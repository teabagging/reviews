Chesbro goes off on some tirade to validate his political views and spends much of the book having fun yanking the right wing's chain. Inadvertently, in his book they are right actually---the KGB really has infiltrated the country. Whether you're right or left, this mindless claptrap gets in the way of the story, and is a bizarre diversion that often makes no sense. As the series progresses, the Mongo-isms are reduced. The quirky books with a dwarf detective dabbling in the supernatural become standardized and they become routine. This is the series' nadir, though, lacking in charm, filled with irrelevant tirades. I'm working my way through the newer ones now--hope this isn't a sign of what is to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words","review":"Normally, when I pick up a \\"Mongo\\" book, I have already entered a state of quite willing disbelief. Generally, I've saved one as a special treat for myself, but Mr. Chesbro definitely needs to write faster, as I am catching up with him!This time, however, the suspension didn't need to travel quite so far. This time, the book gave me cold chills.Don't get me wrong. Mr. Chesbro is ALWAYS fascinating, and I love the characters in the Mongo series... but this particular book I just finished, and it was close enough to reality [or maybe it IS reality] that it is actually scarry! Not that I think his perceptions are wrong - it's just that I'm terribly afraid that they are correct.

Very friendly with my KVM (IOGear) I can switch between multiple PC's and not have any drops.. switching is seemless. Would highly recommend users also install the third-party UberOptions SetPoint enhancements (http://www.mstar.net/users/rlowens). This lets you program just about any key on the mouse/keyboard and have it apply globally or per application. So in iTunes I can use the mouse alone to skip forward/back, change volume etc. In Word I can use the same mouse keys to do Cut/Paste instead. Very customizable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech 3200","review":"This is a great combo! Amazon still has it @ the best price anywhere! I've had this combo for over a month without one glitch!

If I had noted this earlier I would have purchased something else or at least held off until this issue was resolved.I tried to resolve the issue with Logitech Customer Support for almost three weeks with no luck. The other reviewer (Scott Solanik) experienced the same result after working with them for over three weeks.

However, I find the wireless mouse to be eratic and jumpy. I've cleaned the lens, tried different mouse pads, repositioned the USB dongle and waited through compute-intensive processes on my computer to no avail. My pet peeve with the keyboard is the zoom control along the right edge. It is hyper-sensitive. If so much as a single sheet of paper touches the edge of the keyboard, it wildly and unexpectedly zooms the content on screen. To make matters worse, the 100% button on my keyboard (which should restore the screen to normal magnification) doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keys stick after 1 year","review":"After one year of solid office use on this keyboard, the keys stick.

Also, the keyboard will only lay flat on your desk, with extremely limited options for angling it upward for comfort. Logitech customer support is nonexistent. I gave up on their help line after 37 minutes.

The zoom-function on the left side drives me crazy as it is _extremly_ sensitive, so that every likkle 'almost-touch' activates it. You also have to get used to the strange order of the 'Home-Key-Section'.This makes it unusable at all. After exactly one year of use all the Function keys (F1-F12) suddenly stopped working.The mouse was actually pretty good. Very handy and precise. But after a few months the rubber pads startet to get loose, wich made it more and more unusable. After 9 months it suddenly stopped working, I don't know why.Battary changing was as hard as f*** for both.All in all an epic fail in my opinion.

Logitech has lost one valuable customer cause I am disgusted with their poor customer support.Their online forum is also a joke. Maby cause China producing cheaper more inferior parts now who knows but Logitech should be ashamed. I live in the Caribbean so I have no warranty and cannot send it back to Amazon so when we down here buy something it must be very good.

After several hours of trying to correct using L software (which did not work for other key/mouse functions either) I finally gave up and had to do a full system restore to remove L software and reinstall the old hp keyboard/mouse! Then I just hooked up L key/mouse as I did at first and did not install L software. So now I have a partially useful key/mouse.

I actually chose this set over the MX Revolution because of the mouse - it looks more normal and more similar to MX 700.I find that the keyboard LCD lights up very well if you have the keyboard at the right height (aka on a keyboard tray), but not well at all if you have it too high up. Found this out by changing desks. I like the volume/media controls up top, not as big as I'd like the buttons to be, but I'll take what I can get.

The keyboard took a little getting used to because the keys seem a little higher on the board than my old one but that's because it is a smaller keyboard. I use it sitting on my lap and have gotten used to the size and actually prefer it to the old, larger one. The functions are useful and, at least to me, easy to use. The mouse is not too big and fits the hand comfortably. I changed some of the functions that were programmed in and now it works the way I want it to. So far the batteries show up as \\"good\\" and I've used them pretty extensively. I would recommend this to my friends and would purchase it again for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good !","review":"The keyboard and mouse works just fine. the mouse is well designed and is comfortable. the keyboard has soft keys and also firm.nice product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wore out quickly; very bad for PowerPoint users","review":"The keyboard wore out too quickly. I don't even type on it that much, but after a year of light use, the keys have almost become impossible to press down. This severely aggravates my typing tendonitis.One unfortunate design decision was to leave off the context menu key which I rely on heavily for efficient work in PowerPoint. There is a two key substitute (Fn+PrintScreen), but this workaround is highly inefficient as it's hard to hit those two keys reliably when touch typing.Also, the \\"zoom\\" slider on the left is troublesome. I often accidentally brush against it find myself staring at 80 pt font on the screen.Small plus - a dedicated calculator key! So handy to keep me from starting Excel or hunting through windows menus to find the calc program.Also, minor but annoying: CDMA phones will interfere with the wireless link on occasion.The mouse is OK, but I would not buy this set again or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech MX3200 is a must-have keyboard and mouse","review":"I've tried quite a few wireless keyboards over the years and I'm always disappointed by how finicky they are. This keyboard and mouse are truly the answer if you suffer from corpal tunnel syndrome or just need a keyboard and mouse that maintain a good signal to the computer from more than 6\\" away.

It looked sleek, felt nice, and was very convenient since there are no wires. However, after around 4 months of usage, the keyboard completely DIED on me. Not a single key would work even after changing the batteries, reconnecting the usb receiver, and reinstalling all of the drivers. DO NOT GET THIS KEYBOARD/MOUSE, the keyboard will stop functioning and the mouse does not even feel that great, my old logitech MX518 mouse is way better.

This guy is nuts, seriously, and I'm not some religious fanatic, I'm not religious at all, in fact...I'm just a reasonal normal intelligent person and I hope that nobody will fall into the cult like group that Tulbure is trying to create. So...avoid this book and don't waste the money, if you're really curious about it, read Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand (which is at least an entertaining book) and multiply the ideals by 200% throw some telepathy in there and a crazy guy...and you've got the Illuminati Manifesto."},{"rating":"1","title":"rude nonsense as enlightened thinking?","review":"This book points to a problem online book dealers need to address: how many beautiful reviews can an author put up about his own work?

It's not the same as if you did wear them. The Manifesto is like a pair of glasses to view the government and religion. Whether you are an objectivist or not, it will strengthen opinions you have, as well as make you question others. It talks about a whole spectrum of ideas, from Christianity, to Islam, to welfare, and then gives you how the Illuminati propose life should be lived. A very good read, just remember that Mr. Tulbure's mother tongue is not English. He handles the language better than some Americans I know, but there are a few instances where the editor could have done a better job on fixing minor grammatical errors. This book isn't an english lesson though, its a manifest, just like Karl Marx's (although completely different in content)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prophetic","review":"This book is mysterious to me. What I did find interesting is the new and original philosophical overtures and the almost prophetic nature of the way things are turning out in the world and I suspect in 200-300 years this author will be revered for the visionary he is. I don't know if this book is the work of an Illuminati or the views of the Illuminati Order but I still found it a good read. I have had the opportunity to be exposed to ideas I never thought of and a philosophy I never knew existed. It was well worth the money. If the author reads this, please rework the book to fix some spelling and grammar errors. otherwise don't change a thing. It is good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammarians and other thinkers beware","review":"For some unknown reason, this book was not turned over to a competent copyeditor prior to publication. The lack of copyediting shows from the very first page, and continues. Forget about the illusion of objectivism, which one either buys into or recognizes as the sham that it is. Forget about the militant atheism, again which one either buys into or recognizes as the sham that it is. The fact remains that this book is one of the most poorly written and poorly edited works that I have ever seen outside of a college remedial English class attempts to write a coherent paragraph. Surely, the Illuminati, if such exist, could have found a better spokesperson than Solomon Tulbure. One can excuse Mr. Tulbure's inability to handle English, an adopted language for him. One can not excuse the publisher's failure to provide his with a copyeditor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"I've always been interested in Rand and her objectivism. So I bought this.

If that doesn't seem to boost your book sales, try finding a qualified author who can tell the difference between their rear-end and a hole in the ground. This book is full of propaganda and misleading information. This author is extremely opinionated and has plenty of off the wall conspiracy theories that make no sense.

So this review is unbiased in that regard.Tulbure writes like a bitter 17 year old who failed high school English. Just awful! And yet, he considers himself a genuis and if you don't agree he'll tell you your just too stupid to know.He bashes religion but conveniently leaves out the mass of evidence that much of religion was influenced, if not outright controlled, by the Illuminati as they use it to control, manipulate, and play one side against the other (just like today in the mideast). You'll have to read other books for this info because its not in here (David Icke for example).This book is a waste of time. And the positive reviews posted here?

The author is obviously just attempting to cash in on the the public's curiousity about the Illuminati.This book is written at approximately an 8th grade level, and has about one mispelling or grammatical error on every page. It's barely even entertaining, since the author's writing is of such poor quality, that he fails to maintain the illusion enough to be plausible.After all, if the Illuminati really are the most intelligent of all human kind and capable of ruling the world from the shadows, they'd certainly know what a run-on sentence is, the proper use of commas, how to click on the spell-check button in Word, or be capable of arguing a point without appearing juvenile or resorting to profanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane.

You have a philosophy that offers challenging creeds but in the hands of a 'spokesman' like this, you lose interest in the concept itself.The writer ironically does what many adherents of Christianity do - by putting forth his beliefs so badly, he undermines what he wants to promote. I read half of this before I chucked it, which is a lot. It seems to have been written by a kid no one likes, one who never got over it. The grammar is a joke and the tone is hysterical.

For many of us, it is his voice we associate with listening to ballgames on summer evenings. Well, Mr. Harwell was also a writer. During the 1990s he wrote a short column for the Free Press over the years. The columns are only a few hundred words each, but they are keen observations of the team and the sport. While the columns come from the 90s, he makes observations and tells stories from many decades. They are quite interesting, well written, and easy to read. They sound like the kind of thing he would say through the mike if he had a few minutes to fill with his thoughts.Some of these columns have been used elsewhere, but this is still a volume worth having if you are a Harwell fan and fan of the Tigers. The longer you have followed the Tigers the more his stories will mean as they bring back memories of players and games.

I was a little surprised to find how sloppy and broad-stroked Shelley's historical development of Christian history was, especially during the first five centuries: the development of papal doctrine, for instance, occurs much earlier than Shelley concedes in his book. Once the doctrine does develop, Shelley seems obliged to offer unsatisfying counterarguments to the reader - as if the reader were somehow unsettled by a historical development, and needed reassurance. This overall polemical attitude toward Roman Catholicism makes the book read much more like an editorial against it than a history of how it developed among other Christian churches. I would recommend trying a different book that aims to do more straight-forward history, and not historical promotion of one ideology over another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"Surprised by all the good ratings, this book was hard for me to read.

Shelley does a remarkable job of explaining Christianity from it's humble beginning to it's present state in a clear concise manner that isn't bogged down in details. The history is told in story form and you can almost watch it unfold. It can ocasionally get confusing because the book doesn't always correspond to a timeline. Rather, it concentrates more on the individual stories and in doing so makes the book much more enjoyable. I enjoyed the way Shelley introduced different ages in church history and presented problems that the church has faced throughout time as well as some issues that we are still coming to grips with today. The personal stories are vivid and captivating and it really does help to explain a lot of rituals and reasons behind a lot of the whys most Christians have today about the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent starting place in Church History","review":"I read this as an intro to Church History, rather reluctantly.

I've been able to set limits better, with excellent results, where in the past I would feel stuck and disadvantaged. This is in addition to making my communication with friends and family smoother. Sharon Ellison's ideas just make good sense when you think about it. But it's unusual in this culture to see very good examples of how to communicate well. It's as if arguing and fighting are the only ways we know, or giving up and shutting up, or maybe just pretending to agree, then zapping the other person the first chance we get. I'm thrilled to find and understand another way, where I can be true to myself and stand in my integrity, without getting into a tug of war, or disappearing.

Yes each novel stands on its own as a great literature accomplishment, but so does each movement of any symphony by Beethoven or Mahler. Now, I am not a write or a literature critic in any shape or form, but I have read the complete \\"Sea of Fertility\\" twice before, and am onto \\"Runaway Horses\\" for the third time now.

Literally, the MOST intense pain that I have ever experienced. As irrational as it may sound, I'd trade for a broken arm at times when the pain was beyond excruciating.The gel itself definitely does a good job (actually, a great job) whitening your teeth - no question. However, it comes at a high price - pain, pain, and more pain. Initially, I was under the impression that the pain would go away. When I woke up, the pain was even more agonizing. No, wait... I didn't have to wake up! I never fell asleep.I have semi-sensitive teeth - really nothing out of the ordinary. I would not recommend this product, UNLESS you plan on taking some sort of a pain killer prior to its use. That, or some morphine - I am NOT kidding.

Just be sure to avoid Soda or Coffee since that will stain your teeth. I will not lie, if you have very sensitive teeth, this may not be worth it to you since it hurts A LOT. But if you're willing to go through some pain for white teeth, more power to you. Ocassionaly, I felt pain in my nerve as if someone is poking a large needle to my gums.

It's not among the worst of its ilk, but Gardner does himself no favors with some of the cheeky side references to Bond's favorite actor (Sean Connery, naturally) and the marathon \\"honeymoon\\".Given the nature of Scorpius, a megalomaniacal cult leader commanding a legion of former drug addict suicide bombers, and his strange quirks, I would have to wonder whether or not this was originally conceived as a Conan novel that Gardner shoe-horned into the Bond mythos.The whole thing just feels rather shallow and weak, especially when one expects a thrill a chapter in a rollicking adventure. It wasn't the worst novel I've read in a while, but it's nothing particularly memorable neither.

The edition I read from the library included a glossary of terms in the back for convenient reference.

This, however, did not resemble that meaning at all. Beginning with a \\"jobber\\" contest consisting of Tito Santana and \\"professional loser\\" Playboy Buddy Rose in an Executioner outfit and ending with a lackluster Tag Team contest as a Main Event, it is near guaranteed that you will feel unsatisfied once the video is over. There is not one great match-up in the video, as it is filled with disgustingly boring matches such as Big John Studd vs. Andre the Giant and the 30 second snoozefest pitting King Kong Bundy and \\"Special Delivery\\" Jones. On the positive side, this event boosted the WWF into what we know it as today: Sports Entertainment.

His new book on Coney Island was not at all what I expected. It's more like a book report than a book, consisting of bits of information taken from previous Coney books spliced together with trivia from web sites. There appears to be no primary source material or original research. Immerso repeats the traditional Coney Island stories, weaving them into a dry narrative that will be interesting only to someone who is not familiar with Coney Island.

Jung and Einstein have spoken about manifestation and connecting to the \\"whole\\" and this is an informative book on how to apply these traits to your life.I am grateful that Mr. Berg has taken the time to write a thoughtful book on how to live a more fulfilling life. To those who are so quick to say that he is only out to make a buck or is an \\"evangelist\\" i say at least he is trying to make this world better and not being judgemental or critical of others.

Whether Salvador committed the crime he is accused of isn't the point of this book at all, in fact Jacoby takes no position on this matter. Instead, he just tells us--and allows Sal's own words to tell us--the whole story of his tragedies and triumphs. If there's a moral to Sal's story, it is this: let's treat our children beter and prevent the horrors that sent Sal to prison.

This is true westcoast hip hop in its entirety. 2 disc of real hip hop from a hip hop legend. When Pac dropped this album, people were running to the stores to get it from all over the world. Too many great songs on this album to choose favorites. I say the whole entire album is my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT the first hiphop double cd... but probably the best.","review":"In 1993, international hiphop outfit IAM dropped the first hiphop double CD. a largely ignored fact...still, Pac DID have the first double LP from a solo artist and along with Biggie's attempt months later, stands as the only good solo Double album in hiphop history.Pac's rhymes are emotional and varied and have the strength to carry the album and the production, while occasionally weakened by flimsy keyboards is competent enough. Unfortunately, being from his death row period, this album is almost devoid of NY influence which would have given it more variety (check the battle rap with Meth, Kurupt and Redman)In conclusion: if you hate Pac, this album won't change your opinon and if you love him you'll cherish it. It certainly is'nt the greatest hiphop album of all time, but it's certainly in the top 5 for it's year. Wu-tang Forever and Life after Death are it's only competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 awesome","review":"5 star is not enough for this album. The first rap 2 disc cd.

Just about every song on here is listenable, and many are classic. The album ranges from contemplative life and death ballads (\\"Life Goes On\\"), hard core gangsta rap (\\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah,\\" \\"Shorty Wanna Be a Thug\\"), fun lowrider music (\\"Thug Passion\\" with DJ Quik's Talk Box), to the sex anthems (\\"Ratha Be Ya N---a\\")all rapped over smooth to hard G-Funk beats sampling Roger and George Clinton Jr. The beats that are sampled are well done. One standout track is \\"Ain't Hard 2 Find\\" because the beat is strong, nice smooth G-Funk, and it hosts a variety of Bay Area rappers (Oakland's Richie Rich, Vallejo's D-Shot, E-40, and B-Legit, and Sacramento's C-Bo).

This album has a lot of feelings and emotions that 2pac witnessed. Not only is it TRU but it is also encouraging. No More Pain has the best beats and lyrics within the album. Personally it's my favorite track. I love all the tracks from disk 1-disk 2 because they are all interesting and keep you thinking. Biggie's album Life After Death is great but it could never touch All Eyes On Me because it's not real. Tupac rapped about things we can relate to, while Biggie talked about mainly money and women, which gets boring after a while. No matter how old this album is I will always listen to it because it can't get boring.

Pac's lyrical skill and raw talent remain constant throughout, whilst the album itself takes us through a whole series of moods and atmospheres, all revolving around this untamed artist and his world. A host of rap heavyweights feature (Redman, Method Man, Snoop), adding dynamism to an already potent piece of hip-hop artistry. There are tracks to suit all tastes; with west coast as well as east coast flavours, hard as well as upbeat tunes, in Pac's own inimitable style. Each track is the memorable legacy of an irreplacable rapper, and girls and guys alike will find themselves drawn to this artist who, despite his critics and enemies, blasted the world with his voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"they should have a special section","review":"this album was just blazing. i had never been in to rap until i heard this. i bought it 4 a friend and he already had received it. sooo i kept it for myself and havenst stopped listening to it since that day in feb 96. they should have an extra star available just for this album. songs like 'heaven aint hard 2 find' and 'ambitionz az a ridah' could never be emulated again. this album is and always will be the greatest music album of all time RIP PAC we all luv ya"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the Best","review":"When I think of Tupac Shakur I immediatly think if the deepest black man alive.

Tupac forced the THUG in him by joining gangs so that society can recognise him as a thug and not the young geek who went to art school and studied literature and Ballet. When he moved to California everything changed from his attitude to the tatooes on his body so that society can then portray him as Tupac the\\"gangster\\".The only real thing about Tupac's songs where the ones about women because most of them were positive.

He was a violent gangster constantly headed down the wrong path, and should not be worshipped in the way that he is. \\"But, he loved his mama\\", I hear you say. Shouldn't we all?

Instead, 2pac goes right back to the sh-t, focusing too much on, and overdramatizing the thug-life. This drawn-out, sprawling, if not tedious double album tends to be annoying at times. However, stand-out tracks like \\"How Do You Want It\\", \\"Bring the Pain\\", California Love\\", I aint Mad at Cha\\" \\"Wonda Why they Call You B--tch\\" and a few others takes on all the needless and uncalled for tracks, not making it a complete throw-away.

I'm out, dawg!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Half Great and half mundane","review":"Basically it's an album of contrasts. On the first disc Tupac displays his talent brilliantly and flawlessly. The beats are infectious and the science he drops is noteworthy.However the second disc is, on the whole, quite sub par and typical of so much of the rap being put out by the 90's era of rappers. Musically boring and lyrically/creatively run of the mill.Personally I felt that Tupac was on the road to megastardom both as a rapper and as an actor. Both fields in which he had tremendous talent and perhaps even more potential.Nonetheless, this album is definitely well worth a purchase just don't expect very much from Disc 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"tupac first album after leaving jail for death row records","review":"It was sad that tupac was incarcerated in jail and that he was abused also but in this album he showed everybody that it was not going to get to him and he took out his frustration on other artist including the record label Bad Boy. I listen to this album and I now understand why pac was so upset at his music mates. To sum it all all eyes on me was a dramitic album about the time that pac was going thru and what happens when you turn on a whole coast. It's sad what happened in jail to pac,but pac knew that he was gonna keep his head up and roll over his past and continue making music to make money for his label"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!","review":"I purchased All Eyez On Me from Amazon.

After being released from jail, he starts writing and recording a double cd which would be the first for hip-hop. But it was unknown that it would have this big of an effect on the hip-hop culture, or his career at that. Starting his \\"reincarnation celebration\\" Book 1 opens up giving you the \\"Ambitionz az a Ridah\\". From then everything is eventually a plus. Some of his greatest hits were on this disc that did'nt make the greatest hits disc. And it is still selling.All eyes on me has probably sold 10,000,000 to date. If you haven't heard this immaculate piece of history yet, BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this","review":"2pac in general puts poetry to beats, albeit with a large amount of profanity. Regardless, this CD truly is awesome. Seriously. The songs on here like \\"we aint hard to find\\" are lame because I hate to hear 2pac rap about killing instead of loving. On the flip side, how many other rappers dedicate songs to other men (life goes on) and make it sound beautiful, while keeping a \\"ghetto edge?\\" None. \\"When you see me you better holla at me\\", even if you \\"Can't C Me.\\" 2pac r.i.p."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tupac is the dopest","review":"\\"All Eyes on Me\\" is a perfectexample of why Tupac is largely known as the best rapper of all time. Besides the \\"Old School\\" scene. Although he contributed to it in many ways. \\"All Eyes on Me\\" is a 2 disc album packed with dope beates and untouchable real lyrics. He spits game at the ladies in some songs and in the blink of an eye, the next song is describing the harsh reality of street life.I would recomend this album to a person who is deep and comprehends deep lyrics and can get lost in amazing beats and music.

If you want a party album,do not get this.Everyone already probably knew that,though. The second cd is better than the first one. Best song on the first cd : \\"Only God Can Judge Me.\\" Best song on the second cd : \\"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug.\\" Lets see,all in all, a whole lot of good songs, but not nearly enough to make it \\"the best rap album ever\\" as some of the reviews say.Even though its not the best rap album ever,it is still worthy of the money that it costs.

Filled with anger, pain, sadness and relief, this two disc cd is pure gold to its listener. 2pac was not just another gangster rapper, his music still lives on years after his passing for a reason. Shakur was the 90's modern philospher/revolutionist. Nobody spoke pain and struggle better then this man, and it breathes through his music. Whether you live in the suburbs or on the streets there's at least one song that will speak to you. But Tupac was also a hypocritical and confused man and it reflects in his variety of topics. I wont speak on the track listing because almost every song on this album is solid. Don't take my word for it however, buy any Tupac release or read \\"The rose that grew from concrete\\" and enter the mind of a soldier.

Ever since then I have obtained all his records and in the process of getting his movies. I feel, and anybody who has listened to all of 2pac's music should agree that All Eyez On Me is Tupac's best album. Some poeple say that he has a bad influence on we the youth but the truth is most people that listen to his music learn about how hard life can be if we don't make the right choices. But back to the album, he shows his lyrical talent on tracks like 'AMBITIONZ AZ A RIDAH' , 'ONLY GOD CAN JUDGE ME', shows a softer side with the love laced 'RATHER BE YA N.I.G.G.A.', also includes haging out songs like ''CHECK OUT TIME' , and makes a wonderful collabo with Method Man and Redman on 'GOT MY MIND MADE UP'.

This \\"Florida\\" installment is particularly good. The book is broken down into sections like \\"History\\", \\"Culture\\", \\"Economy\\" etc., and each section is thoughtfully written and edited. The \\"Culture\\" section is especially good and is very inclusive.This book, as well as the entire \\"Portrait of America\\" series, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool to all primary school educators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unbelievable","review":"Poyer used every bit of imagination about the characters in this book. Nothing even slightly realistic occurs. It is also set some 15 years back and Poyer wants everyone to think it is in the present.

It just keeps going on.One of the worst books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot is a bit shaky","review":"Aside from being a boring read, the plot is also a bit hard to believe. The central character is working on a secret weapons project, but is allowed to hang-out with a group that has destroyed Naval property and is fighting the military, while at the same time he expresses his own doubts about Naval weapons programs.....would not fly in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illuminating, yet with glaring incongruities","review":"The insights into weapon system development are fascinating. Yet a sub-plot and it's deriviatives require such a degree of naivety on the part of the protagonist and some of his associates made it difficult to suspend disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKip This One","review":"I always enjoy this genre of novel and have read Mr. Poyer's other books in this series. But I just found Tomahawk to be a real bore. I think LCDR Lenson needs to get back on a ship -- the \\"wars\\" in Washington D.C. are just a bit too contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Poyer turns left!","review":"\\"Tomahawk\\" was a major disappointment to this fan of the Dan Lenson series. \\"The Circle,\\" \\"The Med,\\" \\"The Passage,\\" and \\"The Gulf\\" were outstanding and authentic, written with great skill by one who had \\"been there, done that.\\" But it seems that Poyer underwent some sort of social/political rebirth just before writing \\"Tomahawk,\\" for the book is filled with a boring mish-mash of alcoholism, girlfriend woes, and Lenson's highly unlikely involvement with a radical pack of peaceniks out to sabotage the development of the cruise missile. Too bad, for this could have been a fine tale if it had been crafted in the style of the previous four books in the Lenson series. If you subscribe to turn-the-other-cheek pacifist theories, you might like this novel. Otherwise, save you money and your disappointment--this is NOT the Dan Lenson you knew and loved in the previous stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you believe this, I'll sell you the Brooklyn Bridge","review":"One of the worst books that I have read.Nothing in the story seems real. The story about the missile is over 15 years old, but Poyer wants the reader to believe that it is set in the present time. The main character, Dan Lenson, is truly a work of fiction. Lenson is an alcoholic, developing a missile, falling in love with an anti-military freak and befriending her colleagues, saving the world from spies, etc.... Poyer's imagination is very vivid to have anybody believe that all of this could happen to one man.STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK. SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"The main character is getting better","review":"Lt. Commander Dan Lenson is balancing on a critical decision point of his life. His first Shore Duty assignment may be his last position in the Navy. Dan is trying to decide if he needs to get out of the service and commence a new career that would be more satisfying than the disappointments he has impacted against during the first half of his current Naval career. The failure of his marriage, and the ongoing failure of his sporadic parenting attempts with his daughter. His checkered career performance records, which would seem to indicate, that he will be unable to advance much further in rank if he continues his career path. And a nagging idea that maybe the military solution toward peace is not the right choice for the world.Much better than 'The Passage'. Lensons' character is now starting to stabilize into a more satisfying representative of a mature military officer . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into the world of procurement","review":"I have read most of the Dan Lenson series and found this one a bit different and quite enjoyable. The story line centers around the Government procurement of the Tomahawk missile and gives the reader a peek at the difficulties of the process. For those that might be interested, that insight is spot on. Dan has to deal with the frustrations of dealing with technical issues, government politics, convoluted bureaucratic rules, greedy defense contractors, and unrealistic schedules. All part of the real world of weapon acquisition. And, while dealing with all the above, Dan becomes involved with what we used to call \\"Peaceniks\\" and begins to question his role as a contributor to the war machine.Overall, I found the book to be a good read -- better than many of Poyer's other \\"Lenson ashore\\" books that tend to become bogged down in political issues and personal depression at the expense of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I oredered....I received an older edition of this book","review":"I don't hate it.....but I ordered the book pictured and received an older edition with a red cover.

Show structures and characters will seem familiar yet startlingly British and quite disorienting. Ricky Gervais is quite talented and his quirky staff are quite good. After getting used to the peculiar British sensibilities of the program and the much dirtier comedy in evidence, fans can appreciate just how clever this program is. This box set is the complete package and showcases every last bit of the show including the startling revelation that the Documentary format which has become comedy gold was basically just Gervais' and Merchant's way to save money while shooting their pilot. Accidental genius. Any serious fan of the American Office should definitely get this even if they do not appreciate it as much as the American version.

The humor is \\"in your face\\", crude, painful to watch and clearly beyond my generation. British humor appears to have changed.A bit of a disappointment....Update 2/9/08:I just finished \\"the specials\\" episode and found those two episodes very enjoyable.

And I love the American version of \\"The Office\\". So, I expected to love this show even more. It starts out with funny bits, but soon becomes painful to watch. The characters, especially Ricky Gervais' David, are fairly unlikeable. By the end there is no one to root for, only a feeling of voyerism... like watching someone in a very uncomfortable and embarrassing personal situation. You feel sorry for them and almost hopeless.

I lent it out to friends who loved it too. This series hurts to watch I agree with that. You feel for the characters and especially David Brent. I just want to take and hug him. If you need joke after joke and laugh tracks then you don't have a sense of humor at all and you don't know real talent. The writing and acting are great. If you choose to view television at all, it should be a smart series such as this. I'm sad that its over but it was great that it ended the way it did. The special was great as well.

Well in my opinion its hard to understand, I imagine if you were english it would be just as funny, but the dialogue is hard to understand on some levels as there is a lot of slang and even with the volume up it seems to be mumbly. That being said there were quite a few funny scenes, and is much more racey than the american version which is enjoyable and humourous to watch, that said I SIMPLY wouldnt buy it and intend to sell mine on ebay, its not worth owning but is worth renting or seeing on netflix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the American version?","review":"I think so.

Best comedic show since Da Ali G show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal...One of the funniest and most original shows I've seen.","review":"I love comedy T.V. shows. Not really \\"sitcom\\" funny but more naturalistic shows like: Arrested Development, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Flight of the Conchords, etc. This show surpasses it's U.S. counterpart by a milestone. Ricky Gervais is hilarious in his character of David Brent. The cast is fantastic and the story is impeccable. However, nothing compares to the dramatic special that concludes the story. If you have a funny bone in your body, I suggest that you give this series a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Office","review":"While Michael and David are vastly different characters, you can't help but love and loathe both. Where Michael is naive, David is insecure. He wants to be loved but is so akward about getting it he makes you cringe everytime he opens his mouth.

It was on BBC cable, a service not generally available throughout the United State. It won a couple of Golden Globe awards, one for being the best sitcom.It is funny. At times very funny as we watch this pseudo documentary invade an English office with its narcisstic, neurotically insecure boss (Ricky Gervais) and employees who range from appealing to appalling .

Once you start, you will end up buying all three anyway, so you might as well save money by buying this set, which in sum costs less than buying individually. The series, the plot, the characters, especially Ricky Gervais, work their way into you consciousness, and you won't let go until you see the full way it plays out, so comic, yet so real and riveting. This is more than just a comedy, it's a world that is created and inhabited by the characters AND by you, the viewer -- they way they draw you in with soliloquies to the camera, and reveal little pieces of themselves. Comic yes, but also drama and character You will be very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find something else","review":"The BBC Office and US Office are like body piercings.

Hydro is too precious to be floundered on this kind of tripe.Getting right to the point, I've never viewed anything as boring and lackluster as this show. All the characters are mundane and require acting lessons, in the worst way. There is absolutely no chemistry or spark that gels these bunch of rookie actors. The script and lines are neither funny nor entertaining.

The Fuji rep also said that they do not sell Fuji H-speed cards in the U.S. for that very reason, and any cards sold in the U.S. are grey market, probably from Japan, and Fuji will not support these cards in the U.S. if they malfunction. Of course, Type H cards will be 2-3x faster once you take the card out of the camera, e.g., if you have a card reader and are downloading to your computer (but you will need to make sure your card reader reads H speed xd cards).

I was so fascinated by the stories that I won a fifth grade reading contest by reading so many Hardy Boys books that I easily outdistanced the competition.

We could never get the timing right for anything we wanted to bake or broil. The menu is supposed to make it easy to program what you want to accomplish with specific types of food (\\"reheat pizza\\" for instance). But what we had to cook never matched the pre-programs on the menu, so we fiddled and fiddled to adjust the settings. This is not easy to do, with no back light in the setting window and unnecessarily complex procedures. We ended up using it mostly for toast, but the toast would always get darker on one side than the other, & it took up a lot of space as a 4-slice toaster! After 15 months the upper elements quit working, which was both a disappointment and a relief...

Not once, but several scenes show a 'predator' removing its cloak and simply standing there and growling all mean like instead of immediately slaughtering whoever it may be. There's a scene where Laurence Fishbourne's character is talking about how they've gotten 'smarter, and changed up their hunting tactics'. These tactics include standing around, un-cloaked, and growling. They've tried to turn it into a horror film. The main actors fake voice reminds me of batman in 'the dark knight'...He 'growl-talks' and it makes me want to kick a hole in my TV.The people who are leaving 'good' reviews are simply trying to justify their unfortunate purchase of this monster pile of crap.

Else, how would you explain Natalie Portman starring in Your Highness or Marissa Tomei doing awful romantic comedies for the rest of the 90s? Or Halle Berry - just Halle Berry - what were they thinking? With Adrien Brody, one thinks that we have a winner as he growls and grunts his way through this tepid \\"action\\" thriller with the exact inflection throughout. I think he's some special ops but I can't really tell as his growling is a little too much like a mutter to really make out his words.Beyond that, this thing is full of people just walking through jungles with the \\"spooky\\" music playing. Sure the Predators come eventually but when they do, you're too bored out of your scowl (and annoyed with the academy for giving Adrien Brody an Oscar) to really care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie sucks","review":"This movie had such a good set up.. and then fell flat on it's face. It just wasn't good. I'm a hardcore fan I've seen all the movies and read many novels based on the alien and predator franchises and I've never heard of this other race of predators. To me, that ruined the movie (among other things). They took the original predator, the icon of badassery from my childhood, and had him b*** slapped around like a ragdoll. They took the most bad ass thing in the universe, and made it into a big p***y. Why would they throw a screwball at us with this random new race of predator? I just don't get it. No need for that, stick with the original. It wasn't broke don't try to fix it.Yet another fond child hood memory.. raped. Indiana, predator, star wars.. all ruined. I wish I could be more specific but I don't really remember much of the movie other than I started hating it 20 minutes in and wanted to walk out of the theater.

It was much better than I expected (I have learned to be a tad skeptical), and this movie was everything I hoped for and more. The characters were fascinating and the struggle was new (new rules, new situation). I would recommend this to any fan of the first Predator movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gory, not scary","review":"The film is obvious at times and subtle at other times. For instance the protagonists do utter some evident truths like in \\"you do what you have to do to remain alive\\" or something to this effect. However, and this is why I give this film a higher than average mark, some of the behavior portrayed in the film do confirm this truthiness (thank you Colbert) incrementally. For example Noland (Lawrence Fishburne) remained alive so long how? By sheer luck? No, of course not, but because he took advantage of his fellow human beings, because in order to survive on this planet you have to kill (even your friends) and, who knows, even to resort to cannibalism. Yes Isabelle speaks the obvious when she says that humans and Predators are alike, but the beauty of the film is that they prove it.The ending kind of contradicts this as Noyce and Isabelle work in unison to defeat the predator, but it makes up for a potential sequel (as if we had any doubt as to that possibility...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now This Is Entertainment!","review":"The Predator film series has finally gotten it right after the deplorable AVP film disasters; this is a back to the basics: suspense, action, horror!

It was more humorous than I expected, with much of the comedic relief provided by Topher Grace and Walton Goggins, and had all the action I could've asked for and more. What I was surprised at was the amount of tension and suspense built up during the first 45 minutes or so. Although those of us familiar with the Predator films knew what we were expecting, Predators did a great job of causing us to fear that revealing as much as we were anticipating it. Very well done all around. I did think the ending came a bit abruptly, but I am anxiously awaiting a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"PREDATORS RETURNS TO ITS ROOTS!","review":"I always liked the original Predator film, but I felt the sequel Predator 2 while an interesting idea, was too heavy on comic overtones and the film suffered severely for it. Predators returns to a more serious tone and almost seems more like a remake than a sequel. Other than some advances in the FX department and the jungle being on another planet it is essentially the same film. The good news is that is is every bit as good as the first film with a solid acting cast and quick paced action! The story is easy to follow and they waste zero time getting to the fun. Adrien Brody is no Arnold, but he makes his role as believable as possible.I could not find much wrong with this film as action films go, but it does seem like we've been here before.

I love predator and predator 2, but this should have never been made. Horrible story with characters you don't care if they live or die. The biggest problem in this movie is that they ruined the actual predators. They aren't cool in this film. I know that sounds silly, but seriously, this movie makes them out to be wanna be tribal hunters or something. They're supposed to be technologically advanced hunters. The movie was just random and had no direction. There are a few twists, which were completely unnecessary. I'm not a judgmental or uptight movie watcher, but I have to admit, this movie was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"miscasting galore!","review":"Adrien Brody as an action hero is like casting Wally Cox as Superman! And that sorry Clint Eastwood impression? This miscasting ruined what could have been a decent action adventure film. Sorry, but that merits a loss of 3 stars alone... Topher Grace played it just creepy enough to pull off a psychotic murderer, but it wasn't much of a surprise, when after all, all the others were supposed to be some major bad-ass merc... so a doctor, very out of place and predictable! So very sad because they could have focused on the new kind of predator that Fishburn's character spoke of... by the way, when he showed up one hour into the film, I said to myself, finally an actor that makes me believe he's a bad-ass... the rest just made me feel I was watching a bunch of pre-adolescents pretending in the back yard!!!

Director Nimrod Antal and producer Robert Rodriguez essentially recycle every halfway decent idea from the original film with less than satisfactory results. The film tells the story of several mercenaries and killers dropped onto a an alien planet game preserve as they are hunted down by the title creatures. Plenty of people die, the visual effects are lacking, and the whole thing seems like a waste of time. Kudos must be given to Adrien Brody, however, for effectively conveying an action hero without the usually requisite tough guy build. Still, he's no Arnie or Carl Weathers. Through the film's runtime, I continuously found myself wishing I could just watch the original. 2 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I loved both Predator and Predator 2, but Predators was a simply awful attempt at rebooting the franchise. Robert Rodriguez is one of those directors whose movies tend to draw extreme reactions, one way or the other, from audiences, and mine was extremely negative. Reading all the four star and five star reviews here makes me think I saw another movie because it simply can't be possible that we watched the same tripe, predictable farce of a movie. I thought this was the worst movie I saw in 2010. The acting was uninspired. Adrien Brody may have put on pounds of muscles for the movie, but he could not convey the tough guy machismo and credibility that his role required. Laurence Fishburne's cameo was ho hum and an utter waste of time. For an action movie, the action was surprisingly lukewarm.Save yourself time and money, and stay away far, far away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Another great opportunity at \\"finally\\" making a decent sequel to the original Predator gone to waste...

I liked that the new Predators shared traits with human hunters, such as bear traps, mechanical hunting falcons, and a pack of alien hunting dogs.

I tried to enjoy this film but it was so tacky and cliche ridden I thought why the heck did they even bother.What should have been an all out assault on our senses is just a let down making this the perfect example of just how much hollywood is short changing fans.Let's hope this is the last Predator sequel, as it looks like leftovers from Outlander and Avatar.Worth a watch if you must but it's no worthy addition, Predator 2 is still the best of the Predator sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I didn't like Predators at all, I honestly think it's kinda dumb.

AVP 1 and Predators, the Predators look like a bunch of overweight ex-wrestlers.Doesn't live up to those old suits, sorry. Also, where are the Predators in this movie? They're barely in this movie! I could care less about a bunch of multi-cultural merceranies on their way to try and create the first film.This movie may have been in the respect that it got people back into Predators the franchise, but just weak.

It successfully captures the essence of the first movie while slightly expanding the mythology, and even references the Schwarzenegger movie to make a proper homage to the action classic. While it doesn't have the mega-star power or the quotable catch phrases of Predator, the cast put forth an above par effort for what you'd expect from an action film.

My only gripe is my own sensitivity to the loudness of the orchestra, except the part where the multi-planetary horizon is observed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Predator 2 should have been!","review":"Predators takes the franchise back to its roots in style. This movie is what \\"Predator 2\\" should have been. If you enjoyed the first film and lost faith in the franchise after those terrible AVP films. Give \\"Predators\\" a try. This film is a good solid sequel in the spirit of the original yet it takes us into some new territory at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friggin awesome! Love ya Robert!","review":"Robert Rodriguez, you are the man! This is my favorite movie. Hell with all AvP's! Alien movies were the best and the first predator was amazing. Now this movie! Predators got upgraded, finally more than just one race, more alien creatures, even predators themselves are different. I absolutely love it. All starting from the story, the atmosphere, the alien planet, ending characters cast! I wanna more from you, man! This movie must be seen! Please continue your fabulous work with your movies! I want to see more movies like this one! And I want more aliens and predators. Plus you just created new species! ; ) This is one hell of an awesome movie. I'm in absolute love with it!

Not even Nightmare on Elstreet or Aliens"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as fun as the first Predator","review":"While the tough guys just don't stack up to the caliber of tough guys in the original Predator movie, most of the characters are interesting and fun to watch.

The storyline of course was understood early on, however, I enjoyed the challenging primal adventure the movie offered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Bad","review":"I really liked the original Predator and thought after seeing the preview that this version would at least be interesting.Its not very and the acting was poor. Brody looked great but his tough guy drawl just didn't work. This homage to the original just failed on too many levels to be entertaining. A rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"First I would like to say the picture quality of this blu ray is amazing. The reason why I gave it one star is because when I poped the disc into my PS3 I had to sit and stare at a black screen for about 10 minutes. This is insane!!!! Why the hell is this disc taking so long to load? I have never had this problem with any other blu ray disc, EVER!!!! I googled and found others were having the same problem. I loaded all the extra content like one viewer said to do but I still have the same problem. I am thinking about returning this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of \\"Predator\\" series","review":"Be a fan of \\"campy\\", violence without meaning = Robert Rodriguez = violence for the sake of meaningless violence = virtually no viable plot. \\"Robert Rodriguez\\" name attached to a film is a WARNING. I will know next time, before I spend my money. I assume Robert Rodriguez takes pleasure in mis-casting film characters.Quality of the DVD video: Absolutely superb.

Aliens: GreatAfter that it all went to crap. A whole mess of books and comics came out for both franchises, even a series of books combining the two. Aliens vs. Predator was AWESOME - in books. When it came to Alien3 and AVP the movie... it seemed like the writers of the movies had all this great source material that the fans loved, but decided to ignore all of it for the sake of originality.Good job.The sequels were all original, and horrible. Because all of the good stuff was already in the books, so by ignoring it all you had only one direction to go, make a bunch of crappy movies.

I enjoyed the first 2 Predator films but each and every single Predator has been a let down since - this one being the worst of the bunch. Don't bother with it, at all, on any level. If someone bought this movie for you then that person hates you to a high degree.The picture quality on Blu-Ray is also mediocre.In order to enjoy this film you need to have a level of fandom that involves you wearing Predator pj's to bed and have fantasies of mandibles sprouting from your face.Pass on this, go to your local comic shop, and take a look at some of the older Dark Horse Predator comics and see how a story is actually done well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me want to skin myself","review":"Horrible movie. Worst casting ever in the history of ever. No matter how much Hollywood wants me to believe that Adrian Brody is a leading man / action star, I just cannot willfully suspend my disbelief. He is to action star as Arnold was to comedic actor. All around bad acting with weak plot and despite the couple of recognizable faces (L. Fishburne, D. Trejo), this movie is an affront to good entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sequel that rivals the original","review":"This one is a \\"back-to-the-basics\\" kinds of movie and does a pretty good job of re-inventing the original Predator concept with Arnold Schwarzenegger. I would say its almost as good as the original. There is plenty of action, plenty of weapons and does not require a lot of mental energy to watch. This is the kind of movie to watch on a day off from work and just relax. Adrien Brody does a respectable job of playing Royce as the lead character and there's also a samurai sword based fight scene. What more can you ask from a movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than expected, and the first really good sequel in the Predator Series","review":"First things first - let's face it, the sequels to the original (and riveting) Predator with AH-nold have been massively disappointing, and made the 'predator franchise' concept something of an artistic bad joke. Not anymore - this one might the very best of the group, even compared with the original. OK, some of the violence is a bit gruesome at times, but overall, they did a good job of making things exciting without making you feel like you wanted to puke and run out of the theater. Fantastic acting and ending. Even people who are not sci-fi fans might enjoy this one. Blu-ray is the only way to watch however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predator or Prey","review":"I'll try not to mention any spoilers. Let just say that this movie is to the other predator movies, as....Cousin Vinny is to serious drama.

This really needs to be flushed for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big step back...","review":"This film took one bug step backwards.

I was very disappointed. The reading level of this book is just a cut above Nancy Drew. The characters are predictable, and I had it solved before I was halfway through (and I don't even try to solve mysteries -- it was just that obvious). I really enjoy female mystery writers such as Sue Grafton, Patricia Cornwell, Sara Paretsky, and so on. This book is not at all in that league."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I bought this book for myself AND for my brother. We're both New Yorkers, and we both love art.

My one complaint is: where is \\"The Minstrel Boy?\\" Recall the scene in the film when Hancock and his staff come upon the Irish Brigade about to receive the blessing of their chaplain, Fr. William Corby. \\"The Minstrel Boy\\" is the march being played by the Brigade's fifers.It's one of the movie's many stirring scenes, and I can't for the life of me figure out why the producers of these two otherwise fine CD's could not find room for this ancient Irish march on either one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings you right into the battle.","review":"The music is excellent.

There was plenty of room on the CD for it and it was one song I was especially looking forward to. Also, the stero separation was a bit too severe when the song was played using only two instruments. I use headphones a lot and thus had one instrument in one ear and one in the other. Not the spacial set-up one would prefer. Other than the above gripes, it was a great CD and the tunes really stick with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very rare recording (in France)","review":"An original and very hard-to-find recording of the civil war.

Outside of that it is perfect for listening to on a Sunday morning as you read the newspaper. Soothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the headache","review":"This is a CD that demands to be listened to at high volume on a stereo that goes to 11.

Very much like the Teak Wood Bench that cost over ($). Better made than the Amish Version that also cost more. I did not care for the coloring when received - it is a shade of natural grayish tone. I am using this bench inside and not outside and wanted it to look more finished. So... I applied Tung Oil to it and it brought out the natural tones of the wood. It now looks like a finished piece of Teak wood furniture. Very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is a great CD with great music. Perfect to listen to if you just want to relax. Brings the same emotion that the movie does. If you liked the movie and the book you should add the cd to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Edelman is the best!","review":"This is one of the most inspiring and emotional soundtracks I have ever heard! I believe that Randy Edelman does more to catch the true emotions of a scene than most other soundrack composers do. Perhaps this is why his pieces are used so often in film trailers; listen to \\"Fire in a Brooklyn Theatre\\" from the soundtrack \\"Come See The Paradise\\" if you don't believe me. This soundtrack stands on its own but I would recommend watching the movie to get the full effect. \\"Battle of Little Round Top\\" is a highlight. If this soundtrack doesn't move you, nothing will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Stunning!","review":"The music places you at the battle scenes where you feel the emotions of the men. It is just beautiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favourite film scores","review":"A smashing achievement by Randy Edelman. The score is ideal for the film, with exceptional, beautiful, and haunting cues. I have both the original and the deluxe edition, and still wish there was more out there for release. This soundtrack is Edelman's crowning composition, and a worthy companion for one of the best war films ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Gods and Generals, Glory better","review":"Gods and Generals, and Glory soundtracks seem better. Gods and Generals seems to have more variety than Glory, so I give it first place. But even Saving Private Ryan is as good as Gettysburg. My review is based on listening to the sample tracks on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 5 stars. A wonderful soundtrack.","review":"\\"Gettysburg\\" was a wonderful movie, and anyone who enjoyed it will doubtless want to own and enjoy this soundtrack. The music of \\"Gettysburg\\" complimented the movie very, very well, and it is a pleasure to listen to in its own right. The battle music of \\"Battle of Little Round Top\\" is perhaps the most rousing battle music I've ever heard--unforgettable. The rest of the album is quite good as well. The ONLY reason I did not award the fifth star is that this album lacks a big blockbuster comparable, for example, to Mary Fahl's wonderful \\"Going Home\\" on the \\"Gods and Generals\\" soundtrack. That aside, this is a very very good soundtrack featuring excellent music which captures the Civil War theme beautifully and effectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Musical Score","review":"As I have said in other reviews of motion picture musical scores, it is great to hear composer's writing motion picture scores, than scores written in an attempt to hit a top 40 rating. This musical score is a wonderful musical production that will take you on an epic journey to the days of the civil war. I wish I could tell you by what symphony peformed this piece, but rest assured it is performed by a very talented full instrumental group. Randy Edelman created this masterpiece for those enjoying a more artistic musical experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotions that never grow dim","review":"Gettysburg is that rare soundtrack that captures the very essence of the film it was written for.

It came back to my mind recently and I decided to purchase it based on the memory of the wonderful music that makes up the album. I don't remember how the theme went, and I don't remember all of the songs, but I do remember how beautiful it all sounded and that memory makes me give it 5 stars. I look forward to hearing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful soundtrack","review":"I puchased this sound track to use as background music for a ceremony.

Namely provide a medium on which to print your label, then attach itself to the desired item. While there may be other label tapes out there, some with near impervious surfaces, some with extra-strength adhesive backings, this particular label tape is of a more generic nature, good for general purpose situations.

As far as listening goes, it probably deserves five stars. My problem is that I'm a fan of period music. I want my chants to be chants, and I want the instruments to be period instruments. The good part of this album is tha it was recorded in actual monasteries around Europe, using the churches' own choirs, and it is great. The part I don't like is that they use the existing organs to accompany music that was written before the first organ was built.A small quibble, I admit, but things like that do influence the way I feel about the music I listen to. Still, if that doesn't bother you then this is a great album to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another point of veiw on this countries health system by comparison","review":"The film by Michaeal Moore, \\"Sicko\\" is very entertaining, humorous, and frightening revealing in scope.

The film brings attention to the American people and the world how much is needed for change in the health system system as it exist today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, Bad Platform","review":"Once again Michael Moore has created and entertaining and enlightening film on an issue that affects us all. His newest \\"shock\\"umentary is sure to please, entertain, and raise eyebrows around the country.My concern, though, is with the cult of Michael Moore. I would like to point out that this is a MOVIE and was made in a \\"for profit\\" market, so watchers beware of the Hollywood-izing that takes place to make such a movie sell. I find it best to take most of what is said with a grain of salt, and not to base my opinions and views of, say, the US healthcare system purely on what i see on this dvd.

Moore makes the argumentthat we would all be better off with a system of socialized medicine in place.It is clear that there are problems with the private insurance system which maximizes its profits by denying coverage to the sick in this country. Working from this premise Moore contrasts the systems in place in Canada, France, England and Cuba to show that universal coverage is the answer.Moore has taken a lot of heat over his investigative methods and his ways of presenting information. The question as to whether this is true journalism or pure muckraking and Bush bashing is best left up to the individual viewer but hos film is a good source of material for the health care debate and on this point alone it is well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie for these times!","review":"I praise this film for its positive portrayal of the publicly funded health systems of Canada, the United Kingdom and Cuba, and for its negative portrayal of the health care system in the United States.With several personal interviews and American health care \\"horror stories\\", \\"Sicko\\" shows clearly why the United States needs to change its health care system.By highlighting the success of other nations with publicly funded systems, Moore shows that such reform can be successful in the good ole' U.S.A.The video contains plenty of extras - in depth interviews, etc. that provide lots of eye-opening info!Buy two or three to give to your friends and local congress critters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Health care in USA is SICKO!","review":"We have shared this documentary with several friends who were all ashamed and embarrassed by America's greed and avarice toward fellow Americans by the health care????? industry!

This one is good and pretty solid. I've experienced the UK healthcare system and I can confirm that they see people for free and the medications have a price cap.My only issue is the deleted scene where he talks to a nun about religious freedom in Cuba. That was garbage. ReadGod's Missiles Over Cuba: The Tom White Storyand tell me about religious freedom in Cuba!That aside, Moore raises very good questions and shows how messed up and corrupt our health care system really is.

A must see, and think about, film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valid critique of American healthcare (insurance) system","review":"Many Americans will be surprised to learn that there's a whole range of opinions and experiences regarding healthcare (and other issues), outside our borders, that we're not exposed to. In fact, we're rather aggressively shielded from the outside world. Some would have you believe that the world outside US borders is all some huge socialist hellhole. Of course, few of those folks know (or care) what the word 'socialism' actually means. They're simply carrying water (knowingly or not) for the US insurance industry. This movie attempts to expose American audiences to a small slice of the large reality outside of our carefully sheltered experience. Moore uses the same story-telling devices he uses in all of his movies, some of which I find slightly annoying, but I applaud his message whole-heartedly. He's a good man, and a patriot in the true sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Inspiring","review":"Many of us seek documentaries in search of wisdom. That is to say, we want to know more about the world around us. Subjects of politics, of nature, of religion, of history, of science, of health demand the attention of the best of society. Here, we find a beautifully made documentary filled with hope, concern, anger, and, at points, laughter. The insights granted by this documentary are very different from most documentaries I've analyzed. Here, we have a clear cut case that everyone, in some way, can attest to. A subject so profound but so guarded. There are no conspiracies here, just experiences. Believe me, this documentary is wealth worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let go and let government solutions never work","review":"It's funny how rich socialists like Moore, who insist on government control of every aspect of our lives, have no intention of giving up any of their treasure for the cause. I refuse to take advice on handing over the health and well being of myself and my loved ones to the same type of top down beuracracy that has a hard time keeping track of supplies for hurricane victims from someone who can afford to have a full time physician. It's easy for Moore and others to tell us to \\"Let go and let government\\" when their wealth exempts them from the program.As a comedy it would have gotten four stars, but as a serious documentary, it barely rates one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not play in Switzerland","review":"My wife is a doctor here in Switzerland and we always wanted to see Sicko. Unfortuntately when we tried to play the video we got the message that it does not work in our area. Another tiny problem is that Amazon sent us two Sicko videos instead of one. Needless to say, I will not be ordering any more videos over Amazon.Bob GriersonSwitzerland"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like silly exaggerations, you will like this.","review":"Filled with many well produced exaggerations designed to make a point and not necessary the truth of the situation. While healthcare needs reform in the US, pointing to healthcare systems in other countries where their citizens come to the US for care if they can afford the cost is ridiculous.

It not only depressed me, but made me angry that our country has been hijacked by Big Business. Everythingin this documentary is true. It should be required viewing in all schools. American citizens must realize that governments should fear their people, not the other way around. No matter how you feel about Michael Moore, the issues in this documentary are too important to be dismissed because you don't like the film maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful idea, no?","review":"Michael Moore made a film showing voters in other countries got their governments to provide them with universal military , police & fire protection as well as health care and even college educations. People in this country who are opposed to that seem to be afraid to say so. Instead they heap scorn on Michael Moore for pointing out those simple, basic, important facts. Me? I think taxpayers and voters in America should follow the lead of taxpayers and voters in other countries. After all, the money that our government spends is . . . ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus -not crusaders- would love Michael!","review":"Mr. Moore sometimes gets attacked for being a fatso socialist who doesn't really make documentaries.In SICKO Moore leads a small film crew that shares the unravelled fate (of only a few of the 24,000) volunteered and desperate US health care victims who quickly replied to his call for attention.Moore, as an artful dodger, sheds light on some of the the most outrageously unfair cases upon an international stage. It is this staging that provokes the outrage of staid documentary consumers who feel easily threatened by health care systems which are less driven by stock market greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im confused","review":"I dont usually take any type of advice from fat slobs. Luckily for Moore though, thanks to his pals movie 'Supersize Me', he now knows that stuffing his face isnt his fault, its McDonalds. Seriously though, if Moore thinks Cuba is so wonderful, and that America is so awful, it puzzles me why he still lives there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!!","review":"He makes a good point that health care would be wonderful IF it was free and readily available, but that is not a good idea for the US and the way it SHOULD be. It SHOULD be that the government stays out of the peoples lives here in the US. Government health care, i.e. Hilary-Care, is going to be MESS. It will cost much to setup, then after setup they will alter the way of it to save money, then it will be a very shody and risky system. Government control of most anything, in some ways even \\"security\\", is mostly always a bad thing for the citizens. This is a short and vague discription of why its bad but but beleive me this DVD has a sugar-coated, poisony message."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Socialistic\\" healthcare is NOT the answer","review":"The problem with this video is when you look at something as large as healthcare, where there are literally millions of cases that can be looked at you are naturally going to find issues. What Moore does is exploit those issues so he can scare people to buy into his line of thinking. No matter what system you establish you are going to have issues. Is it fair? Does it suck? Yes, but that is a fact of life. Everyone who is gung ho for a government run system is putting on blinders if they dont think there are going to be a ton of other issues that arise. Government run programs have more waste and are mismanaged more then any other programs in the world. The government has no incentive to manage programs effeciently, if costs get out of hand they have an easy solution, raise taxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Split decision","review":"I actually prefer my fiction to be fiction and my documentaries to be non-fiction. I have never been a fan of taking the truth and stretching it to where it is no longer recognizable. And Michael Moore has taking stretching to a new art.If this was listed under fiction I would have given this 4 stars, it is colorful and imaginative but alas it isn't quite what it is advertised to be. Unfortunately the trend in Hollywood is to label the \\"in\\" thing as being factual and list it under documentary. If you are not familiar with the subject, you would be ill-advised to take Moore's word on anything and look for information in more respectable places."},{"rating":"2","title":"A jaw-dropping experience","review":"We've always been brainwashed into believing that \\"socialized medicine\\" are dirty words and that if we had it here in the U.S., the quality of medical care would be far worse than it is now. (I don't know how much worse it could be than almost killing Dennis Quaid's twin babies.) Not so. Wait till you see this film! It'll make you want to move to France or Canada or England, or even Cuba, on the first plane out. The medical care that is offered in these countries is not only FREE, but also excellent, and apparently the doctors are not living on meager salaries like we've been told. One English doctor's salary has afforded him a comfortable lifestyle, with a million dollar home and a luxury automobile. And the cost of medication in Cuba will raise the hairs on the back of your neck. 5 pesos for the same medication that costs $150 in this country! If you haven't seen this film, do so quickly. It's excellent and a real eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Republican and give this 5 stars!","review":"Eye-opening. I'm not a Michael Moore fan in general, but this was a great documentary/movie or whatever you want to call it. I also watched ALL of the special features and highly recommend them. The private healthcare in this country is a huge failure overall... let's fix it so we're not the only western democracy without universal healthcare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of \\"Sicko\\" by Ronald Remmel","review":"America has a conservative political idea that less government is better government, because government supposedly provides services less efficiently than capitalist enterprise. Thus private health insurance should provide better medical care than a national health care system such as in Canada, England, and France. Michael Moore makes the case that in fact health care, even for the insured, is poorer in America. He cites many cases where an insured person's medical condition is not covered, or his share of the expenses is exorbitant. In my own case I am under Medicare, but I must still pay several thousand dollars for medication. Moore's movie should help conservatives rethink national health care."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving, funny and extremely important movie","review":"This movie is Moore's best work by far. A must see for all Americans. People, we can do better than what we currently have in our country. We are getting so screwed over by private insurance. People are DYING for their profit. Please watch this movie with an open mind. Thanks Michael!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Americans but worth watching by others","review":"Anyone who lives in a country with socialized medicine, (Canada, UK, France, etc), should watch this movie to see what real people go through in the USA. Medical care may not be perfect in your country but you may think better of it when you see what some unfortunate people have gone through in this movie.

If you pay every month for health insurance, this movie is worth looking at.What I found the most compelling and valuable was Moore's comparative studies in health care systems here and outside the US.I think this movie provides us with another perspective (an unspun look) at our medical 'care'.I strongly urge everyone to borrow, rent or buy this film so that you may make the most informed choices regarding your own health care.There is nothing more precious than our health. This movie reassured me that \\"no, I'm not seeing things...the medical treatment I'm receiving seems to worsen with every office call!\\"The movie will more than likely have you fuming...so be prepared for some much needed, bitter tasting doses of the truth. Ignorance is bliss but knowing power!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sicko","review":"Sicko is a must see movie. If you think you have good insurance and suddenly find that you are denied treatment by an insurance company bureaucrat,this is your story. This movie is not about the uninsured, it's about those who have insurance but are at the peril of being denied needed treatment because their insurance company, for one reason or another, denies their claims. This movie spells out one of the two most important reasons that this country needs health care reform now. The other reason, of course, is that so many people cannot afford, or cannot obtain,Sicko (Special Edition)needed insurance coverage.

This film proves my theory that the once great nation we live in today is not about moral values anymore, only money. But I'm not terribly upset by this old news because if I had half as much money as the Private Insurers do, I would not be worrying about what is happening to others, I be worrying what to be spending my next big salaried income on.

I read it and understood the words, but I didn't understand anything. It seems like there is no coherence in the book.

This is the last novel completed from Dickens, I seriously believe he was growing crazy or something at this point, or maybe his mind was just decomposing and falling apart?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Sadly, this book was just too boring for me to continue with. Not even the possibility of finding LOST answers can compel me to trudge on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickens at his best","review":"Dickens last completed manuscript shows him at the top of his game. Solid humor and lively characters are brought to life in Dicken's usual, though extraordinary style. Chapters that bounce back and forth between past and present tense really showcased his remarkable abilities as one of the world's most gifted writers. Our Mutual Friend was considered by the critics of his day to be a bit eccentric. As a result it was not, at the time, thought his best work. But I find the eccentricities here make it his very best, his most lively and entertaining piece. Either way you see it, it is clear that Dicken's very best books came about in his later years. A Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations and Little Dorritt provide proof to this. Our Mutual Friend would make an honorable addition to any modern or classic book shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Jane Austen...","review":"Charles Dickens novel \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" is by far the best novel I've read to date. He masterfully portrayed Victorian London society, and the overwhelming emphasis of money at that time. In this novel Dickins work is similar to that of Jane Austen, aside from the dark underlying settings the novel at times goes. This book by far to me, is a story of how love conquers all, even money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Literature","review":"It's a shame that this classic novel is practically unread by the average citizen. This book pulls in 56 scant reviews while some e-kindle garbage for 99 cents pulls in over two hundred. People tend to think that Dickens, while a difficult read, cannot provide the same gratification as simplistic literature does with any James Patterson novel. Mind you, this is a long, drawn out story, with complex characters/caricatures and some buried words, but the tale itself is worth the devotion. I tried reading this as a young man, but was overwhelmed after the first hundred pages. I re-visited Our Mutual Friend in my early twenties and appreciated Dickens ever more. I won't comment on the story itself, other than expressing my gratification to the old literary world, and the few who still try to uphold it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy one Dickens","review":"Yes Yes YesDickens writes a towering saga of greed and love and jealousy and manifold other emotions.At times it seems as though the happy ending will never come, yet at the end wrong is righted and the heroine wed.Forget this book as great literature - it probably is -(I'm just not pompous enough to say so) This book is a book that makes you glad you read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unhelpful Introduction","review":"The two star rating is aimed at the introductory material chosen by the editors of the Modern Library Classics Edition, not at all at Dickens' novel.An introduction should facilitate the reader's comprehension of the work. Particularly, one expects Modern Library editions to be demotic, helping keep classics alive for readers who are not up to speed on high toned literary criticism.The essay by Richard Gaughan which was chosen to \\"introduce\\" Dickens' most complex and difficult novel requires more effort than the work itself.

True, but being from Indiana, I know what a good snow shovel can do. We have camphor trees surrounding our house and have a huge amount of leaves to scoop up. This shovel works great! I use it to push and scoop up the leaves that are in the road as well as to scoop up the leaves after I rake or blow the yard. Makes the job so much easier. This seems to be a pretty sturdy shovel. I wasn't sure I would like a plastic one as I've always had aluminum so we'll see how many years it holds up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong and sturdy","review":"This feels, and is, very solidly built. D-shaped handle easy for pushing. Shaft is thick with long ridges making it easy to hold. The shovel is the proper length to minimize bending over. The shovel portion is strong plastic with a metal edge. The metal edge is a thick metal that is bolted multiple times to the underneath of the plastic shovel so it should be securely fastened. Yes, I live in Atlanta, but we get snow about 2-3 times a year that I need to push off the drive way (else it partially melts and may refreeze into ice). Luckily we don't get enough to have to shovel, lift, and throw into a pile. Regardless, I am very satisfied with the quality and price -- which replaces my old, short, flat shovel that strained my back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good snow shovel","review":"The ONLY bad thing about the shovel{that I can think of} is; It could be a little wider. Or maybe make 2 sizes 1-18\\" and 1-24\\" for guys who like to move alot of snow quickly. But everything about the 18\\" shovel is great. Built tough and the length is perfect for me and I'm 5ft 10in. So far-so good and we've had our share of snow so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow Shovel","review":"I ordered two shovels. Good price. No problems so far and I have used them in three snow storms. Even heavy snow, it functions fine. The good thing about this shovel is you can push snow and lift snow with the same piece of equipment. I personally do not like the metal edge on the bottom. It may last longer with this, however, the metal scratches wooded decks and doesn't glide that well. This can be removed if need be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cottle as a college text","review":"Cottle's edited text gave an outstanding overview of the public relations (PR) fields. His co-authors wrote compartmentalized chapters on specific areas of expertise, and it makes understanding the field much clearer.

I am using it as a text for a public relations master's level course, and it is almost perfect.

The picture quality is great when you are able to focus the unit but if you want something that you can actually be mobile with then this is not the unit for you. The viewing screen is extremely small to the point of not being able to see very well and trying to focus the unit in a fast and efficient manner is not going to happen, especially on objects within about 15-20 feet. In complete darkness you can see very well but then say try walking around or moving the unit away from your eye, you are then worse off than if you had nothing at all. I would save up your money for night vision that will be more mobile oriented and user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect , perfect","review":"Wonderful, it is considered one of the strongest digital vision i ever seen perspectives, which can be seen clearly second generation with the possibility of clarifying dimension is very easy and infrared level far frankly he was excellent"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was dum","review":"The giant hogan match, was the dummest match ive ever seen.

At most it will stay on my head for 10 minutes. I find myself repeatedly twisting the thing back into place. The second one I got (the first was missing parts) came apart when I tried to unplug it from the charging cable. Jawbone does not seem to offer any other buds (not even spares) so I just ordered some Acoustibuds in the hope that I can actually use it.

When I made calls, I could hear the person I called but they could not hear me.

It sounds like the treble has been turned up, or the dynamic range is really narrow. To be fair, I have been told that my voice sounds OK and that the noise cancellation does seem to work well.In the end, I have second thoughts about spending this much on a product that delivers marginally better voice quality with a big question mark on durability and reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"It might be great if it fits your face","review":"I bought this as replacement for a Motorola 850, that I loved and wore into the ground. If you are the kind of person who has a hard time getting earbuds to fit DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. The included sizers were useless. After e-mailing Aliph directly, they sugeested that I try Jabra earbuds. After a week of fidgeting with that I found one that sort of fits, after I spend 10 minutes slipping this over my ear. Of course after about 45 minutes, your ear gets a bit sweaty and the unit starts to slide. Further, even when comfortable in my ear, the piece lifts off my face making the noise-canceller (the purpose for buying this) useless.

I purchased this two months ago and I can't get it to work for me. When I am in the car or in a rush and try to put it on I can't get it to sit correctly against my jawbone and this causes it to not hear me. The biggest problem is that you don't even know it's not sitting correctly until you are on the phone with someone and you can hear them but they can't hear you and they hang up on you.When it works - it's great. No one can hear your surroundings and the quality of the speaker is good.

Perfect voice reproduction. Unbeatable noise avoidance. It pairs quickly with both mine and my wife's cell phones. The only issue we have run into is that while this product works perfectly for me, her face is a bit smaller, and the noise sensor bud doesn't always hold to her face. That bud has to touch your jawbone as that is how this earpiece detects what sound it should let through. The second it comes off, your voice shoots to the background. There are several included earcups though, so I'd expect the issue to be limited to a only a few who couldn't use it. Best Bluetooth phone out there though. Clear, perfectly intelligible, highly recommend to anyone considering it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the best Bluetooth headset","review":"This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality! The ear clip should be redesigned. I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality. You must remember the sensor has to touch your face while you talk.

I will say, however, that I am very satisfied with it's performance. The noise shield seems to work well, maybe not as well as they would have you believe, but people seem to have no trouble hearing me while I'm in my Jeep with the top down. The battery life is more than enough for my purposes. The ear fit is a little tricky. I use it in my left ear and there doesn't seem to be a perfect fit combination, which is a complaint I read when researching it. All I can say is: I like it, but I wouldn't pay full price for it, but then again I don't buy anything at full price...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good technology.

It claims to have great noise reduction, but is not any better than my previous headset that cost half as much. The sound quality leaves some to be desired. It can be a pain to fit. It was not comfortable or very secure with the ear buds included so I purchased the gel ear plugs. This made it more comfortable but even harder to fit in the ear.

The jawbone charger connection is poorly designed, when you plug in the charger it is depending on the end of the earpiece to stay on but it has a small piece holding it so the force of the charger dislodges it, it is hard to describe unless you see it.

So, I can't tell you if this is a good adaptation or not. I can tell you if it is a good film, and the answer is no! It seems the film took quite a bit of time to make you familiar with and like the characters, (spoiler alert) just to chop 'em all up and destroy them at the end. The thing about torture movies like Hostel, that makes them worth watching, is the victim/hero finally gets revenge in the end, and we cheer when the sadist/torturer meets his demise. The ending of this film was just too dismal and after all that time (over an hour) of character developement, the ending just doesn't pay off.

Twilight's Jackson Rathbone stars as a college student who partakes in the documentation and experimentation with people's fears, as convinced to do by his unhinged colleague (Shaun Evans) who has a dark and shady past. You can probably see where things end up going from here. While the atmosphere of Dread is admirable, the pacing and scares of the film are pretty much off-kilter. The actors involved don't do much to help matters here either, and as a whole, the film is fairly predictable, albeit its conclusion does come off as somewhat of a surprise.

Even the low rez pics are high quality; I've got an HP 952c printer, and unless you look close, you can't tell that you're looking at a digital picture. Editing pictures on the fly is a snap. The only complaints I would have is the low 4MB Memory stick it comes with, and it's a little slow when taking action shots (for an extreme amateur photographer like me, I need every advantage I can get!). Sony continues to have my vote for high quality electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera","review":"I bought this camera after some comparison shopping, and was surprised to find features that aren't commented on in most reviews. In addition to what others have already said, I really like the video out feature, which allows you to watch a slide show of your pix on a regular TV. I was a litte worried about the quality of a 1.3 megapixel camera, but I have made good-looking 8x10 prints after a little enhancement in photoshop.This camera can pre-focus (like a real 35mm SLR) which shotens the time it takes to take a picture from the moment you press the shutter release to the time the picture is captured. Just press the shutter down about half-way.Documentation is excellent, quality and build are first-rate, and I would recommend this camera if you are shopping for a camera in this price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every child should read this book","review":"I loved this book as a child and now that I am a teacher I use this book in my classroom.

Being in the IT Security field for over 7 years and remembering some of my earlier days, I decided to buy it. Overall I liked how Ms. Harris broke out the ethics and laws. Most of us in the field know there are laws, but never take the time to sit down and absorb them. The coding stuff was the best and more up my alley. I've seen too many security professionals who don't know how to code and coding IS THE MOST IMPORTANT SKILL YOU CAN LEARN. This book cleanly broke down C, Assembley, and some sample exploits really well. I was able to brush up on my Assembley and learn some cool tools in the process. If you've read Hacking Exposed and want some more fundamental information, read this book. You'll really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a waste of good paper","review":"I have been condicting ethical hacking for 3 years and this book was such a let down, it falls well short in providing and good detailed content.

Imagine my disappointment to pour in water and have it leak out slowly all over the counter. I was pretty sure that wasn't part of the game plan. I had my husband look at it. He said it wasn't an easy fix and every attempt to brew a pot ended with Lake Erie on our counter. We decided to return it. It may have been just a fluke in that one machine, but I was afraid the whole batch might be bad and so didn't exchange for another one (even the nearest Target is a bit of a drive for us). What a hassle and what a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"Here is the problem, the controls are on the bottom(on and off switch and stuff).

DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Second One","review":"We bought our first several years ago, and it was reliable and made very good coffee by our standards. We really liked the thermal carafe, and we always filled the carafe with hot water the night before which we believe helps keep the coffee hot long into the morning.But, I killed it one day. Not realizing that I had a carafe of warm water sitting under the filter, I added a potful of water to the reservoir, turned it on, and ended up drowning the thing. Water overflowed the pot and got into the electronics, and the digital controls failed to function after that. So, I was delighted to see that the identical model is still for sale on Amazon. I ordered it, we are using it, and we love it -- but now I make sure I empty that pot before I turn it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Unless you like cold coffee, this coffee maker is pretty much useless. Machine functions as do most except there is no heat plate to keep carafe warm. And the carafe does not keep the coffee warm but for a few minutes. Even if you preheat the carafe, which is a nuisance and waste of water and energy, the coffee is still cool within minutes. One must also use a measuring cup for water to accurately determine the number of cups to be brewed as the carafe has no markings for number of cups. Again, a nuisance. Useless and worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The whole purpose of a carafe is to keep the coffee hot. Not with this coffee maker. Unless you drink all 8 cups right after brewing, your coffee will be luke-warm at best. We returned ours after 3 days. I'm assuming that the more expensive models work better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Thermal Carafe Model DE790B","review":"Nice looking unit brews fast. Coffee is hottest when carafe is pre heated and a full 8 cups are made. Never had a problem with lid, pouring or leaking. Programing easy after reading directions. This unit has a basket filter holder I would have preferred a cone #4 filter holder and red clock numbers are very bright. Unit leaves a tablespoon or two of water in the reservoir after brewing. After washing then brewing water 2 times it took about 2 more brewing cycles to lose that new smell/taste. Easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back & Decker Thermal Carafe Coffeemaker","review":"This thermal carafe does not keep the coffee hot long enough to qualify for a thermal carafe unit - probably less than 2 hours and it was only luke warm. I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like the taste of plastic.....","review":"then this coffeemaker is for you. While my first cup is hot enough, it doesn't stay hot. The second cup has already cooled way too much. I find myself nuking at the second cup. The lid is very awkward, holds liquid inside that is difficult to get rid of, stains my sink if left to drain out. I do like the coffee basket, comes out easily to clean. Not too difficult to pour water into the tank, but the level indicator is hard to read. Makes coffee really fast which is the very best thing about this one. Bottom line, some pros some cons, as with all machines. But the deal breaker is, I can't get rid of the plastic taste. I've only had it a couple months and I'm looking to replace it. I have another Black & Decker flagged as it's gotten almost 5 stars, but I'm scared it may, too, have that awful plastic taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined too many mornings","review":"Every few weeks, the filter collapses and coffee spills out over the counter and onto the drawers and floors. There is no predicting when this will happen. I finally threw it out. And yes, I am using the filters for the 8-12 cup coffee makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I have owned four other thermal carafe coffee makers of various types and quality. I found this one to be equal to or better than my previous purchases. Thermal carafe coffee makers keep the coffee fresh by not \\"baking\\" the coffee which retains the good flavor. Coffee quality was good, coffee temperature was also adequate, set up for brewing was reasonable, I saw the open/close lid markings to be obvious. My wife liked this unit because of the stainless steel design. If you expect your coffee to be \\"Dunkin Donuts\\" hot, you'll be disappointed with any home thermal carafe coffeemaker. But if you make coffee to be consumned within a one to three hour time period, I'll enjoy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money!","review":"I am very pleased with this coffee maker it has exactly the features i wanted except the reusable filter - i just brought my own. This unit makes good coffee, with both the gourmet and cheap coffees I use. It looks great and the stainless carfe feels well made when you hold it. It took me a couple of tries to get the hang of the lid but not an issue after that. I find that the coffee stays hot for hours if you close the lid after each serving. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm coffee, anyone?","review":"I am returning this item after using it for about a week because it simply does not and cannot make a cup of HOT coffee. The machine automatically shuts off the second that the coffee has finished brewing, which means that the coffee can only get as hot as the heating element can make it, without the benefit of the warming plate doing anything. You cannot keep the warming plate on to keep the coffee heated, so regardless of the carafe aspect, you can't have hot coffee. Bummer, it's nice looking and I like the idea of the thermal carafe, but it doesn't do much good to simply keep lukewarm coffee lukewarm."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Product Support","review":"I was unfortunate enough to have purchased this product. Initially, the coffee maker worked fine but it only lasted 5 1/2 months.

No more worry about \\"did I turn off the coffee pot?\\" Need one for the office and plan to get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffee maker ever - will ruin your marriage","review":"In a word - terrible. Carafe design is deplorable - makes a mess when you fill reservoir with water, and when you pour your coffee. Although ours is the white model with the heated plate, the machine and carafe are identical, only glass, and with a warming plate. I tend to use the grab-a-cup feature, which causes a drip every time I do, which in turn has led to the coating on the plate to peel away. And we've only owned it for about 4 months!I hate this coffee maker more than I've ever hated any small home appliance I've ever owned. I'm not kidding, my husband laughs at me but is equally frustrated with it. We're going back to Proctor Silex or a Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it: leaks, leaks, and leaks","review":"I strongly recommend against buying this coffee maker. Coffee oozes out of the carafe (between the metal and the plastic) both during brewing (long before it actually reaches that level) and during pouring. A puddle of coffee on the counter after every cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whewee, stay away from this one...","review":"I hate to write a harsh review, but this was one awful coffeemaker.--Hard to clean--Awkward lid--Lukewarm coffee--Nonintuitive autobrew mechanismThe baseplate is not heated, of course, which would be fine if the carafe actually kept the coffee hot. It doesn't.I purchased this product and, within a week or two, returned it and got a Mr. Coffee coffeemaker, which was not only cheaper but far superior. I just got tired of reheating each cup of coffee in our microwave.It may have been a defective unit but, if so, it was the same defect experienced by another reviewer here at Amazon, so, if you're reading this beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes good coffee","review":"When my last Mr. Coffee died (I've had at least 3) I thought I'd try something different. Reviewing prices the B&D seemed fair. It makes the coffee as quickly, if not faster than Mr. C. After using it for a month I haven't had the problem of the filter paper folding over so that grounds get in the carafe which would happen occasionally with Mr. C. The coffee tastes fine. The insulated carafe does keep the coffee warm but after an hour it isn't as warm as I was used to. On the positive side it also doesn't make the hour old coffee bitter. I like that I don't have to worry about breaking the carafe while I'm rinsing it out (I've done that once with Mr. C)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISASTER!","review":"We bought this at Target only 2 weeks ago, and already it has exploded coffee all over the kitchen counter twice. The instructions say if you don't attach the lid correctly, this will happen. So I take pains to insert the lid correctly (which took some practice after the little markers wore off after only a week). It explodes with no apparent reason. So, on top of having to clean up the mess first thing in the morning--without having had any coffee--I have to also bleach all the countertops because the coffee stains so bad.Don't buy it!!! If you must, at least keep the receipt (I wish I had)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this model","review":"My last Black and Decker coffee maker lasted 15 years and made great coffee. This model is a disappointment. The carafe leaks and doesn't keep the coffee hot. The \\"first pour\\" coffee isn't very hot either."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the problem?","review":"I don't understand the bad reviews for this product. I asked my wife to get a non-glass coffemaker because I am tired of breaking the glass coffee carafe when I wash it. I always end up buying a new coffeemaker because the price difference is close enough between a replacement carafe and brand new machine to opt for the latter. Coffee tastes good, coffee kept hot, easy to understand instructions. The arrows on the lid let you know where to position the lid for pouring and closing. Maybe if I needed a coffee pot that lasted over four hours this would be a bad deal, but all I need is for it to last maximum 2 hours, long enough for morning coffee with my wife on weekends and quick cup out the door before work days. I am confused by the negative reviews. Just make sure the lid is closed between coffee pours. No problem with cleaning, just wash in warm dish water. Also I followed the direction and ran clear water through before first use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 4 weeks","review":"This coffee maker quit working after 4 weeks of use.

Lesson learned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm and watered down...","review":"We have whole beans at work which we grind every morning and brew thru a wonderful Bunn coffee maker. My desire for similar quality coffee at home led me to this machine. Following the first brew, my initial impression was that the coffee was very lukewarm and weak. With every subsequent brew, I adjusted the recipe - using more grounds, grinding longer, using more water (to let the grounds \\"cook\\" longer), preheating the carafe, etc. While I figured out how to make stronger coffee, at the end of the day it still had that watered down consistency. The best results I got were from grinding enough beans to make 10 cups (according to the grinder's fill level) but it seemed like a waste of money to use that much when all I really wanted was 1-2 cups a day.I came to the conclusion that the water just doesn't get hot enough to brew a proper pot of coffee and after toying with it for 1.5 weeks I returned it and bought a Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"basically throwing away coffee","review":"The holes that drip the hot water onto the grounds are about 1 inch around, the surface are they need to cover is about 3 inches around.

It would have benefited from a second loop handle, but the design is still nice. This is a good size for modest portions and smaller jobs. Unlike some bigger traditional steel woks, this has a flat area on the bottom (not completely bowl shaped). This 10\\" one is worth the $20.

You'll love this book, whatever your spiritual or religious preference is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Ladinsky - read Hafiz","review":"Once again, Ladinsky claims to be presenting English speaking readers with the work of the great Persian poet Hafiz, and once again, he hasn't felt the need to actually learn Persian or actually base these works on any previous translation of any poem by Hafiz. These are the poems that Ladinsky imagines Hafiz might have written had he been a twentieth century baby boomer Californian disciple of Meher Baba, instead of a 14th century Persian Sufi Muslim. Ladinsky believes (or claims to believe) that Hafiz told him these poems. If so, the afterlife hasn't done anything for the great poet's literary talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Ladinsky hoax","review":"It is already well-known that Ladinsky cannot read Farsi and that he has simply written all the poems himself, publishing them under the name of Hafiz because it sells better than it would if they were published under his own name. Since he seems to have his own \\"believers\\" I am not going to disturb them by saying what I think about his poetry, but they are disturbing ME by saying what they think about the poetry of \\"Hafiz\\". If this is Hafiz, then Justin Bieber is Mozart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex and Art","review":"Judging from Greek mythology and art, the Ancient Greek appear to be obsessed with sex - but why? The author does a good job of explaining this obsession in terms of literature, art, and history. By understanding the suppression of women in Greek culture, one is able to understand many taboo aspects of Greek culture. The author states that museum's have censored many works of art due to the pornographic themes, and as a result Modern society has been misguided.Although I did not agree with the authors interruption of every piece of art in the book, I did find the subject of female and male prostitution 'interesting'. It was also 'interesting' to learn what the Ancients Greeks considered beautiful in terms of male and female sexuality, and why the Greek's altered the size of certain body parts in art. Needless to say , I found this book interesting and very entertaining; however, I would only recommend it to a mature audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong product","review":"L'interdit was the product ordered, not Fleur D'interdit.

He's the type of child who doesn't see color. On the other hand, Aunt Lucille is one crazy--but hilarious--broad! Her wild excursions are very entertaining, while shocking at the same time. It's neat how these two characters are going through two completely different things, yet they are both \\"growing up\\" and learning pretty much the same lesson about standing up for who you are, not letting anyone put you down, being an individual, etc. Overall, this was a great read...I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Change","review":"This book is a great portrait of life in the south during the change of segretation.

Give it a try, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing new talent","review":"I bought this cd hoping it would be as good as the clips seemed, and its better. She touches a place inside of you and the songs are memorable. Let's get the word out on this new singer, as good as jewel when she first came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent debut... can't wait to hear more.","review":"I heard \\"Breathe (2AM)\\" played on XM Radio and I just had to know what else Anna Nalick had to offer... after snagging the CD (for only $9.99) I was pleasantly surprised by this great debut. As much as there aren't many other songs on the CD that are quite as \\"pop' and catchy as the first single, there are some real gems on this recording. Some of the songs, especially the album closer, bring to mind the vocal talents of Fiona Apple - and that's quite a compliment. If there is anything the album suffers from (ever so slightly) is that a couple of the songs sound too alike as far as instrumentation and production goes. Overall though, a wonderful debut with no filler material. I can't wait to see Anna's talents blossom even further. Get this CD, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I love this cd, I have to listen to it atleast 3 times a day. I really encourage other kids to buy it. It is something you and your parents can enjoy together (much better than that disco stuff they listen to!) I have never had a cd I have enjoyed more. Most cds have three or four really good songs and then the rest are filler tracks that stink. Not this one! All eleven songs, start to finish are amazing and beautiful. Take a break from that dumb stuff Avril and Brittney sing and listen to some real music from a real proformer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not perfect","review":"I just bought Anna's CD, after becoming obsessed with the first single. I am enjoying it, but it isn't quite what I had hoped for. I didn't know what to expect, but I've been pleased even if it doesn't have many \\"turn-it-up\\" kind of songs on the CD. Still a good buy that I'm not regretting, and I'm already singing along with a lot of the songs. (I can't stand songs where you can't tell what the person is saying.) One of the reviewers said Sarah Maclaughlan fans would appreciate this CD, and I agree - that's exactly who I would compare her to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strongest lyrical album in over 10 years","review":"Every now and then, an album comes along that speaks to you. It tells a story and taken you on a journey of someone's life. Not since 1993 when Counting Crows debut album August and Everything After has there been an album with such powerfull lyrical content and beautiful melodies to accompany it.I first heard Anna's music last year when Breathe was a free download on iTunes. Since then I knew she was going to be big, and this album goes far beyond any and all expectations I had for it. I expected good, I didn't expect phenominal.All in all, there's tons of gem tracks on this album, and it's prefect for reflecting or just relaxing. This is also the first album in recent years where I've gone to the store to buy it on it's release date and yeah, it was well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Surprise","review":"I usually don't go for music like this (coming from a particularly big Sabbath, AC/DC, and pre-Reload Metallica fan), but after hearing Breathe 2am, I jumped at the chance to pay $11 for this CD a few months ago, and unlike a good percentage of the reviewers here, I'm gonna go ahead and tell you that this is one of the finest albums I've heard all year. Anna's soft melodies and voice is definitely a big breath of fresh air compared to all the crap I've heard over the radio in the past few months.Anyone interested in this kind of music or otherwise (like me) should give this a shot. I personally can't wait for her next album. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Speaks To Me","review":"She Speaks To Me... That's what I keep thinking when I listen to this CD. I enjoy listening to female artists who seem to relate to, not to mention have a knack for putting words to, all the things women feel. Artists who have that knack for saying what our hearts would like to, but often cannot. This is one of those artists. Other reviewers made the comparison to artists such as Sarah McLachlan, Alanis, etc.. and they weren't kidding. Anna Nalick is most definately going places and anyone would be wise to hitch a ride on her band wagon now.If you are already a fan of Anna Nalicks you may also like Martina Sorbara. I try to plug her any chance I get. She's one of the best new artists out there and hasn't been heard of enough.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Skip Over This CD","review":"I purchased this CD a week ago and have yet to remove it from my car's CD player. This girl has serious talent and soul. The CD makes you want to just want to keep listening until you know all the words to every song. Pick this one up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very impressive","review":"This CD is very good. Anna Nalick's style is similar to such artists as Jewel, Sarah McLachlan, Avril Lavigne, and Alanis Morrisette, but her sound is all her own. The lyrics are full of insight on life. Her voice is clear and powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" CD for every music lover!","review":"I have this cd on my iPod, but loaned out the cd long ago. Of course I never got it back, so when I found it on Amazon at such a great price, I had to have it. I could hear it anytime I wanted on my iPod, but it's just not the same as having it in my collection. I love every song on this cd and could never tire hearing it. Fast delivery and perfect condition....thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"She is trying too hard to sound like other artists like another reviewer mentioned. This is nothing original whatsoever! The style, arrangements, songs are almost identical copies to other artists in this same genre!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as I hoped","review":"This is generally not my kind of music, but for whatever reason, the album's first single, 2 AM, caught my attention, so I picked this up expecting many more anthems of melancholy and rainy day softness to enjoy outside the company of others.Instead, all I got one well written track (lyrically and musically) and a bunch of clumsy 90's songwriter bollocks with a glossy, uninspired quality. It's rare anymore when a single is less formulaic and contrived as the rest of the album, especially when it comes to this niche, but despite Anna's soft 'n' timbered voice and her above average lyrics, the album simply blows."},{"rating":"2","title":"New star rising","review":"This little girl is going to be another Sarah Mclaughlan in a few cd's. Great first album, great tone and inflection. Fantastic CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm \\"Just a Nut\\" for her music!","review":"Anna Nalick, I hope she is prepared for \\"Super Stardom\\" because it's coming!She is the best new artist of recent times. I purchased herCD from Amazon.com as soon as they had a release date.I waited 2 months for that release, but I was able toenjoy all of her music via the instant download. Loaded onmy IPOD and have been playing it ever since. I just had thepleasure of seeing Anna live tonight at the Border inAlgonquin, IL. A great night, she was fabulous! Additionala very sweet and generous person with her time and talent.MUCH MUCH TALENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Artist of the New Millenium!","review":"Anna Nalick IMO is the best artist in the 21st century. Her voice is so smooth and soothing and her vocals are personal and intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one for the collection","review":"I first heard of Anna Nalick when she appeared on the Today Show. I usually don't like the quality of the concerts performed on this show but I stopped in my tracks when I heard Anna performing. I immediately ordered her CD from Amazon and don't regret it a bit.The writing on the CD is amazing. The lyrics are as original as say, Gavin Degraw's. She conveys AND evokes exactly what one would feel if they were in the song's situation beautifully without incorporating cheesy cliches often found in \\"down and out, love gone wrong\\" songs.The song I most identify with is Satellite. I think the lyrics to this song are BRILLIANT.Some have mentioned that the lyrics on most of the album are depressing. Well, YEAH. Don't artists write what they are feeling at times? I know in MY cd collection I have a variety of music because I have a variety of EMOTIONS. I am happy that this one is at the top of the list when I am a bit melancholy. You will be too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album Lyrically and Vocally","review":"I really like all of the songs here. She has a great voice and these are some great lyrics with a lot of depth. I like the good metaphores used in the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna Nalick Nails It","review":"A great album if you like a strong female vocal in your music. \\"Breathe (2am)\\" is a aprticularly great track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Influence or a little more than....","review":"I heard the song Breathe (2am) and was intrigued but when I listened to the rest of the album, I was surprised to hear similarities to many other well known artists. I noticed that Ms. Nalick notes her influences as Fiona Apple and Sarah McLaughlin but I hear more than just influence. There are some lines that are more than similar to many Fiona Apple songs. I was disappointed to hear that Ms. Nalick did not really have her own sound but rather emulated other well known artists (who are successful and well known for their talent and originality). I gave away my Anna Nalick CD and picked up the new Fiona Apple \\"Extraordinary Machine\\", as I would rather listen to the original artist rather than a copycat! I am not debating that Ms. Nalick isn't a talented singer...she has a good voice but that is where it ends. She unfortunately relied too much on the successful lyrics and sounds of others!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"major bummer","review":"This is a great CD to listen to if you're in the mood for slitting your wrists. Anna Nalick has a wonderful voice - incredible, in fact - but virtually every song is sad. Extremely so. Two or three would have been plenty. But the listener - at least this one - can only take so much angst. Even Sarah McLachlin mixes it up more than this woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mature yet lacking","review":"When I first heard 2am I thought it was Jennifer Knapp of Christian Comtenporary Music. Then I realized it was way too nieve and grade school for Jennifer Knapp. Her voice is nice at times, but needs more polish. I dont hate the album, but I dont like it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nalick nailed it!","review":"I really enjoyed this freshman work by this new artist! She is soulful and her music offers a variety of sounds and rhythms in my opinion. If you like Sarah McLachlan, Beth Orton, Lisa Loeb...you will most likely enjoy Anna's work also. I can't wait for her next album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs OTHER than Breathe","review":"I discovered Anna Nalick through Grey's Anatomy, where they featured Breathe. By sheer accident, I decided to listen to the entire album, and really liked what I heard. In fact, I totally disagree with those who say that other songs don't hold a candle to Breathe. Personally, I enjoy Satellite, Wreck of the day, Consider This and Forever love as much or even more than Breathe. The lyrics are good, the voice is very pleasant and strong, and the music is great! One of the best albums I heard in a long time. If SHE is not original and needs to find her path than 99% of other new singers of today need to be banned from singing forever!The only reason I give her 4 stars is because I don't like EVERY SINGLE song or even most of the songs in the album equally, but then again - that does not happen to me very often. Still, I try to reserve 5 stars for those rare occasions, so 4 is really really good in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtaking","review":"I got her album only recently. I had immediately fell in love with \\"Breathe (2AM)\\" so I decided to preview her other songs. I don't buy cds often, in fact this is my first one, but I'm very proud of the decision I made.Like most of the other reviewers seem to think, Anna Nalick definitely has a lot of talent for her age, which really sets her apart and ideal for people looking for original music. Lyrically, she's powerful, yet vocally she's soothing. Everything flows nicely. I'm able to listen to her in any mood, so this CD finds itself very often in my CD player.She's definitely reminiscent of Alanis and a 90s Jewel. I miss them, so I'm very glad Anna Nalick came along."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good one:: form the best tv show ever","review":"You just can't ask for more, this cd is one of the best of all the entire show, well is the first so we can expect the good beginnig of these great singers. The show is absolutlely the best of the year, an the best in so many years. The singer are just great. This cd contains about 24 songs, of the Gala 0/1. Seventeen young singers performing the worlwide hits only for you. I just hope to everybody to enjoy as i did. Your money it will worth it, i mean more than 3 million of people arround the world have it.

Many people believe that the difficult life of the geisha, and other women who entertain men in Japan, is a thing of the past. This book clearly shows that in modern Japan women are still being treated according to centuries-old customs. I have also read Memoirs of a Geisha by Arthur Golden. The many people who enjoyed that novel (and kept it on the bestseller list for over a year) would enjoy Butterflies of the Night. I have heard, on very good authority, that when Butterflies of the Night was first published Ms. Louis was asked to appear on several top television shows. The producers of the shows wanted to sensationalize the material. Ms. Louis declined making an appearance, saying that she wasn't going to go on national television to discuss some unfortunate Japanese women and rake them over the coals. Ms. Louis sensitivity and ethics shine through in her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Perspective on Japanese Night Life","review":"The author Lisa Louis is an American who traveled to Japan and actually lived there for a number of years. When in need of some extra money she dabbled in the night life profession herself as a hostess at a bar where she poured drinks and entertained men. She is also fluent in the Japanese language. It?s because of these things that I think she was able to write such a compelling book. Since she has been a part of both cultures she is able to explain things to an American audience in a way that we can relate to.I also really like the layout of the book. She starts out with her story and what compelled her to make the book. But without assuming she is all-knowing on the subject matter. She recruited numerous others to tell their stories as well.I got the book because of my interest in Geisha but learned so much more than I ever expected to. I had no idea of so many of these things! It was quite a page turner as you?re eager to learn even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor presentation","review":"This book sounded quite interesting, however, the copy that I received looked nothing like the sample shown on line.The first page of the book was allocated to telling the reader that time had not been taken to edit the document and there would be numerous misspellings, punctuaton, possible missed pages, and other errors.The book was not formatted -- not spaced or indented, and in a small point, making reading a chore. I could find no introduction, date of the writing, or information about the story and author. The cover was obviously pulled from a library of photos, unrelated and without concern to the content.I felt this book was an insult to the reader in the form in which it was presented, and I would not have paid .99 cents for it let alone the $19.99 they were charging.Needless to say I sent it back the day I received it.

In the process, we learn more about them, and the central events which displaced them in their world. One is quaint: a kiss stolen on a porch in Nebraska forty years ago. That one kiss set this world on its end, and was a watershed mark in the lives of three people.

Stargate is very much like Independence Day with its brassy action sequences but isn't dominated by it. The score is well-balanced from subtle and touching cues to furious and suspenseful cues. Tracks 1, 2, 9, 10, 17, and the rest are the best in the whole score. The Stargate Overture introduces the main theme and the bad guy's themes, two very good themes. If you like Independence Day or want a well-balanced, complete David Arnold score, this one is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the deluxe edition","review":"Stargate: Original Motion Picture Soundtrackis a great soundtrack.

It's lightweight and was great for swimming laps. Within five months, however, the sound quality deteriorated markedly (treble faded in and out) and now, at 7 months, the player will only work if I hold it face upwards and stand still(think of the way you hold an egg in the palm of your hand). Forget about swimming with it, walking the dog, or any of the other forms of exercise that you might want it for. Hitting the reset button solves the problem for about 10 minutes . . .Although tech support at the Oregon Scientific website promises a response within 48 hours, I have never received one.

So I rented it instead. This movie is weird, pointless, and its attempts at humor are either non-existent or just lost on me. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time on this one! Actually, the cheesy scene at the very end was pretty funny. I don't think it was supposed to be, but it was the only thing even remotely funny about this movie.

He calls her Guinevere, as he calls all his \\"pupils\\". She continues to let him call her that even when learning of all his other \\"pupils\\". Realistic in the way that the only way an older man could get a young girl to satisfy him and support his unemployment is through intense, cruel manipulation of a hopeless wanderer with the self-esteem of a gnat.

I liked Sheehan's articles in \\"Runner's World\\" years ago, and I liked his book \\"Running to Win\\".This one simply isn't as good. For whatever reason, Sheehan seemed bent on naming as many other thinkers as he could, without appearing to really assimilate much.If you have never read any philosophy yourself, you may find some value in this book; but if you've studied philosophy at all, I'd recommend you skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Random Quoting, Few Original Ideas","review":"As an avid reader and runner, I looked forward to buying this book when it was recommeded to me. Regrettably, I had difficulty finishing it.From the start I was set off by the \\"my way or the highway\\" tone. Sheehan's pride in reclusiveness and dislike of people made it difficult to side with the writer. I looked for unique inspiration, advice, even substantial themes. Instead, my eyes jumped from one quote to another - disconnected ideas from over-quoted writers of past centuries.I give due respect to the years Sheehan devoted to the sport. But that is where his expertise stops. A self-proclaimed philosopher, the author uses 90% of the book for elementary self-help messages, many not remotely related to running.I kept hearing \\"you should be me\\" from this book. If you are truly a passionate runner (or have an interest in philosophy 101), you owe it to yourself to find better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Runner-Philosopher","review":"All runners are philosophers. It's just that George Sheehan is every athlete's philosopher. If you have ever wondered why you swing a racquet, shag fly balls or spend hours on a bicycle, read this book and you'll say to yourself \\"that's it, that's why!\\" It's not just the runners who'll say it. This book should be a prerequisite for pursuing any sport at any level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the thinking athlete","review":"I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys philosophy and deep reflection on the meaning of life. I am not much of a reader but once I picked up this book I simply could not put it down. Sheehan has a way a putting together the pain and joy of sports and shows you how you cannot have one without the other. He reminds us that in order to gain the glory of sports, we must endure the pain which is sure to come every time we challenge ourselves. Every time I run, I am able to remember at least one line out of this very powerful book. This helps me to remember that I am not alone, at least not as a pain-enduring athlete."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book!","review":"This book was written several years ago when running was at its peak. When marathons were the only race worth doing. George Sheehan reached right inside the skull of the runner and was able to put into words the feelings that many of us felt at the time. He was merely describing the physiological effect of positive addiction. No-one else has managed to achieve this since. His clinics and lectures were unique and epitomised the man and his writing.

Good Sequel to Oxygen","review":"Although not quite the caliber of \\"Oxygen\\" this book is enjoyable and still contains that edge-of-your-seat story telling style. Again there's not much in the way of \\"Christian\\" fiction but it does ask some good questions and it clearly shows the effects of lying even if your intentions are honorable. I could have done without some of the romance but then again it does add to the character development. I thought \\"The Fifth Man\\" was a good title and not misleading at all. The story sort of leaves room for another sequel but I don't think it's necessary and I wouldn't want to see the characters undergo anymore hardship.

Their latest collection is substantially lusher than earlier releases, crossing guitar-rock with sunshine harmony vocals and the studio craft of classic '60s West Coast pop. Engineered by the band's drummer, Peter Craft, the sound is both spacious and intimate; the vocals settle comfortably into instrumental passages that fill out songs of disintegrating relationships, spiritual quandaries, and meditative circumstance. The lack of a clock ticking away precious studio time clearly freed the band to explore creative new directions in writing, playing and producing, resulting in a sophisticated leap forward.

There was a ready and waiting audience for this series.Maybe if there are enough complaints, they'll re-release it.We can only hope!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yipee","review":"Hoorah! I'm not sure why they list Rod Steiger (he had a film of the same title from 1988) as this series played in the mid 90's on CBS, then later on the Sci-fi channel and somewhere off in Great Britain.Starred Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck, Paige Turco as Gail Emory, Jake Weber as Dr. Matt Crower, John Mese as Dr. Billy Peale, Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs, Lucas Black as Caleb Temple, Sarah Paulson as Merlyn Temple and Nick Searcy as Deputy Ben Healy.Fans of Horror and Fantasy/Sci-Fi will love it. It's creepy but not gorey (hey, it was on CBS). Classic battle between good and evil, and the human souls in between.

Now I am obsessed with the sexy ( and evil [...]) Lucas Buck. And the rest of the cast ( esp. the little boys, Caleb and Boon) shine as well.For those who have never seen this series, it's about a small town in the South called Trinity, where every resident lives by the law of Sheriff Buck, who asks for favors from all of the residents ( and they owe him, as long ago Buck did a 'favor' for them, so they are kind of forced to, unless they want to die...). Caleb Temple and his sister Merlyn ( who was killed by Buck) attempt to do good as Buck tries his best to sway them and get custody of Caleb (SPOILER: He's his real father).An artistic, well-done series that should have been more popular than Friends or Lost; how often do we have shows produced by Sam Raimi???Rent or buy this. It's a classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait; excellent DVD","review":"I hesitated to purchase this DVD series due to some reviews by other members. I must say I don't understand their problem with the way the episodes are set up. I went to the episode index, where the episodes are numbered and titled. I don't see how anyone could be confused or have a problem with it.I watched the series on television but ended up missing an episode or two. I have very much enjoyed being able to watch the DVD commercial free! I only have 3 episodes left to watch. I highly recommend this DVD for those who enjoy this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Series","review":"Any time a TV series appeals to a higher intellect, you can bet it will be short-lived, thanks to the networks. (i.e., Twin Peaks) I'm glad they made this series available to us on DVD. The writing was excellent, as was the acting. The series title speaks for itself: it's definitely American Gothic.(One thing I have to add, however: another reviewer confused the series creator, Shaun Cassidy, with his half-brother,David, and made the Partridge Family connection. Shaun is definitely a heart-throb in his own right; but, as this series evidences, his talents expand beyond the pink satin pants he wore at his concerts, as well as his days as \\"Joe\\" on \\"The Hardy Boys.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"The love of the devil, and some angels for one bad little dude.","review":"This the story of Caleb Temple, an orphaned child of rape in Trinity, SC.The twist is this. Sheriff Lucas Buck runs the town with an iron fist. He can make you or break you, literally. He is admired and/or feared by all. All except Caleb, that is. For Caleb, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, but one still needs to prove their worth to him. The most amazing thing about this show is the high level of courtesy all the characters show one another, after the initial tragedy sets the stage.The show could be called \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" or simply \\"Trinity\\" but the syndicated title says it best. It's a cult classic, with unstoppable twists and turns that make you want to watch it and only it until you've seen every episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If I could rate this a zero I would; it is horribly over acted and absurdly predictable. The characters display an extreme level of naivete and seem incapable of considering consequences to their actions or acting with even a minute level of self preservation. I can only imagine that those who liked this show do because the dead sister's ghost occasionally appears at seemingly random intervals to, in a sugary voice and with vapid expression, repeat phrases about the importance of family. That does not an entire series make. How about some plot, dialogue, or acting please?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish for more","review":"Watched this series years ago sadly a second season was not made. Warning the shows are out of order. Easy to find the correct order and watch it that way.That is the only negative. After watching this you will never hear the Andy Griffith whistle in the same way. Amazing acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic TV Series...","review":"We love it! Gary Cole does a superb job as Lucas Buck, with a fine ensemble cast backing him up.

Some of the most critical moments to the series' theme and character development are just completely inaccessible. Is there ANYONE who's purchased a set who hasn't had this problem?As for the series, well, \\"American Gothic\\" was probably one of the most intelligent portrayals of the battle of good vs evil ever developed for the small screen... Unforgettable performances by Buck and Caleb. Witty, moody, smart, engaging... it's pretty rare to find a series this good on television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed but better than nothing","review":"While I am thrilled that this series has finally been released, I am appalled at the horrible quality of the DVDs. My third DVD, which contains the final episodes as well as the unaired episodes, is virtually unwatchable. It skips and freezes in most of the episodes and so far I've been unable to come up with a \\"fix.\\" I would gladly spend more money on a better quality recording if it were available!

Never forgot about it though because it was that great of a show. Shaun Cassidy really should be proud of this one and I hope he reads this review and gets inspired to do another one or somehow just put things together as Gothic in Temple is Alive and Well. This was a Christmas Gift for my husband but of course we all watched it and more than once. The quality of this DVD was excellent and it was a very smart purchase that I made. Sure am glad that it was available."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those shows that Deserves a Movie","review":"Originally purchased this set for my mother-in-law for Christmas and started watching it with her and fell in love with it. Gary Cole's portrayle of Sheriff Buck is truly one of those overlooked great evil characters of our time. I cant' recommend this enough to anyone interested in supernatural / thriller shows.

This had the effect of bringing what little action there was to a grinding halt.Much of the information was only tangentially relevant to the story; for example, the main character sits his young protege down and tells him all about the Molly Maguires - thirteen pages of infodump.

If you're simply looking for a good story, look no further than _Fermat's Enigma_. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry","review":"The history of the solution to the theorem is a history not only of mathematics, but of politics, art, and literature--the small book is an epic that spans from the ancient Egyptians, across deserts and oceans--it's characters are painters, musicians, revolutionaries and poets--It may be that what some artists (da Vinci, Dante, James Joyce, Charles Wright, Jorie Graham) and some physicists have suspected all along is true--there is a nexus--a unified field where mathematics, art, poetry, science, geology, astronomy not only *meet* but *become* one another.If its true, and various experiments, theorems, books, and poems are the clues to that place, then I guess this theorem is one clue--this book is another--"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This book is very readable, if for no other reason than to see a characterization of people who hunger for knowledge and are willing to go as far as necessary to satisfy that desire. It is not very clear from the book, but the man who proved the theorem (Andrew Wiles) invented lots of new, good math in his quest to solve this problem, and that is astounding in itself. What's impressive (of the book) is the way that it made math interesting. (Just on the strength of the storytelling ability of the author, I've purchased another of his books about Quantum Cryptography and not been disappointed.) This is also a book that you'll want to read a second (or third) time to make sure that you didn't miss any parts of the argument.Of course most of us won't understand the mathematics *all the way through* this book, but there are references to help anyone understand what he might wish to, for his personal enrichment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rekindling your interest in Mathematical proofing","review":"This is a highly intellectual piece of work in which any layman who has lost touched with high school Mathematics would not find it difficult to comprehend.It is quite fascinating to read some interesting stories of other mathematicians who are directly and indirectly involved in solving the Fermat's Last Theorem. Simon Singh's insights and ability to relate Mathematics from the Ancient Greece to the present day developments have given me a deep appreciation on the evolution of math within a nutshell.Let me assure those who may find it tough to savour the beauty of Mathematics - This book will definitely dispelled such a misgiving. In fact, this book has rekindled my interest in re-examine Mathematics in different light and angle.Go for it.

Singh masterfully, clearly, interestingly escorts us through thousands of years of number theory. The author profiles Andrew Wiles, the man who worked out the proof of Fermat's last theorem over seven years, saw a flaw in his own proof, then resolved it. The story also introduces us to the Pythagoreans, Femat, the fiery Galois, Tamiyama and Shimura and many others. Several appendices illustrate mathematical truths, but the book's greatest value is its enthusiasm and approachability. Deserves any number of major prizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping, well-written tale","review":"I have read a number of books in this genre, and this is the best. It is a fascinating story of the solving of a world-renowned mathematical puzzle. It is also fascinating in the stories of the myriad personalities of the mathmeticians involved through the centuries. It culminates in the story of Wiles, whose success can be partially (and gloriously) attributed to his refusal to follow the conventional means of scientific discovery. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really gripping!","review":"I have never read a book about mathematics that was gripping like a criminal story. But this really is!

Unfortunately, the latter is by far the better book. Although the CODE BOOK manages to cover both the personal and the quantitative side of the recent revolutions in cryptography, FERMAT'S ENIGMA does not attempt to break into the actual mathematical proofs at all. The result feels like one of those NBC human interest stories that take up airtime from the Olympic Games. The essence is in the math, but we hear instead about the innovators' daily lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not informative","review":"This book presents a lot of facts not related to math, but did not explain well the math used in the original solution, and how different solutions differ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mathematics at its finest","review":"I know what you are thinking... a book about mathematics and its practitioners is probably as exciting as watching paint dry. But you would be wrong in this assumption. Simon Singh does a masterful job of describing the history of mathematics as an obsession, profession, and scholarly endeavor. Along with the quest by mathematicians to find a proof for the paradoxical equation known as Fermat's Last Theorem, the author gives fantastic information regarding math philosophy and the practical uses of theoretical mathematics (such as decoding messages by the Nazis in WWII).I was so impressed with this book that I am attempting to do everything I can to get people to give it a look. Lets face it a book about the history of a search for a mathematical proof is not exactly Tom Clancy material.... but I urge everyone to give this book a chance it is EXCELLENT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"History & drama","review":"It is hard to imagine that a book on a mathematician could translate into a dramatic story but this book does so. Along with a wonderful history of the evolution of math, Singh sets up the modern day story of one of histories great mathematicians and how the stress of solving this problem almost broke him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nobel Failure","review":"Simon Singh sets out to convey the drama, excitement and genuine suspense surrounding the solving of one of the greatest problems in math - the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. Singh's challenge is in both conveying the historical significance of the problem, and in boiling down complex math for those, like me, who are not particularly knowledgeable in math. Sadly, Singh fails in both counts. FERMAT'S ENIGMA moves slowly through the history of number theory, while leaving the meaning math's meaning impregnable. Although this book is short, after a while I was wondering what the use was in going on. I suspect that those who know more about math than I could enjoy this book. Sadly, I could not - it was just over my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much math, not enough personality.","review":"The book reviews the mathematics associated with Fermats Enigma, but did not tell nearly enough about the mathematicians particularly Andrew Wiles and his search to solve the Enigma. At times, I felt as if I were reading a math book, or a somewhat dry book on the history of mathematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"As dramatic as it could be","review":"Mr. Singh certainly does his best to make Fermat's problem accessible and the search to prove it compelling. But unfortunately, as the mathematics get more abstract, the layman reader gets further and further from any sense of why this problem is important and what its solution could mean. One has to admire Andrew Wiles for his intellect and his tenacity, and the book certainly demonstrates that mathematics has its share of tragic heroes. I have to conclude, though, that the plot summary is more interesting than the book. It was a good idea, but there wasn't quite enough material for successful execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of breed!","review":"I read this just before reading Dava Sobel's \\"Longitude\\", and the difference could not be more startling. Both are enjoyable enough reads (and both were read on transatlantic flights!), but Singh's book supplies the technical detail needed to make it a really worthwhile exercise. I have an engineering degree (and therefore little \\"pure maths\\"), but Singh's layman's approach works well. Nice to see a populist book which doesn't shirk its responsibility to detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book made me want to know more about math","review":"This is not a math book, but a book which tells a story about math and mathematicians. It is thought provoking and entertaining. It is written in a clear and concise manner and is not hard to follow.

I encountered this problem for the first time when I was 15 in a local Math journal in New Delhi, but never paid too much attention to it. It was the early part of the year 1992 and Andrew Wiles' proof was not yet known. But today I dont feel bad unable to solve the problem because the list of people who failed to prove this problem is astonishingly illustrious. The book is an emotional rollercoaster beautifully woven in the fabric of the hardships, frustrations, romance and genius of some of the best brains to ever live on this earth. The character of Andrew Wiles is beautifully portrayed and one cannot but fall in love with this mathematician. All in all, this book is a classic and definitely a must read for everyone, even for a person with no background in Mathematics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"Okay, he might deviate a little from the subjuct at times, but Simon has still turned out a masterpiece, of which you don't need to know alot of math to understand.Simon has done an amazing thing when he wrote this book.

The best part about it, was it is about the history of math, more than about math itself. You don't need to understand any math at all to understand and enjoy this book. It starts out with a brief history of Fermat's equation, then goes back to the Pythagorean times. I learned more about Pythagoras reading this book, than I did in the 16 years of math I took in school! It was fascinating to hear about the times, and how math was viewed as a religion, the pythagoreans were persecuted, etc. It moves slowly up to modern times, explaining various steps to prove/disprove Fermat's last theorem. Finally, it tells the story of Andrew Wiles: his obsession, his discovery, his fall, and his ultimate triumph.This was a great book. Don't let the subject matter fool you. It isn't dense at all; give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear math explanations for English majors!","review":"I must first confess that higher math utterly escapes me (I got C-/D+ grades in college math), so I approached this book with some trepidation.To my surprise, it turned out to be the first book on mathematics *which I could actually grasp*. Singh offers lucid, intelligible-to-the-layman explanations of the mathematical principles, techniques, methodologies, personalities, history, and problem-solving blind alleys involved in solving this centuries-old math problem. This is a mathematical detective story, and absolutely fascinating even to non-mathematicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Think Calculus Is Difficult, Read This Baby","review":"A mind boggling trip into the world of number theory and the path that Andrew Wiles incessantly followed for EIGHT whole years in order to solve a 360 year old puzzle: There are no solutions to Pythagora's theorem for powers higher than 2! Sounds simple? Wait until you see the demonstration.However, one does not have to understand elliptical equations, modular forms, the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture, or Kolyvagin-Flach method to enjoy this captivating exploration of superior mathematics.

I nearly cried when I finished the book, I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt like doing some work after reading this.","review":"And seeing as my work is math, that's a compliment to the book. It's a reminder to all of us who want to be individuals that ending up in the gutter is not inevitable.As for the book itself, it has several good anecdotes which I hadn't heard of before, even if Singh tends to include more than one for simply its own sake.

Beginning in Ancient Greece, Singh takes us on a quick journey through mathmatical history, with brief stops at the French Revolution, Post-WWII Japan, and more. The book culminates with the story of Andrew Wiles's brilliant and troubled breakthrough. Very little math knowledge is needed to enjoy this book; in fact, there wasn't ENOUGH math to satisfy me.

The stories of the people behind the Theorem were fantastically written and well worth my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Mathematical Saga","review":"Singh and Lynch have successfully presented one of the most abstract subjects in a simple to understand language. For those who put down a Maths book by looking at the complex equations: Fear Not, this one does not go too deep into equations and relies more on plain English to convey the point. I think that Appendixes could have been a bit more descriptive. Overall it was a fun read. I highly recommend this one for Mathematics appetite of Not-So-Mathematical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, but not casual reading","review":"Simon Singh makes difficult topics readable, although not necessarily totally understandable. This comment applies to Fermat's Enigma. The bulk of the book concerns the history of number theory and here it is truly outstanding. The description of the final solution was Jabberwocky to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful writing style and very readable","review":"This book assumes the reader knows nothing about mathematics and walks the reader through some reasonably complicated mathematical properties and history to make the subject quite enjoyable.

I first saw it based on the BBC programme and then had to read more about it. Although more about maths than just Fermat and it's most recent victor, it offers a lesson in humility and perserverence. A book highly recommended to anyone who appreciates the hidden and often intangible world of maths."},{"rating":"2","title":"It inspired me so much that I returned to my math studies!","review":"One complaint I've had to my professors is the lack of historical background for the sciences. After thousands of years of development math had come to a dramatic complexity one forgets its humble beginnings. This book has inspired me a lot not to forget the importance of the human interaction in search of a goal and the motivation behind it. For the non-mathematicians this book is not technical at all and incredibly enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and Full of Suspense","review":"This required reading for my History of Mathematics class was anything but a chore. Singh keeps the reader wanting more at the end of each chapter. The descriptions and examples of the mathematical concepts were written so that a person without a mathematics education could learn and understand them. The powerful story behind the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem is told along with many sub-stories: the tragic Tanijama-Shimura story, the brilliant youngster Galois, Euler's story, and many others. Without realizing it the reader gains much knowledge of history and mathematics history.It is a true love story of the passion Andrew Wiles possessed in his desire to solve the greatest math problem ever. For 350 years some of the greatest mathematicians had tried to solve the problem and they all failed. This book tells their stories along with the drama that surrounded them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story","review":"This is the story and the history of the world longest standing math problem. There were some problems in my calculus classes that I just gave up on after 20 mins. This problem has people giving up on it for 350 years. Fermat's last theorem is simple and elegant and it stumped dudes with stratosphereic IQs for centuries. This book starts with a good history of number theory, starting in ancient Greece and progresses up to Andrew Wiles, the guy who finally crack the problem. It is kind of funny, the problem could be written on a bar napkin. The proof ended up being 130 pages long and involed almost all of the newest mathematical developments of the 20th century. It is a great book, there are so many interesting characters, I really enjoyed it. It isn't technical and certainly doesn't require a math degree to understand. It was a fun little book, and it a fast read. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight for mathematicians and non-mathematicians alike","review":"Singh's account of the conquest of Fermat's Last Theorem goes far beyond just the history of Andrew Wiles's sucessful proof. The story begins all the way back in the time of Pythagoras, and Singh tells it in an informative and entertaining style.You need very little knowledge of math to understand this book. What little you do need, Singh tells you lucidly and without patronizing his readers. The book is full of human-interest stories from the history of mathematics (and yes, there are many!), so the book is certainly not for mathematicians only.It's remarkable that Singh can discuss the activities of research-level mathematicians in such an easily-readable book, but he has done it. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Find yourself sipping tea, while reading this one","review":"For me, mathematics was fun and challenging during the university years. After that, I've practised little, except starting a calculator on my computer.Being a backgrounder for Fermat's last theorem, reading this book fired off a new branch of interest in number theory for me.Fermat's relatively easy problem (at least to formulate), wasn't published with a solution, which either proved that Fermat was a genius, lazy or just saying \\"ha-ha, I know something you don't\\". The book suggests a combination of them.Weaving together an interesting history of mathematics (with great mathematicians as Euler, Hilbert and Godel) as well as the work of Andrew Wiles who've devoted a great deal of his life to try to solve this theorem, you'll read this book from start to end in no time.If you'd like to get inspired in math, try this one, and then head off into \\"Godel, Escher, Bach: an eternal golden braid.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite","review":"This is a non-mathematical mathematics book regarding one of my favorite puzzles in math, FLT, and is probably one of the best that describes the chronic events of this 365-year enigma.

Traces of Stokowski's creativity can be found in the orchestration, making the full Cincinnati palette out of what was originally a dry piano piece. Also surprising is an extended treatment on Disk 2 of the melody/rhythm of a song loved/hated throughout this planet as Ravel's Bolero. Albeniz wrote his notes down first and the differences are fascinating; am I the only one to catch this? The sound is not far-out, contrary to what could have a been a technologically screwier London Phase 4 treatment suggested by label hype, although this Telarc will not explode your subwoofer. Playing time is 82 min, only a few more than many orchestral Telarcs on 1 disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workout Fun!","review":"I love this game!

In my opinion it's a step backward. When i turned it on, the first thing i was reminded of is the konamix. The setup is more like the original instead of like the arcade (which ddr max and ddr max 2 follow decently). It has some of the favorite songs with a few good new ones as well, but the songs that you start off with aren't as fun as I had hoped. It takes awhile to unlock a lot of the good songs, but it still is ddr so it is worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Kids","review":"Ok, I admit it...I'm 31.

Being a total newbie to DDR this suits me just fine.There is one thing I wish they'd change. I don't like when you end game mode or fail, you get sent all the way back to the beginning. Why not just let it go to \\"retry or quit\\" instead of having to wait and wait and wait while it loads? Also, the workout mode is a little confusing to figure out.

I won't ever make that mistake again. The writing is deeply, deeply terrible. The character's actions are completely at odds with the way they are described - the battle-hardened Lukien, whose life is war weeps every time a minor character dies - and we are constantly told, not shown, how we should be perceiving characters. If you have an extremely high tolerance for Terry Goodkind's worst, most pedantic writing you could conceivably enjoy this book. If you're looking for an intricately plotted, well-written work of epic scale to rival George R. R. Martin or Raymond E. Feist...look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I bought this book based upon the positive reviews. I am an avid reader and for the first time ever I returned a book based upon poor quality and even worse writing/story development.The main focus of the story revolves around the actions of Cassandra and Lukien, two of the most shallow and selfish characters I've come across. I couldn't find anything redeemable about either. Yet, Akeela, who is quite admirable in the beginning, changes everything (and loses his own sanity) based upon these worthless individuals. Is the message that beauty or physical strength are more important than all other personal traits combined? Frankly, the story made me nauseous.Do yourself a favor- don't waste the money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grim and meandering tale","review":"I don't have too much to say about this story.

Constantly being told everything completely kills this novel. Three characters prepare for the most arduous journey of their lives to Ganjor and then Jador (the nation where no one has been and no one knows), and instead of showing us a harrowing trip...they just wind up at their destination. Then we are told it was a really tough journey, but they made it.The character's actions/thoughts/dialogue do not match up. We have someone scream then suddenly stare blankly into a wine glass.GRRRRR....thoroughly disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good.","review":"There are a lot of negative comments about this book - it being an overused plot, using characters that are not rich and bein just plain boring. Let me expel these myths - the characters in this book are as good as in any book and as well developed with as many if not more internal issues than actual people. This book is not boring and is full intricate details and strange, mystic characters. I will admit that this plot was an overused one - seemingly for the first part (300 pages) to be a Camelot type story, but after part 1 the book is original and fascinating. This is a definate, solid read for any fantasy or military history fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"An author worthy of attention!!","review":"Read his trilogy before reading this work. Good Arthurian retelling, with Akeela more realistically responding to being cuckholded. Two of the main characters seem to be extensions of characters from the first trilogy. Akeela=Emperor Biagio and Trager is definitely a more developed admiral Nicabar. Marco is a good fantasist, a cut above such authors as Goodkind, Jordan and the present day Raymond Feist, but he's no George R.R.

The first part of hte book is a huge rip off of the Arthurian legend. i felt like i was reading The Once and Future King all over again. Akeela/Arthur, Lukien/Lancelot, Cassandra/Guenevere. Prized knight falls in loves with new king's queen. queen loves him back. blah blah blah. Its slightly different but the characters seem to have no static traits and their actions are totally unpredictable and out of character. its interesting to read about Gilwyn and theres a few good parts but overall its pretty stupid. the only reason im still reading it is because I can't leave a book unfinished. this makes Terry Goodkind look like a good author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I purchased this book for an amazingly low price, with the promise of quick shipping.

Take nothing for granted in this novel. Environments and times change - and with these changes come the wonderful plot twists that make Mr. Marco's books so interesting.As with his other books, the plot moves very fast - he covers a lot of ground in this novel. However, Mr. Marco also has a wonderful sense as to when it's time to slow down and use his wonderful imagery to further immerse you into his world.I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

From simple, self-working tricks, to slick card handling, to magic \\"gimmicks\\" you can make or buy, you'll find everything you need to put together a fine performance. It covers coin magic, card tricks, mentalism, and classic hustles like the 3 card monte.This book shows you how to do lots of the fundamentals (french drop, finger palm, double lift, undercuts, breaks, injogs, etc.) and gives you some nice routines to perform using these techniques.

The other two had more of a fight babe effect than an actual movie about a femal boxer. The acting and script is much better in this film as well. The boxing, however, is not quite there in all three movies though. Moves were kinda sloppy with all the dropped hands and rabbit punches. Someone definitely needs to train these girls more if they want to see more like legitimate boxers on the silver screen. But as a dramatic movie, Girlfight wins in the entertainment factor. Well, as some said, it does get weak towards the end of the movie. I was kinda left bewildered as to what direction they were trying to go at the end so I was left a bit unsatisfied. But I think the first 3/4 of the movie is strong enough to entertain someone that they'd still like to see movie despite the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast forward not fast enough","review":"utter boredom. the fighting was more like lovers enjoying a passionate scramble.

Glad I did. One of the best movies I've seen. The director knows how to create atmosphere which is a story in itself. With one exception, I have never seen any of the actors before (I don't go to the movies much) but they certainly held my attention. No car chases, gunfights, or nudity (for a change) but this film will stick in your mind. Again, one of the best films I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn . . .","review":"I really wanted to like this movie. I heard lots of good reviews about it and expected nothing but good.10 minutes into the movie, I could see that Michell Rodriquez was a pretty girl, but not a great actress. She acts and sounds like your average schmo on the street who's reading a script in monotone.The story itself could've been edited. Sometimes I completely lapsed out, it was so slow. ANd how predictable. OF course Diana was gonna meet a good-looking fellow boxer, fall in love with him, then when a big fight in the end.A movie about an angry girl who does good is an interesting idea, but sorry to say, Karyn Kusama did not try hard enough.I'm Asian, but that doesn't mean I'm going to lie and say I think Karyn made a good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughts on this book","review":"Somewhat disappointed, not a guide for the collector.

The sauce is now more homogenized and bland to the point that I will no longer shell out the premium price for a product that is no better then sauces selling for $2 a bottle. It is sad that the company has cut corners in the way that they have (perhaps they have expanded production and are using a new supplier).

It has its faults, but overall its not a bad appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great value!","review":"I paid $5.99 and think it was a fabulous buy! It is a little smaller than most slow cookers - but the perfect size for our family. Also, because the heating elements are on the sides instead of the bottom, it does get hot. But since there's really no need to touch the sides while it's on, that's no big deal. I do wish it had a power indicator. That said, I LOVE that it doesn't take up too much room on the counter and is completely devoid of hokey decoration. We had Coq au Vin last night, and today we're cooking lamb with olive oil, lemon, garlic, rosemary and potatoes. The house smells like heaven! I'm hoping to buy several more at this price for gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook. Cook. Ssssssssizzle!","review":"Steam heat moistening bird carcass makes dinner for 3 carnivorous human animals.

As an adult, I do believe that each human being deserve the freedom to choose his/her partner. But for kids as young as those at elementary schools, this book brings no educational value but disturbs and poisons their minds when they don't even know what the love and the marriage is. I got this book from my local public library, and I regretted so much that I did not pre-screen it. To be warned, this book is not suitable for elementary school kids as the book suggested. I hate the author's intent to bring debatable sex issues in the adult world to the pure and innocent lives of young children!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diversity = Man + Woman, Not King & King!","review":"This book teaches kids the worst aspects of sex discrimination. The king says 'I've never cared much for princesses', marginalizing women and making it seem like it's macho to exclude women. Then the king rejects all kinds of women because of superficial physical characteristics. To top it off, the king selects another man as his 'prince' and then they kiss at the end.By definition, homosexuality separates men and women. It will NEVER allow gender diversity or equality in the name of 'love'. Why do we want to be teaching kids that love is about excluding and separating people simply because they are a different gender?\\"Separate is not equal!\\"One man, one woman is uniquely inclusive gender diversity and equality. Let's keep it that way! Let's not turn back the clock 50 years when same-race orientation (racism) was fashionable and separated blacks and whites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gay Propaganda","review":"This book aims at infiltrating young minds and indoctrinating children into the gay agenda. The story actively promotes homosexuality, with the purpose of steering children towards a gay lifestyle choice. This book represents gay propaganda at its most insidious. Don't believe a word of the fatally flawed rhetoric of the gay agenda, which amounts to a pack of lies dressed up in academic and politically correct fluff and nonsense. Keep your kids away from this book, and keep this book out of school and public libraries."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"This is the best book I have seen for broaching the idea of being gay at a young age, and I have looked at a number of them. On top of that, just from a story-telling perspective, it's a good story with good language and vocabulary (which is important to me as an SLP). I am gay, and I just bought this book for my baby-niece-to-be (who also has a gay uncle). Because it's written like a fairy tale, it's a nice, natural way of teaching about it... Just like anything else in life!

I like to go barefoot mostly so had built up a lot of callous. I have yet to get to the bottom of it. It looked like a good idea but was so wimpy I could get the same results by gently brushing a nail file against my foot. And if you apply enough pressure to actually get some skin removal going the motor stops. I turned it off and tried manually sanding with it but still not too effective. I can at least say it gave me an idea. I went into the garage and got a power hand-held sander and some 120 grit paper. After 20 min they are smooth but not perfect. I'd use coarser paper next time, but my skin is really thick. It makes your feet and legs tingly afterwards, which feels kind of refreshing, like minty soda water, or a mojito, but it works. I'd never go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk!","review":"I bought this Item and with shipping it was just under $20.

I personally don't enjoy Hicks because he makes me gut-laugh until tears are in my eyes. What I think is Bill's true strength is coming up with comedy is that he always struck me as someone who couldn't do anything else. When I hear his CD's I don't hear someone up there who just jumps into their routine by saying \\"so....black people\\" or what have you. He seems like someone who genuinely has something to get across, and isn't just trying to be funny. He's trying to make people see. See what? I don't even think he knew what, but it was there nonetheless..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying Saucer Tour","review":"This is an album of one of Hicks' sets in it's entirety and shows how he carried on in the face of a lack lustre audience and with heckling. It isn't necessarily the best place to start if you're new to Hicks. I'd say it's more for die hard fans who want something extra. Parts of it are uncomfortable to listen to and yet it is compelling the whole way through. A worthy addition to Hicks' catalogue, but not the best example of his unique and outstanding comedy.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Hicks concert","review":"Why is this the best of all his CDs? Well, I have all of his CDs and I will tell you why. Hicks interacts with the crowd. At first it is Hicks wondering why so few seem to be getting his act, then it is Hicks berating the crowd. The interaction is just what the concert needs to put over the top. I have never laughed more at a Hicks concert. Yes, some of the material I had heard before, obviously. I don't know any other comedian that does not have repeated jokes and takes. The beauty with Hicks was that he could expand on the same joke.

I feel like the film poked fun at people who are blind, and made it sound like some un-livable curse. Besides that, the whole idea of the procedure to make the blind main character see again is not believable; when he first \\"sees\\", he says he can see white and black, and a square shape. He's been blind his entire life! He wouldn't know what he was seeing at all! Let alone what colors or shapes he's seeing!I think his desire for a relationship was believable and realistic, but again, I think the women he dated were written into the story to poke fun more than anything, and the result was not in the least bit funny. His relationship with the Indian woman from the clinic was honest and believable, but I think her family problems were distracting from the main character's story, and that angle wasn't very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable comedy","review":"Blind Dating is a suprisingly touching comedy about a young man wanting to be appreciated for who he is.

I've never seen her use a cane, and although she's got a guide dog, the dog is more of a pet. Sometimes, it's hard to think that she's blind. Pine makes it seem as if he really is blind.Pine did a wonderful job as Danny, and his good looks and impossibly blue eyes make me like him even more.I'm a sucker for romance and a pretty face, and although this movie is not the best, the acting itself makes Blind Dating worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind Dating","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie.

Two tracks have vocals, \\"...See the Light\\" with Laika and \\"Blues in the Night\\" by Jeffery Smith.The liner notes are extensive (10 pages) with pictures. Bolling explains how he was influenced by this music; listening to it on 78's while the Allies liberated Europe, not realizing that one day he would be conducting the same music.If you have other Claude Bolling CDs, you'll find this one somewhat different and demonstrates his versatility.Though this CD is out of print, I was able to get it new from an Amazon reseller for less than $[...] including shipping.

I do wish I could find out about more info then just from the 1960s onward and would like to see the author try one pre 1960s.

They're flooded with technical fault reports.The \\"fixes\\" often include suggestions to roll back drivers, turning off graphics features (!), reformatting the PC (!!) etc. I've personally made numerous configuration changes, on a well above spec machine, and the game still crashes at clearly defined points, making the game unplayable.The game simply does not run on all machines above the required minimum spec."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game ever","review":"I saw some of the older posts that complained about Caesar 4 not working very well when the game first came out. I have a 2010 Acer desktop and this game works like a dream.

Me and my wife are both history majors, and this is the first video game i have been able to get her interested in. Cheers Tilted Mill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicating what had been simply brilliant","review":"As a fan of Caesar III I was VERY disappointed with this game. The only noticeable improvement from Caesar III was a slight tweak to the graphics. Short of that, everything else is downhill. The central flaw of this new installment is that the designers overly complicated things. Each building has a different size, each sector requires a different type of citizen and nothing can be easily monitored. To someone who enjoys planning a large city beforehand, Caesar IV is a nightmare. Example: adding throughout the map rugged terrain where nothing can be built turns the map into a very small building area, limiting what can and can't be built. Perhaps if I had not played Caesar III before I would be able to rate Caesar IV as decent, but as a follow-up, it does not live up to expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor execution","review":"This one turned out badly and I hate to say I bought it. Buggy worse than normal, it is a rough game. The fact that another patch is not yet available is terrible. The support site blames your system or card but offers no practical solutions. Too bad. I trusted PC Gamer's review and it is the first time they let me down but they have adapted more of a partnership with the game companies now and a liberal grading program that passes more stinkers. Do not buy this game...even when working it is not but a bargain bin game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caesar IV...the Decline of the Empire","review":"Having been a huge fan of the Caesar franchise, I was dying to see what new features the newest offering, Caesar IV, had in store. Unfortunately, all I found was an incredibly clunky UI that did not allow for any semblance of gameplay whatsoever. Navigating the screen is incredibly frustrating as the UI seems to be 14 steps behind where the mouse is. For example, place the cursor on the map edge and nothing happens for about 45 seconds, then the point of view jerks radically to some unknown place. Hovering over icons do produce a tip, but clicking on them doesn't seem to have any effect. With all of this, it is impossible to zero on any map point and forget about placing objects where you want them.With a computer that more than exceeds the recommended requirements of the game, I am very much suprised that a game this unmanageable exists.I guess it's back to Caesar III for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Subject","review":"I wouldt recommend any sierra games because they are basically the same, you always have to fight to keep you city going and the graphics are lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"I can't rate the game really, because I'm afraid to buy it.

The gameplay is basically unchanged. This game seems to be almost identical to Caesar III excepting a few different resources and such. The clunky menuing system always seems to be in the way. You never seem to be able to zoom out far enough. Poor manual and online help detailing how many factories are needed for various camps. PopTop did a similar disservice to Railroad Tycoon II, reducing functionality and gameplay to achieve 3D graphics.

Then they stop buying all together. Other cities will not buy any finished goods. Very frustrating.

It was a lot easier to place roads and buildings in Caesar III. It was also easier to move around the map. One good thing is that there is a lot more variety of things to grow, manufacture and sell, though it makes managing things harder, but that's okay. One thing I don't like is that you need a trade port or depot for each city that you trade with, if there are four cities that you can trade with and they are all water routes, you need four ports, and they take up a lot of room.I'm sure that I will enjoy it more once I get used to everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caesar IV is great","review":"Yes, this game does require a demanding set of hardware, but in these days it's actually fairly cheap to get good hardware and well worth it for many reasons.

I like Caesar 4 a lot but it lacks the fun and the pun of the aforementioned games. Zeus had jokes and one could slowly build the city from one campaign to the other. Also, one could click on the characters and hear great dialogues. All that is missing.I do not know but games like Zeus and Age of Mythology are best games ever.

Instead of dragging me a few feet, the harness turned her body so she was facing me, all without any real strain on me or the leash. My dog was a little confused the first couple times it happened, but now she knows that if she pulls she's going to end up facing the opposite direction.

She always try to roll around on the grass area and try to paw her way out of it. When I put this Easy Walk Harness on her, it takes a while to really get the correct position as there are quite a number of adjustments to do. Amazingly, she doesn't even try to walk in front of me when she's on the Easy Walk Harness. I do think that she feels more comfortable wearing the harness than the leader.

We bought a medium based on the girth size, and maybe we should have gotten a small. But this would still not solve the problem of the right buckle that is so close to the leg.

They know when they go on that they can't pull on their leashes and no longer even try. I will say that they rub under the arms if they are used for an extended period of time, but I seem to mind that more than the dogs. It is great for training and great for walking with multiple dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good walk!","review":"I have a \\"puller\\". My dog thinks she is the leader, and is always trying to be in front, pulling on the leash. It's frustrating, and something I've been working on for over a year. I got her a Gentle Leader collar which helped with the pulling (if she pulled ahead it turned her nose and head) but she would shake her head and paw at her face whenever I put it on her, and would stop during the walk to rub her face on the ground. I was concerned that this chest harness would make her even a stronger puller, having the all the pulling power on her chest and not choking her at the neck. To my pleasant surprise, she heeled wonderfully with this Easy Walk Harness, and a slight tug when she pulled ahead brought her right back to my side. She doesn't seem to mind this harness, the only \\"problem\\" was when the leash got slack her front paw would step over the leash. But just the fact that she was walking with a slack leash is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kept secret","review":"I have no idea why more people don't have these harnesses. I live in a city where everyone has a dog, most seem to be somewhat poorly behaved on their leashes. Our pup was no exception. We tried obedience school, etc. but he was just a puller. Fist time out on this leash and our lives have changed. We actually enjoy our walks now. I will say it is a little tricky to get the right fit at first, but we got it down now. There is helpful fitting info and a video on the manufacturers website. For reference we have a 25lb boston terrier and the small/medium is a perfect fit. We originally purchased the medium but returned it because it was a little too big. If you have a puller, don't hesitate, add it to your cart ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"It took only three days of wear for this piece of junk to break.

Look elsewhere if you plan on actually using this thing on anything over 20 pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it were more durable","review":"I have a 45 pound puppy who is all muscle and loves to pull. He pulled so hard on a regular collar and a martingale collar that he would end up gasping and coughing. This harness instantly helped more than I expected. It didn't teach him to walk nicely without the harness though so we're still working on that.My only complaint is durability. I left it on him in the car for 10min and he destroyed it. He's never chewed through a leash so I was surprised. The nylon webbing is not as heavy duty as I would have expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"The harness does help, but does not prevent dog pulling. You do not feel the pulling as much but my dog still pulls on the leash and tries to be ahead of me, he still does not \\"heal\\" at all.

As soon as she wants to run forward the harness prevents her to do so without me having to do anything at all, very impressive.FYI: I bought the large size for when my girl becomes an adult, but fits her perfectly right now with some minor adjustments :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't prevent pulling","review":"This didn't stop my dog from pulling, tugging like it says.

For a few days it worked really well. However, the adjustments on the front of the harness will not stay adjusted. It becomes loose and ineffective. The leash also rubs on the dog's leg. After about a week, I noticed hair loss on the outside of the dog's leg. Fortunately, that's all that occurred. If I'd used it any longer, there would be sores on her leg, too.I hate that it didn't work for my dog. Now, we're back with the Martingale collar and leash. She was doing pretty well with it most of the time. However, now it seems we are starting all over again with the training after using the harness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Harness","review":"This harness was a little to large for my dog even though I ordered the size that was recommended.

I was so excited at the prospect of a walk with out the possibility of getting yanked off my feet I threw caution to the wind. My dogs are both 42lbs a Blue Heeler and a Scottie mix they are extremely active and strong and love to run, I prefer to walk. After adjusting the harness according to the instructions we went for an hour walk. I thought they worked great however when we returned home I discovered they both had been rubbed bloody under the armpits and the Scotty mix on top of his back he has very thick fur so I was amazed. I made covers for the straps with faux sheepskin and after their wounds healed I tried again it's working but I wish I had paid attention to the other review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great harness for dogs who pull","review":"My dog always pull when I walk him, even after trying to teach him not to do so. Before I bought this harness, we had a regular collar, and he would choke himself on it basically, but still pulled. I felt horrible, so I got this harness. It really does work. It helps with the pulling, and just one tug is enough to make him stop.The only thing is, he once managed to chew through it while it was ON HIM. And once he managed to slip out of it when my dad walked him. I dont know how those incidents are even possible since it is a snug fit, but they did.But it is a great product and will help with pulling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best harness but good for training","review":"This is not the easiest harness to use. It doesn't stay on my dog too well. I use it under his regular harness or I put on a sweater on my dog so that the easy walk harness won't come off. I plan to use the easy walk harness short-term until my dog learns to walk with me instead of pulling ahead of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vet says changes gait, bad design","review":"Our vet saw this on the dog and strongly recommended that we stop using it. She said it's putting pressure on tendons, changing the dog's gait and will eventually cause problems. It is not as easy to use as other harnesses and it definitely does not discourage her pulling behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product!","review":"These are a good idea, but they just don't work. I got two of the same size (based on chest measurements) for for my 80lb and 50lb dogs. I was unable to adjust either of them to fit accurately. On one dog the breast piece was too loose and got in the way of her legs. On the other dog the girth piece would not go back far enough and caused pretty serious scrapes and burns in his armpits. They would work a lot better if they were like a regular harness with this tightening feature in the front, but they have no support or neck attachment so they just don't work. I returned them and got Haltis instead. I later learned that Halti makes a harness almost the same as these, but is has a neck strap! I am sure they work much better than this one based on how great the Haltis are compared to other halter brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harness","review":"Really like this versus walking dog with collar leash or back harness leash.

She would pull until she half choked herself to death. One of the staff at our doggie day care loaned us an Easy Walk harness to try with our dog. Miraculous is all I can say! Instant success! Our pup immediately learned that \\"pulling\\" gets her absolutely no where. The concept of the harness is perfect. As the dog attempts to go forward, if she pulls too hard, it turns her body backwards which is counter-productive in her mind. Therefore, she immediately stopped pulling and learned that she can only continue forward if she doesn't pull. It does nothing to harm her in any way! If it did, I absolutely would not use it!! The harness simply by way of leverage and movement sends a very clear message. \\"If you want to go forward, you can't pull\\"! If you pull, you will go back to where you just came from. Whoever thought of this harness is brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worn out in 3 days","review":"it is not strong enough for my GSD.

A little confusing to put on, but other than that, no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuitable for running","review":"My dog and I run between three and six miles a day. This harness would tear him apart if I used it! I just received it, and after putting it on him realized that I had made a mistake in ordering it.

She pulls a lot which makes it difficult to walk. For a number of years, we used the \\"muzzle\\" style Gentle Leader, which goes around the dog's snout. It successfully prevented her from pulling, but she hated it. She always spent most of the walk trying to get it off by pawing at it, rubbing on the back of our knees, etc. Finding this harness version is so much better! It helps with the pulling, and it doesn't bug her at all to wear it. Its easy to put on, and we know she can't slip it off and get free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Excellent leash. Works as described.

He is a pretty well behaved 9 month old but loves to say hi to other dogs and animals.This is far superior to using a choke collar as it doesn't pull at the dogs airway and neck. They also aren't motivated to pull against it because they get spun around rather than a collar they can lean to creating a game like tug of war while they are on the leash.It was a little hard to get the right fit at first because he likes to keep his head to the ground sniffing but its working well now that we adjusted it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Excellent, except for one thing..","review":"This product works very well on my small sized yellow lab. We had been previously using the gentle leader but wanted another product since the leader tended to inhibit her breathing a bit since to be effective it needed wrapped around her snout. The easy walk harness works and prevents pulling just as well! The only problem I found was that the straps going beneath her arm pits tends to rub and gave her a sore on one side that would bleed after our jogs.Fast forward to a month or so later and she no longer gets sores from this product. I'm not sure if it's because she has grown accustomed to it, pulls less, or I have adjusted it to fit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is questionable","review":"The harness works well. My extra-large dog stopped pulling immediately making walks more enjoyable for both of us.

For safety we will be using a combo harness/martingale collar and two leashes.Update: Nope, even with the inescapable collar this harness is just no good. Even mild pulling/jumping when she is excited and trying to get at a squirrel etc. results in the harness coming right off.

Just hope your dog likes it because it was really simple for them to loosen it up and take it off. And just a note, it was 2 different breeds that did it.UPDATE: I have none of these left.

I did try one of the anti-pull leashes from this same brand and found they worked much better. They have an attachment that goes around the puppy's nose and kind of turns her around when she pulls.

That said, the one quick walk we took to check the fit changed our dog's behavior immediately! The product seems to be great quality and we are looking forward to figuring out how to replace it. I guess that is the one downfall about purchasing on Amazon versus an in-person retailer - you have to pay to get the correct size if it's incorrect.This guy must be made really as an x-large - which is great for people with truly large dogs like male Danes/Mastiffs, Irish Wolfhounds, etc. I guess we are used to buying an x-large in everything else bc they aren't really \\"that\\" large?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!

The leash hooks at the dog's chest, which means it CONSTANTLY gets caught behind one of or both of the dog's front legs. If the dog is in front of you, walking at a normal pace, you have to constantly hold the leash up and/or lay it across the dog's back so it doesn't get caught in the dog's legs. If it's a smaller dog, the metal clip part of the leash bangs against its legs making it walk sideways. Any time one of my clients buys one of these harnesses, I put it on upside down -- so the leash clips on the dog's back and I'm able to comfortably walk the dog without these problems. I don't request that they change back to the old harness, but they usually do so on their own when they discover how difficult it is to walk their dogs while using this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"webDogTrainer.com review","review":"As a dog trainer and for my own dog, I love the gentle leader products!!

She absolutely would not accept a gentle leader, so this was suggested as an alternative. PetCo and PetSmart don't stock this size, so I ordered it from Amazon.Poor little Jessie - one walk, and it rubbed under her front legs raw. After she heeled, I made a fleece pad for it to try to stop the rubbing. Despite the fleece, she was still red under her legs (the area I would consider an \\"armpit\\" if she was a human) after a walk. Needless to say, we gave up at that point.I wish there was an altenative to a gentle leader to help her walk better on a leash, but this definitely is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"My dog has a hard time pulling with this harness and it does what I want. The only thing I don't like is that you have to keep tightening the loops. For some reason they don't hold very well. It won't come off him accidentally, but it will loosen up. Its constructed in a way so it won't easily pop off over his head, but I would like the clasps to stay tight once they are in place where I like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for my Dog","review":"I bought this for my 50 LB Doberman/pitbull. Right away he was much easier to walk with. A lot of the time he'll walk with a loose leash. It doesn't hurt the dog at all, just sorta pulls on his chest and legs if he tries to get too far away. Much better than a regular collar. I was afraid he'd end up chewing on it, but he doesn't try at all. I leave it on him most of the time. When I take it off, he tries to put his head back in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous difference in walking, just needed a cover","review":"We absolutely love this harness. We have a belgian tervuren (sheepdog) who is strong and very alert, and isn't fond of bicycles, motorcyles or buses. He walks fine unless one of these happens by, which he then tries to lunge at. He will also sometimes be so distracted with a smell, he'll forget to stop on the extendo lead.Plus - stops him dead without hurting him at all.Minus - started rubbing his long hair off. Not good for a show dog. We are buying Strap Wraps - I figure they should work just like the fleece we used to cover horse halters with. Assuming that works, it's fabulous.We never had a problem with the harness coming off. I frankly don't see how that can happen if it is adjusted correctly.

Well, let me say this-- it's amazing...he's like a new dog!But first, I do have to mention that on fluffier dogs this harness is VERY difficult to get on. In order for it to fit properly it has to be very snug, this is not easy to do when there is so much fur in the way. His fur kept getting caught in the clasp and it took me about 20 minutes of struggling to get it on. At that point I thought to myself, unless this is the most amazing collar in the world, I am sending it back.Well--I'm not sending it back. After two tries he completely stopped trying to pull. Walking him was actually enjoyable! To really test him out I took him to a pet store, typically his #1 pulling zone. I also got the gentle leader which he does not like at all, he wouldn't walk and kept rolling around trying to pull it off.

The side straps were constantly digginer into her armpits, and I was worries she would get irritation so I decided to return the product.I hate to give a bad review as I'm sure the product works great for bigger dogs, but for those of use with petite furry friends I'd look elsewhere for a harness that fits better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for dogs low to the ground!!!!","review":"I had to return 2 of these harnesses (and got dinged a 20% restocking fee from this seller - on top of the cost of shipping both ways). This harness does not work with all dogs. Both my dogs fit the \\"girth measurement\\" but the loop where the leash attaches drags on the ground. My two dogs were able to walk out of the thing and kept getting their front legs tangled up. Also there is one dimension where the harness can't be adjusted so you might find, as I did, that the girth measurement is correct, but it still is too big for your dog. The description should have warned the owners of \\"short\\" dogs that this would not be a good choice.If you want to try this out on your dog, buy it from a dealer who will refund ALL the purchase price without a 20% restocking fee.

He is about 60lbs, which is 20 lbs lighter than our last dobie, but he the strongest dog I've ever owned. The harness worked great for him for the first week or so and then I started to notice it was rubbing his chest. It just seemed like his fur was getting thin, so I didn't worry too much about it. Then my partner took him on a long all day hike and he didn't complain but at the end of the day his chest was rubbed completely raw. It scabbed over the next few days and we're back to being pulled around by him at the other end of a choke collar until he heals. Beyond that, I'm looking for another brand of harness that won't hurt my pup.I would only recommend this harness for a dog who pulls a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy walk??","review":"This harness was far from easy walk for me and my dog. I have a almost 100 pound year old pup and as we walk this harness pulls on his front legs at his shoulders. The leash being in front kept getting tangled in between his front legs as well. My dog has a deep barrel chest and there was hardly enough harness to go under his chest and way to much across his back. We bought the extra large because of his enormous size but it is not sized right for the deep barrel chested dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit well, chafed under front legs","review":"As some people mentioned, the fit did not work for my dog. I have a small Beagle and she had grown out of her small puppy harness which was this same model (which seemed to work fine). I purchased the next size up and it fit well in terms of size and through my experience with the previous harness, it was mounted properly on her. As I took her on our usual jog, I noticed her legs didn't have a full range of motion. I immediately shortened our jog as I was concerned with the harness. We got home and I noticed the harness and completely chafed her skin raw under her front legs. This may fit better on your dog but it did not fit well on my Beagle.

I tried this harness after another dog owner told me she'd used it on her Lab and claimed that \\"it was like walking a totally new dog\\".It seemed to work for the first week or so (it wasn't \\"walking a totally new dog\\" though, he still tried pulling and was being a pain). After that, he must have figured out some way of getting around it, because he started pulling again. I checked to see if it had loosened, and it hadn't.When walking on a loose lead, this harness causes the leash to jump up and down violently, which gets very annoying for the walker.Lastly, one has basically zero control over the dog when using this harness. My dog managed to knock me over by cutting in front of me. If I had been using a collar, I could have prevented it.So, basically, I can't say I really recommend it. I'm not very satisfied with it and considering returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premier Easy Walk Harness","review":"Premier Easy Walk Harness is a great concept, but beware of the belly strap and it's connections which will rub off the fur from the dog's \\"arm pit\\" area, causing the dog to bleed.

He is 3 and was given to us a year ago by some lovely people who could not keep him. He was a bit wild but we broke most of his bad habits, except the leash. We tried, and abandoned, choke chains because he would gag himself to the point I thought he was going to injure his throat. This lead worked on him right away. It was literally like magic. He caught on right away that pulling did not result in moving forward and since that's all dogs want to do, it worked like a charm. The more often I walk him, the easier it gets and since the leash makes walking him easier, he gets walked more often. A wonderful scenario. I do have a problem with the fit of the belly leash, it doesn't seem quite right. I would definetly suggest a Large size for the German Shepard even though the height/weight suggestions they offered me suggested a Medium/Large for my dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works","review":"Our new rescue is the type of dog that pulls and pulls when on leash that after 5 minutes she has almost choked herself out. In two weeks we had a regular collar, a Kong soft padded collar, a Puppia mesh harness, and then finally found success with the Easy Walk Harness.It really works great, my Shar-Pei mix immediately stopped pulling.

The harness also pulls them off balance if they try to stray or pull more than they should.GREAT GREAT buy, now walks are calm and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!,","review":"I was hesitant on purchasing a harness, but wish I would have bought this sooner.

I attach the leash to the harness and collar just in case the harness would come off. I don't know why I waited so long to order a harness, I guess I was hoping that he would just stop pulling one day. I can't wait for other members of my family to walk him. (they never could before).

Great harness that has two connection clips for attaching or removing the harness depending on how you'd like to work it. The harness slips easily over your pets head and can be attached without removing your pets neck/tag collar. We bought a new one after 4 years of constant daily use, the nylon harness material wore out rather than any of the buckles/clips or hardware.

In fact, I could no longer walk him as he pulled too hard for me, so my hubby's been on walking duty. We bought this in hopes that it would stop the pulling and the horrible choking sound our dog made when walked with regular leash and collar. It stopped the choking and wheezing sounds, which makes for a better walking experience, and the pulling lessened a great deal. Regular harnesses that attach the leash on the back don't work on our dog since he just does the pulling all over again. The only downside was the girth fit him perfectly, but his chest across the front is so wide that a large will probably be a better fit. I do, however, have to order another one since he chewed through it in a moment of lax supervision. :) Other than that, it's an excellent product for our husky. It makes walking more enjoyable with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wonders!","review":"This harness has absolutely worked wonders for my dog.

It's perfect for all the outdoor activities we do together, it keeps him and I safe, and puts my mind at ease when others are walking him.

Labrador","review":"I've been through all different types of walking collars for our Labrador and still seem to get pulled even with a prong collar (though that was the only collar, until now, that I could use to walk him). As soon as I saw this and it's glorious reviews, I knew I'd have to give it a try. I got it today, immediately fit it to my dog (X-Large size was perfect) and took him for a stroll. The entire walk, he never pulled, he stayed by my left side and I hardly held my leash--it was heavenly! I'll never go back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly it didn't work - and then he ate it!","review":"I've had the other easy walk head harness so I thought this would help with the lunging and jumping. Regardless of how I adjusted it, it really didn't work. It just sort of pulled to the side. But it was easy to put on and the pup seemed comfortable enough. That is until he was annoyed at being hooked up at our lake cabin for TWO MINUTES and ate it off himself while I was inside grabbing a drink. So if your dog is a chewer - never leave him alone with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect harness if you use some common sense","review":"I bought this to walk my 97 lb. Olde English Bulldogge puppy and on the first walk I experienced the same issue that some others have reported - the front clip connection causes the leash to end up under the dogs front legs. So I thought about it for a minute and realized that if I used this harness with a collar and hooked the leash through both it would fix this issue. Guess what? I now have the perfect system for walking a dog. Not exactly rocket science....By connecting the leash to the harness AND the collar it keeps everything at chest level. I used the Rogz Fanbelt collar, which I already had and it works perfectly. No brainer as far as I'm concerned. As far as the other issue that some have reported about irritation under the front legs (armpits) of the dogs, I don't have this issue at all by correctly fitting the harness and using the collar. Overall, this is the best harness for walking a strong dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Walk Harness","review":"It is just ok. It doesn't fit my 11 lb yorkie very well. As she is walking, the adjustable straps loosen and she has stepped out of it a couple of times. I do think if it fit properly, it would effectively keep her from pulling her leash. It is also difficult to put on her."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY!!","review":"I have a husky, who loves to try and hank my arm off. I've tried everything, every training trick in the book, given them time to work too but NONE of them worked. But this harness did the trick. Immediately I noticed a HUGE difference, she barely pulls at all anymore. And I've tried harnesses, head harnesses, slip collars, clicking buttons, treats, walking the opposite direction when she yanks, stopping and making her sit everytime she pulls, nothing worked. But this harness is really amazing, it does it for you, when she pulls it turns her around, so she's pulling on herself and not you, works great I recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile Harness","review":"I loved the wide selection in sizing, which recognizes that dogs are more than small, medium and large. Also, good color selection. Worn with the pull in front, it is an Easy Walk Harness. But it can also be worn with the pull on top, like ordinary harnesses. More durable material would be nice where the strap rubs on the joints. This area frays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Great but...","review":"This product worked just as advertised but it is of very poor quality. I have a 70 pound dog. She pulled twice at the start of the walk and I stopped and gave the leash a tug per instructions. The dog still pulled for a bit but not much. However, I stopped to adjust the harness and noticed the strap was almost completely torn through next to where the hook for the leash was. This was my firt walk with the product. I didn't pull that hard. We hadn't even gone 200 yards from the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"straps don't hold up","review":"I bought two of the easy walk harnesses. After three weeks of use for daily walks the strap on one of the harnesses has completely worn to a thread. It is the strap that attaches to the leash. I only leave these on the dog for walking so there was no chewing, etc. I will be contacting the company. The harness is much better for walking than the traditional lead but getting it on takes two people with my active labs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Harness, Immediate Results","review":"I cant say enough good things about this harness.

It makes walks so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few suggestions to improve a great product","review":"I found the Easy Walk harness truly effective from the start. Just to be sure, after a few walks with Gentle Leader. I tried the standard collar and leash again. The difference is like night and day. Our 7 month old puppy has a different brand of harness also designed to stop pulling. I is barely better than a collar alone.Premier Gentle Leader It is definitely the best harneaa I have found.My suggestions would include one more stabilizing strap (on the back) running from neck to the belly strap to minimize shifting. And turdier connectors. Our English Bull Terrier puppy grabbed the harness purchased for his bigger buddy, a gentle but strong Boxer Shepard mix, with a strong chase instinct. In the time it took to get it away from the puppy, (less than a minute) he had cracked the plastic clasp for the neck strap. Hoping super glues can put it back together.If that doesn't hold I will buy another Easy Leader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made walking a pleasure","review":"I bought the Premier Easy Walk harness for my 1 year-old Pug/Beagle-mix dog who - although he is only 28 pounds - is surprisingly strong, excitable, gets easily distracted, and makes mad dashes for whatever catches his interest. It made walking him hard work and wreaked havoc on my arm. But even on his first walk with the Easy Walk harness it made such a difference! My dog didn't pull, and the slightest tug immediately called his attention back to me. While it made me nervous at first - it looked like he could easily wriggle out of it - as long as it's snug on his body he stays in it and walks by my side. It's really helping with training, especially since I am far less frustrated. It's made walking him a pleasure again."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well, but not for short dogs & tie-outs","review":"The harness goes on very easily and works well. My long-legged Standard stopped pulling quickly. The negatives are that the leash attaches at the chest and hangs down so he was always stepping over it and getting it under him. The second issue is that this harness should only be used for walking him, and not tying him out. When the dog lies down, the chest strap pulls at his shoulders...very uncomfortable after awhile. Take it off at once after the walk. Third issue, if it gets wet, it can rub the shoulders unless adjusted very well.My poodle suffered a neck injury with the \\"Halti\\", so we tried this, and it works for discouraging strong pulling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent harness!","review":"Before we found this harness, our (80 lb) dog would pull on his leash so hard! We never wanted to take him on leashed walks because we couldn't get him to stop pulling. I found this, and thought -- Hey , might as well give a try since nothing else has worked. Well, this thing WORKS! He never ever pulls when he is on this thing. Even if he is excited and wants to get there fast, he never pulls. Thank goodness I found this thing.... now we can enjoy our walks with the dog :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but mine broke","review":"I have gone through two of these harnesses simply because they keep breaking. I have a 7 month old golden mix who would constantly tug while walking. This harness was recommended and while it help significantly, the two I used broke. I tried it for a second time because I had positive results. But the second time was enough. I switched to another brand and thus far I have no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing ever!!!!!","review":"We have an 8 month old yellow lab. He's 91lbs. and still growing. He was always a chore to walk. We had all but given up because he pulled so bad and was sooo stubborn. We tried a pinch collar, with little success. We then tried a check/choke collar with no luck at all. We looked at other types and decided to try this harness and I'm so glad that we did. From the first small correction, he walked with slack in the leash for the first time, the entire walk. No pinching or choking. When he wanted to go a different way or, stop to smell the roses, a gentle tug got him back on track. It actually pulls him off balance a little bit and forces him to keep slack in the leash. He was happy and so were we. He knew what the rules were after only a few steps. It was just our first walk with the harness, but I don't think things will go back to the old way of the dog walking us. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best option out there","review":"I have always used a prong collar for my 1 year old extremely sweet, but large and STRONG pitbull mix. There was no other way I could walk him without getting my arm ripped out of it's socket (especially when he sees a squirrel.) Just walked him for about an hour with this harness, and it works much better than the prong collar. I had very good control of his head and front end. He also adjusted to it very quickly (pretty much instantly.)I've tried many other options, but this is the best by far. I ordered the large, and it fits perfectly at the smallest adjustment (my dog is about the size of a labrador.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"lifesaver...","review":"I love this harness and so does my large breed puppy.

This harness is amazing. It really does instantly make walking your dog easy and pull-free. If you are hesitant because you have tried everything--TRY THIS!

I definitely recommend this product to all dog owners!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Walks are fun again...","review":"We have a 10 month old black lab that is about 70 pounds and walking him was a HUGE chore. We have tried obedience training with the use of a nylon collar and a metal restrictive collar without prongs to try to control his pulling on walks without achieving the desired effect. This harness made an immediate change from the first time we used it. Do not keep your young dog in this harness permanently. We crate our dog at night and when we are not home. On the second night he had determined where to chew on the harness that allowed him to get our of it. Once out it became a big chew toy which he devoured. We are buying another harness today through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION: NOT FOR DOGS WITH SHORT LEGS!","review":"This harness does improve one's control over the dog and minimises that pulling reflex that occurs in most dogs when they feel lead resistance from behind.My huge complaint is that it dosen't work, and is actualy dangerous, for dogs with short legs such as my Corgi, Dachshunts and the likes. I was walking my Cordi near heavy traffic and he slipped through the harness. Thank God he stayed near me!

This harness does not work with short dogs. Both my dogs fit the \\"girth measurement\\" but the loop where the leash attaches drags on the ground. My two dogs were able to walk out of the thing and kept getting their front legs tangled up. Also there is one dimension where the harness can't be adjusted so you might find, as I did, that the girth measurement is correct, but it still is too big for your dog. The description should have warned the owners of \\"short\\" dogs that this would not be a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"We had this on our dog 2 times.

This harness has made that possible. We tried other methods (the kind that goes around the face), but have found those to be non-effective. This one is user friendly and Max (our Dane) does not mind it at all. It makes it such that he does not pull and stays right besides us.Would highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harness Doesn't Stay Put!","review":"I bought this for my Boston Terrier as she is a big puller. The first few times I took her out with it, she seemed a bit confused by the leash in the front and she did pull less. But after she got used to it, the pulling quickly returned. Since the leash attaches in the front and she is walking in front, the leash gets easily tangled. The harness also slips around on her a lot to where it's practically sideways. Adjusting for a tighter fit does not seem to solve the problem, in part because when I adjust the straps they don't stay, but work themselves loose so I will have to stop and readjust on a walk. If the harness stayed put and had a fixed ring for the leash (instead of one that moves a few inches side to side on a loop) it might work. But I would advise against buying this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not as good as the Gentle Leader Head Collar.","review":"My dog is a puller and likes to slip out of her harness. The easy walk works pretty good to stop both. My dog seems to like this harness a lot. The thing is I don't use it. I use the Gentle Leader Head Collar which is the greatest dog collar/harness ever made. The easy walk helps the pulling, but the Gentle Leader Head collar eliminates it. It's a catch 22. Go with the easy walk and still have a bit of pulling, but your dog won't mind wearing it. Now go with the head collar, you won't have pulling but your dog won't be as comfortable (my dog got use to it and now wears it with no problems)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For A High Drive Dog","review":"While im sure this harness works well with some dogs...i found that it had NO effect on our 5 month old GSD , he is 65lb of pulling power whos drive i is VERY strong...if he wants something, he will do what he can to get it. The minute i put this on i regretted it, he pulled more on this harness than on a regular one! It works almost like a agitation collar for bite work...the harder he pulls...the more excited he would get. We resorted to a Prong Collar as i DO NOT like chock chains. He now heels nicely ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I run with my boxer early in the morning and she has always been difficult to control if a rabbit or squirrel runs out or we approach another dog.

My children can take her for a walk in the neighborhood and control her. The change is remarkable. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward sizing","review":"I have two dogs.

I have a boxer/pit mix and even though only 70 lbs/medium size, he is super strong and used to pull when he got very excited (he would leave his \\"heel\\" position). However, this harness really does stop that. I can keep on walking even if he gets excited when he sees another dog. I got the med/large in between size and it fits well (the medium was too small). I highly recommend it for anyone who has a dog that tends to pull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curbed Pulling But Bruised My Pit","review":"This was recommended to me for my rambunctious pitbull who pulls me more than I pull him.

He still wants to be in charge, but it only takes a light tug to bring him back in step.There is a tendency for the front ring to pull a little to the side, however I think I can adjust it to fit a little more snugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog loved too much","review":"The ad says dogs love it!

Works best when combined with training your dog to stop pulling. I previously had the Gentle leader head collar and my dog hated it and frantically tried to pull during our walks plus she figured out how to hold her head and still pull. As mentioned by others there is a issue of chafing with this harness, I simply solved this by sewing a old wash cloth around the belly strap, no more chafing and great control. Overall I am satisfied, I can finally walk my dog and she walks mostly next to me vs dragging me. I would highly recommend this harness."},{"rating":"2","title":"reasonably good, could be better","review":"This harness does help control the pulling. It is not as secure as the standard four point harness that goes over the head and one strap behind each leg.

The four point harness with a martingale type d-ring in the front would be a better design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too small for my Frenchie","review":"Even though there was a picture of a pug on the cover of the small easy walk, it was too small for my puppy frenchie.

Do you hold your dog's leash in front of and below him? If so, this might well be the harness for you! But if you walk behind your dog, and you're at all taller than your dog, then this harness is worthless. Why, why, WHY would you attach the leash in front? Also, the lack of any kind of a cross-strap allows my dog to wiggle out of the harness with extraordinary ease. Plus, all the loops and buckles and what-not make it heavy, uncomfortable and ugly.My dog hates this harness.I hate this harness.Happily for us both, there are much better - and much less expensive - harnesses on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supposed to be a medium that expands to a large,WRONG!","review":"I bought this for my puppy in May and he grew out of it in four months, so now I need a new harness. I won't be buying this brand again! The labeling of this product is a lie. It's not made for a large dog, but that's what they tell you. Seller never responded to my complaint, so they are done too! Plus it doesn't really stop them from pulling; you might as well just use a regular harness. It worked a little when he was younger, but it's a joke now that he's 8 months old.

It seems to work okay if she's not too hyper and if we're just walking, but don't use it for running with your dog unless your dog will run beside you! (And in that case, why use a harness at all?) My dog goes nuts when we run and she pulls me so hard I was hoping this harness would make it so she couldn't pull me and we could just go for a nice easy run. Instead she pulled as hard as she usually would and this harness rubbed holes in her legs! She was screaming and barking (moreso than she usually does from the excitement of running) and I thought it was just from frustration of not being able to pull me but when we came inside I noticed the front of her legs were rubbed raw! I won't be using this harness for running anymore. Unfortunately I don't know what else to try. Also it's really hard to fit this thing to your dog properly. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but doesn't stop pulling or not much","review":"I use it on a small (17 pounds) mixed breed, aka hybrid ;) that was a rescue dog from a shelter, a mix Bishon Friese and poodle, maybe. He's about a year old and I don't think was ever or much on a leash before. This harness was recommended to me by a shelter volunteer as stopping pulling. I find that it helps over having just a collar, but he still pulls. What's particularly a nuisance is that because the loop/D ring is in front, frequently the leash is under his front leg or between his legs, so I have to constantly stop and lift the front leg and re-place the leash. I give the harness a \\"4\\" since it is an improvement over just a collar; it's well-made and attractive. He's very enthusiastic about having it be put on since it means walk, scamper and sniff, sniff, sniff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Endings","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this play.

On New Year's Eve, the world is consumed with terror at the brink of its end, yet there is time for one last celebration, featuring a megastar singer whose music seemingly has the power to predict the future. Getting Near The End is an enthralling and highly recommended science fiction saga that matches the length of a song to the remaining time of the world, and is a true \\"page-turner\\" of interpersonal problems dramatically heightened by a sense of panic that keeps the reader absorbed until the fiery end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of rare jewels!","review":"Do you need a break?

I've had a chance to sample various, Javanese and Balinese gamelan music, and I admit that finding \\"audiophile\\" recordings of these are quite rare. If you love the warm, glowing tones of this music and don't want to hear an excess of live concert noise that seems typical of this genre, buy this CD; I was pleased to find the quality of audio recording so high. Whereas a few tracks are of a fast tempo, most of the songs are of a quiet, pensive mood. Drawing upon the Javanese gamelan tradition and synthesizing their own, Trance Gong (based in the Northwest U.S.) occasionally inserts a wind or string instrument into their compositions. One of the last two tracks is my absolute favorite. I often hit *repeat* on the CD player and leave that song to play all night. It is what dreams are made of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmitigated Listening Pleasure","review":"Quoting from the liner notes: \\"Gamelan Pacifica is a professional ensemble in residence at the Cornish College of Arts in Seattle.

Various choruses (e.g. the Gloria, the Sanctus, etc.) require more shear vocal heft than this one voice per part recording can muster. As a result the sense of grandeur that is so glorious in this great work is unfortunately missing. The other choruses seem to work quite well though.Another problem is that often conductors and singers think that faster is often better and that happens in this recording as well. The Gloria and the Cum Sancto Spiritu are sung so fast that the beauty is lost and rather than hearing a spirited and bouncy chorus that absolutely swings, you hear a race to the finish in an attempt (I suppose) to show how expert the singers are in being able to sing it so fast.I find I prefer a recording with larger forces. Consider the Fasolis which only uses about 25 voices but captures the Mass in all its grandeur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of imaginative play","review":"Got these for my kids because they played with them at a museum recently and couldn't get enough.

If shaped like bricks, they'd be far more enjoyable and practical.Our creative and smart 7-yo and 3-yo have not touched them in months after three days of stacking them and trying hard to balance them on their thin sides.

Regardless of Reeves' racial/ethnic stock, he did a wonderful job in this movie. Actually the half of the movie about the life of Siddharta was fascinating and magnificently filmed. I wish the whole movie were about his life and not the silly search. The music soundtrack by Ryuichi Sakamoto was also superb.Now for the bad: the half of the movie searching for the young Buddha was silly and the acting was poor by the parents of the boy. It did not ring true and was uninteresting. A whole movie about Siddhartha's life would have been much better.That said, the half of the movie with Reeves is worth seeing and savoring, while the other half can be fast-forwarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Gem","review":"Beautifully filmed and acted.Connects the spirituality of Buddhism to the 21st century seamlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually Stunning","review":"You have to remember that this is fiction. With that firmly in mind,it is hard not to enjoy the lush cinematography, and the interesting story about how the Dalai Lama comes back through reincarnation. In this particular situation, three young children are thought to be separate but integral reincarnations of the Dalai Lama. As the story progresses, the life of Siddharta (portrayed by Keanu Reeves) is simplistically revealed prior to his becoming Buddha, and his awakening into Buddha. I like the fact that the movie did not make any attempts to proselytize Buddhism, but instead revealed some of its beliefs and practices. The movie is very entertaining and absorbing; a dream-like fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty Case","review":"I purchased Little Buddha about a month ago.

The acting by Reeves and Isaak are awful, while Bridget Fonda was woefully underutilized. Reeves as Buddha was a severe miscasting. In what could have been a compelling tale of Buddha's journey, it fell flatter than most Reeves films. The lack of emotional connection was apparent and that was part of the final blow, along with the disjointed story lines.The cinematography and scenes were beautiful, but that was the movie's only saving grace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Budda, Little thought","review":"It seems to me that this movie was rushed through production. I feel that this movie could have gone deeper into the truth of Buddism and not lingered on the top of it. I don't understand how the parents of the little boy would just leave him with perfect strangers or let him run off by himself in Bhutan. There seemed to be no point with the fact that the fathers freind died, except that it showed connection between Siddhartha and the boy. In the end of the movie, I didn't understand how the kids ended up watching Siddhartha be temtped under the Bo tree and reach enlightenment. While many of the things shown about Buddism were true, they forgot some main ideas such as the four noble truths and the eight fold path.In all, I feel this movie could have been taken more time on in the making and resulted in a pathetic movie that stretches the reality of our lives"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly stupid","review":"That has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Although the cinematography is wonderful and the retelling of Siddartha's story is, at times, interesting, the part of the film that takes place in modern times is simply awful. The characters are either boring or painfully inconsistent; The boredom of Fonda in this role is surpassed only by the tedium of Chris Isaak. And,from what I could take from the picture, the future Lama has decided to reincarnate himself into three selfish yet English speaking children. What a disappointment, particularly from Bertolucci. I could not believe this was from the man who gave us The Last Emperor."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUDE!

The writing was cliché. Keanu Reeves was terrible, (well when ISN'T he?) The only good part of the movie was the sets and the child actors. The child who played Jesse was alright, the child that played Raj was the best, and the little girl was alright. I would not EVER recommend this movie to anyone.

This film demonstrates another point of view, rather than the myopic view of Christianity and it's \\"Supernatural Being.\\" This is movie is very well done, with a wonderful group of actors, right down to the extras. I HIGHLY recommend this movie to people that think for themselves and question the belief system of which they were programmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transcendent","review":"To treat this movie as a light introduction to Buddhism is to miss completely what it's about. I will leave other reviewers to detail the plot, and tell you only to let the movie transport you to its exquisite ending, where the cinematography and the music of Ryuichi Sakamoto carry a message that is beyond the ability of this reviewer to describe. You have to see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Contrast of Cultures","review":"Little Buddha is really two stories that are intertwined. The main part of the story is about a little boy named Jesse who lives in Seattle with his parents. Buddhist monks believe that he may be the reincarnation of their late teacher. They came to his house and present him with a book about Prince Siddharta.As the movie progresses, there are flashbacks as the book is read to Jesse. It tells the story movie of Prince Siddharta and his journey to enlightenment. Siddharta is played by Keanu Reeves. Try as I might, I had a hard time recognizing Keanu. He was lost in his role -- only to be recognized by his eyes. In this role, he shines.Most of Jesse's story takes place overseas in Bhutan, where he meets the other two children that also may be reincarnations of Llam Dorje. Prince Siddharta's story continues to be intertwined with Jesse's story.\\"Little Buddha\\" will stay with you long after the credits have rolled, and also help you to appreciate the Buddhist religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Format!","review":"I placed an order for the widescreen (2.35:1) vesrion, but the shop sent me a letterbox version.

If you think it was rather uncomfortable setup you would be right, so I thought any other isolating phones would be better than that. Vic Virth proved me wrong. Not only noise isolation in their phones is nowhere as good, but I'm getting headaches after just 10 minutes of use, while I could easily wear muffs for couple of hours with no particular discomfort. They should have put health hazard warning on them. Another thing, I don't know what materials they used, but your ears feel pretty hot pretty quickly, much more so than in any ear muffs I used before.

On the other hand, it seems Vic Firth has gotten cheap on the quality of the actual speakers. The older sets have louder, clearer speakers, however with a headphone amp these new sets work fantastic... even with the loudest of drums. Isolation headphones are a must have for any musician who wants to play along to clear music without destroying their hearing over time, and I haven't seen any other headphones that compare to these in durability, sound, and price.

They are quite good for playing along to songs on drums, but they are a bit quiet.

Both headphones started having sound issues where the right or left side would start to suddenly be static, sound coming in and out. If I were to hold play with the cable going in to the headphone would relieve the issue but when I let it go. It comes back. Like I said this is the second one I bought, same issue. I don't know if there is a way to open up the headphones to see if there are loose wires, but I don't know how to open without breaking.

I also have a pair of beats by dre and they're amazing, not even in the same category as these vic firth headphones. but then again there is a big price difference between the two....just goes to show that you can't get a good pair of headphones at a cheap price. you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"these things suck, they broke after the third time I used themI don't even have a big head, but these are not flexible AT ALL"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing debut novel","review":"After fighting my way through Martin Sketchley's first novel, I can't say I'll be racing to read any of his later offerings. The story definitely showed promise and there were some interesting characters, props and settings but these parts were not woven together into a cohesive whole. The writer spent too long on irrelevant details but then glossed over important material directly relating to the main character's progress and motivations. The reader was expected to simply accept too many key elements that were presented in ways that just didn't make sense. We were told that the protagonist was an elite soldier but very few of his thoughts or actions supported this characterisation and any forward progress he did make seemed more the result of random chance.My advice - don't waste your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"When is it going to get interesting?","review":"How many times can you crash a spaceship on a planet and walk away from the crash, despite not being strapped in?

It did not. The main character is supposed to be an excellent soldier, but he blunders straight ahead without tactics. I like a lot of military science fiction, but the military angle is disappointing. The potential political and personal dramas are also not played out.

Every so often I would try a \\"natural\\" deodorant and every single time I would be disappointed. They looked like regular deodorant, but within a few hours I could smell that they weren't working. I came across this deodorant stone on Amazon was amazed at all of the great reviews. I figured for $6, why not give it a shot? So I did. And I am so glad I did! Yes, you will sweat, but if you apply evenly and thoroughly, you will not stink. It is so refreshing to know something as simple as mineral salt is keeping me odor-free. It's a big relief. So glad I came across this stuff. And other reviewers are right on when they mention dropping it. I have not done so, but I can see how easy it would be. The base is not very big compared to the large size of the stone. It is top heavy, so be careful when applying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy more than one for friends and family","review":"I use this salt stone, just wet and apply...as simple as that.No chemicals and surprisingly no odor from 6am-10pm.

While living in CA I could purchase it locally. But, since moving back to my little rinky-dink home town, I can't find it anywhere. I ordered another manufacturer's product on line several years ago (I actually purchased 2), and it worked great, as always. Then, after about six months, the product I was using started to crumble. I located the second one I had purchased, and it was crumbling as well. I was very disappointed.I pulled out a hand-held (no applicator) version that I'd had for years, and continued to use it until it got too small to handle.I like the Thai Crystal very much. Only time will tell whether I will purchase another one, but I'm hoping it exceeds my expectations.I like the applicator versons better, but if necessary, I'll go back to the stone you hold in your hand - I know it works extremely well, and lasts a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing crystals...","review":"I originally purchased one of these from A health food co-op.

After a week of using the Amazing Thai crystals, I gave up. My smell was horrible. I smelled like someone from Europe that does not use any deodorant, Asia, from all those crazy countries that like the natural barnyard smell. I am so pissed I am writing this review. Why does natural meaning smelling like the packaderm house at the zoo! All you natural smelling people tell me? What am I missing here.

But after the first few days, I could swear it was causing me to sweat randomly in my armpits during the day. It was pretty gross. I started developing slight BO too, which I've never had in my life. I think it depends on the person and how their body reacts to it as to your level of success with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, by a long shot","review":"These crystals do work, but you may notice a bit of a smell at the end of a long day. Not obnoxious, but the way to combat that as some readers have suggested is to do a large area of the underarm repeatedly.The price went up by over $6, shipping is hefty, so at a total of $14 for this item, I am classifying this as a huge rip-off.Walgreens and CVS sell the same deodorant crystals for $5 to $6, so save yourself some money if you are just testing. I bought \\"Naturally Fresh\\" with Aloe Vera and have been using it successfully for almost a year.Don't be fooled by the Thai or any other label. Mineral crystals are all relatively the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Best deodorant I've ever used.

The 'safe to stand next to hot chicks in a crowded elevator zone,' that is. No joke, this product works. Here's the trick though - use some bad-ass soap like Dial antibacterial (white), and scrub your pits like a champ 'til you've annihilated all traces of funk. Then, apply this here salt of Zeus LIBERALLY, like for at least 20 seconds per pit. You do that, Funk Fighters, and you're good to go!Oh yeah, like another reviewer said, don't drop it. Not only is it a sin, but it will shatter, like your dreams of freshness achieved.Disclaimer: Some of you may be genetically predisposed to sweat like a mofo, and no amount of salt is gonna do you justice. If that is your fate, then bite the bullet, and spring for some industrial strength stuff.

It's not an antiperspirant just a deodorant and for that use it excels. The main point here is you're not slathering a plethora of chemicals on an area of your body that allows them to leach into your system. A big plus, it lasts a real lonnnngggg time....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product contains harmful toxins (including Alum)","review":"Yes it works, why? Because it's made of aluminium crystals (or Alum). It's no better health wise than your regular old stick of Degree. The manufacturers cleverly omit an list ingredients on the packaging but if you do your research, you will learn of the aluminium crystal content. Products manufactured overseas have very little health and safety codes so there's no telling what else is in this stick of deodorant. You could well be spreading some serious toxins onto your skin.There are claims that Alum crystals cannot be absorbed into the skin because of there molecular size which is just completely unproven. Molecular makeup changes upon becoming wet(you have to wet this stick to us it).Want better solutions? Take a spray bottle and mix some Bobs Red Mill aluminium free baking soda along with lemon juice under your arms. Or fill a spray bottle with Milk of Magnesia and apple that and you won't have further underarm problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad!","review":"The crystal deodorant worked amazingly for a week or two, but then I started to get stinky very quickly.*sigh* I was so hopeful that a natural deodorant would work for me, but my quest still continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money , did not work for me","review":"This did not work for me at all .

It doesn't advertise itself as the latter and I concur with that description. In my experience, it does perform admirably as a deodorant. However, two and a half months after purchase, I developed rashes under both arms and have had to stop using the product. I had to return to the mainstream products and the rashes went away in two weeks. I am a senior citizen and have never had an allergy in my life so my reaction came as a surprise and a disappointment.

This morning, I played a round of golf in sunny, 75 degree weather, and though it's not as humid as it will get in the summer, should have provided a pretty solid test of the product's usefulness.

While fictional, of course, it had elements of reality in how I imagine people lived in those ancient days, and I wonder why it has fallen from the fleet of annual TV Christmas shows that we are blessed to see each year.

The story teaches morals of using your talents (even if they seem insignificant to you) for the betterment of others instead of moping that you can't do things other folks can do or you don't have things other folks have.The story also includes some great melodies and songs easy for kids to sing... catchy tunes the whole family will adore."},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"I bought this for my grandson.

As a child I remember being very upset by the images of Aaron losing his parents, being kidnapped and almost losing his sheep BaaBaa. The best part of this movie is Aaron playing for baby Jesus and regaining his trust in people again otherwise, make sure you have a box of tissues when viewing this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Christmas Show","review":"I'm an agnostic, and I enjoyed this for the pure entertainment it is. It doesn't feel very Christian to me - really horrific things happen to the kid's parents; he's enslaved by bad guys; death nearly comes to his little lamb. Not a lot of redeeming stuff happening so far. Even that baby in the manger doesn't completely turn the rather righteous bitterness in the kid's heart - we don't really know for sure, do we? I'm old enough to have seen this when it was first broadcast - I always liked it because it actually showed an African King! And a Chinese king, although his voice was kinda silly. If you remember the 1960s, you know folks of color rarely showed up in Christian Christmas holiday specials. If this is Christian propaganda, I must be immune."},{"rating":"1","title":"nostalgia ain't what it used to be","review":"Loved the Christmas TV special \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" as a child, so I thought I'd order it.

Generally a big bore, although the Vienna Choir Boys still inspire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about letting kids see this","review":"It horrified me as a kid. I still can't listen to the song, to this day, some 30 years later. There are several scenes that are just too much for children.

However, I should have paid attention to the negative reviews. Reba may be a good singer and she is. But the material on this CD has got to be some of the worst I have ever heard. The first song nearly made me want to croak and it hardly got better from that point. Even a good singer like Reba cannot make bad material sound good. Reba's voice is good.

Nowadays this is impossible to tell because country has gone to pop!! Reba is a prime instigator of this movement, but in so compromising herself as so many others have noted, she has done herself and her devoted fans (many of whom have been with her since her career started...I know, I'm one of them) a great disservice. With \\"Read My Mind\\" she ventures even more into the pop realm, though not quite as bad as her future releases after this. However, one wishes for a little less pop and more country infused into the proceedings here. The tunes merit little distinction. Only two or three are o.k. but hardly outstanding compared to what she is capable of!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE FULL PRICE.","review":"Reba's music is interesting to listen to but I wouldn't pay full price for any of her music (except her real traditional country stuff). This CD contains some tunes that would have best been left for the pop singers of the day. They aren't for Reba. Tunes like \\"Heart is the Lonely Hunter\\", \\"Everythat that You Want\\" (That's so awful) \\"Why Haven't I Heard From You\\" (a stupid song). Even most of the ballads lack the credibility needed to sustain the listener's interest. I'm glad I got this from Amazon used sellers for just a few nickels and dimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF TALENT","review":"From the mid nineties on, Reba channeled her musical energy into a more contemporary sound. This is just noise as far as I'm concerned. A couple of the cuts are o.k. I like \\"Till You Love Me\\" and \\"Read My Mind\\". \\"She Thinks His Name was John\\" is a fine testament and a good story song. But the rest is just more of her contemporary pop styling with loud noises and that terrible habit she has of extending her phrases into multi-syllables. Someone should tell her that it is annoying to hear her sing like that. She doesn't over-do that on her early stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD IS JUST TERRIBLE!!","review":"From the very first song entitled \\"Everything You Want\\" I knew I was NOT hearing country music. \\"Read My Mind\\" was o.k. but hardly spectacular. The next song \\"I Won't Stand in Line\\" is one of the ugliest and worst songs I've ever heard in my life backed with bad background vocals and poor production. \\"I Wish That I Could Tell You\\" is mediocre. \\"She Thinks His Name Was John\\" about an aids victim is o.k. but not worth buying this CD. \\"Why Haven't I Heard From You\\" with that horrible saxophone is just an excuse for one of Reba's overproduced videos. \\"And Still\\" is the best cut on the Cd, but again, nothing worth raving about compared to other stuff she's done. \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is terrible. \\"I Wouldn't Wanna Be You\\" is trite and banal. \\"Till You Love Me\\" is all right. The problem here is the overproduction and the loud background vocals!! Everything screams!! I think its a terrible CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT REBA!","review":"This CD is one of my favorite albums EVER! Reba sings every song with such conviction and you can hear the emotion in her voice! Songs like \\"And Still\\" and \\"She Thinks His Name Was John\\" are just heartbreaking! Also there are two amazing love songs \\"Till You Love Me\\" and \\"Read My Mind\\"! Not to mention the up tempos, the #1 SMASH \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\\" and of course \\"Why Haven't I Heard From You\\"! Everyone needs this CD! It's also one of Reba's favorite albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reba's BEST","review":"Read My Mind is the best Reba album, EVER! Every song on here is the cut, there is not one song on here that is out of place or not as good, they are all awesome.It starts off with the jazzy Everything You Need, then to the title track Read My Mind which happens to be one of her best songs ever. The album tackles many issues, as McEntire's albums usually do. She Thinks His Name Was John is one of the most powerful songs sung by her, a song adressing AIDS and its impact on those who lose their loved ones to the disease. Other powerful songs include I Wish That I Could Tell You, And Still and others. The album closes with another great song by Reba, Til You Love Me. Beautiful arrangements and vocals make this album, her best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA IS NOT COUNTRY ON THIS CD!!","review":"Reba is not country anymore period!! This CD will prove that. Just listen to the first track which I think is horrible. As a matter of fact I think the whole CD is horrible. Not deserving of Reba's talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, BORING, BONG!!!","review":"Let's gong this one folks. It is one of the worst collections of songs I've ever heard. Most of them need to go into the recycle bin. The arrangements are loud and left my ears going \\"Bong\\"...especially the first song!! The ballads are dull except for \\"Till You Love Me\\". You can forget this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY!!","review":"When I heard the song \\"I WOn't Stand In LIne\\" I thought to myself...neither will I...meaning \\"I Won't Stand In LIne\\" to buy any of this lady's music!! This CD has some of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life like the one above, \\"I Wouldn't Wanna Be You\\", and \\"Everything You Want\\". \\"Why Haven't I Heard From You\\" gets on my last nerve!! There really is not much redeemable about this release. Its got a nice cover with a flattering picture of Reba on the front of it but that's about it!! Read my mind....it stinks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF REBA'S LEAST PALATABLE ALBUMS","review":"As are most of the albums she recorded in the 1990s, this one is subpar, at least by my standards. Such mediocrity is indeed rewarded though by people who like their country music laced with over instrumentation, loud background vocals and gimmickry galore. The songs, well, lets just say that you won't find anything on here which compares to \\"Somebody Should Leave\\" from Reba's \\"My Kind of Country\\" or \\"Have I Got a Deal for You\\" the title track from her 1995 LP. This one went directly to the Used CD place for a trade in on a Patty Loveless CD. There is real country!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CONTEMPORARY STYLINGS ARE NOT REBA","review":"I do like \\"Till You Love Me\\" but it is mediocre when you look at it against the standard she set on her traditional stuff. This album in a whole is a contemporary output for Miss McEntire and this clearly, as this album indicates is NOT her forte!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY TO FULFILL A CONTRACT OBLIGATION","review":"If a CD has ten songs on it and only three or four of those songs (if that) are worth it, then the CD takes up filler time. That is the fact with this hokey Reba release. The first track \\"Everything I Want\\" is, as usual, loud and overproduced. The next \\"Read My Mind\\" is nice but isn't memorable. \\"And Still\\" is a nice ballad too but it doesn't come to mind when I think of Reba's ballads. \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is a gimmicky song and NOT one of my favorites. \\"Till You Love Me\\", the best thing on the CD IS memorable. The melody and lyrics are beautiful. \\"She Thinks His Name Was John\\" is o.k. but again, lacking in production value. \\"I Wouldn't Wanna Be You\\" is one of the worst songs I have ever heard......my mom heard this song playing and to quote her \\"Why do you buy such ugly CDs\\"? \\"Why Haven't I Heard From You\\" is loud, gimmicky and overproduced as are most of Reba's CDs. If you're new to Reba please DO NOT START with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF HER WEAKEST","review":"Only Three SOngs here merit praise. \\"Read My Mind\\", \\"He Thinks His Name Was John\\" and \\"Till You Love Me\\". The rest is just the regular old pop stuff Reba likes to do and what most of her fans like to hear. I am a Reba fan but I like very few of her pop songs. I am a true country fan and when she does it right, its pure magic. This one lacks that pure magic except for the three songs mentioned above. (I hate \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter!>...uggh!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe She Let Her Big Hair Get in the Way","review":"Maybe Reba let her big head (eh, hair) get in the way of her perspective for picking out good material because there is only one good song in the bunch here and that is \\"Til You Love Me\\". You can have the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"YES INDEED, REBA DID IT AGAIN..........","review":"She again released an album of contemporary pop songs that should appeal to the \\"kiddies\\" who like this kind of \\"so called music\\". However, to the serious country music fan, this is an insult to the term \\"country music\\". If Reba wants to appeal to all people then at least include some tunes in there that half way resemble \\"traditional country music\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ye Gads!!!!","review":"Suppose one wants to be the best that they can be in whatever arena of life one happens to be in?? If this is the case for Reba, and if I know that redhead, she desires ONLY the best. Which is why I can't figure out why she recorded such mediocre songs on this project. I sense a downward trend in her music with this release. If she wants to transcend all types of music she's going about it the wrong way. There is absolutely Nothing here to justify my giving it a higher than a one-star review. Didn't like this at all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PIECE OF EVERYONE'S HEART","review":"Reba McEntire touches everyone's heart in one way or another and she proves it in this CD. Reba sings from the heart and her songs pull you in with each story line and her singing is amazing. So get your Kleenex out for this is a very heartfelt album. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read MY mind......It Stinks!!!!","review":"Only die-hard McEntire fans will give her 5 star ratings for work that is nothing but Bubblegum Pop!!! I did like \\"She Thinks His Name Was John\\" and \\"Till You Love Me\\" but the rest of the CD has got to go!! Read MY mind....it Stinks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler SOngs Just to Make an Album","review":"And say that this is one of my least favorite Reba albums. Its too far out there for me that I can't bear to listen to it except for one or two songs. That's not enough to make me like a record. An album should contain more than just \\"filler\\" songs. Most of this album is \\"filler\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY POOR RELEASE FROM REBA","review":"Most of Reba's 90s stuff ventures into the pop mainstream. Doing so compromises what makes Reba so appealing...her down home earthiness. She's much too good to be singing stuff like this. Only one or two songs are worth it but not enough for me to give this CD higher than one star!! Forget this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER \\"MISS\\".................","review":"What attracts me to a song? The melody!! The arrangements here for poor material are even worse! Sadly, most of Reba's 90s material is lackluster because she compromised herself so badly! This was another \\"miss\\" in a long line of \\"misses\\". The only good song on here was \\"Till You Love Me\\"...but One good song a good CD does not make. This one misses the mark on all counts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TREMENDOUSLY OVERRATED","review":"Reba McEntire is so overrated it is ridiculous. Only \\"She Thinks His Name Was John\\" and \\"Till You Love Me\\" are worth it here. The rest of this CD is just filler! Buy her traditional stuff of the 1980s instead or the brilliant \\"For My Broken Heart\\", but forget this mess!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I THINK THIS MIGHT BE REBA'S WORST ALBUM","review":"When Reba was on Mercury she never put out an entirely bad album. There were cuts on them that could indeed have been left out but they weren't all bad. This also holds true to her early MCA releases. But this one....\\"Read My Mind\\" has only ONE good song on it...or maybe two...those being \\"Till You Love Me\\" and \\"He THinks His Name Was John. The rest of it is fluff...and its so bad its unlistenable. I think this may possibly be the worst album she ever put out. I can't listen to any tracks on this except for the two above that I mentioned. That being the case this CD deserves one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ONE IS FORGETTABLE","review":"Reba has certainly done a lot better than this. I only liked \\"Till You Love Me\\" which is a good song and has great arrangement and great production. The most awful song on here is \\"I Won't Stand In Line\\".....loud, boisterous, overproduced and just horrible!! \\"She Thinks His Name Was John\\" is too depressing for me to listen to and is actually bogged down with boredom. \\"Read My Mind\\" could also use some livening up. \\"I Wouldn't Wanna Be You\\" is another bad song. \\"Why Haven't I Heard from You\\" is loud Reba with another excuse to make a bad video!! Bottom line: This one is completely forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on playing stock splits","review":"Most people are ware of stock splits, but how many people know how to play them properly?This book picks up where Wade Cook leaves off in WSMM#1 and WSMM#2-Stock market Miracles.I like the fact that the Nelson's explain NOT to play all stocks just because they are going to exercise a stock split. Rather, they explain how to find the best stocks and trade them successfully.I made and continue to make continous cash flow just by playing splits and rolling stocks.Other books I recommend are WSMM#1 and WSMM#2-Stock MArket Miracles and WSMM #4 and Rolling Stocks.Ignore the naysayer. Obviously he hasn't read ot tried the advice. His loss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"I have to agree with the reviews that found this book to have a LOT of repetition. I agree that everything in the book could have been covered in 25 pages. A large portion of the book is not even spent on stock splits. Although there was some good information it was not specfic to the title. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-standard book","review":"I have read many investment books but this book is just a piece of garbage. Compare this book to a late night commercial on TV where the guys claim that they made $50,000 in less than a week. But in practice people end up loosing money. If profiting from stock split is an effective technique, do you ever think Darlene Nelson will disclose the secret to the public?. I have been testing this strategy for the past five months and I can very well say that this never works...If you guys are want to make money in Wall street, learn from experts like William O'Neil, Martin Sweige, Jim Cramer etc.I bought this book because of excellent review found on this site. Now I am convinced that those reviews were posted by the author or people who work for them.

First, crack authors Hiser and Adelstein instantly soothe frustrated Windows users by showing how easy (and familiar!) Linux can be. Second, they help Linux users at every level acclimate quickly to this best-of-breed GNU/Linux desktop system and its sumptuous harem of applications. Third, the book is written by such savvy Linux and open source veterans that - despite the simple language, step by step instructions and many explicit screenshots - even advanced Linux users and system administrators will find material and new information to hold their interest. In this readers humble opinion: a must-have on the road to Linux Enlightenment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but ...","review":"This is a SF novel with a feminist touch. I like the idea very much: though it' is not really orginal to separae genders and let each go their own way. But the author did not manage to write the story good enough to be intrigued. Even more, I did not fid out, what the story is. What t s aimed at? It has no real ending, i.e. no solution of the plot.It takes a very long start - the author overdoes the world building at the beginning. The middle part is rather good, and then she screws up the end: a very long aftermath. I think, that's because she tried to find a way to put a happy end, though it's a tragedy. The story beter end with Tritch going mad.That would have been logical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tritcheon Hash","review":"I normally love sci-fi stuff, but something about this story just didn't click with me. I struggled through the early chapters, because I just didn't care about Tritcheon as a character. It wasn't until her recon trip to earth, that I stopped having to force myself to finish the chapters, but I still wasn't truly invested in the story. Most books of this length, I will knock out in 1 or 2 days, yet it took me 2 weeks to finish this one. It wasn't awful enough to abandon without finishing, but I won't be re-reading it, ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous read!","review":"Feminist? Yes. Hilarious? Most definitely! I enjoyed this book from \\"cover to cover\\" and couldn't put it down. Who wouldn't love a book where the women leave the men to make a BETTER society, lol. I was so thrilled by this book that I am going to have to look for more Sue Lange because I know I will enjoy any and all books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plutoium Powered Sci-Fi","review":"You don't have to be a feminist to envision this planet for women only, Coney Island or to be thoroughly entertained by Tritcheon Hash's jet-propelled adventures. She had my imagination as revved up as her plutonium powered prototype jet, \\"Stubbo\\". Tritch is a hard as nails flight tester with nerves of steel, but inside lurks the lust of a woman. Her cool exterior melts away when she is assigned to infiltrate Earth, the males-only planet. She reconnects with Bangut, \\"the young male with the apparatus. But that's only the beginning of this well-written sci-fi satire. So buy Tritcheon Hash, sit down with a cup of glop-and-mo, strap yourself in and prepare for a good read.The Junk Lottery"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Girl!","review":"This scifi is so tart, it makes you laugh out loud. Lange has given us a new hero in Tritch. Her attitude combined with her heart make you want to blast forward a thousand years to help her make the universe a better place. The book's characters grow on you as you follow Tritch back to an Earth devastated by wars and the absence of women. A good read for feminists of all ages and genders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science fiction, fast and fun","review":"Read page 86 aloud for one of the author's puns. The book combines all the best elements of a good SF story. A wicked sense of humor combined with a solid story and with great characters. Most importantly, it takes a sideways view of the world(s)which makes me think about this world in a different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every Sandra fan!","review":"A great great CD to pop in and just listen to the whole way through.

Very disappointed in the quality of the care they put into sending their books out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never judge a book by its title!","review":"The book was alright, although lacking the excitement and in depth explanation of other kung fu books. The work did not contain any \\"secrets\\" of Shaolin Temple as the title implies, simply the basic facts and techniques that anyone with any knowledge of Chinese martial arts would know. Not necessarily the greatest book for your martial arts collection, but a semi-interesting read nontheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic without communist meddling","review":"All I can really say is, Smith with this book delivers beautifully on the topic and history of Shao-lin Temple style boxing. It illustrates the central concept of Shao-lin boxing (known as \\"Shao-lin Ch'uan\\") and offers a bit about the temple itself...without the modern communistic interference of the Chinese government. Buy this classic, because if it ever becomes totally unavailable, yet another lovely Chinese cultural treasure will be lost.Also, if this is an area of interest, NEVER miss buying Robert Smith's work. Smith, a true Chinese-trained master of several arts, is also the premier martial arts historian in the West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I bought this book thinking it will help me in my research on the myths of the Shaolin temple's involvement with MA.

Smith's book has to little, to called it a \\"definite\\" guide is misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets of Shaolin Temple Boxing","review":"I have found that many treasures are understated.

In short I think you don't learn much by watching the entire tape, one can summerize the vocabulary and the grammatical rules explained in this tape in just 3 or 4 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Marple Is On the Case","review":"This is a fun movie, the third of four Agatha Christie films from the producers of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. It features Angela Lansbury as Miss Marple, solving a perplexing murder in her tiny English village of St. Mary Mead. A local woman is poisoned, and the suspects are all in a visiting film company that's taken over the village to make a movie about Mary, Queen of Scots, including Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Kim Novak, and Tony Curtis. Along with the mystery, there are great scenes of the two movie actresses (Taylor and Novak) in a nonstop bitch-fest, and a lot of very funny jokes about Hollywood. Look fast and you'll see a very young, unknown Pierce Brosnan as Taylor's leading man in the movie (he doesn't have any lines). But Lansbury is the real treat here, creating a credible and likeable Jane Marple that bears favorable comparison to all the other stars who've played her (Margaret Rutherford, Helen Hayes, Joan Hickson, Geraldine McEwan, etc.).

(On sale for 40.00) After I recieved the guitar I was shocked at the cheap quality. Don't let the nice picture in the advertisement fool you. This thing can barely be tuned properly. I was very disapointed in the guitar itself but the customer service and the shipping was fast and great. I would buy from this seller again assuming a better product. However, I think the regular price should have been advertised as 40.00 and the sale price 5.00. Great customer service. Fast shipping. Poor quality merchandise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar","review":"This guitar is a very attractive piece of wood. But it isn't good for much more than that. I would NOT recommend this actual guitar for pro playing or even around others, as it is extremely difficult to keep it tuned because the neck is poorly constructed. However,the shipping was wonderful and the customer service was excellent, and I would absolutely purchase from this seller many times in the future based on that alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"My friends, DO NOT BUY PLEASE. From far away it looks really nice, but you look at it up close and it is just spray painted, the wood is super horrible quality. As soon as you place your hands it it, scratches will show and the guitar will get easily dented. You won't even be able to tune the guitar. Also, the bridge of the guitar is not even centered. Horrible!!! It is better to wait and spend money on a kit from Yamaha or Fender for double the money. Probably will turn out better that way. It is a toy guitar. You'll know what I mean if you decide to get it. Wood with stickers is all this is.

What I abhor are nonsensical conclusions. This book had potential to be great and fell flat on its face as the coincidences and repetitive descriptors (seriously, if I ever read the words \\"raptor gaze\\" when describing Richard's eyes again it will be too soon) that make me wonder about Terry's ability to mature as he builds experience. At the end of the final conflict, I just felt...cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing series... If you skip this book","review":"My recomendation skip it, catch up in the next book, for the entire story to be have been any good, Goodkind should have shortene it to a few chapters (So much filler and fluff in this volume as to make it easy). Long story short it isn't even told from Richard or Kahlan's point of view..."},{"rating":"1","title":"some things i thought about pillars of creation","review":"The book itself wasn't that badly written. I feel, however, that it was to far from the story of Kahlan and Richard. The story line itself was choppy; I thought it rushed ahead and then slowed down when it didn't need to. These are just things that i thought when i read the book. What disappointed me the most was that the other books were so good and offerred interesting parallels... this one didn't.The two characters were very good. but that doesn't matter because they had little relation to the other stories. The most intersting of characters aren't even in the story; they just come in at the end to save the day. Oh well; i will still pay my [money] on the next book which comes out. as will everyone else who loved the first books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like X-files without Sculley or Mulder","review":"I listened to the audio tape and found myself wishing that the book would end. I did not find Jennsen Rahl particularly interesting and kept hoping that the main characters-Richard and Kahlan would put in an appearance. Needless to say, they did not appear until the book had just about concluded.It would have been more interesting if this book took up where the last one ended (I remember there being some question about Kahlan possibly giving birth to a son who would have a major impact on D'Hara). Oh well,I felt compelled to listen to the entire book because I have read all the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....what happened to the story?","review":"This is one of my favorite fantasy series but I found this book and the last one to be dissapointing. The last one \\"Faith of the Fallen\\" seemed to be only half a story and left a lot unfinished. I was hoping that this one would at least complete all the loose ends from the last book but it did not. It almost seemed like a veerrryyyy long short story. Richard and Kahlan did not come in until the very end and while the storyline with Jennsen and her different view of Richard and the order was somewhat interesting, it seems to me like it could have been condensed so that we could get back to the main story and tie up some of the loose ends from the last book. Personally, I am ready for a conclusion and happy ending in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the main characters ?","review":"Goodkind is a good writer, but this series has been based on the main characters that have been developed in the first 6 books. Those main characters are absent in this book !Richard and Kahlan were hardly in the book at all. None of the themes from the other books were carried over. In fact, there seems to be no continuity. This book is not really part of the series, it should be a standalone book that takes place in another universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book gets bad review","review":"Despite all the bad reviews from other readers, I tried this book and really enjoyed it. It had all the action, suspense and page turning thrills as all the others in this series. Goodkind is an excellent writer and I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Was HORRIBLE!","review":"This book really disapointed me. While the book does give the reader a different perspective, the whole time I was waiting for Richard and Kahlan to come and be the focus. Besides the fact that Goodkind forgot about all the important charachters, nothing in the series plot really changes. Emperor is still trying to takeover the midlands, nothing chamges with Richard, no new developments are made. I hope that the next book returns to the original format, or many of his fans will be extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating read","review":"I've enjoyed reading the Sword of Truth series until now. The sixth book, Faith of the Fallen, was a good read, even though I found the communism / capitalism reflexion extremely lame and unidirectional. When I read a fantasy book, I want to evade in a different world, not get moralized on the vertues of neo-liberalism.To get back to this current review, the graphic violence it contains is totally unecessary. I personnaly do not see the need to have the details about a matricide, for example. The focus on two or three unpalatable new characters misses the target. I stopped reading at about 200 pages, this book is a total waste of time. I believe the Sword of Truth series should have ended one or two books ago. I call it quits for this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"Disappointing to say the least. I read Faith of The Fallen and was extemely impressed. This is the first book I read in the Sword of Truth series. I was so pleased, I read it 3-4 times. It was that good. I didn't even give a second thought of buying Pillar of Creations, I wish I did. The first few chapters, I thought i was readin another book. The story had a bland taste to it since it focused more on dragging out details to the extent of boredom. I mean, I skipped about 10 pages in the swamp chapter(Althea). It usually takes me about 4-5hours to finish a book this size. The whole storyline of love was also empty and non realistic. it can't even be called a cliche since it was so poorly done. i hope Goodkind can refocus his efforts on dealin out some better literature. i kno i'm being a bit cruel but payin for somethin so boring is aggravating."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste....","review":"I have been an avid reader of Terry Goodkind's books. I am truly stunned over how much paper that has been wasted on this particular story! I do not know what he was thinking, but he has lost me in more ways than one. I don't know why he wasted so much time on these two new characters. I didn't buy this book so I could read all about Jennsen and Oba. I bought it so I could read about Richard and Kahlan in the Old World. Yuck! It is not the money that I wasted that makes me so mad. It is the time that I wasted. That is more valuable to me. I am through with this story. It is just too frustrating to hope that Terry will get his act together and tell a story that we would like to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anybody Seen Richard?","review":"Not to say that this wasn't well written, it just wasn't what I expected of the book. I was seriously let down when I discovered that it wasn't a follow up to Faith of the Fallen.Though emotional, I think Mr. Goodkind spent too much time explaining the hatred his sister felt for him, and despite hearing from the various people she meets on her travels that Richard Rahl was a good person, the anger and prejudice stay until the very end of the book.I found that aspect of the story rather tiring, to be honest. It seemed too repetetive for my tastes.If one is not seeking a sequal to Faith of the Fallen, this isn't a bad read. Just don't expect anything spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"The editorial review says it all","review":"Many people have said they don't like this book, but I found it higly enjoyable. Sure, you don't see Richard and Kahlan until the very end, but I was left with the feeling that the next book would tie in very well bringing everything together. If you are a diehard Terry goodkind fan, and, like me, are hesistating to read this book because of all of the bad press you have read, then stop hesitating right this instant. It is well worth the time it will take to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This entire book is filler.","review":"The first thing I have to say is that I'm not the biggest sword of truth fan.. I like wheel of time a lot better. But, after the sixth sword of truth book, I had almost switched--the sixth book was amazing. However, Pillars of Creation is terrible. It completlely excludes the all of the main characters and the characters were what made the series. I wouldn't recommend this book unless your really a diehard fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pillars are crumbling!","review":"This book has to be the worst in the series. I hated Oba, he was a freak with too much power. I couldn't wait for the chapters with him to get over with. He was just such a twisted character. Jensen was okay, not a very exciting character, but better than Oba.I also found this book highly repetitive. It said the same things over, and over, and over. I also was highly relieved when I read \\"Faith of the Fallen\\" (I read this one before it) And was instantly reassured that Terry Goodkind had not lost his mind. And that he was still the same, talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"We can't believe that they went ahead and published it.","review":"WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS:If you're a Goodkind fan-boy, then don't let us distract you. Go out and spend your $10-$20 on this book. If you're empty-headed enough to like it, why, go ahead and buy the eighth book as well. You certainly don't need our permission. But we warn you: this book is badly written, badly edited, and feebly concludes. Even for fans, it's a crushing departure from the--I guess we have to call it this--story arc of previous books and it couldn't possibly stand on its own as a worthwhile novel absent those predecessors that it chooses to ignore.WHY YOU SHOULD PASS:We gave it a 1. It's our worst rating. We reserve 1's for books that make us temporarily regret ever learning to read. If the reader would rather avoid such painful regrets, then trust our review and avoid this book at all costs.READ THE ENTIRE REVIEW AT INCHOATUS.COM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Goodkind has let us down in this last book. There is little or no plot -- certainly no plot developements with regard to Richard, Kahlan or the Order.As you read the book you'll find yourself encountering the same sentences over and over (sometimes just a few pages back). The metaphors are always the same ('He was invicible.' 'She was invicible.' 'I am tired of running.' 'It felt like lightning.'). The characters are very, very naive and one-dimensional. His two new characters, Jensen and Oba contradict themselves constantly thru their actions. It is not a refreshing, entertaining or enjoyable read.Owning this book feels like a ripoff -- first time Ive had this feeling and I've ready many many books.

The characters are not likable or intersting, the plot is weak, and it was only my respect for his past writings that I kept on turning the page. Our beloved characters and reoccuring themes (Wizard Rule #7) are written in a flat and baffoonish manner, they are a punchline, making this book a 500+ page joke. The ending was similar to an ending out of Threes Company or some other cheap comedy in which a lame joke is told, the cheap music starts, and the credits roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo Hoo","review":"I just want to agree with most of the reviewers: this book was certainly not what I expected (...). The fact that the two main characters, Richard and Kahlan, are barely in the book, is indeed disappointing. With the conclusion of Faith of the Fallen, I assumed(obviously incorrectly) that Pillars would be the story of Richard's retaking command of the D'Haran army, as the people of Altar'Raug proved themselves to him. Instead, Pillars was about a young woman we had never heard of and a sadistic, animal killing, \\"oaf\\" named Oba. Also, I was very curious to see what Nicci's role would have been in the fight, now that she had found the answer to the question she was looking for in Faith. Overall, the book was disappointing and I can only hope that the 8th book(the next one) gets back to the fundamentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I just finished reading this book. I was so excited about getting it, especially after reading Faith of the Fallen. In fact, I re-read Faith of the Fallen the weekend before Pillars came out, just so the storyline would be fresh in my mind.Wow, what a disappointment this was. In a 559 page book, Richard didn't show up until page 500. Even then, you have no idea what happened from the end of Faith of the Fallen until he shows up in this one. The cover of Pillars lets you believe that Richard and Kalhan are main characters again. In truth, they are in only a handful of pages.This book is a filler book. Nothing more. (...) It is so disorganized and off of the original story-line that anybody who is a fan of the Sword of Truth series will be ashamed to have purchased this book. I know I am.

I like the SOT series and this was a refreshing book. It was not refreshing because it was new and astonishing, but because for once the bulk of a book was not centering around just Richard and Kahlan. Some call this a way to extend the series, but i call it a prevention against the reader getting bored with the characters and the plot falling into a predictable rhythm.

Shame on them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Mistake","review":"First, I believe the book could have been written in under 200 pages.

I loved the first few books. I enjoyed them, because of the characters.One of the other reviews mentioned a lot packed into the final chapters. I hope this is true. I hope it does not seem good because you have to suffer through the majority of the book to find out about the characters we have come to enjoy.I feel cheated by the author.

After about 100 pages, I found myself flipping forward to try and see when Goodkind would get on with it. Unfortunately, he didn't until the last couple of chapters, and then it was a bit of a forced tie-in.This is more of a side story instead of a continuation of a series, which is disappointing as the description of it makes it sound like the main story line will be continued in this one. If he's going to write a side story, he should at least be honest about it.After the last book, Faith of the Fallen, which I felt was an incredible book, this was a real let down. There were a lot of threads left open at the end of that one which were just ignored and now we have to wait another year to find out what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, but...","review":"Goodkind once again shows us that he is a fantastic writer. We were introduced to two (main) new characters, one of which we have been waiting for since #4, TotW, though she was called Lindie. We got another look at Emperor Jagang's side, from yet another view. All in all, it was a wonderful book.I was expecting, however, (...) that Richard, Kahlan, and co. would be the main characters. Richard enters the scene 59 pgs before the end and is only actually on the scene for less that half that. No POVs from Richard, Kahlan, Zedd, Mord Sith, etc.Again, great book, but I hope to get more with our main protagonists in book 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good....","review":"Just try to pretend the series ended with book six. You're really not missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst books ever professionally published","review":"All of the books in the SOT series leading up to this one are pretty bad, but this one took the cake. I am someone cursed with not giving up on a series once I have started it, but this book was so bad I have dropped the series like a steaming hot squishy dog turd that somehow made it into my hand. From an evil character blowing up a poor living chicken like a balloon to kill it for kicks (what is it with Goodkind and fowl anyway?) to the nobility of goats, and the adventures of a sociopathic rapist/murderer, I just could not take it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relavent to the plot line","review":"This goes on some big sidetangent not related to the story. Really not that worthwhile to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have to...","review":"Now now now...Despite what MANY other people have said, I've enjoyed this series. Well, except for this book. The characters are predictible, annoying, and naive. The characters displayed in this book should be of the age of 13 instead of being in their 20s. Some of it was alright, however. I guess I give it a 1 and a half. However, like Jordan, Terry seems to be making books now as filler between important events. Oh, well. He should just finish it, sheesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment after waiting so long","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. Its almost as if he had a low paid ghost write it for him. I have really enjoyed all the Richard and Kahlan adventures and this book barely included them. If the extreme descriptions of death of innocent people and a snake by a pervert is the best he can do I will never buy anothe book written by him. This book by the way ended up where it should...the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"read the older books for satisfaction","review":"If you're like me and have read all books in the series up till now, I would recommend re-reading Wizards First Rule, and Stone of Tears. No possible way can you read in order WFR, SoT, and then Pillars of Creation. Comparing the best to the worst. But over the last few books the quality has seeped out, almost to where the Pillars of Creation is acceptable. Almost.For all of you(300) that say to us(300,000) \\"get over it, he's introducing new elements. This series used to be beyond greatness. It had wonderfull characters impossible to forget. Chase. Chandalen. Denna. Now Richard, Kahlan, and we the readers need to dust ourselves off from the past few books and remember what it once was. I've never been able to commit myself to a series of books before this. Don't let it wind down like this Terry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did everyone go?","review":"The book it's self was decent enough. As a part of the series it was not only disappointing, it was treason to the original storyline. There were more than enough problems in the world that needed answers but instead he completely drops all the main characters for a new set and only at the VERY end do you get to see the original cast, and only briefly. SO, if you have not read the other books in the series, this is a good book, full of adventure. If you are a fan of the series, you may as well pour salt in your eyes instead of wasting the time to read this. This is a sad day, the seeker is dead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total sidestep","review":"I have read the whole series og Goodkind, and loving it. But in the last book, Pillars of creation, we read almost nothing about the characters we have gotten to know and love. 90% of the book is about two characters who are ultra-stereotypes of good and evil, and the last 100 pages or so is like we have learned to love Goodkind. Sure, the plot crawls forward, but in my view, the characters he has made are so important in this epic saga that one cannot leave them out and still satisfy devoted readers. And the plot itself moves so little that you van actually skip this book and miss little."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it","review":"It took me months of reading bits of it, until I gave up in defeat of ever finish reading this book. It is truly bad. Only one book that I have read is worse than this out of thousands of books. I would rate all of his previous books either a 4 or 5. And it has nothing to do with having Richard there or not. It was simply boring with characters I couldn't give rat's ... for.His next book will be out in a few months, and instead of pre-ordering his hardback books like I have before. I will wait until it is released, so I can read a few pages first. I have simply lost my faith that what he writes will be any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book i have ever tried to read.","review":"i love the sword of truth series but this book was awfull i couldn't even finish it. i have owned this book for 2 years and i can't get even half way through it. it is boring and i cannot believe Terry Goodkind even wrote it. i suggest that you should buy some other book and not waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable characters and tedious plot","review":"The only explanation for this book is that an alien snatched Terry Goodkind and replaced him with an illiterate life form. This is simply a dull, poorly crafted book. The dialogue is infantile and strained, and the plot develops only because the protagonist and antagonist, along with the rest of the characters, are all incredibly dull-witted. Completely without subtlety or craft, Goodkind's worst-ever effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off okay, but.........","review":"Very predictable stuff, here. Yawn.... Very contrived betrayals and the way all the separate characters finally come together in the end is too coincidental.I don't even want to get in to the disappoint of the ending, it's just too sad.I didn't give it one star because I have read books worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor, read anything else!","review":"This book was a big disappointment. I am always on the lookout for a new author and series of science fiction or fantasy. I realize this is the 7th book but a friend said I did not really need to read the other books to follow this one. The naivety of the character Jennson and the evilness of the character Oba are pathetic. If I could give less than one star to this book, I would. Instead of wasting your time with this one, try reading something from Clive Barker (horror), Joe Lansdale (mystery with a twist of humor), or Neil Gaiman (fantasy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuation of a great story","review":"Okay so it may not be as good as some of the others. So what? Terry Brooks continues to shine! I have truly enjoyed reading these books. I'm not disappointed that I plunked down for hardcover either. I'll admit that I was disappointed that Richard or Kahlan were not the main characters but I soon grew to love the new characters. The Pillars of Creation gives us a new look at places we've visited as well as new. We larn that brute force will not always bring victory in war or battle. In the next novel I think that we can all imagine the mischief Jennsen and Richard Rahl will bring for Kahlan, Cara and all the other characters we've grown to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just ridiculous.","review":"Woa... Let me say that I liked the first 4 books of this series, but now Goodkind turned into total [...].This book is the absolute worst book I've seen him write. Unfortuantely, it seems he is just trying to get our money now... This piece of work is turning the entire series into a [...] fight between Communists (Jagang the Just) and Democrats (Richard Rahl). Not only the writer made it look like that, for some unknown reasons he also made Commies much more stupid than D'Harans... [...]? I didnt buy this book to read about political situation 50 years ago... Totally worthless, honestly, look somehwere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"First reviewer","review":"This book is very good if you enjoy childish fantasy novels that lack character depth. The plot is amusingly simple. I think its time for Goodkind to give his novels a rest. I for one am tired of the good samaritan-like characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"End this series - please","review":"The series was extremely strong at the beginning, but has grown weaker with less and less happening of interest as the series continued. Save your money and request Terry Goodkind start another series, even if set in the same world, but totally unrelated to the Rahl's, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't understand","review":"I really don't understand how a man like this could become an author. To begin with, the plot is emensly childish in all of his books so far ( dont ask me why I've read them all). Secondly, his characters are so transparent, unrealistic and uncreative, it makes me doubt that he actually wrote the book without an editor. Every chapter of this book, and all of his books, served only to add to the mound of spontanious rabel that he aimed to serve as a plot. I can say nothing positive about this book. Overal, I really think it is the worst book I've ever read. Please stay away from it, and all books by this author for the sake of your mind"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the few times that I've taken on science fiction.","review":"The way that the Goodkind tells a story is absolutely amazing. I have read very few if any science fiction books but if they all are as engrossing as this book was I might soon find myself hooked. It would have got 5 stars but do to my lack of experience with the genre I only felt comfortable giving out 4 stars. Do not hesitate to read if you have the time, its well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked for more","review":"This is the only fantasy book I own in which the story does not follow the main characters. As I was reading it, I kept on thinking \\"ok, next chapter they'll get to Richard and Kahlan.\\" They don't until almost the very end of the book. This is Goodkind's worst book of the series, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I am a big fan of the Sword of Truth series. This book however was not one of my favorites. Instead of following the old characters you have grown to love he creates totally new ones. Don't get me wrong I like new characters but you can't spend a whole book following them. I bought this book with the hope of reading more about the Sword of Truth and Richards exploits. I was very disapointed to find that this book doesn't follow Richard at all. If I was not loyal to Goodkinds books I would not have even bothered to read the whole book. Yes I thought it was that boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"Until now, Terry Goodkind could be counted on to create an interesting story. This latest addition, however, is frankly unreadable. The plot is plodding and the characters of no interest. Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to complete this book. I can't recall the last time I failed to read a book cover to cover (OK I can...Moby Dick when in high school!). This effort is totally wasted and I hope the author regains his previously demonstrated ability to create. Two thumbs way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read","review":"This book just drags on and on, repeating the same stuff over and over again throughout the entire book. It seemed as though he was trying to turn two or three ideas into an entire book. It became an effort to keep from just putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pillars of Creation","review":"After waiting for the book to be published,I was very disapointed after reading it.The story line was dropped.I hope this is a transitional book to bring in new characters to extend the enjoyment that I had from the first six books..The book only made vauge references to the main characters of the other 6 novels.Who are these people that have been introduced?Terry Goodkind have you lost your way as Robert Jordan has in his many book saga?Please refocus in the next book and reintroduce us to the characters from the first books let them interact with these new people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent and slow","review":"Goodkind has fallen into a trap set by the Keeper (and now shares the fate of his fellow sellout Robert Jordan) and worships the almighty dollar. Just like the last installment in this series, there is perhaps 50 pages of text featuring Richard and Kahlan, the protaganists of the series. Instead, we are left with a slowwwwwly unfolding story of two new characters, neither of whom is \\"gifted\\" and neither of whom is interesting. May Goodkind find the strength and resolve to either resume the storyline or conclude this farce. Tolkien and others had the courage to end their stories without meangingless excursions and tangents. Check this one out of the library if you must and save your dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I looked forward to each installment of this series with great anticipation and was never disappointed. After finishing this book, I am worried that the well has run dry. It is very disturbing when the main characters from the earlier books, COLLECTIVELY, appear in less than 10 percent of the book. Yikes!I am hoping that this book was a necessary interlude to set up the future of the series. If not, it will be the disappointing end of what has been a very good fantasy saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little Richard and Kahlin","review":"This Book was very disappointing almost from the start. I was wanting the continuation of the last 6 books (which were fabulous). Instead I was forced to endure all about two someone's new, whom I could care less about and never did grow to like. It was the next to the last tape before out hero or his wife show up. All in all, just a big let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"shedding light on other characters","review":"Sure, this book might not be 100% about Richard/Kahlan, etc. like the majority of the previous books were, and though I found it odd at first, eventually I came to enjoy the book as thoroughly as I had the others. It was nice to start with \\"new\\" characters for once--getting to know new faces in the series is always interesting. Keeping so many characters balanced and well written is no easy task--yet Goodkind has done it again! ;) A superb book for any die-hard lover of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing [non-] Sequel","review":"This was a grossly inadequate entry in the Sword of Truth series. Goodkind abandoned his main (and most of his minor) characters -- not to mention the entire story-line from Faith of the Fallen --- for what should have been a back-story, not a novel in its own right. I've never seen characters behave so uncharacteristically. What a disappointment. I hope Goodkind redeems himself in Naked Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACK!!!! The last 30 pages were good atleast.....","review":"Well if you wanna book about the main characters in the \\"Sword of truth series\\" you can just skip this one. I don't think you'd miss much if you just went to the next book, when it comes out. I found myself skipping entire pages becase I already knew what was happening, Goodkind was just stretching it out. (Really, really streching it out.) Not to knock Goodkind, i love the rest of his books but this one is my least favorite, I'll even go on to say that it was a bad book. Just my opinion...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pillars of Creation","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Definitely not up to Goodkind's normal standard. A whole book devoted to developing 2 new characters, but left you wondering when the last book was going to be picked up and when the main characters were going to enter the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really tried... ** SPOILERS**","review":"I understand what Goodkind was going for here. I agree with the Pugh review that he was attempting to challenge his fans (of which I am one and still remain...) to see Richard from a unique perspective. But I just couldn't get into it. I think the book would have worked better if Goodkind focused more on Jennsen and never bothered us with Oba. He spent way too much time on Oba who's actions could have been served by anyone from, say, the Sisters of the Dark or even Sebastian. Plus, it was kind of confusing when we're one minute with Richard in the forest, and then - BAM! - we're at the Pillars and the story suddenly comes to and end with no set up.I was disappointed in this portion of what is otherwise a brilliant series. I hope the next book is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is he short on cash???","review":"This has got to be the worst one of the series. All of them up to this one have been very good. He spends almost 400 pages on what amounts to nothing and then the last 150 on characters that the fans care about. Just jump to page 404, chapter 44 and you can get what you want out of the book. You can skip the life histories of Jennsen and Oba which take up the majority of this mind numbing waste of trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing continuation of an excellent series","review":"I started out reading The Pillars of Creation with high expectations, but after the first five chapters, I was deeply troubled by what was occuring. Not only was there little of any literary value in this book, I found it boring, long winded and generally poorly incorporated. A similar task was undertaken in the fifth book (Soul of the Fire) but it was done much better than this one. I must say that I hope Mr. Goodkind returns swiftly to the handful of characters anybody will ever care about in this series and leave extra garbage like this on editing room floor. I sorely wish I could rate this book better based on it's predecessors, but sadly I cannot. It is a sad day indeed......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This is a book that should have been condensed to a few chapters and included in another book, or better yet, left out of the series entirely. It adds no value whatsoever to the series. All I've gotten from this book is a headache from being relentlessly hammered with Goodkind's philosophy. The characters you fell in love with, well they are gone. They are replaced with emotionless shells that parrot the same objectivist line over and over and over again. A simple conversation turns into a sermon. Reading this series leaves me feeling like a revolutionary sent to a political re-education camp. Goodkind has completely defaced a story and characters I had come to love. My disappointment in Goodkind is beyond words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst one in the series (so far)","review":"Nothing happens in this book! I plodded through the first 3/4 of it hoping it was all going to come together at the end like it does in Soul of the Fire... and then it ends in about 2 pages that make no sense at all. This one actually made me long for the sanctimonious political stuff from faith of the fallen, because at least that was somewhat thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite book","review":"A little background:I have become totally engrossed in this series since watching the first episode on tv last year. So far each book has been exciting and so much more in depth and interesting than the tv program and I couldn't wait to turn the page. Except for Pillars of Creation.I tried so hard to like this book but there were times that I would literally scan the pages for anything that may be important to the story later on because it was so uninteresting to me. I just couldn't relate to the characters and I'm not really sure why. The end was a let down and I sure hope that this book will somehow be referenced later in the book series to justify the time I spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 7 Disapointment","review":"I admit this is unfair since I am only half way through. But I may not make it through! I had the same reaction to book seven of the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. I gave up on the series after book seven.Anyway, I find the story line silly and the characters uninteresting. But since it is a cold and rainy day in South Florida I guess I have nothing better to do but to continue reading, even if it is a stuggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't decide if this is the worst book in the series or was it #4???","review":"Books 1,2,and 6 are fantastic. 3&5 are OK in my opinion. This pillars of creation book is just what all the negative reviews said it was...It looks like the author had no clear direction for this book and wondered around trying to introduce \\"interesting\\" new characters. Then with the way the problems all neatly wrap up in the last 60 pages with little understanding to how they got their, it seems evident the author was running out of time before his deadline and just resolved the issues with little build up to how they got their.At least in this book the author didn't make the two lead characters, whom he's impressed us with their intelligence previously, seem so stupid as he had done in book four. This time the stupid plotlines are saved for the other bastard children of Darken Rahl. I'm in too deep to quit the series now, but I gotta hope it gets better again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recomended","review":"This book reminds me nothing of Terry Goodkinds earlier work. I was very dissappointed by every aspect of the book and only finished reading it out of disbelief that it could be so bad. I am a big fan of the sword of truth series, but the book bears no resemblance. Although it seems the novel is supposed to part of the series, I still dont know if it is even the same story.

Keep reading it is worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"I have faithfully read all the Sword of Truth novels and eagerly anticipated new novels by Terry Goodkind. Overall, I enjoy the series even thought it falters at times. However, this book was aweful and painfully predictable. There were no interesting twists, it was completely flat and poorly developed. Although the entire series relies heavily on violence and gore, this one took it to boring extremes. The book could have been interesting but it fails totally."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I have to add mine to the list of negative reviews of The Pillars of Creation. Having become an avid fan of this series, I expected the same powerful command of the language exhibited in prior volumes. Mr. Goodkind is capable of spinning a compelling and intense story. The earlier books in the series kept me awake nights unable to resist turning the page. I had to struggle through this story.Beyond the disappointment of not having my thirst for the main characters quenched, I found the writing was not up to Mr. Goodkind's par. There are entire sentences repeated almost verbatim. There are references made to actions by the characters that have never occurred. Whoever edited this book was asleep at the wheel and drove it off the cliff.My biggest fear is that now I'll wait another two years for news of Richard and Kahlan only to be disappointed again. Terry, take 3 years and really do it well the next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucketh","review":"Goodkind once said in an interview that he kept the story in his head for the Sword of Truth series, not needing an outline to keep track of it. He really ought to rethink that strategy.This book has nothing whatsoever to do with the story started a few years back in Wizard's First Rule. It is a thin, bpring side tale of yet another ... brother of Richard's, who acts just like Drefan did. Gee, I guess Richard was the only child that turned out ok. Duh.What a colossal waste of trees. Save your money so that's not another colossal waste. I will NEVER waste my time on another Terry Goodkind book. The rest of you, who are so disappointed and keep hoping the next one is better--GET HELP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer so good, and maybe not kind","review":"I was disappointed in this new book by Terry Goodkind. I missed the old characters, the humor, the caring between different characters, the magic, and the nobility, or search therefore, in characters. But most of all, I found the sadistic Oba ruined the book for me. I read to be entertained, not to be sickened over and over again by a character who must kill and maim. Yes, there has to be an evil element for good to fight against, but this went beyond what was necessary. And although I kept reading to find out why he had to be that way to help the story, I never found the reason. Next time, I won't instantly buy a new Goodkind book, I will wait and read some reviews. If this is the direction he is taking, I will go another."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I was really looking forward to the next in the Wizards First Rule series.

Nothing in this book moves the story plot along. With entirely new and seemingly unimportant characters being the focus of an entire book it begs the question, \\"Is he just out for money? Because clearly this book has nothing to do with the story.\\" You could summarize the first 1/2 of the book into 4 chapters and move on to the real part of the story.I would recomment skipping it entirely read a summary on wikipedia and move on to the next book that actually has to do with the story and plot.I will now be looking for someone else to read as clearly Goodkind does not cut the butter any longer.on a side note. Can I give this book 0 stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Jordan?","review":"What happened??? After a perfect gem like Faith of the Fallen, Terry comes back with this??? Too long with Jenneson, it was like it was written for a game or something. It reminded me of what Robert Jordan did with Winter's Heart. He left the readers at the gates of Tar Valon in Path of Daggers, then didn't even go there in Winter's Heart. The Pillars of Creation is definitely the worst of the Truth novels. Come on Terry, give us the characters we love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book in hardcover!","review":"It had to happen sooner or later. Goodkind finally followed Rober Jordan's example and started writing books that serve only to lengthen his series. Faith of the Fallen was immensely entertaining, but didn't accomplish much in the way of plot development. This book is absolutely stagnant. The series' two main characters only appear in the last seventy pages. In a 500+ page book, only one chapter met the standard for action and entertainment Goodind's previous works have set. Next time, I'll save my (money) and wait for the paperback. Maybe if all of his fans do the same, Goodkind's friends at Tor will make him trim the pointless filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo! Hiss!","review":"What IS this? IF Goodkind is going to abandon the story he was telling and throw a couple of chapters of Richard and Kahlan in to officially make it a SOT book, how can anyone think this is a continuing series? What a ripoff!These books have really been losing steam since STONE OF TEARS which was the apex of the series at book 2. THe worst was probably Soul of the Fire, until now. The last one, FAITH OF THE FALLEN, had some signs of redemption, though it was a lot of political ranting and raving based on Ayn Rand.

It gives me everything in a fantasy novel that I could ask for. At times, Goodkind makes me drop Jordan to number 2 on my fav list.This book, however, puts Jordan back to number 1. The only reason I got any joy out of it was when I made the ultimate reader crime and started skipping ahead. I'd read a page here, a page there, and then, suddenly - thankfully! - I reached the story where Richard and Kahlan come into play. After that I read it straight through and really enjoyed it. That's the only reason.It seems to me that Goodkind is stretching his story out a little too thin. He needs to focus on the parts of the story that made it so successful in the past - Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd. When he does that, I might be able to keep him from falling further on the list. As it is, he's already crawling behind Jordan, George R.R. Martin, and Tad Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillars of Creation","review":"This in and excellent book.

He must be laughing all the way to the bank, especially when he considers that he even had the temerity to TELL his readers they're stupid and they still gobble up all the offal he sends their way like filet mignon.I suppose the author can at least be praised for so thoroughly and amusingly verifying his own unflattering view of humanity's average intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pillars of Creation","review":"I was disgusted after the first chapter, and the following chapters were barely readable. DON'T READ THIS BOOK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"After getting totally hooked on the main characters and the usual fast pace of Book 6 and most of the previous books, this book was extremely slow going and down right boring. I hated Oba from the beginning and thought his presence was a total waste of time. I did like the new character Jennsen but really wished it would have stayed with Richard and Kahlan and introduced her in some other less time consuming manner. Waiting until the last 50 pages for your favorite characters is a real drag. I should have waited for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh what might've been...","review":"Yep, I'd have to agree with most of the other reviews on here.. I didn't truly care about this character and I was constantly waiting for Richard to appear in at least some form, but, nope.. He's in about 1/20 of the book and even then he doesn't have much to say/do..The ending seems to come out of nowhere, the whole first half of the book is a small journey across D'Hara with few interesting developments and yet the journey to the Old World which should be 5-10 times as far is not even given one page to describe..The ending also had a bunch of holes and didn't really flow with past descriptions of events.. But obviously jennsen was introduced to be a part of the series from now on.. However, she could've been introduced and fully flessed out in less than 500 PAGES!...I read sword of truth to hear about richard and the sword of truth, this book contained very little plot moving events other than jennsen appearing..It's too bad.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Series That Never Ends","review":"I'm not going to jump on either bandwagon here -- I'm not a diehard fan (though I've read them all), and I'm not a huge fan of the digression, either. I borrowed this book, and read it, and was glad I hadn't paid for it.Goodkind seems to suffer from the same disease Robert Jordan does. It's the \\"I'm going to write the series that never ends\\" disease. I don't blame him for wanting to write about someone else -- but Terry just couldn't leave his series alone (probably because of the extra several tens of thousands of copies he'll sell by putting it in the series proper). This story would have been a much better, more interesting book if he had written it \\"next to\\" the storyline, but not interacting in a meaningful way. It was written because he needed to add another major twist to his series to lengthen it another few books. That's just plain annoying.Finish this series, Terry, and let's move on to another incredible world (or storyline) ... Please ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok read, But Richard and kahlan fans beware!","review":"In Terry Goodkind's latest novel we follow the new character of Jensen on her journey of self discovery. Jensen is Richard's half sister and she believes Richard is out to kill her like their murderous father attempted to. Terry Goodkind is an incredible author and while I applaude him for using fantasy as a genre to present his political philosophies at times he climbs a little to high on his soap box. Another major drawback to this book is that Richard and Kahlan, the series main characters occupy less than twenty pages. For true Terry fans the novel can be enjoyable if you are forewarned of the lack of main characters. I still can only give this book two stars because I was not warned of the lack of the original characters and therefore looked forward for over a year to reading about them only to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book in this horrible series","review":"basically, i begin to wonder if Goodkind simply wants to make more money. Seriously. This book managed to forward the overall plot of the books not ONE bit. Not only that, but he creates these \\"null\\" characters that are WORSE than worthless and are completely unlikable. One is a villain that is dumb and the other whines every other page about losing her mother by USING THE SAME SENTENCE! Of all the books, this one showed me the depths of Goodkind's mind. Unfortunately, I would not be able to drown in a pool of water that deep. I personally think that you could likely skip this book and pick up the next one when it comes out and have very few problems. It is that bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terry Goodkind is turning out like Robert Jordan","review":"When I first picked up this series, I couldn't put it down. I would ride the train home from work and almost miss my stop. Now I have to force myself to get through it. I keep buying the books hoping that it will pick up, but I am beginning to doubt it will happen. I fear that Goodkind has taken the same path as Jordan and this series will never come to a satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pillars of creation","review":"He did it again, instead of focusing on the main characters Terry Goodkind, has made me waste 20 dollars on what could and should be a seperate series. This was not a book in the series of the sword of truth, but a side story which could have been handled in a much smaller role."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let-down","review":"I was surprised at how bad this book was. I like Goodkind and I loved the rest of the series, especially Faith of the Fallen. It was a real shock to me, therefore, how disappointing this was. Some of the other reviewers have already mentioned some of the points that the book lacked. Richard and Kahlan were not to be seen until the end, the plot had huge, gaping holes, the book did nothing to carry on the general plot line Goodkind has established in the previous books. Much as I do at the end of a bad movie, I just wanted to get the time I wasted on the book back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprising disappointment","review":"It appears the author attempted to extend the series (and his profits) by devoting an entire book to an uninteresting new character. I have never been more disappointed in Goodkind. I actually returned the book back to the store. It is not one that I even want in my Goodkind collection. On a different note: although I am a great fan of Ayn Rand I've become a bit disappointed in the direction/tone of the series which at times it seems Goodkind is lecturing Objectivism: reason, individualism, freedom, concepts as abstract ideas, rational egoism, etc. No where was this more prevalent than in Faith of the Fallen. I'm pretty surprised that it took me until Book 6 to actually notice it. But Richard is definitely Rand's \\"heroic being\\" in a fantasy context. Not that it's a bad thing only give me more action and less philosphical lecturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Episodic, repetitive and, at times, bad","review":"I will not preface my review with caveats regarding how much I've enjoyed this series. If I'm reviewing book 7, that should be enough to know that I'm a fan. And since I know most of you who are reading this are already \\"in the series\\" I won't say not to buy it, because even if you believed me that the book is pretty awful, you would probably still go out and get it, if only to find out what happens to the characters you've been reading about.Well, you don't really find out anything and this series is looking more like a season of Three's Company: episodic, bad writing, and plots that revolve around miscommunication. Terry has lost me as a reader and, to be honest, he should lose you too. He shouldn't profit from such obvious profiteering. Which is way too bad because the series started out about as strong as one that I can remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story (But What Happened to Richard, Kahlan, and Cara)","review":"All right. This book was great, had an intresting plot, great new characters, AND an intresting perspective of the Old World's beliefs and the way their camp is run. But what I'm shure drove a lot of diehard fans up the wall was the fact that we didn't know what was happening to Richard and his followers! We only got to read about him in the story through the other characters in the story. I, personally, am greatly intreagued as to what has happened to him in the time between the end of \\"Faith of The Fallen\\" and when he saves the guilder from the heart hounds and what he has learned about the Sword of Truth that allowed him to Levitate the Sword to him. I hope that the next book in the series reveals all the details of his adventures"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monolog","review":"There was no development of the characters beyond a couple of people. I would have liked to have seen and heard from the characters from the first set of stories before page 600. Only a few key characters were mentioned at all.This is one of those stories you can skip 10 or 50 pages at a time and you have not missed much. The author stayed with basically a one-person story line the entire book, which was not entertaining. It was mostly monolog (he thought this, she thought that and so on and so on), not much dialog or real action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a side step","review":"this is not the usual story taken in the series, very short compared to his other work and the ending did fall together to easily. i believe this was no meant to be apart of the series but a supplement to the main story line. This book did feel very rushed and probaly the fault of the publisher not his. It is also obvious that this is not going to be the end of the series as stated by other reviewers which seem to believe so, Just because it isnt like harry potter giving you the title of all the books even before it written doesnt mean anything. Further it may not be written to the candle of lord of the rings or the wheel of times but it shines by its own accord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard and Tom and Betty and...Oba??","review":"Does anyone else wonder what kind of fantasy world has a hero named Richard, and a character named Betty, when others have names like Jagang and Oba? This little example shows a tiny portion of the problem with Terry Goodkind's series and with the latest attempt, PILLARS OF CREATION. There is no cohesive thought in any of these books. Characters like Rachael and Chase are introduced, then disappear. Plots are recycled. Stream of consciousness shallow writing takes the place of any kind of world building or suspense.I had great hopes for this after the first two books, and have watched in dismay as it hit the skids, and now the toilet. The die hards that only tune in for the sex, the cliffhangers and the gore are going to love anything Goodkind puts out, but I think the readers with more than two brain cells to rub together are going to leave, sooner or later. I know I am done."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTED IN CONNECTICUT","review":"I LOVED THE FIRST SIX BOOKS - RICHARD,KAHLAN,ZED AND THE GANG PROVIDED A NICE RELEIF FROM THE DAILY STRESS OF WORK - BOOK SEVEN SEEMS TO ABANDON THESE CHARACTERS - LEAVES ME WAITING AND HOPING FOR BOOK EIGHT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good moments floating in a sea of mediocrity","review":"Glaring typographic errors, repeated phrases, huge plot discontinuities ...Man, but this book needed some serious editing. I don't know how many times Goodkind repeated the same basic thoughts in this book. Over and over, we read how Jennsen plans to \\"plunge her sword into Richard Rahl's chest.\\" This exact phrase, or something quite similar, must appear ten times in the last part of the book. The book comes off as superficial and amateurish. If JRR Tolkien or Gene Wolfe is a 10 in terms of fantasy prose, then Goodkind is about a 2. On the other hand, there were some compelling moments, and I found the whole People's Palace sequence gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save some time","review":"For those of you that have not read this book yet save yourself some money and just read the last 50 pages. This book had no business being apart of the Sword of Truth series. It should have come out as a stand alone like the Debt of Bones book. Or at least finish the series then write about the new characters. So this book has about 150 pages of good reading and the rest stinks. Terry you can do better than that and you should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed!","review":"I was very dissapointed with The Pillars of Creation. The book falls far short in the intricate relationships set in the Sword of Truth saga. The entire book was set, with few exeptions, in a world that could exist completely outside Richard and Kahlan's realm. Richard and Kahlan are vaguely mentioned and Zed has an extremely small part. The series did not progress at all, and I feel cheated. A minor saving grace is that we get a more in-depth look at Jagang.Overall, I felt the book did very little in regards to the Sword of Truth. I only hope that the next book will get the series back on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hopeful","review":"This book takes us down a side street of the SoT series. I did enjoy learning about the new characters in the book, how TG unravels the parts of their personality that make them unique characters. Although I liked the characters, they are not interesting enough for 500 pages. I would have enjoyed a longer book that kept switching between Richard, Kahlan and Cara and then occasionaly back to Jennsen and Oba (instead of placing R, K & C in as \\"minor characters\\" of their own story). I am hopeful that this is a \\"tie in\\" book for the series. Introducing new characters and then have them play a vital roll in the future releases. I am still anxiously awaiting the next book in the SoT series and I hope the end is on page 1100 of the next book. But if the next book is not more SoT than this I may jump on the wagon of the disappointed. Overall a very good book, just not what I wanted as a SoT enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I think it was innovative to write the book from the perspective of new characters, but I read these books because of Richard and Kahland and with the hope that they will dipose the Imperial Order.From that perspective, this story fell flat on its face. Mr. Goodkind's story-telling is still exceptional and it was an interesting story. However, this book should not have been touted as part of the Sword of Truth series (even though there were a couple of chapters dedicated to Richard and Kahland).There we several plot flaws that can't be discussed without revealing spoilers. But they mostly happened near the end, like he was rushing to get it done, and forgot some of the pieces that had gone before. Even so, I did like the over-all ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"not Bad, just different","review":"This wasn't a terrible book, it was just a builder. I miss all of the old characters as much as anyone, but I guess I am trying to be optimistic and hope that Jenssen will have a purpose in the future novels. Oba, however, was a bit too sadistic for his own good. Though I was a bit dissappointed, I thought Goodkind did a great job of presenting the characters' perception of everything through a different point of view. The ending was a bit sketchy; it seemed thrown together and sappy, with the corny goat reunion and all... but I just can't help but hope that there are still great things to come in this series. I loved the first four books, and found book five to be a bit of a slump. Six was better... now let's hope Terry has the grand finale still up his sleeve..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A return to great story telling","review":"If I hadn't known that Richard and Kahlen wouldn't enter until near the end, I might have been disappointed, but knowing that ahead of time, I decided to judge the book on its own merits, and I REALLY enjoyed it. In a way it reminded me of WFR...compelling story telling. It's been awhile since I stayed up 'till midnight to finish a book. The end was certainly rushed, but I think that is one of TG's weaknesses, and this book wasn't more rushed than any of the others. I'd recommend that SOT fans go into this with an open mind and forget Richard and Kahlen for a bit so that you can enjoy a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"Ugh. Please don't tell me that Terry Goodkind is losing his way like Robert Jordan. This book might as well have nothing to do with the rest of the series. It is bland and preachy. Once again, I say Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, but disapointing","review":"the pillars of creation is a great read, and ive read ALL of TG's books, but this one was to centered on jensen. the whole book had less than a chapter with kahlan and richard, i was really disapointed. ...

Each book in the series makes me want to read the next a little less. The writing itself seems more like what I had to read in Juvenile Literature while getting my teaching certificate, yet the events being described have too much sex and violence (combined into one at times) to be aimed at teenagers.\\"This latest preaches to the reader too much, but not by actually making the point about the dangers of communism or whatever he's trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long intro!","review":"Let me say straightaway that I truly love this series. However, my least favorite character is in this book. That said, I believe his character is fully developed and, unfortunately, a necessary evil. On the reverse side, my absolute favorite scene in the series is in this book! Richard is truly dedicated to Kahlan and his actions prove it.This book is a necessary step in the story line so stick with it and you will be happily surprised. I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really took a detour on this one...","review":"Lauren comes up from out of nowhere in this book, and isn't a particularly entertaining character. I don't know if maybe Goodkind was trying something different, or thinking about taking the story in a different direction, or just drunk, but this was really not at all what I was hoping or expecting to read after reading all the previous books.I haven't read beyond this book as when I put it down, it was the newest book. There have been 3 or 4 more released since then, so I'm picking up the next one. If it continues this story line, I won't be likely to finish it, and certainly not likely to purchase the next one after that."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good","review":"I would say that this book seems to be going on and on a little too long about Jennsen, Sebastain, and Oba, but then again I understand that they are trying to get us up to speed of what happened between the three before they bring them face to face later on in the book. Richard and Kahlan was introduced once again in the late section which makes me feel like \\"Uh... it would be nice to read a little about them at some points in the book rather than all at the end.\\" I mean... isn't it the reason we are so fascinated with the last six books? The fifth book - Soul of the Fire - seems to have a good balance in the people in Anderith and Lord Rahl's army.Even though it may be a little too long with the side story, Terry managed to keep me fascinated at the end of the book. Now I'm enticed to read the next one - Naked Empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this to be a truly disappointing end to a pretty interesting series. It seemed as if Goodkind became bored with the whole story line and published something just to get it over with. I read all the other books in the series and was anxiously awaiting a grand finale. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please don't tell me this series is petering out...","review":"I've been riveted to all the books leading up to this, and had high hopes for Pillars. It's a pretty good book, but not the best in the series, by far. The main characters are not Richard and Kahlan, but Richard's half-sister Jennsen. It seems as if this book was written 'like a girl', so to speak, and less like an adventure/fantasy novel type story. Character development wasn't as good either - I got almost tired of hearing Jennsen's inner thoughts of hate toward Richard, her angst and woes of her lot in life. The story ending does redeem it somewhat, and one must read it if following the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler","review":"While you get a tidbit or two of backstory out of this novel, you can pretty much skip it and not lose anything much. The main character of this book gets pretty much discarded in the next (or the one after?) one.The main characters only make cameo appearances and it may interest you (it was a boring read for me), it has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the series.This was merely a filler for book 8, and nothing more. The writing wasn't so hot either. It was almost as if it was another author. Don't let this book dissuade you from reading the ones after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long-winded","review":"I could've skipped a few chapters of the book and not missed anything. In fact, you could, if you want to get through with this book quickly, read the first and last few chapters and it would just be as good a read as the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the rest of the series","review":"Although I thought the story in this book was very good I thought that the deviation of using Richard and Kahlan as main characters really ruined the story for me. Since the rest of the books in the Sword of Truth series have Richard and Kahlan as the focus, not focusing on them in this book really left me with the sensation that the book was really missing something. Overall I was pretty disappointed with the book. I hope that Goodkind returns to Richard and Kahlan's story in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few little problems - consistency, credibility, plot...","review":"The Pillars of Creation - Too many inconsistencies. Too many coincidences. Weak story. 550 pages of fluff, maybe 50 pages of content. The characters are unbelievable and not very intelligent. Not on par with Goodkind's early books in this series - not even close. I don't know whether to be happy for you or feel sorry for you if you enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky I Didnt Pay For The Book.","review":"Slow to start off, jumping around in the middle, The end all fell together to easily.If Terry is going to finish the series then he should just do it, not drag it out with halfbaked plots and annoying women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about the seeker... really","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The description of the book, both from the site, and the dust jacket discuss Richard as being a main part of the book and plot, given that the series is about him...He enters the book around page 430 and is temporarily removed from the plot again until about 10 pages to the end.Besides the obvious complaint about the book not fufilling expectations, it seemed to wander and get lost at points with sometimes childlike dialogue and a lack of sophistication I was surprised by. I hope to see this series regain its former level."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this one.","review":"All this book is good for is introducing Jenssen, Richards new sister, who ends up being nearly identical to him in charictor. Obe is so simeraler to Richard's other brother it's scary. You hardly get any of Richard fighting the order, you hardly see any of Richard at all. Instead of developing old charitors, Goodkind gives us new ones that I could care less for."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the motivation for this book?","review":"I must say I was pretty disappointed when I heard that Terry Goodkind was to release 7th installment for \\"The Sword of Truth\\" series. \\"Faith of the Fallen\\" had a perfect, non-Hollywood, ending, where it gave hope to a new beginning. Unfortunately, it seems that the writer could not just end it there, but instead started a completely new story that somehow lamely ties into the existing one. Seems to me like greed was the motivation for the book, not a new brilliant idea. And new plot is not what really bothers me. It is the quality of writing. It is repetitive, silly and obnoxious, and it read as fast as a bad romance novel. I do hope he will go back to the writing style which made the previous books in the series such good reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sword of Truth Series???","review":"I thought I was purchasing a book from the Sword of Truth series. Funny how it was barely mentioned and the main characters are on the outside looking in for most of the story. If Terry would like to branch out into other characters I would recommend him to pursue other short stories like the \\"Debt of Bones\\" that chronicled Zedd's early years (which I recommend!). I have been a rabid fan since discovering this series and have found this edition to be a huge disappointment. This IS a Sword of Truth Series book, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWFUL","review":"I have generally been a big fan of Terry Goodkind's work. I greatly enjoy his characters Richard, Zedd, Kahlan, Chase, etc. Too bad this book wasn't about any of these characters. Richard's character appeared at most on 25 pages of this 550 page waste. I must say, I really don't care about Jennsen, and the description on the inside of the dust cover is really the only good fiction to be found anywhere inside of this book. There is more written about Richard and Kahlan there, then anywhere else in the novel. I love this series because of Richard and Kahlan, I was hoping to read more about them. This book might be good, as a stand alone novel, with a vague tie in to the Sword of Truth series. But in no way should it be book seven. I bought this book expecting to read mostly about Richard and Kahlan, instead I got page after page of Jennsen. This book might have done the impossible and completely turned me off Terry Goodkind for ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"I have grown to love Terry and his writing with books 1-6. This one, however, makes me want to push fast forward on the audiobook. Its just terrible. I hate the new characters. I find myself wanted to bash their faces in. They are inhuman, and just plain, NOT INTERESTING. Why did he do this? If he wanted to spin off some lame books, then do it. This really does not tie into the main story arc at all. I'm not even sure I want to continue reading this book (or the series), as it is THAT PAINFUL to get through. Its almost as bad as Book 10 of WOT. What were you thinking Terry?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself some time, skip it","review":"As many others have said, this book is a long and boring sidetrack from the main story. The entire purpose of the novel is to introduce Richard's half-sister, but I found myself completely unable to like her. I haven't read the next book yet, but if it's anything like this one, I may pretend that the series stopped at book 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Change doens't come easy.","review":"Okay so what happened here. This is my 3rd real sci-fi/fantasy series I've read(the other two were the LOR saga and the DUNE saga(stillcomingout)(I was a fan of both before the movies were even in creating))and I really enjoy Goodkind's writing. But what happened here? Some like the change in style and the idea of holes in the world was intriguing(spelling?) and all but what did it have to do with the story? I wanted to hear more about Richard and Kahlans adventures instead of a bunch of strage offspring. I hope the next novels doesn't venture off to left field just to come up empty handed. I suppose it's a good idea to read this one but it leaves the ready with little energy and a sense of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"The first third is fine, but then goes downhill....to the totally stupid ending.

They do become dry in occasion as the author goes into the nitty gritty detail in his desciptions of areas or explanantions of thoughts and actions. I was also annoyed with the way he repeats specific statements throughout the series. Explaining that Zed is Richards grandfather, is a first wizard and that he made Richard the Seeker of Truth as an explanation to a new character but is unnecesary for the reader. That cost the 5th star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapponting","review":"I have to agree with the majority of reviewers who sounded disappointed with this book. I read the publisher's blurbs and read the book jacket beofre reading the book. After the first hundred pages or so, i went back to the jacket thinking I had missed something. Wasn't this supposed to be about Richard and Kahlan being pursued, etc? Maybe I wouldn't be so disappointed if I didn't feel like the readers were misled. Why not come out and say that this is a story focusing on characters other than Richard and Kahlan? Maybe the publisher realized if the truth about the focus of this book were identified up front, people would hesitate to spend the money on the hardback. Bottom line for me is that this was one more disappointment in this series that started out so well. I think buying used in the future is what's in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to read this junk","review":"I've greatly enjoyed reading the Sword of Truth series. I thought Faith of the Fallen was one of the best of them with an amazing amount of character development. Afterwards I was struck with a mighty blow to the head with this book. I'm only 360 pages into it and have to battle to read it after starting MANY months ago. I just don't care at all about any of the the dull characters. So far the one I care about the most is Tom! Maybe I will eventually finish it so I can move on to a good book. Wish me luck. END THE SERIES!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did everybody go?","review":"Ok we spent time, money, and effort reading the all the other books getting to know the characters. Then what happens? They all disappear. I found myself skipping 10 to 20 pages at a time of drawn out boring dialogue from characters that we don't care about. (And this occured alot throughout the book) Ones we know will end up dead. It also seems that every book brings out a new sister of the dark briefly then we kill her off. All of his books are delightful even though they all seem to borrow everything from other fantasy and fiction writers. The reason I read books in series' is because there are a cast of characters you grow to know and love, Goodkind might as well have killed them all off, you only hear about them in the last 30 pages or so of this 550 page book"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"We wait all this time to find out what happens to Zedd and Richard and Kahlan and Cara, one of my personal favorites, and what do we get? A completely new story with all of our favorite heroes as afterthoughts! I was looking forward to this book with vigor; after all, \\"Faith of the Fallen\\" was a beautiful and stunning work written by a true writer. I cared deeply about Richard and Kahlan and Nicci, and wondered what would happen to them. And what do we get? A completely off-kelter story about people I don't even care about and undoubtedly never will! They would be great as a sub-plot, but really! You can't write 6 books about characters that your readers learn to care deeply about and then write a book about some other chick and her problems and sell it in the same series! Frankly, I don't really care to know about Jennsen and Oba and Sebastian and the sorceress dames. I eagerly await Terry Goodkind's next book, and hope its a hell of a lot better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the lot so far","review":"I have a love hate relationship with Goodkind. On the one hand, he is incredibly imaginative and original. On the other hand, he can't write dialog to save his life, and often, he just repeat himself over and over and over and over and over again.I suspect if I deleted all the repetition, particularly about the stupid knife (Yes, we get it early on Terry) you could cut about two thirds of the book out and not change it at all.The previous book, Faith of the Fallen (book six), was very good. Another brilliant original twist placing the main character Richard deep in enemy territory, stripped of his magic and his sword, with only his mind to fight back. Excellent. So what happened Terry? How did you go from such brilliance to the pedantic, plodding, mind-numbing pap of book seven?I found myself skimming through this book. In truth, you can read the first few chapters and probably the last two and get the entirety of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"When I first inserted the first tape into my player, I questioned whether or not it was the same series.Not till I got home and comfirmed it on the internet did I believe it.3/4 of this book is dedicated to two new character who could have been described in two chapters.I was very disappointed with this book.Mr Goodkind takes an entire book to identify two characters which he could have done in two or three chapters.The last 100 pages are appropriate and very interesting.The rest of the book existed just to make money.Shame on you Terry."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book- though a side story","review":"this book was a sort of side story used to intruduce the new charater of richard's sister. people gave it bad reviews because of this but it was worth reading and i liked this side story different from the others. Don't be turned off by other reviews it is a good book, not the best, but good"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Perspective","review":"I throughly enjoyed this book, I got hold of it on Thursday night and by Sunday it was all over! Although I was wondering all the way through when the main characters would emerge, it was very refreshing to see the conflict from a new point of view. This story also gives us an understanding of how an essentially evil leader can convince their followers that they are working for the right cause. I strongly recommend this book for anyone who has read the rest of the series, but if your new to the series you should start at the beginning to understand the nuances througout the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Sword of Truth","review":"I love the series, but I loathed this book. Putting aside the fact that the book doesn't include any of the 'main' characters from the SoT series, I found it largely boring. The only parts I found worth reading were the ones dealing with Jagang, and the last 50ish pages of the book. Goodkind sold out, and instead of actually continuing his already long story, he's added this book just to make some extra bucks. It is extremely frustrating to have waited for a book to complete/continue the SoT story, and instead be given this piece of....If this were the first book in the SoT series, I would NOT have purchased the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big printing but less words.","review":"The thing that irritated me the most about this book wasthat the type and word spacing were so much larger thanall the previous books. Did the publisher think that wewere so dumb that we couldn't figure out that if you uselarger type and more spaces between the lines and the wordsthat you may end up with the similar amount of pages as theprevious books but you actually get a lot less words.The story was shorter than all the other books and it bugsme that they tried to cover it up by using larger type usuallyreserved for kiddie books. This book was a sell out by boththe author and the publisher. If it takes more time to do itright, then take more time !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same review as for Naked Empire","review":"See my review of Naked Empire. In particular, do not buy any books in this series if you are from Canada."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marks the end of the Goodkind era","review":"This is probably the worst book I have ever read.I've loved the first 6, and from this book onwards - and especially with this book - I find Goodkind's work to be totally empty and denuded of interest.I can't begin to understand why, as one of the other reviewers wrote \\"did he even write this book\\" ?. I personnaly believe that success made Goodkind fall head over heels into self-admiration and lust to sell more, to the detriment of his books' quality. The plot is staightforward, the characters unsurprising and simple, the \\"philosophical\\" (I would rather quote this term in this context) statements simplistic, boringly long, and frankly laughable.I read the two following 'Pillars of Creation' : 'Naked Empire' and 'Chainfire', which are a little better. To tell the truth, I felt that I was taken hostage and forced to read these books because I so much liked the previous ones that I bought all three at once.These will definetely be the last Goodkind I read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but confusing","review":"The book was confusing but it put in a lot of information on Richards goals of magic and what he wants to do for his kingdom. It also shows some more facts on Darken Rahl which is interesting because it shows what Richard is still trying to fight against. It does not mention a lot about Richard and Kahlan but it is still interesting and it has a lot of connection with past books. It definitly kept me in suspense for the upcoming books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback edition","review":"Faith of the Fallen read like Atlas Shrugged if Ayn Rand had been a romance author with little writing ability. Unfortunately Pillars of Creation is no better. Perhaps I could see past the bland writing if the story and characters were compeling. However the character development is superficial as the characters tend to be bland and predictable. I've read nutrition panels on cereal boxes with a more intriguing plot than this book! If you must read the Sword of Truth series, then I definitely suggest you wait for the paper copy. I wish I could get my 27 dollars back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome, a new protaganist....","review":"and yet the series is still horrible, what gives? I mean how can you not find a series exciting and refreshing when plotlines are rehashed and characters are interchangeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"goodkind= clown of the year","review":"Goodkind really should of stayed with ripping off ideas from Jordan, but i guess sense jordan is on the decline he had to actuelly do some work. well Faith of the fallen had me convinced goodkind was going to make a series out of this soarly lacking Plot progression, However this new instalment is not even worth the read.Goodkind talks about his books being about these \\"charecters\\" but yet prolly the main reason anyone reads this series is to see richard and kahlan, well this isnt a spoiler, its a warning not to buy the hard cover because None of the main charecters are in the majority of the book.I am hoping my last regrett of 2001 is buying the hard cover version of this book, I hope you dont make a simliliar regrett in buying even the paper back come next year.I for one wont pick up the next books by him..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of the series.","review":"I must say after reading this bookk the first thing that comes to mind is good try. I, like many, am a advid follower of the Sword of Truth Series, however I did not enjoy this installment. I liked the idea of introducting a character at odds with the fundemental virtues that the main characters strive to uphold. However, Jenssen, nor Oba were the characters to do it. I found Jenssen's gullible nature a little to convient in allowing her to be so easily lead by someone who is, in essence, a complete stanger to her despite the warnings and training of her mother. I find Oba to be a weak willed brute with little to offer in the way of true opposition to the struggles of the series main characters. I think Mr. Goodkind had a good idea to base this chapter of the series on, but fell short of developing the idea fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Having just finished The Pillars of Creation, I'm left wondering, \\"Is this the same story that's summarized on the dust cover?\\" It was excellent until the last 75 pages, where it all falls apart. It's as if Mr. Goodkind got tired of writing. I kept looking to see if I had missed entire chapters of Richard and Kalhan's adventures, which are only hinted at. A very disappointing ending to what had the potential of being on of the series best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Sword of the Truth series book.","review":"I feel like some other writer has decided to write a book. After the first 50 pages with nary a mention of Richard or the Mother Confessor. I wasn't worried though because Goodkind has done that to us in the past. However, 500 some pages into the book and still nothing?? What is Goodkind thinking? People read the book for the characters that they love, not strangers with whom we do not empathize with or care about. Goodkind had better come out with a book as good as Faith of the Fallen next time or his readership will suffer tremendously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth feeling violated...","review":"While I am not one to beat a dead horse, I still would like to say I was SEVERELY disappointed with this book. The plot could have been forseen by a child of three, the characters lacked much needed definition, and I felt that the story went nowhere. After a year of waiting, I feel like a man would after visiting a prostitute, the service recieved was not worth the money spent. I'm sorry to say that one of my favorite authors has let me down with a sidebar that, to me, had no meaning. This book felt more like one that would come after an author has finished a series and was trying to float a few books by on its reputation. I hope that this book is not a forewarning of the future of Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. I look forward to a better book to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love his books, they usually are very complex. This book was a short story with a very shallow plot. Did he have to get a book out for Christmas?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"I \\"was\\" a huge fan of the series but this book is a disappointing entry into the Sword of Truth series. The book does little to advance the storyline/plot that the Sword of Truth series advances. The review of the plot makes it appear Richard is a major player in this series when in fact he is only around for the last 50 pages and that is less than a tenth of the book. Clearly some money hungry person be it the author or the publisher thought this book deserved to be a part of the series. The tricks of Robert Jordan are clearly evident here which makes sense as tehy share the same publisher, Tor Books. I think authors should not allow themselves to be duped into this thought process. I for one never by the Jordan books, I just get them from my library... in paperback and would recommend you do the same for this book or borrow a friends and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food for thought but wait for the paperback","review":"I too was very disappointed because I love the main characters so much and was looking forward to spending time with them. However, the one thing Goodkind does well is kinda give you moral food for thought and the message in this book is: what happens if you base your life on assumptions/beliefs that are entirely false? Made me kinda want to examine mine and I also felt it also might have an implications in understanding how 9/11 happened. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imaginative but Repetitive","review":"Goodkinds stories have great plot lines and characters, but his writing style leaves much to be desired. The books look hefty when you first see them, but if you cut out the rehashing and catching up, you're left with only a few interesting events. Goodkind's need to \\"remind\\" you of things that happened only a few chapters ago tend to drive returning readers crazy. If he shortened his books by a few chapters and cut to the chase he would probably be twice as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I love the Sword of Truth series (except the chicken one, I still don't know what that was all about.) Then I read Faith of the Fallen and I was hooked again desperate to read the sequel. When I picked up Pillars of Creation I thought that's what I had. Boy was I wrong! I don't mind reading about a new character, but she shouldn't have more than a few chapters dedicated to her. In a Sword of Truth book, of approximately 550 pages, neither Richard or Kahlan appear until the last 50, and they don't play that big a role in those pages either. This wasn't a sequel, it was a cash grab. I'm just glad I read a library copy and didn't buy it. Terry Goodkind must be running out of ideas if Pillars of Creation is all he can give us. I'd rather have waited another year or two for him to come up with something worthwhile. Am I willing to risk wasting my time again and read the next book? Sadly yes, because I'm still looking forward to the sequel to Faith of the Fallen. Hope I get it next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly good book with a fresh perspective","review":"i don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, but this book directly addresses the criticism of the previous books while introducing a breath of fresh air to the series.1) it provides a new iteration to the generic plotline of the series, i.e., richard and kahland get separated, defeat the enemy and reunite.2) it puts the whole d'haran/old world in a new perspective3) you get a better sense of what is going on in the different worlds, the daily struggles and the ways of life4) there is suspense. you know something is wrong but you don't know what.5) new characters, new tensions, new conflicts.Terry, this book is great! not the best (the second and third were) but definitely worth a read and worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooray for libraries","review":"This stinkbomb series is great. It really reminds me that if you're in doubt about the book, you can check it out at the library instead of buying it. Support your local library!Lucky for Richard his enemies are dumb and cartoonish, too bad for us I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind continues his degredation of the series","review":"Wizards First Rule was one of the best books in the fantasy genre I have read and the subsequent books have done at best, kept my interest (2 and 3 were really good). God, I mean the main character seems to have become a more special and powerful person with every book. I did not mind the war wizard thing a while back, but the statue that made the entire city cry and revolt in the last book? Come on. This entire series just appears somewhat to cliche. This has just become a never ending tale of Richard vs. the big bad world (whomever the great evil at time seems to be).Goodkind's writing really seems to have come down to extending the series and not doing high quality work. Don't get me wrong, The Pillars of Creation isn't a bad book and I think it is worth reading if you have read all the others, but it leaves alot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother. I liked Wizard's First Rule too, but the series just gets horrible","review":"This book is really lousy. As I said in other reviews, the first book in the series was excellent.The next 3 ranged from almost good to decent. But they just kept getting progressively worse until you hit this piece of garbage. The story has become so convoluted that its just not worth reading anymore.This one has NOTHING to do with Richard and Kahlan in case you are wondering. Just some random side story the author decided to throw in. Seriously, quite horrible..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst so far...Pretty Awful actually...","review":"I loved this series- I could not stop reading each and every one of them cover to cover up until this piece of garbage. Its almost like TG handed over his writing to an author of much much lessor quality - like one of those cheesy books based off of a video game like \\"Starcraft\\" or something. It is sad.I still finished this book, but man I could not wait for it to end!!! Boring, with a plot that made you hate every character introduced. This reminds me of the new Eddings books- I loved all his old work, but really really hate his new stuff... its almost like they stopped thinking when writing and play to a 'dumber' audience!I will get the next one in the series- just in case he can pick up the pieces...sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this book... I recommend you do so.","review":"Basically 50 chapters of all new characters. Richard and everyone from previous books do not even enter the book for 50 chapters and are only is a few of that last 10 chapters.I've started the next book and have decided that this book can be skipped because the only thing you need to know from it is... SPOILER COMING...He finds his ungifted sister, Jenson. And she was duped by the order for 50 chapters.Terry... get on with the story... I was SOOO frustrated by this book. I am starting to think we will never see Richard be a true Wizard... or the Order squashed. Get on with it please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed...","review":"While I understand the value of looking at this world from a completely different perspective, this story is flat. Seeing others struggle through the world that Richard, Kahlan, Zedd and the others are stuggling to uplift lends a new angle, but I agree with many others that Jennsen and Oba are flat, one dimensional characters, and the pace of the story has peaks and valleys like a bunny hill. Still, I do look forward to the following books in the series. This installment, however, can be summed up in one word: FLAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"What series did this story come from?","review":"I was very disappointed with the plot of this book. When you see that a book is the next volume of a SERIES...you expect that it would continue with the original plot. This book however goes off on a completely different tangent with only a \\"cameo\\" apperance of the original characters.I can only hope that the next one does continue the original story, but I will be sure to skim through it BEFORE I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!","review":"I love this serious but unfortunately the latest book has almost nothing to do with it! I kept reading and wondering when the characters I knew were going to make an appearance, and I had to wait until I was 95% into the book. In my opinion this book should have been published outside of the series and not considered book #7. If you are wanting to read more about Richard and Kahlan, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic approach","review":"I've read all 7 in the series so far and can't wait for the eight 'Naked Empire'. This book takes an unusual view point of The sword of truth world. You see a poorer side of the world from richard's half-sister and half-brother Who unlike richard do not have magic but instead can not be affected in any way shape or form by magic.Both siblings believe that richard is as evil as there father and go on a search for richard, when their parents die, in the girls case to seek the truth and in the boy's possiblly to kill him. I won't say any more cause I can't give all the fun away.The 'Pillars of Creation' is a fantastic read and gives new insight into the main cultures and kingdoms that have featured before. Not his best one but v.close to it. The best I think was 'Temple of Winds' and a joint second between 'Faith of the Fallen' and this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Goodkind write this unsatisfying book himself?","review":"Another reviewer summed this book up: \\"It began in a long drawn out fashion and ended in a whirlwind of events that made little sense. Shame on you Terry Goodkind.\\"That Kahlan and Richard are barely in the book is fine, although it's better to know that before reading it.What is not fine is that the first 400 pages are filler while the last part of the book needed 200 more pages to make any sense at all. The overall plot and narrative are embarrassingly weak. Bottom line: The quality of this effort is an insult to faithful readers.Will I read him again? Yes, but I'm in no hurry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that?","review":"This was a huge disappointment. What is up with Goodkind and Jordan? I think they both read too many professional reviews, \\"Wow, they are like the best thing since Tolkein\\". Just not true anymore. This book was just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but needs more","review":"Well it wasn't what I expected, but it was good. The one thing I didn't like was how it dragged on for most of the book and then the last 50 pages have all of the great action, with exception to the order battle against Adie and Zed. Those last 50 pages should have been told in more detail and used at least 200 pages. Another thing, I want to know what Richard and Kahlan were doing the whole time. Hopefully the next book will fill us in. The way I see it, the next book should be the last with the order trying to take the people's palace. If Goodkind tries to drag it out any longer than that, I will be very disappointed. I will be anxiously waiting for the last brilliant novel to bring it all together and then conclude it."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i really pay full price for this?","review":"ok, i know this has been said over and over, but one more time, this book was a huge HUGE waste of my time and money. The previous reviews said this was basically a book to introduce a new character. Well i disagree, it was a book about nothing. Jennson wasn't interesting in the least, and i have no idea what oba the boring oaf was even doing in there. And who couldn't see the whole tom was actually a lord Rahl agent all along? I love the SoT series, and it saddens me that mr. Goodkind felt he needed to write this novel like this at this time. I agree with the others when they said he needed to address what happened after they took Jagang's home city. With that said i'll just say that I would have given this a big fat goose egg for a rating but amazon doesn't go that low in it's rating system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers. While Mr. Goodkind normally does a great job of developing characters, this was far short of his previous efforts.Although he sets the stage for his next novel, he doesn't work the introduction of the new character into the greater storyline, and tried to do too much with the new character too soon. He took 6 books to develop his lead characters, and it felt like he was trying to repeat that in a few hundred pages. It felt rushed, it felt disconnected, and there were too many holes for it to fit into the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"BARELY STARTED IT AND I WANTED TO SET IT ON FIRE!","review":"im not done with the book yet im about in the middle but every page i read is a struggle that tries to put me to sleep.

My favorite line is for July, \\"And Tabby dozes/in a pool/ of fur she sheds/ to keep her cool.\\" What a beautiful summation of July!Originally written in 1965, the book was re-released in 1999 with new illustrations by Trina Schart Hyman. The pictures are stunning and capture the elements of each month. Readers of Updike know that he lives in Massachusetts, and the poems and illustrations have a decidely northeastern feel.

This book talks about dreams as it attempts to indoctrinate you with the philosophy of a cult whose spiritual center is in Minnesota. It's loaded with words and names that sound like they are made up by children playing \\"Invent A Religion\\", or borrowed from Hinduism. It reads like a warped version of \\"WATCHTOWER\\".

It was an easy read although I became irritated by the continual references to whether a person was or was not a student or member of ECK. The references distracted from the message of using dreams to expand your awareness and began to preach the benefits of belonging to the religion.My main problem is the religion's practise of allowing the Dream Master, the ECK's spiritual leader, access to your dream world - to guide and protect the novice dreamer. I prefer a different method."},{"rating":"1","title":"so deceiving!","review":"DON'T BUY this book if you are serious about dreams.

The cut is fine for model making, or even craft stick cutting. For most cuts at angles, this tool suffices. It is not a replacement for a miniature table saw (3 to 4-inch blades).

It is sharp, and cuts through wood pretty easily, but this tool does not make accurate cuts at all. It's wonky in every direction. If you were working in a larger scale, maybe it wouldn't be as noticeable, I'm not sure. But, if you really need a 120 degree angle to actually be a 120 degree angle, this is definitely not the right tool for the job.

This one is no exception, although I would think it was better than average. Yes, they go with the silly 'the kids are taking over Dad's job, and Dad sneaks around to make sure they don't screw up' plot. However, this really shines in the same place the original series did -- the interaction and dialogue between Cosby and Culp. After all this time, they were still being those characters! Yes, while the scene where they are tied up naked might have been a little more fun if they had been a bit younger *cough*, it led to a wonderful scene.

You turn to the number that is indicated and read what your line means.

He sleepwalks through the film, a pale shadow of his former self. The locations are of interest to anyone either unacquainted with the city of Istanbul, or to those who would like to know what it looked like before the developers changed its vista forever. John Bentley, a stalwart British B-Movie actor of the mid-50s, looks uncomfortable playing a Turkish police inspector, as he should be.

Nat King Cole is great for 5 minutes in Technicolor but the rest of the picture stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"When I Fall Asleep","review":"Possibly in an attempt to give this sad little epic a \\"Casablanca\\" flavor, Nat Cole sings \\"When I Fall in Love\\" about sixteen times, while bleary-eyed Errol Flynn tries to get a bead on lost-yet-not-quite-lost love, gorgeous Cornell Borchers (what's with that name? sounds like a Russian sneezing). There's also something about a fire and some lost diamonds, or pearls, or gold... I wasn't really paying attention.

The wound had already started healing before the nurse arrived a couple of days later! It only took about a month to be completely healed over. Recently, she had another minor accident that left a gash on her leg. I didn't have any patches so I dressed it with Telfa pads for a few days, without seeing a whole lot of improvement.

Their journey creates friendships with other humans, rats, dragons, dwarfs, etc. The evil villian in the book is an enchanted golden dragon, Nettlebrand, who was created by an alchemist to hunt and kill the good silver dragons.This ultimately is a fun children's story well-written to entertain young readers. The story lacks the depth and detail of Funke's other books like the Inkheart series. In Dragon Rider, she forgoes much of the character development and depth of story in order to move the plot along and introduce colorful characters along the way.I think this will entertain young readers and adults who read aloud to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, wish there were more","review":"This book I listened to as read by Brendan Fraser on a CD.

If you are older, you probably shouldn't read it though, as many parts may be considered too whimsical for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro to dragon literature -- and reincarnation!","review":"As a grown-up, this book was a little on the put-down-able side. It just didn't have that much story going for it.As a parent, though, this is a keeper. A nice, long book in the dragon genre with nice, likeable characters, a boy and a girl and many magical creatures. It uses stretch vocabulary, a little humor, and features maps. Third grade reading level -- a great first dragon book.Happy (if predictable) ending. 523 pages. Short chapters, each with a little illustration. Quite a bit of reincarnation talk (parts take place in India) -- is the boy the reincarnation of the Dragon Rider?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Rider...","review":"This is the most amazing book ever. I loan this book to all my friends, but as soon as it's gone I regret that I loaned it. Because I love reading it! Do you like mystery? Do you like talking animals? Do you like books that are hard to put down? Then READ THIS BOOK!!!I really wonder if there is a second book!I am a 11 year old writer. Writing Annabeth Chase- The Adventure begins. Annabeth Chase is the title of the series. and The Adventure Begins is the title of the book. I won't go into any details about this book. Because This is the review of Dragon Rider.I'm not quite 11.

Slow-paced, stereotyped female characters, a purely-evil antagonist with no reason to exist, unevolving personalities, irrelevant plot digressions, endless nasty and pointless dialog.Frau Funke's German-to-English translator evidently missed the distinction between Elves and Fairies - quite clear in the British tradition, but lost here because the German \\"Elfen\\" can refer to either. She simply takes whatever magical creature she's heard of and assigns to them whatever attributes strikes her fancy.A good editor would have cut this huge volume down by 30-50%. During storytime I cut out the dross just to hasten making an end. Dreary and tiresome by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odd theme in a book for children.","review":"First I have to preface my comment with the admission that I did not finish this book all the way though. I bought it with the intention of reading it to my 4 year-old as a bedtime story. He seemed interested in dragons so I thought that this would be a good book for him. We really only got a few chapters in when I got tired of all of the human bashing that goes on. I want my child growing up learning about the ways humans make things better not how awful we are. If there is a thematic change in this book that I do not know about then I apologize. But I could not continue reading this to my son. I just thought that a counter to the glowing praises should be written for those like me who are picky about the messages that are underlying the stories our children hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its pretty good but as good as Eragon","review":"The is not the best a fiction story can be but I like a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest book","review":"The dragons are going to be attacked by humans.In this book Dragon Rider Firedrake,Sorrel,and Ben have to find he Rim of Heaven so the dragons are saved.In this book Firedrake,Sorrel,and Ben must travel across the world to find the Rim of Heaven.Professor GreenBloom will help them across the world.NettalBrand the Golden Dragon is in thier way.The auther made this book for all ages but mostly for younger ages.Theme is small people can make a big diffrence.This book is better than any other book yo will find.You will not be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have to try it in Audio!","review":"I usually only listen to books on tape when I have a big trip but when I heard Brendan Fraiser did the reading for this I was willing to give it a try while sitting at home.

The narrative parts are spoken in a near whisper while the conversations are given at normal volume, which makes it hard to adjust the speaker volume. Words are unreliably enunciated, phrases are often broken at odd places, the wrong words get emphasized, and the narrator speeds up and slows down unpredictably. All in all, an annoying reading. Get the print edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book/Bad Narrator","review":"Don't waste your money on the audio version of this book. It has nearly ruined the story for me. Frasier almost whispers much of the text and then yells the dialogue. I was constantly playing with the volume while I listened. A few of the character voices were decent but Frasier's Scottish accent is just cruel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of book incorrect","review":"Very excited to receive this book. My daughter loves it. The listing stated that it is Used - Very good. That is incorrect. The binding on the book was all but falling apart. There were just a few of the binding threads holding the pages in. Also there is darkly hi-lighted pages with writing making it nearly impossible to read. Very unhappy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kid loved it","review":"A very nice story for young kids. The brownie was a bit annoying, but my son didn't notice.

I loved all the details in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cute","review":"When I bought this book, I had already read Inheart and The Thief Lord and was hoping Ms. Funke wouldn't let me down. Well, she didn't! This book is very likeable and a fun fantasy read. Though, as previously mentioned by another reviewer, it isn't as serious as her other works, but more light-hearted. I really enjoyed it, and thought that the author did a good job of putting a clever spin on over-familiarized mystical beasts. Not to mention I was sad when it ended, and that's always a good sign! It's a little slow getting started, but is hardly a drawback at all. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An older reader logs in...review of book on CD","review":"Cornelia Funke's long and occasionally tedious novel is enlivened by Brendan Fraser's imaginative and, dare I say, brilliant vocal performance. The characters, brownies, dragons, dwarves, humans and fairies are all given a different and charming voice my Mr. Fraser. He more than deserves to receive the AUDIE award for his performance. I highly recommend listening to this audio book just to revel in the talent of this man's rendition of Funke's work. Brendan Fraser rocks. I hope to hear him reading more books on tape in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Invitation to Reading Mark","review":"Don Juel's book on the Gospel of Mark will be very helpful to those reading and preaching Mark in this Year B. Juel's work serves both as an introduction to reading the New Testament and a companion to viewing the Gospel of Mark as a self-contained narrative. What I enjoyed most about the work was the way that Juel both explained the narrative strategies of the evangelist and suggested greater theological possibilities. The best example of this is his chapter on \\"The Death of Jesus and the Will of God\\" that is both lucid and spellbinding. Juel's overall thesis that Mark defies our desire to have neat theological and pious interpretations of scripture has filled me with a new understanding and appreciation of the gospel. (By \\"gospel\\" I mean both the evangelist Mark's work, and the good news of the Holy Gospel itself). If you want to go deeper in this under-rated and enjoyable book of the Bible you have no better guide than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marriage Covenant","review":"I love this book!!!! It really explains the blood covenant that God has with man and how he intended marriage to be. It is not a counseling book it is a book of truth. It confirms the rolls of Man, Woman and God in this relationship. We have lost our traditions in this area, but God hasn't changed. There is a pertection in obeying the priciples of God. I highly recomend this book to anyone or all couples who want the full bennifit of what marriage is supost to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why marriage?","review":"A great little book on the biblical foundation of marriage and why God is so concerned about it. Not an institution to be entered into lightly, marriage is not only a picture of God's unfailing love, but it is a life-long commitment of the highest and most sacred degree.I recommend this book for couples who are engaged, married, struggling or considering divorce. Also a must for pastors, lay leaders and biblical counselors. Great study for singles groups, couples and newlyweds."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best teachings...ever!","review":"I watched this video years and years ago and have always remembered it!

It is a constant reminder that my God is a good God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Study of Plantation Architecture","review":"John Vlach's book is a thorough study of the architecture of plantation slavery in the South. He primarily used resource materials from the 1930s Historic American Building Survey and WPA interviews with former slaves to develop a social history. The research is solid and comprehensive. Vlach demonstrates ways to interpret the buildings for information about the life of the people who worked and dwelled in them, and he backs up his conclusions with interview materials. It's a terrific way of studying architecture that merges folklife studies with architectural history. The conclusions expanded my understanding about history, and this book is an essential contribution to learning about black history."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's unconditional love, center of the message of the Word of God to the world.","review":"Good goats is a message by the Linns that already proclaimed a few years back what the encyclical: Deus Caritas Est recently confirmed for the world: God is love, God loves all humans unconditionally. This message for the last millenium was continuously challenge by the theology of Saint Anselme: Jesus sufferd and died to satisfy and pay for our sins, a demand of distributive justice, the justice of an eye for an eye. Benedict XVI stresses that the cross is a \\"non-violent\\" symbol of the love and forgiveness of God for the whole world.... and stresses his conviction that the secular world of today who \\"forgets God\\", suffer from a deep loneliness and therefore needs to hear that God loves the whole world, that the world is DEAR to God.

But I took one bite and had to throw it away. I thought it would have a nice sugary flavor but it just tasted gross. I can't even describe it. Synthetic, maybe? Also, the serving sizes they list on the box are a joke. For example, the box says that 1/4 of mix with 3 tbs of water will make four pancakes. Maybe four nickel-size pancakes. MAYBE. I had to use a whole cup--which probably left only about a cup left in the entire boxI--just to get a pancake a little bigger than a saucer. know this is cheap but do yourself a favor and save your money.

Also, the elastic comes stapled, so you have to adjust them; you should do this anyhow, since everyone has slightly different sized fingers. While these are not ornate like others, they work well. One problem: Because there is only one hole, they tend to move out of place while dancing, which means you have to stop and fix them, or keep playing them the wrong way.

Or is Sci Fi what you yearn for? You will find all three in this delightful book.I had previously read \\"Oxygen\\" and \\"The Fifth Man\\" by Ingermanson and John B. Olson. I liked both books very much, but they were along the lines of more serious Sci Fi. Thus, \\"Double Vision\\" was a bit of a surprise as I found myself chuckling through large sections of it. And biting my nails at other times.I enjoyed the author's wit, the pace of the book, and his three main characters -- all of whom I found likable in different ways. The suspense aspect of the book was very well done. And as for the Sci Fi -- well, I still don't understand quantum physics or the multiverse but I do understand more about photons than I had ever believed possible.Even if you never read Sci Fi, there's a great deal in this book to enjoy. Highly recommended -- I give it 5 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Vision is one book you won't be able to put down!","review":"I just finished the book. It was so good I can't quite find the right word to describe it. Several come to mind; magnificent, wonderful, touching, gripping, suspenseful. I can't settle on one word. It has got to be one of the best books I have ever read, I was crying in several places. God has really blessed Randall Ingermanson with a wonderful gift; he can touch people's hearts and give them God's message in a way that is kind and compassionate. I got a blessing reading this book, especially the church camp part (one of the crying parts). I pray God keeps blessing his writing so that it touches hearts and minds. People are crazy if they don't read this book; it's a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Edge-of-Your-Seat Story!","review":"Randy Ingermanson is a master at characters who stick with you and a plot that has so many twists and turns you have no idea how it is going to end until it does end. Like another reviewer said, I especially found myself engaged with Dillon Richard, a brilliant man who has Asperger Syndrome. Dillon may be smart beyond smart, but he loves the Lord and wants nothing more than to live right for him, even if it means his life in exchange. Dillon has a problem most men would die for. Two women are in love with him. I won't say how it turns out, but I found the ending to be very pleasing. Order this book now. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheesh! What a fun and wild ride!","review":"This book kept my head spinning with all it's twists and turns until the very last page. A romantic thriller filled with suspense and humor, Ingermanson's Double Vision is not to be missed! I especially loved the character Dillon, and the sections written from his point of view. Because of Dillon's Asperger's Syndrome, he is a very unique and engaging character--certainly unlike any character I have read about before. If you want a novel that will thrill you 'till the end, buy a copy of Double Vision today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I'm not sure who wrote this book. I have read Mr. Ingermanson's others books (Oxygen, The Fifth Man, and the time-travel series) and those were good books, tightly written and with some good character depth.This book, on the other hand, is very frivolous, shallow and silly. Maybe there was so much potential that it needed a more thorough treatment in an expanded series but, as another reviewer noted, it's all wrapped up in a nice neat package (with a thousand loose ends that don't seem thought through) so I'm glad to note we won't be seeing this band of goofballs in print again.I'll check out more novels by this author if he continues to write, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A great PVR","review":"My first unit had a defective speaker, Amazon took great care of the situation.

There should be one SELECT button, but there are several, depending upon which menu you are in. Just changing the sound from headphones to internal speaker is difficult. The internal speaker is OFF when it looks like it is on, and ON when it looks like it is off. You must also keep movie file size around 1gb or the playback will only show up to that point! Hooking it up to a home system works, but can be tricky depending upon the number of inputs you have on your home theater system. It is a cool device, but the drawbacks make it not worth the price.

It is quite a change from oh, the Godzilla soundtrack :-) The \\"Main Theme\\" (track 1) has a timeless quality, almost out of place for a violent mystery movie.

The gate is perfect. It is secure in the door which allows my disabled cat to land on the top and then go over. It could be stained to match any wood type or painted. I no longer bang my shin on the gate when I step over yet my dogs can't jump over into the room. My only complaint is that the pin to latch the door is cludgy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the gate, but disappointed with fit","review":"The gate was exactly what I wanted for our little 8 lb dog. However, when putting it together found that the side hardwear that pushes against wall did not match the hardwear that is shown in the picture. What I received were big plastic screws that had to be screwed in from inside the door. Therefore the gate door would not close. I do not know if this was just a one-time mistake at the warehouse or if all the gates are prepacked this way. I did send it back and would love to reorder it if I knew I would not get the same thing again. I was very disappointed. I would have given this a 5 star rating if there was not this problem. Maybe I will take a chance and reorder it again as it was so perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine inexpensive pet gate","review":"This is a fine, inexpensive pet gate for small animals. I have two bichons and it is a perfect height for keeping them out of a room but still being low enough so that I can easily step over the gate. There is a swing out door as well so that you could open it to allow your pet through without a need to take the gate down. For those who think the bumpers don't work well and just \\"spin in the hole\\": They are supposed to be like that. The bumper is two plastic parts around a bolt and it works by spinning the outside ring and away from the disc part that progressively presses against the door frame or wall. The bolt is not supposed to screw tightly into the hole in the wood, it is not a design defect, you are just misunderstanding how the bumper works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not functional","review":"Could not get the gate to secure against door frame. The 4 pieces included with the gate that adjust the tension were not the same pieces as shown on the box and I could not attach them on the one side the door opens because the only way they could be attached was by keeping the door open which defeats the purpose of having a gate. Sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait - don't send it back yet!!","review":"I ordered this gate because it was exactly what I was looking for. Started to set it up, no instructions except for what's on the back of the box (very minimal), but I figured how hard could it be? After 4 different attempts at making the bumper bolts work, I was very frustrated and about to send the darn thing back. Then I looked at the reviews again and found the solution!Find the 4-star review written by alooknac from Montana. She does a great job at explaining how the bumpers are supposed to work. Once you get them on right, the gate works like a charm. My gate didn't have the exact same hardware as in the pictures, either. Don't take the \\"nuts\\" off the bumper bolts, just stick them as is in the holes. Adjust your gate to the right length for your doorway. Then turn the nuts AWAY from the bumpers, toward the gate, to tighten. TA-DA!!Thank goodness for Amazon reviews, and thanks alooknac. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get all parts.

NEVER AGAIN!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking, nice height, easy to use!","review":"This is a great gate for a small puppy or dog. Pressure mounts are easy to use and don't damage walls. Length is easily adjustable, even for fairly wide doorways. It's short enough to step over and for our cats to jump over, but keeps puppy contained. Also, price is reasonable for a well-made wooden gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be much better","review":"Gate is a great height for small dogs and is easy for children to safely step over. Design could be greatly improved if the four rubber side feet were adjustable with a screw like many gates on the market. The rubber feet just slide in so as to not allow for the best and tightest fit to the walls. Good enough for a temporary solution. We used felt chair pads to make up the extra space between the side feet and the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"I should have remembered the old adage you get what you pay for. I admittedly was looking for an inexpensive gate and this one seemed like a bargain.The bumpers are supposed to be adjustable but they do not actually screw into the unit. They just sit in the holes so they are NOT adjustable.I finally got the item to fit into my stairwell opening (the adjustable size claim is not 100% accurate. Your space must be a size to fit one of the sets of predrilled holes the knobs fit into) and after opening and shutting the door twice to make sure it swung over the carpet, it SNAPPED RIGHT OFF! Perhaps I merely received a defective one but I can assure you that I am taking it back to my local PetCo today.Save yourself the aggravation and spend a little more to get a better product.It did arrive very quickly and was in one piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Over Wooden Gate","review":"We have had other gates but this one is the perfect height ( 18').

If you have a dog that is a jumper.....do not waste your time and money purchasing this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for what I needed","review":"The gate was purchased to keep a small dog in a laundry room to prevent accidents while potty training the dog. Worked well for that purpose except the side knobs are not very well constructed as the screws seem to strip in all four places, not allowing for a tight fit int he doorway. So we added shims to hold the gate tight enough that the dog can't know it over. If you can deal with it wearing out very very fast and not working right for the fit, get it. The gate itself is ok, it's the side knobs that don't work properly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gate lasted 2 weeks","review":"Let me start by saying that we have an extremely stubborn miniature Dachsund. Within a couple of days of receiving the gate, Rusty had chewed through the wood, making the gate ineffective. We added a screen to it, which fixed that problem, but soon enough he had figured out how to jump over the gate. He's a small dog, but the gate wasn't quite tall enough to prevent him jumping over it. We raised it, but it still was short enough for him to maneuver over at the right angle.This gate might work well for a well behaved small dog, but isn't quite tall/durable enough for a stubborn dog like ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend.","review":"THis gate sounds great, you can step over it and it installs easily. But the pressure isn't great and it often needs to be re-installed. You have to bend over to open pet door, not good if you have back problems. THe latch pinches your fingers (and your childs'!)

The gate was easy to assemble.

The screws are not supposed to screw into the gate. Another person who uploaded photos describes the installation process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction materials","review":"I own three of these gates for my 3 and 5 pound Toy Fox Terriers. Previously exchanged one of them because it broke. Currently,two of the three here are broken. They are constructed of the cheapest possible pine. Bump one of the little doors and it breaks right off. My smallest dog has chewed her way through three of the slats. Looks like a beaver was at it. I would not recommend this product to anyone who has a dog that likes to chew. I'm back to the metal baby gates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"So far, this is the only unsatisfactory purchase I've had from Amazon. This is the crappiest thing I've bought here. It is beyond flimsy. The screws are too small to actually hold the gate in place and all the wood pieces are falling out of their respective holes. I might as well have thrown 30 bucks out the window. Seriously, this is junk. They had to try hard to produce something This bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described...","review":"I purchased this item, but when I went to install it, the pieces shown in the instructions and in the pictures were not the same as the pieces included in the box.

I called the company and received absolutely no help. They acted as if they didn't understand how that could happen. THEN I read other reviews with the same complaint about the wrong hardware, so I know the company had to have been aware of the problem.

Will be returning for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"I read other reviews, so maybe I was just unlucky. This appeared to be just what I needed to keep one small dog out and allow our 2 cats in. When I opened it, parts fell off of the gate itself. When I tried to put them back on, they didn't fit well. This caused the gate to be uneven, and it wouldn't fit securely in the doorway on one side.

The room is also my home office so I go in and out of this room throughout the day. Also needed something that the cat could easily jump over so she can get in/out of the room. The gate was VERY easy to install and although some reviewers complained about a lack of small adjustment in the gate width, the combination of the gate width adjustment and the four bumpers or wall protectors made it very east to fit. I had it out of the box and install in less than 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very sturdy","review":"I got this for my mini dachshund puppy and for my very narrow doorway. It looked awesome and worked good at first but I had to keep tightening the bolts and now it's been tightened so much it won't stay up. The doorway is awesome and closes good but it didn't always close tight because its only a handle with a spring that you pull. Sometimes the hole didnt line up exactly and I'd think it was closed but it wasn't. The height was perfect until she learned to climb over it! But when I got it, it was already broken and didnt feel like spending money to return it so I just used gorilla glue which worked but I had to keep re applying every week...Overall I'd say I liked the gate but wish it was better quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gates for the price","review":"We needed cheap convenient gates to keep our small schnoodle 13 lbs puppy contained.

It was a slow, laborious, inaccurate process. At times, it seemed that if my finger simply hovered above there would be changes. This is to say nothing of how awkward it was for me to scroll with my index finger.What a boon to find the Logitech VX Revolution!

However, the eject button for the receiver got worn out for some reason after 3 months (my brother has had it over 6 months and it hasn't worn out), and I'm almost on the verge (but not yet) of struggling to get it out. The Logitech SetPoint software conflicted with my laptop mouse sensitivity settings (e.g., settings wouldn't save). So I uninstalled SetPoint and am now unable to customize the button. It's ok though, since the default mouse button settings are useful as it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scroll-wheel too light, middle-button too hard, perfect otherwise","review":"Perfect except(i) that scroll-wheel is too light - the wheel has almost no friction and will happily roll on past intuitive stopping point, so, one has to conciously control it, becoming annoying and ardous after hours of heavy use.(ii) The middle button, underneath the wheel requires significant pressure, so much that one cannot help but unwittingly move the wheel before the press is registered but now in the wrong position.Otherwise, very precise and sensitive. I can move the cursor (mouse pointer) around the screen with slight finger movement, allowing the wrist to stay almost stationary."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY SENT A USED ONE!!!!!","review":"What I received was USED!!!

Quite frankly, I hate this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"There are no better mouse that will surpass this KING!!!","review":"It's worth the money,it's an investment that will put a smile on your face when you order it, when the package arrives, when you unbox it, when you get the feel of it, and when you fully utilize it. That's right, I'm absolutely obsessed with this gadget. I even use it for my desktop, despite the fact that I used to detest wireless mouse. But Logitech proved me wrong, and I absolutely adore this mouse. I dare to vouch for this mouse, you will not be disappointed. VX revolution rules!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Notebook Mouse that I have used","review":"I have used quite a few notebook mice over the years(microsoft and other logitech) and he VX Revolution is by far the best. I currently have 3 of these mice and use them with an IBM laptop (using the logitech setpoint software) and 2 Apple laptops (powerbook G4 and macbook). I don't utilize the logitech software on the Apple machines as I have had problems with it, I utilize Steermouse and it works great (costs @ $20).The main thing that I like about this mouse is the size/shape and the placement of the buttons. With the software I can configure the button actions for the way that I work.I can't recommend this mouse higher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works Intermittently When Selecting","review":"As other reviewers posted, must be the receiver dongle.

A very frustrating mouse..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfy, but.....","review":"I absolutely love this mouse! It is so comfy and the scroll is amazing. I have yet to find another mouse that will equal the power and functionality of this one. Even though they no longer make it, I will probably purchase a second for my home so that I can finally stop carrying it back and forth to work everyday. Only con is that the USB receiver sticks out pretty far, and if you are on a laptop it could break off easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect notebook mouse!","review":"Quality construction, a clever hideaway USB adapter, ergonomic design, and an adjustable scroll wheel, and you have perhaps the best portable mouse available. My only gripe is that the scroll wheel adjustment on the bottom of the mouse is difficult to fiddle with frequently. This is also an expensive mouse but the stowable USB feature alone makes it a worthwhile and practical investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Cordless Mouse","review":"After a lot of searching I decided to try this cordless mouse and I LOVE the back and forward buttons. I would recommend"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Hands down the best mouse I've used. It is comfortable, stylish, and packed with features. The pointer is accurate and smooth. The only change I would make to the mouse is the position of the forward-backward buttons, they are too far back on the mouse making it awkward to use. I would give the green light to anyone considering this mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ridiculously amazing mouse!","review":"I love this mouse. I can't praise how much I love Logitech's products. Forget about purchasing a Mighty Mouse from Apple. The scroll wheel will crap out on you and you'll eventually get sick of it, as I learned. The fact that you can customize the many buttons this mouse has is absolutely amazing. I love it and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech VX Cordless Laser Mouse for Notebooks","review":"Product is well made. Product description use is correct. Another fine product from the folks at Logitech. Well pleased each day, from the use this cordless mouse gives me! Thanks again. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the free wheeling scroll wheel","review":"It makes moving through lengthy documents and web pages a breeze.As some have already noted, the forward/back function keys are not the easiest to use but work OK.The zoom keys are not as easy to use as using the CTRL key/scroll wheel to zoom in and out.It is big for a portable mouse but I like it as I can use it both with my laptop and deskside computer by just moving the USB receiver.Not really the best for any kind of gaming requiring fast, consistent response as it sometimes lags or just doesn't respond.I just got it so no idea of what durability will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best notebook mouse yet","review":"I really like this mouse. After using it for a couple of weeks, I'm still not using all of its capability.. but getting closer. I find that I don't use the Zoom function and for me the side scrolling capability of the scroll wheel is a bit awkward, so I don't use that much either. Yet. I do like the free-wheeling feature of the scroll wheel - can't beat it for long docs. The battery monitor thinks the battery is still good for another 94 days... can't beat that. It's smaller than the MX700 I use with my desktop machine, and I think switching back and forth has slowed my bonding with the VX Revolution. Overall, definitely recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third mouse, VERY poor quality control","review":"Logitech should be embarrassed about their quality control. I've been through three of these. The first broke after 2 months, the second broke after a few weeks, and now, the third is broken right out of the box.Why don't I switch to another brand? Because the scroll wheel is awesome. So if you like the freewheeling scroll, and can put up with a broken mouse every few months, by all means purchase the Logitech Revolution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I got two - both disfunctional","review":"I have two of these; they were OK when I got them, but one started to get \\"jerky\\" movement, and the other - well, just went bonkers.The jerky problem is well documented, just Google \\"VX Revolution jerky trouble\\". I've tried everything, many different mousepads, reloading software, cleaning the LED, all to no avail. After an embarrassingly long time, I finally gave up. It is REALLY picky about mousepad surfaces, but none worked acceptably.The other one has a weird sticky movement of the mouse wheel, but it isn't jerky. It does, however, open up 2 or 3 tabs at a time, and doesn't close them properly either, rendering it totally useless.I paid list price for these junkers.0 for 2 is not a good score.I can't recommend them, obviously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"I searched extensively for a wireless mouse before zeroing in on this one. This is an awesome buy at an affordable price. Works great even at a distance from the laptop and has a good ergonnomic design in its category. The size of the mouse helps me grip it better. I can rest my hand on the mouse without the fear of pressing any of the buttons. The only small glitch I feel is the weight. It would have been even better if the mouse was a little more light. Irrespective I would strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-performing wireless mouse with good ergonomics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"This is a great little travel mouse. Very accurate and easy to setup. I use it for CAD work when travelling, and the customization of the buttons is a real bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I have found the reviews of this product very helpful to determine how good this is and it is infact right. I am extremely happy with this one. The laser is very great and also the setpoint software that comes with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the MX revolution, but still very good","review":"This is a very nice little notebook mouse. It is compact but not so small that it is uncomfortable to use. The extra buttons are handy for browsing the web, but the zoom button is a little awkward to reach. To change between free spin and click mode on the mouse you have to pick it up and fiddle with a switch on the bottom, which is more annoying than the smooth wheel button mechanism on top of the MX revolution (which I also own). If you don't need to carry your mouse around much then I would strongly recommend the MX. However if you are looking for a small ergonomic portable mouse then the VX revolution is one of the best I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing portable mouse","review":"This mouse is very comfortable even though it's smaller, and has more buttons (and of course a better scroll wheel) than I've seen on any portable mouse! It is a great companion to theMX Revolutionsince the button locations are the same. I actually prefer the button configuration on myLogitech MX1000, but that might just be because I'm so used to it. You have to manually change the scroll wheel mode on the bottom of the mouse, but it's not much of an inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Workhorse, Comfortable, Awesome.","review":"Been using this mouse all day long everyday for about 4 years. Everything about it is just great. Lots of buttons that I custom map to improve my productivity, superfast infinite scroll wheel, comfortable and durable.I had gripes early on about the scrollwheel getting dirty and sticking, but that has not been a problem for a long time. Now it's always perfect and fast.I think it's finally starting to crap out, so I will be replacing it with a brand new VX revolution soon. I've looked at newer models, but none have the perfect combo of buttons, comfort, and hyperscroll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great quality construction - 1.5yr lifespan on left click","review":"This mouse feels extremely quality on the construction side. There is one notable issue, I've had 2 of these purchased at roughly the same time. Both lasted approx 1.5 yrs. The left click has started to go on both. At first I thought it was my imagination but, then a buddy started using one of these (I gave it to him due to the potential clicking issue..warned him about it as well).Also when I use the mouse for 3-4 hours it started to cramp my pinky a little.The quality feel of this mouse is awesome - I enjoy the build, button location, everything except the lifespan.. 1.5 yrs till left click dies - very sad.EDIT:I suggest the logitech m705 marathon mouse - it feels almost as good quality-wise and the shape is almost exactly the same.I have a few of the m705s now and find them to be a suitable replacement for the vx revolution"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great VX Laser Mouse","review":"This Mouse is great and amazing in technology.

Left click some times doesn't work and for desktop icon, you need to double click. The wheel will stop working after a while for IE. I have to drag the bar scroll bar and some time even that won't work since left click doesn't work. Before installing and after uninstalling the software, things go back to normal. The second installation is the new version of their software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work for me","review":"The product description says it works on \\"almost any surface,\\" but I have yet to find a surface where it works other than a white counter top.

I am right handed and have struggled with tendinitis in my right index finger. Bought this expensive mouse hoping the effort required to press the buttons on the mouse will be very light. However to my dismay it is quite high even more than the cheap corded mouse'. Not worth it for my use. I need something that will be a relief to my stressed out index finger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Mac compatable","review":"This mouse does a lot of tricks but it doesn't scroll on OS 10.4.8.The Indian suport team of Menaka and Vignesvaran wanted me to test my mouse on an ealier version of OS 10. My Mac upgrades automatically and I don't have a computer test lab. I think that is Logitechs job. I demanded my money back, they refused. They offered a new mouse after I returned this one at my expense. I previously had great respect for Logitech products. Their shabby tech support has changed my opinion and my buying habits.Very dissapointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Nice Design","review":"I liked the style, look and feel of this mouse so much that I could not wait for online shipping and bought one from local Bestbuy. As it turned out, with all those great features like forward/backward button and all, the wheel was so loose and out of control that I had to return it.Then again I really liked the forward/backward button, so I ordered one from online. This time the wheel was even worse. It's way too hyper. It's so fast that it not only would not stop where I want it to but also made my head dizzy. Also the point is a little shaky, even though the rest of the features are really great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Sweet Mouse! Excellent!","review":"Purchased this because I am used to wireless but was stuck with a cordless. So, I wanted a new mouse by logitech but did not like the MX as it was too big, looked weird and did not fit well in my hand.So, I checked out this little guy at a local store and it felt good, not too big, not too small and has all the features I need. I am extremely happy.Pros: Compact, all the standard features and then some. 1 AA battery. This is a big plus as it allows me to use rechargeable (standard off the shelf) batteries - and nothing proprietary. Compact design allows for much longer battery life. Weight is moderate. Not too heavy and not too light.Cons: None yet :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A+++","review":"Great Product! Use it every day, I have the MX Revolution as well, huge fan of Logitech. This item pairs up great with any apple product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it didn't break so often!","review":"I have had this mouse for a year now and it has broken twice. The first time was within 1 month. It just stopped working, no power lights or anything. I called support and they told me there was nothing that could be done, it was user error and the warranty was expired. I troubleshot the mouse myself (through disassembly) and found that the power cable had disconnected from the battery. I soldered it back together again and was back in business, but only for a couple more months. It broke again recently and I'm not sure I'm going to fix it again (if it is the same problem). I have seen others complain about this mouse breaking when they drop it and I can believe it. Logitech, if you are listening a laptop mouse must be DURABLE!, we do travel with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 2, both unreliable after a short period of time","review":"This is unbelievable. As much as I like almost every aspect of the mouse, the build quality is pitiful. The first mouse just decided to stop recognizing button clicks. 2 months later the second mouse sporadically double-click. If I could somehow combine the two I'm sure it'd all work out but as it stands I don't think I can buy or recommend anything made by Logitech anymore. I've bought their stuff for years but I am so put off by this that I'm probably better off just finding another brand I like. Unfortunate, but with so many other similar complaints, it's likely that if I bought another Logitech mouse I'd just encounter the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and unreliable","review":"I've owned this model for one year and have had problems several times. Finally, a few days ago, it just stopped all together. For a piece of hardware that cost me over $50, I expected a longer life! And, of course, the warranty has expired. Very poor quality control at Logitech, that is for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but durability is a concern","review":"This mouse works well, however I will question its durability. It stopped working after falling from the desk to the carpet. The scroll wheel became physically stuck, looks like the components holding the scroll wheel are very fragile.I got a replacement since my purchase was recent, but I wonder what will happen the next time. I bought this mouse exactly to lug it around the office all day, I'm not sure if can withstand the mobility in the long term."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software for this mouse makes Macbooks Freeze and Crash - No Bueno!","review":"Ok, in terms of the mouse itself, it feels nice and all buttons feel and look good. The BIG problem is that the Logitech software that you need to install to be able to program the buttons and scroll wheel causes the Mac to freeze up and crash. As soon as you uninstall the software then the Mac is fine. For reference, I am running a Macbook 2.0 Core Duo with 2 GB Ram and 80GB Harddrive, 13.3inch (black one). So for Mac owners beware. I am returning this mouse back to Amazon. The mouse works but you can't use any of the programmable buttons which kills the whole point of buying a mouse like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"full featured notebook mouse","review":"It is just about the right size and shape to fit comfortably in your hand while still being small enough to travel. There are nearly infinite possibilities for customization of the buttons, which is both a plus and minus. All in all, a comfortable purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOUSE","review":"horrible mouse, i mean can't they not use the 2.4ghz frequency? the mouse lags on any surface, not because of the laser which works great but because of the wireless reciever and the frequency they use. it LAGS and stutters. definately the last logitech mouse im every wasting my money on.

I had to keep moving it for 2-5 seconds to wake it up every time.I tried everything from changing the battery to keep moving the receiver around it. The behaviour has no logic, sometimes works, most of the time doesn't. Cannot understand why ...I conected it to 2 desktops and 1 laptop. Exact same issues....I own 2 Logitech Revolution MX (Desktop equivalent of this) and they work just fine.If anybody has similar issues then I'd say return it. If not, maybe mine was defecive out of the box, which for such an expensive product is inexcusable so 1 star...."},{"rating":"1","title":"In my life - the worst rebate service by Logitech","review":"Logitech has the worst rebate service I have ever dealt with in my life. Took me more than 10 emails/phone calls/letters and spent more than a total of 10 hours to get my $20 rebate from Logitech. It's a joke - Logitech would not set up your rebate program in their computer system unless a lot of customers purchase the item with exact the same rebate program. Or you have to make phone calls everyday to request. Not just me, another guy I know had exact the same bad experience with Logitech rebate center."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product!","review":"This is my first wireless mouse that I have used. I used mainly for a laptop which is great to use. I like all of the extra buttons, it made simple things faster. Such as the side thumb buttons, you can go back or forward on your web browser or back and forth between folders in your computer. The zoom buttons are useful for photoshop.Though the battery life when I used it was around a one month span, depending how often I use it for my laptop. It also seems to lag at certain times because the frequency is the same as wifi. It will only lag for a few seconds or it may also \\"jump\\" to the other side of the screen.I originally paid close to $50 when this first came out and today, I still think it is one of the best wireless mouses out there. Never failed me once nor broke on me. I take care of the electronics I buy.

Has all the right functionality for web browsing, both vertical and horizontal scrolling, hot buttons for page navigation and even key word searches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Solid Mouse","review":"The best laptop mouse I've ever encountered. Bluetooth mice (includingthe logitech one) sleep too often and take too much motion to wake up. The scroll wheel's nice and the horizontal scroll works well with the new software.Until a little while ago, the logitech software for the mac (LCC213) would kernel panic. It's been fixed in the new version, and works wonderfully.You do have to make that choice between using the microgear or not. It takes a second to switch, and you definitely don't want to keep having to switch while multitasking. The zoom buttons are a little weak feeling, but you get used to them. The software lets you configure their mappings per-app, so it can end up being very useful with a few minutes of configuration for the programs that you use most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible support, fragile, fits weird in hand.","review":"At first I loved this mouse because of the features but then the wireless USB adapter bent a little and a resistor came off.I tried to solder the resistor back on but it didn't work all the time so I decided to get help from Logitech. They said I had to buy a replacement part and they didn't attempt to fix it as an warranty item. Their web site had the part to be ordered but their online order form didn't work so I had to call them and order it. I did so, and even after paying a ridiculous amount for shipping such a small part, I still haven't gotten it a month later.Other annoyances are having to change the battery, the battery never fitting right and sometimes coming loose inside while using the mouse, and since it's small, it doesn't fit quite right in my hand even though my hands are small and after using it for 3 months, I never really got used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mouse","review":"As usual, Logitech comes with a great product. That's why I consider it the best mice and keyboard manufacture.I've been using the VX Revolution for almost a month, and I can tell it's very ergonomic, uses low energy from the battery (I think one battery can last for months) and the best of all, it's very precise.Well, it's a great option for laptop users."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very disappointing product","review":"I've bought this mouse to replace my old, legendryV500 logitech mouse notebook.

I would have given it 5*'s, but it doesn't use bluetooth. I'm sure there is a reason that it doesn't use bluetooth, but it's a pain. My notebook has bluetooth built in for a reason, and for a \\"notebook mouse\\" I would think that you wouldn't need to have any extra plugins. On the plus side, the little USB wireless plugin fits into the mouse itself. Also, I'm going to complain about the programmability of the buttons. They're not quite as customizable as I had hoped.Lot's of gripes, but I'll end by saying that this really is a good mouse. I shouldn't have paid so much, but whatever, I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Down","review":"I really like the way this mouse functions, but..After a couple of months, the left button no longer worked consistantly.

I'm not sure if I will bother trying to get it replaced. My old Logitech MX400 is still working well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handy mouse, but unreliable","review":"The features and ergonomics of this mouse are good, but the hardware and performance are unreliable. Out of the box mine was defective. It didn't work unless it was within 2-3 inches of the USB micro-receiver.I returned it and received a replacement which worked perfectly. While it was working the mouse was very convenient, battery efficient and the small size of the USB micro-receiver very handy for use with my laptop. However after about a year of use, the second mouse is now suffering from the same problem. If this mouse was more reliable I would rate it at least four stars, but after having two suffer from the same problem and taking the price of this product into consideration, I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for OS X - wake up delay is way too annoying!","review":"So many great features, lots of buttons, easy to configure per app or globally.One HUGE problem - sleeps quickly and takes 20 seconds to wake up... 20, long agonizing seconds to finally wake up.

WTF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Ozzy fans!","review":"Great stuff. I'm a huge Ozzy fan who has only missed two Ozzfests. This video has excellent high-def video feeds and superb sound. I'd highly recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Starts For Black Sabbath & Trivium (That's It)","review":"This set is very dissapointing. Why the hell weren't Iron Maiden, System of a Down and Slipknot not included o.0 Why are crap like H.I.M. & Bowling for Soup added to this set. This set could have been awesome. The only thing good about the set is Black Sabbath & Trivium. Other that that, CRAP. Avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great if your a ozzfest fan","review":"Got the Blu-ray thinking the quality would be nice and clear, but that was not the case. The interviews were interesting, but that's about it. The tour highlights were not that great, and not sure why they had the rebel flag showing for most of the time, seems like they had a limited film and that's the best they could deliver. IMHO i think this video was created to milk the Ozzfest name, been to the event 4 times and this video does not capture the true feel of the event. Allot of the great bands that made up ozzfest were left out. I think they made this video to get a quick buck. The only positive I saw for this was that the Blu ray was under $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats this?","review":"im from the uk an when i heard they wud add bands from our download/ozzfest i was excited...after all, seeing unearth, every time i die, lamb of god, chimaira, in flames etc on the smaller stage i saw no harm in mixing them with bands like kse, the hanuted arch enemy etc. But whats this? They take the worst bands on download (HIM, alter bridge, bowling for soup shouldnt even be on an ozzfest in the 1st place) and mix it with very few good bands on the US 1. The exclusion of the great bands from both tours wont go down well with many metal fans im sure. Me being one. Sharon has really lost it this time, we all new maiden wouldn make it but putting on trash so you can sell more instead of putting on the bands that have helped create ozzfest what it is today is unforgivable. Dont buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Ozzfest","review":"I went to Ozzfest this year and it was incredible... however, this DVD is not even a shadow of what Ozzfest really was. A LOT of the bands that made it incredible are missing. First of all, there's no Iron Maiden (but i knew they would leave it out). There's no In Flames, no Shadows Fall, no Arch Enemy. Even though Anthrax and HIM are awesome bands, they were not part of the tour. I love Black Sabbath, but it would've been great if they included other songs instead of the same tired War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man. So many songs to pick from to put these.And please, Bowling For Soup??? The Mad Capsule Markets??? Alter Bridge??? WTF??? What the hell is that??? So many GREAT bands on the tour, to fill this DVD with this crap! No thanx!At least they included The Haunted, Trivium and Soilwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's see.........","review":"This is how I've estimated the order to be. I really have my doubts if the Mighty Maiden will be on this dvd. That truely is a shame though because the crowd really seemed to blossom during Maiden's set in Camden.UK Ozzfest (Donnington,UK)Black SabbathVelvet RevolverAnthraxUS Ozzfest (Camden,NJ)Rob ZombieMudvayneShadowsfall& some 2nd stage bandsI was at the Camden show front and center in the pit and didn't notice any cameras during Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, BLS and In Flames. Majority of second stage bands got some footage in and so did Muds and SF. If my thoughts are correct this will not be a history dvd. Just contain footage from this year and backstage perspective. Overall I don't expect much, it'll be a nice souvenir, thats all. Sharon knows people will buy it just for the name and that fact that somewhere down the line everyones been to an Ozzfest. If there are any disappointed Maiden fans I recommend their 'Death on the Road' dvd which will out the same date as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Drugs Really Got To Ozzy","review":"This is NOT a good retrospective on Ozzfest. It even gives it a bad name! If I were to make this DVD, I would:1. add footage from the previous Ozzfests, from the first one in 1996 to 20052. if not that, give it a more appropriate title without the anniversary part in it3. add the WHOLE 2005 lineup to it. this includes Iron Maiden and Black Label Society, Ozzy.4. take out the Bowling For Soup sets. give me a break here! they're a joke and NEVER played OzzfestWhat a joke for a anniversary set. Well, I guess Ozzfest will sink down to its own demise while Sounds of the Underground, Gigantour, and Wacken will make their way up. Shame on you, Ozzy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this crap?","review":"You know, just like everyone else on here, i went to Ozzfest also. The Dallas show was just amazing. So when i heard that they were going to release a DVD/CD combo, I was so stoked that i thought i would die. I mean, Ozzy, KSE, Mudvayne, Zombie, BLS, and all of the other kick ass bands that played on Ozzfest on DVD/CD was just was going to be awesome right? Wrong. When they relased the line up, I laughed and thought that it was a joke. I was hoping that it was a joke and they would state it was, but then a month went by and the line up was still the same. I mean H.I.M., Alterbridge, Bowling for soup? WTF..... I like alterbridge, but not on an Ozzfest show. The others make me sick. It saddens me that they tarnished the Ozzfest name with this crap. Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!","review":"I read what was on this dvd and decided; I would rather let hell freeze over before buying it. I can't believe it. Zakk Wylde has played with Ozzy, spoken for Ozzy and did nothing but support Ozzy and they didn't even put BLS on this DVD. Also no Maiden! How could you disrespect the GODS of metal. I can't believe that theres nothing to do with Pantera or any former Ozzfest bands either. You would think that w/ Dimebag's (A symbol and martyr of metal)death they wouldn't even put any Pantera or pay any tribute to him. Don't get me wrong; I support Ozzy so much because he's a metal god, but theres only like four good bands on here including, Velvet Revolver, Black Sabbath, Trivium and Rob Zombie. I just can't believe they would do this and put Bowling for Soup on there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Ozzfest 2005 without Iron Maiden? Zilch","review":"What was Sharon Osbourbe thinking? First, she invites the legendary Iron Maiden for the 10th Ozzfest, then insults them on their last gig in front of a 40000+ strong crowd and then, tries to celebrate this with a DVD? This DVD does not feature the one single band that made this Ozzfest special - Iron Maiden. I went to Ozzfest 2005 only to see Iron Maiden. I didn't care for any other bands out there-screaming and yelling. In fact, Ozzfest 2005 was so damned successful only because of Maiden. There were loads and loads of Maiden fans there who left as soon as Maiden were done with their set.Plus, the worst part about this DVD is that Ozzy's faithful pet dog - Zakk Wylde's band is not featured on this DVD! His performance was tolerable and would have justified 10% of the total cost of this DVD. Now the DVD is worthless. It is a waste of precious American Dollars. Avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ave Maria Gregorian Chant CD","review":"Great CD. My wife and I listen to it almost daily. We even use it for prayer sessions.

A Chinese immigrant with two young children, works two different jobs when she hears about a big marketing ploy that is great but when she works herself to the bone, and does what is required in order to get a check, she is taken and arrested. The kids don't know where she is. And the young boy sensing something amiss, decides to take the emergency money out of the bank and make his inventions and sell it on the street. Now, to me that is ingenious, because the kids has heart. The ending comes on a semi happy note, but it makes you wonder. They could have gotten hurt, abused, exploited, but they took care of each other and did what they had to do. For the spunk,bravery and can do spirits. For that, this film deserves five shoot more like TEN stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"These rechargeable batteries are by far the best out there for the price.

There was no humor either. The first chapter was odd and uninteresting. Reading the first half wasn't worth it. The second half was pretty much the same except it was worth reading it. In the 23rd chapter, the McMummy is on the loose at the women's beauty contest. It was sad when it died. However, the ending was a happy ending when Mozie planted the two baby mummy pods."},{"rating":"2","title":"the sound of Brazil","review":"This CD is hobbled with a bad title and boring cover art. There should have been some attention paid to the soft and mesmerizing Barzilian rhythms that permeate the music.

It's a perfect antidote to stress...try it after work, with a cool glass of your favorite beverage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"As much as I enjoy these performers, I have to recommend against this CD. I found that the recording contained a few enjoyable tracks, but that this mostly sounded like \\"one-off\\" hastily produced recordings done with little thought, effort or (despite the title) passion. John Pizzarelli has recorded other instrumental CDs , and I would recommend Contrasts before this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush IS big and fat AND an idiot. But.....","review":"Al Franken certainly did give some insight to the Republican Party and the Christian Coalition. He showed one side of the double standards that plague our nation. I am definetly a democrat because I cannot afford to be a republican, and I am very open minded to both sides until I can be swayed one way or the other. Way to go Al!!! I AM SWAYED!!!!!! By the way, HEY RUSH, WRITE A BOOK WORTH READING, YOU BOZO!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining enough to recommend","review":"I am a liberal, so I certainly was entertained by _Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot_. However, I was expecting more than hit-and-miss humor from the sharp mind of Al Franken. Mainly, he rehashes arguments traditionally levelled at Limbaugh, conservatives, etc. and unfortunately offers few new observations. In this regard, _Idiot_ is best regarded as an anti-conservative compendium rather than a manifesto. I did not enjoy the cheap shots at Limbaugh's weight (remember, I'm a soft-hearted liberal), but much of the rest of the book is very humorous. Superior books in this vein are _We're Right, They're Wrong_ by James Carville and _The Way Things Aren't: Rush Limbaugh's Reign of Error_ by Steven Rendall, Jim Naureckas, and Jeff Cohen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very delightful and entertaining tome.","review":"I found Mr. Franken's book very entertaining, although very one sided, but I guess that was the point. There were several times when I actually found myself laughing out loud at his charecterisation of members of the Republican Party. And although the title of the book would suggest Rush Limbaugh would incur the full rath of Al's pen, he spent very little time \\"slamming\\" the rotund talk show host. A lot of time was spent talking about Republicans in general and the political landscape of 1995-96.I also gained new insight as to Al Franken as a person. I did not know, for example, that he was a Harvard grad. He also appears to have a firm grasp on current events and politics. More so than you would expect from an SNL'r not Dennis Miller.Overall, the book is definitely worth the time and an easy read. I rated it at 4 stars. If you are a Republican or conservative (not that the 2 are mutually synonomous), then you'll probably give it a \\"-6\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franken's Idea of Life","review":"This is a funny and outrageous look at the life and opinions of the modern and unrespected Al Franken. The only attention that he gets is a hilarious Will Ferrell impression from Saturday Night Live. Franken is a very judmental man, but he does it in a way that means well. He looks at the characters in our modern society and evaluates them by the content of their character, just like Martin Luther King, Jr. wanted it. Franken does have some personal problems, but he does a good job at doing away with them through making them public. Nothing racist or offensive in this book, just good humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"So easy, yet so hard.","review":"It would seem so easy to attack Rush Limbaugh. The man is an egotistical, self centered, information manipulating boob. But Al Franken, who must have written this book between skits at SNL (which is also about 30% funny), seldom rises above the level of criticisms about Rush's weight. And unlike PJ O'Rourke, who he has been compared to, you get the sense that Al really doesn't feel comfortable criticizing the \\"liberals\\". It could be that he doesn't want to lose his good friends in power by criticizing them. A true comedian sees the humor in everything. Al Franken does not. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining enough to recommend, but sometimes obnoxious","review":"A book with Rush Limbaugh on the title has got to polarize people, just like the reviews here suggest.I am a fan of Rush Limbaugh, and I enjoyed both his books: See, I told you so, and Way Things Ought to Be. As I identify myself as a libertarian, I agree with Rush more often than not, and consider myself a mostly conservative.However, that being said, Frankin's book is entertaining enough for me to recommended, once you get past the rabid attack on Rush. So long as you take it for what it is, political satire, most of it can be entertaining. I chuckled more often than not, even though Frankin can be pompous and very, very, very obnoxious at times. Mostly he comes across as funny.Be warned that if you are a conservative, you might find yourself gritting your teeth and wondering what village is missing its idiot (Frankin). If you are a liberal, I'm sure you'll find yourself giggling like a schoolgirl caught in a tickle attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do dittoheads comprehend satire?","review":"It's hilarious to see Limbaugh skewered by his own method (resorting to name-calling), and equally hilarious to read the comments of those who just can't seem to figure that out. I particularly enjoyed the conversations with RL's fact-checker(\\"easiest job in America\\")... Although it seems most people already know how they feel about Limbaugh and his ilk, this book would make a great litmus test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Humor and Decent Rebuttal","review":"Franken's book succeeds in poking fun at Limbaugh, and should satisfy any reader seeking to read it for the humor. But if one is seeking to find a refutation of Limbaugh's beliefs, this is only a decent source. A better source though is The Great Limbaugh Con by Charles Kelly. I highly recommended it for anyone who disagrees with Limbaugh, or anyone who agrees with him and is open minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar comedy from a subpar presence","review":"Satire or no, if Franken can't print an economic graph without an obscene scribble on it, why should I believe it's true? And as for Rush and other conservatives being mean-spirited, I don't know of any who have titled a book so obnoxiously. Which political party believes that Individuals of any race or creed can't succeed on their own, and therefore need govt \\"help?\\" Hint: It ain't Repubs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless You're a Left-Wing Extremist, Don't Waste Your Time","review":"If you read it thinking maybe this time Franken will be funny, you'll be disappointed. If you read it thinking Franken will give some new political or media insight, you'll be disappointed. If you want to join the bandwagon of angry left-wing mud-slinging, you will not be disappointed. Franken used to perform a boring little segment on SNL in which he spoke to himself in the mirror. He repeatedly self-affirmed his superior self-worth. I think perhaps he is the character and has expanded his philosophy to include the repeated process of tearing all those around him that differ in philosophy. More's the shame for him. We do not truly elevate ourselves by insulting others. There is always room for political differences and even humorous commentary on those differences. But there is never a call for mean-spirited slander. Reader, rise above the hate and do not bother wasting your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's the idiot?","review":"How about this: Al Frankin is a big fat idiot! You lefties claim to be victims of hate from the Right, but loook at this book's title. Is Frankin so stupid that he can only conjure words like \\"big,\\" \\"fat,\\" and \\"idoit.\\" He could've said, \\"...is an enormously rotund fool.\\" But Al, not Rush, is the idiot. I suggest to all you people going ga-ga over this bound scrap paper should try thinking with a standard human intellect."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are BOTH IDIOTS!!","review":"Both Franken and Limbaugh are self-serving celebrities and, of course,IDIOTS!.

Please confine you statements to the quality of the contents of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mentioning Rush Limbaugh in your title WILL boost sales!!!","review":"Other than that, however, I found little substance in this otherwise unfunny book. My sister-in-law purchased my copy as a gift, knowing I listened regularly to Rush. I thought that maybe Al Franken would have something of interest to say regarding Rush --- instead, he just poked fun at Limbaugh's weight, which is somewhat out-of-date now (Has Franken even SEEN Rush lately?) I never thought Franken was that funny to begin with. He's even less so in print. Note to sister-in-law: Next time I'd prefer a gift-subscription to the LIMBAUGH LETTER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad i did not buy this...","review":"I read it, it's interesting.

Even Ingraham's book \\"Shut UP ...\\" addresses the issues from left to right, up and down; whereas, Mr. Franken (now wallowing in oblivion after FOX Network's dumb suit brought him 15 minutes more of fame) just presents his, well, \\"better\\" opinion(s) for all of us. I once met Mr. Franken in a social setting. His boorish behavior he considers amusing; his typed words in his books he considers intelligent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh....","review":"I was intrigued by Al Frankens hatred for Rush Limbaugh so I got the book. It had the opposite effect than what Al was looking for. I want to listen to Rush to laugh at him and listen to his supposed stupidity.

I am glad I got it at the library...."},{"rating":"1","title":"let's not resort to name calling","review":"I suppose the way to win an arguement is to attack the opposition personally? So often liberals that can't win arguements resort to this. Stuart Smalley (Al's signiture SNL character) would have writen a better book. Not a single sentence backs his arguements. I'm willing to listen to the opposition if they have an arguement. This book doesn't. Constantly criticizing Rush's weight (which makes little sense now considering Rush is thinner than HE is now!) and spouting vulgarity about his past. Praising homosexuality and CHOICE of immorality....Christians-don't even touch this book.

I guess the title just about says it. I remember seeing Al Franken on the old SNL, he seemed like a happy, normal guy.

It's loaded with inaccuracies and lies of Mr. Franken's own. The cheap shots come across as hateful rather than funny. The arguments given to support his positions are embarrassing. I appreciate someone having a strong political position but those positions should be based on rational thinking, not demagoguery. Mr. Franken should stick to humor and leave politics to those with a little more intellect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but far to leftist","review":"Al Franken and Rush Limbaugh deserve each other much in the same way Bill Clinton and Kenneth Starr deserve each other. Both are idiots in some way. The book is fairly funny, but just too darn liberal in its approach. Franken believes in large government taking care of all problems, big taxes to punish productive people, handouts to those that don't want to work and he would advocate for homosexuality to be portrayed positively in every classroom. Thats great liberal thinking but too liberal for most Americans to swallow. So read the book for the humor but don't get caught up in his nonsensical political point of view. Rush has some faults, but Franken able to match most of those with equal or greater idiocy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical liberal name-calling coupled with failed satire","review":"Al Franken's attempt at humorous satire falls flat because it is obvious he has a real axe to grind. An ordinarily talented comedy writer, Franken cannot disguise his loathing for Limbaugh. The title says it all. The only people that get a laugh from this book are fellow liberals that hate conservatives. Rush must indeed be doing a good job of exposing liberal nuttiness if he has irritated Franken to the point of writing this sorry excuse for a satire. Methinks the author IS HIMSELF what he calls Rush. And my guess is that Rush is laughing all the way to the bank with the additional free advertisement. Stick to short comedy skits Al, and restrict your political hate satire to the New York leftist cocktail parties you attend. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick and Twisted","review":"If you enjoy giving your money to someone as sick and twisted as Al Franken, buy this book.

Instead of making observations that have any sane foundation, Al Franken instead resorts to a kindergarden mentality of simply calling names i.e. the book's title \\"Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot.\\" Give it up, this book is simply a stale attempt to descredit a man who has actually earned the right to comment on political events. If you want to read a kindergardener's name calling masterpiece, read this book. If you want to learn and think for yourself, listen to Limbaugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"For an author of reputed intelligence and sophistication, this book is very disappointing.

The title of this book is really a description of far too great a percentage of its content--sniping at Rush Limbaugh over his build as if both were still in junior high. There are entire chapters given over to it. Is this the same guy who played \\"Saturday Night Live's\\" effete Stuart Smalley, who treated his own identity crisis using a mirror? I felt cheated, after buying both of Limbaugh's books so that I'd know what I was talking about when I took issue with his ideas with Conservative acquaintances (they only SAY Liberals are knee-jerk naysayers).

He definitely has a great potential as a writer. I will also admit that many of his criticisms of conservatives are right on target. However, Franken, just like Limbaugh, often oversimplifies complex issues and indulges in unnecessary Ad Hominem attacks. For example, calling Buchanan \\"a Nazi lover,\\" even if it was meant as a joke, is hardly appropriate. Most of the serious conclusions in this book are supported more often by wit than common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat or thin, Limbaugh's still an idiot","review":"If ever there was a self-serving, egotistical, pusillanimous bag of wind that deserved skewering it's got to be El Rushbo. What's great about this book is that Franken took pains to do some research (or to have his researcher do some research) to show exactly where Limbaugh's pompous pronouncements veer rather wildly from reality. There have actually been other books devoted to pointing out specific instances of Rush inaccuracies/gross exaggerations/half truths/outright lies, but this one gives you the most yuks for your buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Book I've Ever Read","review":"Al Franken is one of the harshest authors I've ever read. The index is nothing but insults for Rush. I also enjoyed his new amendments for the Bill of Rights and his proposal for the 26 chip system to protect his children from everything.

HERE I AM!!! But very soon I found that his daily tidal wave of liberal-directed rants and raves often contained some truly absurd, albeit eloquent contradictions - Al has written an entire book on this perception. His description of Rush's particularly unsubtle [presmumeably unpaid] \\"plug\\" for his own merchandise is hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A big fat hit","review":"FRanken's book put the big noisemaker squarely in his sites and hits his target repeatedly. Taking Limbaugh's books and dismatling them almost quote by quote Franken never relents in his attacks against the dj turned political freak. Franken takes potshots, cheapshots, and honest-to-goodness kill-shots at Rush and basically turns Limbaugh's shoot-from-the-hip style against him. All this can basically be found at news and media watchdogs website like FAIR (who constantly uncovers Rush's lies and dis-information)but Franken delivers them with a wink and a punch. This book was really the first salvo against the mighty Limbaugh who enjoyed absolute AM radio dominence in the 1990s and actually brought about his slow steady decline (which only opened the door for other right-wing haters/nazis such as Michael Savage and Bill O'Reilly).

This book is a satiric look at the whole game of politics. I loved the way he mimicked Limbaugh's style; it was priceless. Some of the chapters had me laughing out loud. I did find the book a little long, slow, and inconsistent at times. He took the jokes a bit to far (especially the fat jokes) so they lost their effect.

First of all, I think this opus is one of the most insidious piece of literature put out by the left, tantamount to Shavian-level genius. Second, Franken is intellegent enough to know that if he wrote a book criticizing this person for the Republican party, that his (Limbaugh's) blind followers would by it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, so the book is full of contridictions and bending over for a cheap laugh along the way, blah, blah, blah. So what?

For crying out loud, 2nd graders do that kind of thing. So is Mr. Mauro's book: Al Franken Is a Buck-Toothed Moron'. How immature can you get?

I guess they will never get over the fact that Republicans went to war and won against a terrible regime. I have also read Franken's book criticizing the Fox News Channel and I must say that I see the same poor writing in this book. The title alone proves how immature liberals are, and that they don't have anything to say against republicans except by resorting to personal attacks. I have yet to read a leftist book that gets the author's various points across without exposing his own hypocrisy. The least you can do is think up a more catchy title that does more than just slander somebody's looks and personalities; try Dereliction of Duty: The Eyewitness Account of How Bill Clinton Endangered America's Long-Term National Security for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al Franken is a sick, perverted Socialist","review":"This book is so dull and sick, that it probably makes Stuart Saves his Family seem funny (Oh wait, you probably didn't see it either). Franken's humor is aimed at Limbaugh's weight rather than his political ideas. In the process of insulting obese Americans, Franken also manages to slide in sick Mormon, pornographic, abortion, and Christian value jabs. Not only is this dark humor insulting to American traditions and the US Constitution, but there are no humorous aspects. Perhaps if he understood Limbaugh's conservative doctrine he could make a decent argument in this horrid monograph. But unfortunately, Franken's intellectual lapses forces him to resort to \\"fat\\" jokes and manipulative tactics in gaining conservative resources.

Franken has penned the funniest, most entertaining book about politics in a long time. He's a \\"take no prisoners\\" liberal, and whiny republicans will attack him for it.

It doesn't, it's a a bended satanic book, breaking the rule(s) that most American's were brougt up by, \\"Treat others, as you would have others treat you\\".****Holy Bible, Koran, Tora, ect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid way too much for this book","review":"I picked up a copy of this book at a yard sell for twenty five cents. It reminded me of a joke that I heard about a man that went to the doctor complaining that he was so smart he could not related to people. The doctor told him that he had a machine that he could hook him to and decrease his IQ. The man agreed to try it and asked to by reduced from an IQ of 250 to 125 which is on the high side of average.The doctor put him on the machine and stepped out for a moment and forgot about his patient. When he returned the machine said that he had an IQ of ten. Quickly turning the machine off, the doctor asked, \\"Are you alright?\\" The man responded ,\\"10-4 good buddy!\\"This is how I felt after reading this book.

I see the blood sucking liberal media has resorted to childish name-calling now. Pretty sad. I guess this book's title sums up pretty well the mind set of the liberals in this day and age: Frustrated, immature, and un-willing to accept the times that we live in. Ah well, to Al Franken[stein], I have a message, and I'll deliver it in a form I'm sure that his childish mind will be able to understand; \\"Sticks and Stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic.","review":"Rush Limbaug is a person that has a lot of enemies.

He should have stopped while he was ahead.This book, while having flashes of humor, is betrayed by it's title and it's author's inability to stray from jokes that my 4 year old woould think are \\"too easy.\\"For the 45 cents it will cost you to get your own copy (compared to $14.00 to get a \\"used copy\\" of anything Limbaugh has written), you can almost get a whole can of soda pop. I'd keep the cash, look for 20 more pennies, and enjoy a refreshing drink!The only number to shrink faster than Rush's waist size was the price of this book. While Rush is no longer \\"Big\\" or \\"Fat\\", and never has been an \\"Idiot\\", this literary dung pile still languishes in obscurity.

Okay, I just wanted to get in that line, which I think is a clever one. But seriously, before making any judgments about Limbaugh, actually listen to his program for a couple of weeks. Yes, he has some annoying schticks, but overall he makes a lot of sense - if you're the kind of person who dreams of America not as it ever was but as it was supposed to be - the ideal, Americns of all races, creeds and colors, legal immigrants, et al, standing on their own two feet and making this country great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al Franken is a Big, Fat, Sorry Excuse of a Comedian","review":"This book is just another attempt to revive his lame career in the entertainment business. Al Franken is about as funny as watching grass grow. Anyone see Stuart Saves His Family? What a piece of ... that was. Al Franken was never funny on Saturday Night Live, has never made a funny movie or written a funny book. Give it up Al, you ..., whenever your stupid bit was on SNL, everyone changed the channel. If all you have is your stupid Stuart Smalley character, you are truely pathetic. Your impersonations on SNL ... too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush is a big fat money-laundering junkie crook!","review":"We already know Rush has been addicted to \\"hillbilly heroin\\", but now we find out that he was also involved in illegal transactions to launder money for his supplier. It's incredible how far his fans will go to apply a different standard to judge their \\"hero\\".I think Rush and his supporters misinterpret the title of this book. The phrase \\"big fat lie\\" refers not to the literal weight of a lie, but to it's figurative dimensions. Similarly, a \\"big fat idiot\\" is someone whose idiocy appears unbounded. It should not be taken as a literal reference to their BMI. Whether Al Franken or Rush Limbaugh are currently at their ideal body weight is irrelevant to a critique of their opinions.In addition, a man who slandered the then 13-year old Chelsea Clinton by calling her the \\"White House dog\\" deserves every cheap shot he gets.

But nontheless, this book is worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Al couldn't have spent more than a week on this, and is obviously coasting on his Saturday Night Live fame. It's unclear if this book (which isn't fat) was supposed to be provocative or humourous, because you can't print a laugh track. I challenge any reader to find two decent jokes, which, even then, would come to $3 per weight reference. So why? Save your six bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very convincing arguement.","review":"Although disguised as a satire, the author tries to convince the reader that conservatism (exemplified by Rush Limbaugh) is a failed political platform. Unfortunately, like all liberals, he doesn't let facts get in the way of his argument. The book is somewhat vulgar, in spite of the fact that Al Franken is a rather funny fellow. This book did, however, reinforce my conservative beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies","review":"Lies, lies and distortions. Al Franken is a BIG FAT LIAR. Try listening to the real deal.

However, he has failed miserably with this book. His \\"humor\\" is either not funny or just insulting (at times, both). It is quite likely that the success the book enjoyed was due mainly to people who loved the provactive title (one wonders how well the tome would have done had it only had Franken's name on it. For example, anyone remember \\"Late Line\\" or \\"Stuart Saves His Family\\"?). Do yourself a favor if you want to laugh at something with an occasional political tinge and read \\"Rants\\". And Al Franken, do yourself (and everyone else) a favor. Leave the political humor to Dennis Miller, someone who knows what he's doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written insult book","review":"Mr. Franken is undoubtedly trying to be the Left's answer to Rush Limbaugh, but he has failed miserably in the task. Instead of matching Limbaugh's books that contain substantial philisophical ideas mixed with humor, Mr. Franken has only succeeded in making an insult book that probably would have come and gone without notice if he hadn't put Limbaugh's name in the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Core Power / Innovative / Grounding / Fun!","review":"Sadie's CorePower DVD is awesome! It has a flow that leaves you feeling not only energized but grounded when you are done. Constant reminders to activate the core have me doing it even as I sit here. It becomes a mantra to keep in mind through all movement. Her waterfall warrior and fists of fire, for example, I haven't seen in any other video or class, and they add so much to the poses they are incorporated into. And my gosh, the workout! It really targets areas that you forgot you owned, if you choose to go to your own edge. She does offer alternatives for the difficult moves so you can choose your own workout level as you go.

As a result I've often had to practice to dvd's in locker rooms of arenas, or my hotel room.What I've discovered is that most of the dvd's I've used haven't exactly hit the mark for me. Either the workout's been a little low key, or unchallenging, or the presentation may have been \\"all too wonderful / new agey\\". Sometimes the music was so lame it was distracting.Until NOW.Sadie's dvd is direct, challenging, but spiritually connected without feeling \\"cheesy\\".I highly recommend this dvd.

What I have always appreciated about her teachings is her cool blend of physiological athleticism and grace in presentation. This DVD is the next best thing to being there. Sadie's elegant combinations of poses and movements are in a format that is smooth and easy to follow.

She does a great job of allowing the body to cool while incorporating some core work. Your abs will feel this one.

It's a let-down from the other version; the interview with Arthur Rankin (informative) is missing, the scene where Yukon finds his dream as Rudolph and Santa are leaving Christmastown is cut out (one of the key scenes deleted from the TV airings to make room for ads) again, yet the question on the trivia game on it is there. The Destiny's Child video is okay for the younger audiences but..me, I have an idea; why not a little info and maybe footage of who first popularized the song in the first place: Gene Autry?I just ordered another copy of the older edition from 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually great, Soundtrack Problems","review":"First of all, let me say that this is my favorite TV special of all time and this DVD is visually excellent and clear, however, there's seems to be something wrong with the music soundtrack. On several songs, it sounds as though someone is messing with the Pitch control for the music, making it sometimes unbearable to listen to. This is especially apparent during \\"There's always Tomorrow.\\" It sounds so off key in spots, you want to cover your ears. I hope Sony realizes this defect and reissues it with a fixed soundtrack. Until then, I guess I still have to watch the VHS version. I was looking so forward to getting this on DVD and was extremely disappointed by it.

Truly, you are better off getting an old used VHS version of the program, as the \\"bonus\\" features of this DVD re-release are insignificant (no \\"making of\\" features, interviews, or anything like that).Surely a program this beloved deserves an actual restoration using the original source materials (if they exist) for both film and soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer is a Classic!","review":"They've done a great job restoring this little movie.

I have always loved it, and the story. The animation is clever, and charming.Anyway, this story is about a cute little fawn named Rudolph. It starts out with his birth, and unlike haveing a black nose like the other deer, he has a lovely (at least in my opinion) glowing red nose. His parents are embarassed by him, and try to cover it up with mud to make it appear normal. Later, as he gets a little older, he is shunned by the other deer just for being different. Even Santa Claus hates him (yes, in this movie he is a real mean jerk). But Rudolph's crush-Clarice likes him for who he is. I shall say no more, but this movie carries a strong message: It doesn't matter how great-looking you are on the outside- but how beautiful, and kind you are on the inside. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the memories","review":"Christmas wasn't christmas without Rudolph the red nosed reindeer and Frosty the snowman.I grew up watching these timeless masterpieces.My children and my grandchildren look forward every year to Rudolph the red nosed reindeer and never tire of the story of that stormy night in christmas town and the plight of the cartoon characters.

As a result the dialogue starts before the characters start to move their mouths and then ends and the mouths continue to move!!! I hoped that at some point the audio would get back on track, but from beginning to end it never improves, making the whole show painful to watch.HOW on earth could so obvious a defect have been overlooked? It is outrageous that this sub-standard product made it past quality control and was passed on to unsuspecting customers. Sadly, this is not the only problem with this version of Rudolph.

Definitely worth watching every holiday season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Classic","review":"\\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" is an enchanting classic narrated by Burl Ives that kept my full attention as a child and is still wonderful to watch. Rudolph encounters rejection from friends and family and runs away from home when he is fortunate to meet Hermey, an elf who longs to be a dentist, and Yukon Cornelius, a gruff miner looking for gold. On their way, they sail to the Island of Misfit Toys promising to let Santa know of their neglected existence. After a horrible storm threatens visibility, Christmas is almost \\"canceled\\" until Santa discovers Rudolph's shiny nose.Catchy Christmas songs and animation makes \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\" a wonderful addition to anyone's movie collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"way too complicated for most people","review":"\\"Supertraining\\" is just too complicated for anyone looking for workout ideas.

Inspired by Bram Stoker's classic, Dracula. The album pays homage to Stoker's work and delivers on ALL levels. Musically and production wise, the album is top notch!(contrary to what another reviewer stated), with its gothic choirs, pipe organs, piano, rich orchestrations/stings, drums/percussion, tolling bells, narrative work and with well executed sound effects sprinkled throughout. Every track is captivating and pulls you in as the listener. This is a gothic-horror musical masterpiece! and does Bram Stoker proud. I am happy to say that I am the proud owner of this album and I know you will be too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mood music","review":"This is EXCELLENT mood music for halloween parties, role playing games, ghost story telling etc. Nox mixes little flashes of techno with what is recognizable as classic pulp horror film music to create that creepy mood that you need from time to time.

My favs are pinhead, blitzkrieg bop, the crusher, rockaway beach, rock and roll high school, i wanna be sedated, the kkk took my baby away exc... I LOVE all of the songs actually!!!!

These were originally designed as broadcast programs for educational television and within classrooms. The instructional videos came later. The style is intentionally filled with humor and some silliness. The idea is that enjoying the program will bring one to pay more attention to it and to learn better, sometimes in spite of oneself. The programs state that they are no substitute for the regular classroom instruction. My child and I have both learned a great deal from the Standard Deviants programs, the language DVD's as well as math, science, grammar and literature. They are very enjoyable and educational as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"sham products - crap for profit by misleading public","review":"These Standard Deviant products are shams. The producers hire a bunch of theater students who know nothing about the subjects taught (I unwittingly purchased SD Physics and Spanish at the same time). These actors read scripts with the most innane material, try to be funny and cute (but they are bad actors to begin with and not funny). I suspect they are hired based on whether they are attractive, and I wonder if they are even paid for their efforts. Anyway, SD products do not teach well or entertain. The material is taken directly from textbooks and read verbatim by \\"aspiring actors\\" with grossly inadequate explanation.

I got this newer version to see what they did with the original 1945 movie. VERY DISAPPOINTING. No Way does this compare to the brilliant, witty, frightening, etc. movie made way back when. This one focuses more on the sexual deviate garbage than the whole story of \\"selling your soul to the devil to stay young\\". Also, the new actors renditions cannot begin to compare with original actors: The Great Sardonic George Sanders & Hurd Hatfield.Hollywood needs to stop trying to recreate the Old Classics: They never hold a candle to the original movie. This dvd is so vulgar & trashy, I refuse to even donate it.THIS ONE GOES IN THE TRASH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not watch this if you are interested in the book","review":"I am a big fan of Colin Firth, so was excited to see that he was in an adaptation of Dorian Grey. However, the story line of this movie has VERY little to do with the novel. They created a whole big deal about Dorian's grandfather beating him and completely revised the sequencing and occurence of events. If you want a movie with sex, drugs and Victorian rock & roll, watch this movie. If you want a movie version of The Picture of Dorian Grey, avoid this version. So sorry, Colin, but you should have read the book before you consented to the script!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over!","review":"We never finished watching this.

Maybe it would have all come together at the end, but we just couldn't continue watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD_","review":"I didn't 'love' it_ but I liked it a lot. Colin Firth was excellent in this movie. Ben Barnes was only good in comparison- It was on the dark and sexually charged side- but it didn't commit fully- it could have been darker and sexier and been a better movie- I guess the best way to explain my opinion of the movie is that I liked it- but I felt it could have been 'more'- so I couldn't help but also be a little disappointed. The special fx for the painting was pretty cool- but even that they didn't show too much of until the very end.You do get to see some of Ben Barnes without clothes on. Mostly torso shots- but there is one scene where you get to see his back side_ he's kinda skinny and pasty- he could have put on some more muscle tone and a bit more bulk. His clothes make you think he's built better than he really is- not that he doesn't look good naked- he does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow downward spiral into depravity","review":"This movie was excellent. It was interesting to watch the main character as he wrestled with his inner demons and succumbed to peer pressure simultaneously. His downward spiral into depravity was enthralling an enjoyable to watch.

I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no n o NO NO!!!!!!!","review":"It\`s been years since I read the Great Novel, but it seems to me that this product only uses the frame of the story; great lines and monologues from the Master Wilde is worked over, deleted or simplified....Ben Barnes may be physically right, but his personality is all wrong....Stick to the 1944 MGM version and - I know a lot of people hate it, but I don\`t; - and the haunting 2006 up-date with David Gallaghar...."},{"rating":"1","title":"So horribly bad","review":"From the beginning this film is awful.

It stays fairly true to the book as far as I can recall, though I don't remember the homoerotic elements being so blatant in the book (in spite of what Oscar Wilde's life may have been). Wilde was an incredible writer and poet and this story of sin and the supernatural is still surprisingly powerful today. I thought they did a decent job, though I haven't seen the 1945 version. The book (a short novel) is great though - I'd highly recommend reading that before seeing this. Imagination is still more powerful than CG technology.. and Wilde's wit and wisdom are MUCH better absorbed in the written form. It's not long and it's easy to get into (the book). But for what it's worth, and for those who aren't planning to read it, this film still conjures up the young ghost of a Dorian Gray, a theme that explores the ultimate worth of pleasures (and other crimes) in the face of a fading world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I need a shower after this....","review":"Horrible, horrible, horrible...how many horribles can I enter?I can't believe I sat through this whole thing. I think I was waiting for it to pick up...all in vain. I started out being risque, but lapsed into just plain perverted.

I've always been somewhat intrigued by the story, by the mystery of it, and the fact that it's not entirely clear in any version (save maybe the book) what, exactly, happens to the main character.My expectations were somewhat shattered when I saw this take on the story.It's definitely more of a horror film, with very specific horror-movie gags and devices. I'm not sure how one would take this film out of context - probably not too well - but even in context, I was not entirely impressed.Big motivating factors for me to see it to begin with was Colin Firth and Ben Barnes' involvement, both of whom do fine (and no one is surprised) but, again, not what I expected. In any sense.I have since picked up the book and found that it is entirely different (and better) in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oscar Wilde Told Me He Hates This Movie","review":"I am not even sure what the whole second half of this movie was...I know it wasn't The Picture of Dorian Gray. This is my absolute favorite book which I have wanted to be made into a movie for years, just not this movie. First of all Ben Barnes is a convincing Dorian and Firth is a good Lord Henry but this movie is so far removed from Oscar Wilde's novel that it doesn't really matter. If you're wondering how far removed from the novel suffice it to say Dorian falls in love with Lord Henry's daughter. Some very pretty camera work, the score is wonderful, and the sequences that show Dorian's debauchery are quite thrilling to watch in a perverted sort of way, but there is a reason my friends why this movie never had a US release...it's terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully acted, but very dark story","review":"The acting is superb in this very dark, intriguing adaptation of Oscar Wilde's book, The Picture of Dorian Gray. I thought the actor who played Dorian Gray did an excellent job and had the right balance of innocence and self-absorbed tendencies. I could not watch this movie repeatedly because the plot is depressing and dark, but I think that is typical of Wilde. It's worth viewing, but beware that it is not a sunny, light romantic story, but rather a serious look into what happens to a man's soul when he thinks only of himself and his pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars because it has Colin Firth","review":"Really lame movie...Colin Firth is the only bright spot.

I still think the portrait could've look more gruesome though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and expectations.","review":"I was excited to discover a new film version of Wilde's classic, but I was sorely disappointed with this film. Barnes is miscast and out of his depth here, Firth's man is exaggerated; the daughter is non-existent in the novel, and there are plot additions that were not necessary. (Chaplin is excellent however). For now if you want to see a better version of this story, stick to Hurd Hatfield and George Sanders."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing that resembles the book is the name.","review":"This was AWFUL. They changed SO much in this that less that 2% is the actual book. He pumped up the homosexual line that runs through the book (but in the book it's just hinted at) and he adds lines from other plays that Oscar Wilde has done and made Lord Henry a father (which is not in the book). What is wrong about doing a movie the way the author wrote it down. If you think you can do something better, do it yourself and write your own script - don't ruin someone else's work but misrepresenting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good supernatual gothic drama.","review":"Dorian Gray is a young nobleman. He is drawn into a world of deviance and debauchery by his friend Henry, who is played by Colin Firth. After a lot of partying his beloved portrait reflects the condition of his soul. The more he sins, the more disfigured the portrait becomes. Dorian soon realizes that this picture has given him eternal life. He fails to age. He also realizes that he cannot be killed. Dorian is essentially an immortal. The weight of his sins bears down on him and the portrait has taken ona life of it's own. It has been tainted with the evil from Dorian's soul.This movie should have gotten more recognition that it did. I think it's really good. It's not a fst paced movie, but it's atmosphere makes it quite unique. The acting and the screenplay are also well done. I'm not gonna go so far as to call this movie a classic, but it's worth watching and definitely leaves an impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie will scare anyone into a life of religion!","review":"This movie scared me half to death but I dont watch scarey movies so this was a first for me.

It told me nothing new that I have not heard in other interviews on tv talk shows with the people involved. While the book was able to express to the reader that the author is a fan of the show it failed to raise your knowledge of how the show operated behind the scenes.

Gripes that may be legitimate but also are part/parcel of each individuals voluntary involvment and choices. I'm no fan of Scientology, but this small collection of stories is like a few ex Catholics or ex Mormons complaining about their former church over coffe at the kitchen table.

While it places a large focus on the high monetary cost of being a scientologist in good standing (purchasing dianetics), it fails to explain where that money goes. According to the documentary, it doesn't go to the majority of the members, because it makes their minimal pay very apparent. Does it go to helping the destitute? If so, they should be applauded for their efforts. Does it line the pockets of high ranking church officials? If so they should be ashamed. But the documentary never addresses this seemingly obvious issue.

She realizes her albums only get carried by how addictive & well produced the 1st single is. I can see why she releases a new album every year. 1 song doesn't make a great album and doesn't carry it to multi platinum success. Every commercial artist these days seem to be releasing DUD albums. It's so hard to even find 4 to 5 songs that are good on any new release these days. Beyonce please take note that 10 songs does not make an album. Cassie 9 songs & 2 interludes do not make an album. As for Rihanna, your strength lies in great POP tracks. Please don't try with the ballads. In the song Unfaithful you sound like your whining non stop. Now please stick to what your good at and it's called great POP songs without a trace of R&B because I don't hear the R&B in your voice at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind control","review":"This album is about a good girl [Rihanna] who got involved with JC, Beyoncy [The illuminati croud] And who turned from the narrow good way of following Jesus to following satan and the illuminati puppets on the broad road that leads to hell.

I dunno I think it is like One person buying or downloading a song/album a million times so people will think everyone is buying it and then they start to buy it too...An image created because talent & this girl don't go together...

I almost gave this 5 stars just to counter the crappy, unrealistic and unrelated reviews provided by the other two people here.... but I resisted.

What she does have is a unique vocal tone that supplies the perfect attitude (icy and cool, yet, sweet and soulful) to each song on \\"good girl gone bad.\\" Speaking of songs, there hasn't been a stronger, more diverse collection of HIT SINGLES on one album since Michael Jackson's \\"THRILLER.\\" That is a bold statement, but it is absolutely true (even more so for the RELOADED version). At 6-7 hits (I've lost count) on this album alone, RIHANNA will never be considered a one hit wonder or merely a fluke.

The \\"r\\" in \\"caro\\" is pronounced more like the \\"dd\\" in the English word \\"ladder\\".The other single/double consonants also taught incorrectly are \\"z/zz\\". A single \\"z\\" in Italian has a \\"d\\" sound in front of it, like in \\"ad zone\\". The \\"zz\\" is taught to sound the same as the single \\"z\\" when in reality it has a \\"ts\\" sounds like in \\"hits\\" or \\"ritz\\".Even though I'm from an Italian-American family, I know minimal Italian but enough to know how letters are pronounced. Personally, I wouldn't waste my money with this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speak Italian like an American","review":"While watching the first DVD in this set (Italian Basics), I have discovered several inconsistencies (and I haven't even finished it yet). I was hoping to learn Italian in an entertaining way, and to learn to speak it like a native (with correct pronunciation and emphasis). They got it half right. The DVD effectively uses visuals, repetition, and dialogue to make learning some basic Italian easy and memorable. But in the first three lessons I have already found a multitude of words or letters that were pronounced in at least two different ways each, which is sloppy, to say the least. The problem for a new student is knowing which is the CORRECT pronunciation (and, YES, there IS a correct pronunciation). I will have to rely on OTHER sources to teach me which is the correct pronunciation. I wonder how much else they got wrong? Ultimately, there are some valuable tidbits of information on this DVD, but don't expect to sound like anything but an American speaking Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some flaws, not worth buying.","review":"I bought this book because it uses a hands-on approach, plus I was attracted by its colourful pages and neat layout. But I was somewhat disappointed after reading it and trying out the exercises. The chapter on macros and VBA is the worst. One macro on printing slides did not work out as intended. The VBA part was poorly explained, you end up staring at lines of code and wondering the logic behind them. Another glitch is that the clipart used in the exercises may not be available to every Powerpoint 2000 user, so some of us have to take the trouble to download them from Microsoft's Live Clipart Gallery. The course coverage isn't as comprehensive as it meant to be. For instance, it does not teach you how to simulate an object (such as a bird) flying across the slide. I expect more from an advanced level book like this. My first, and probably last, book from the Shelly Cashman series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves a specific purpose","review":"If you are looking for a guide to do EVERYTHING, you can probably do better. Certainly, if you only want to bring one book, this probably isn't it. However, I wouldn't dare go to Rome without it. Rome is an amazing city, where the smallest church may seem like nothing from the outside. But go in, open your Blue Guide and suddenly you realize that there's a Caravaggio or a Bernini on the premises. I don't use a guide such as this for planning. I use it for reference while I'm in the city. I'd have missed PLENTY without it.

The quietness, the peacefulness and the clearness (every word sung is totally perceptible by the listener) that the monks of Santo Domingos de Silos Monastery put on their performance (if is possible to call perfomance to an act of pure prayer...) is simply a superb joy for the soul. I would point out the \\"Credo\\" played in the thirteenth track: absolutely fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what the title says","review":"reading other reviews i will just say that this book is exactly what it says, an encyclopedia/dictionary. a good reference that will be used and if you are like me, you will read some and put it away to bring it out once again and again and again. lots of material but if you want a storybook read this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I was very happy to see a suger free option for cake but disappointed when I tried it.

It teaches all about Christmas, Chanuka and Kwanzaa in a fun and humorous way. What I really like about it is that it doesn't shy away from showing the real meanings behind the holidays: it shows both the secular and historical/religious origins of the holidays without preaching or offending. (I haven't found any other Christmas specials that do this!) Not only does my daughter enjoy this video, but I do as well (even after MANY repeat viewings).

She really enjoys the puppet shows, such as the \\"play\\" that Sesame street characters put on about the \\"first Christmas\\" and when Elmo was dancing African dances, and the Jingle Bell song part. She watches it again and again. As an adult, I found these parts to be cute too, but I don't understand why they choose to spend so much time on Kwanzaa. If one tries to be international, what about the Asian holidays which are so obviously left out in this program?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it!","review":"I bought this DVD approx. a month before Christmas for my almost 2 year old daughter.

I have seen Dead Weather and the new Jack White Solo stuff. I am sad to say I have never seen these guys. I believe it is a career high for both Brendon Bensen and Jack White. This show is the cream of the crop too. I have some live audio from other shows, and their pizzaz is not quite there. This show, is goose bumps the whole way. I am floored by their talent, All of them. The punk who is commenting on the audio quality obviously never dubbed live shows during the rock eras of the past. This is good quality given the lack of studio isolation. Watch them knock out hit after hit with a strange yet perfect dynamic between songs. They know how to ride the crowd... Enough for me to want to jump around the room to some bad a$$ rock and roll... Absolutely worth the investment for those looking for inspirations in Rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds expectations","review":"This blew my mind! The performance from The Raconteurs is most certainly one of the very best I have ever seen. They are more raw, more \\"rock n' roll\\" than any of the albums even hint at.

Kim Doner's illustrations are beautiful, creative, and varied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much visual distraction","review":"I found the crazy amount of words/pictures inter-spaced all over the pages to be extremely distracting. It is written in a comic book format with lots of colors, misc. graphics and random quote bubbles. That makes it difficult to even locate the roots and/or the words derived from them. My daughter took one look and put it down. It reminds me of a wiggles video. If the book was less expensive, I might keep it, but $23 is more than I want to spend for a book that will sit on a shelf. I recommend taking it out from your library before purchasing it to see if the format works for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairbanks Risen","review":"Story line/plot had great potential but I had several problems with the book. Grammar, spelling and punctuation were absolutely terrible and I got the feeling it was not professionally edited. Also, the main character in the book was made out to be almost super-human in his accomplishments, as to make it comical. One got the impression it was a story told by a 10 year old with a vivid imagination. To be honest, I stopped reading the book a third of the way into it. Over-all, it was just poorly written and over-the-top in it's naive portrayal of the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and oh so true book!","review":"I became a flight attendant in 1990 and bought this book after tons of recommendations by fellow F/A's.

The basic structure of the book is cluttered, and highly disorganized making it difficult to follow. The stories seem to be held together by second-rate cartoons that might have been cutting edge in the swingin' sixties, but seem dusty and embarrassingly unfunny in today's context.

I buy everything she releases, and have always been very happy (no, I don't just listen to Country Music). I bought this CD and was very disappointed the first time I listened to it. From reading the other reviews, they say it will grow on you as you listen. I'm willing to give it another shot, in fact I'm going to go dig it out of the trash right now. By the way, I let others listen to it also, and everyone hated it. Good luck Faith, but I guess every CD can't be a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith...what were you thinking?","review":"I have been a die hard fan from day one with Faith's first album \\"Take me as I am\\". I have always enjoyed Faith's music, and bought this album without reading any reviews. I rarely take them to heart when making a decision in buying an album. In this case, I should have done just that.This album is so bland, all the songs sound the same, and not one song stands out as a true winner. If they added the single \\"There You'll Be\\", from Pear Harbor, then they could at least say she had one descent song on the album. Faith's material has steadily gotten worse, and she has been called a \\"sell out\\" in the past. I think she has reached an all time low. I will definately think twice before buying her next album. Hopefully she will return to her roots and get back to the country we all love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Cry For FAITH","review":"With the release of her 5th studio album, Faith Hill markes one of the best albums of her 10 year career! on this CD you will still find that familiar voice, but with a new Gospel/Soul sound. This album consists of songs like \\"If You're Gonna Fly Away\\" written by fellow pop star P!NK, and \\"Baby You Belong' which is a potential 2nd Single.

Faith takes production credits for the whole album and obviously has had her touch this time in the way the entire album sounds, and it is absolutely awesome. On the first single and title track, she proves she can have the commanding power of Celine and the heart of Reba. The rest of the album is a departure from country roots and firmly establishes her as a mainstream artist. This album has it share of edgier songs and great ballads, and most people would certainly find something they will like. This is a splendid album."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Dissapointing","review":"This is Faith's least impressive album. I have been a fan of hers since the beginning but am slowly losing interest. It includes a couple good songs such as \\"When The Lights Go Down\\" but the rest is empty pop music. This once great country singer is no more. I'm a fan of pop music too but this can't really compete in that arena either. I would not reccomend buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF THIS ALBUM IS GOOD, WHERE ARE THE HITS?????","review":"The song 'Cry' managed to make it to #12 on the country charts, and didn't manage to do any better elsewhere. What's up?? This is supposed to be a great album, RIGHT??? Hardly!! I realize Faith can sing, and I do enjoy her singing, but on this album she hides behind her music and back up vocals, leaving me yearning for some of her earlier vocals. Could it be just me, or are the charts the tell all? We'll soon find out! The song 'When The Lights Go Down' is my favorite from this album, and I find Faith's singing at it's best on this one, but I still do not foresee much chart success from this song either. Perhaps poor song choice overall, and perhaps too much hoopla behind the vocals of a good singer. I believe this is the worst album she has produced yet, and suggest she look into a different producer prior to her next album! 1 STAR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely lacking...","review":"I believe that Faith Hill is talented; she has a decent voice, but she definitely works it to its fullest potential. Sadly, this album is terribly disappointing to me. I don't care if she crossed over to any and all genres, but these songs are very weak lyrically. In \\"Cry,\\" she sings about the \\"pot of lies you gave to me..\\" Hello? This sounds like a sixth-grader writing this song. Musically, it's a nice album; lyrically, it seems to need some serious help.Also, Faith Hill is a happily married, got-life-by-the-tail person; I have a hard time listening to her sing about being abandoned, lonely, and unhappy. It just doesn't fit with the image projected by her. I realize that she's like an actress, projecting her emotions into these sons, but it just doesn't work in this particular album."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAITH","review":"This CD, may not be country, but its still good music. ...This CD has it ups and downs, its \\"ups\\" being \\"Cry\\",\\"When The Lights Go Down\\",\\"Stronger\\"(The only song that sounds close to country)\\"Baby You Belong\\" and \\"Unsaveable\\" are easy to lose yourself in and relax. The down,\\"Beautiful\\", is too lovey-dovey and should be saved for her and Tims makeout sessions! Other then that this is a very good album, however if you like only very traditional Faith and are not willing to listen to something new, do yourself a favor and dont buy this album. If you like Faith and traditional country music or pop/R&B;and want to try something new, this album is for you my friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cry out of JOY!","review":"the best thing about faith hill and shania twain is THEY DON'T TAKE BULL FROM S**T TALKERS..they know their music and know what people want...faith's new cd CRY is not country and all that BS..no..instead...ITS AN ALBUM THAT'S VERY HONEST VERY OPEN TO DIFFERENT STYLES OF MUSIC..which in reality many artists don't do and shut themselves in their own genre of music..several artists though do step out of their own genre and get creative with other styles...i luv all of faiths albums and i luv shania twain....my favorite songs on CRY personally are tracks : 2,4,5,7,8,9,10,11,13,14...each of these songs have a different sound....why her label didn't promote correctly ill never know..everyone should listen to this album even just once...good job faith...can't wait for ur next album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not country, but still an AWESOME CD","review":"Although Faith Hill is getting alot of criticism for this album, I have to say it is one of my favorite over all CDs that she has made. I love all of her music, but every one of these songs is awesome! She put a lot of work into this album, and you can tell that she is trying to grow as an artist and expand her fan base. It is definitely not a country CD, but why does that matter? Why not just like music for music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened???","review":"...what happened??? okay we were all prepared that this was faith's \\"cross-over\\" album, but at best this is an average pop record. now that this is hopefully out of her system, let's hope she comes back to the country where she belongs !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing but still the same...","review":"I love Faith Hill! This album is more 'pop' than Breathe. It's very soulful. You can feel what Faith was feeling when you listen to the songs. I like that's it's not really country, yet not rock & roll. She is sticking to what she said before...she just sings and tries to be herself. The enhanced portion of the cd is really cool. It lets you go behind the scenes of recording the album, photo shoots, etc. It also has the full length video for Cry. My faves are Cry & Stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this anyway ?","review":"This is not a country album. It is not even good song selections. I've tried and tried to like it, being a Faith fan, but it just doesn't happen. This will be her biggest failure. It a mess of an album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with Maren Kuykendal 110%","review":"Thank you for your awesome and very accurate review....I couldn't agree with you more...the only thing I have to add is about the \\"well, what kind of music is it\\" debate.....it's called a free country last time I checked, people! And in the words of Tim McGraw's song, \\"It's just good music if you can feel it in your soul.\\" Get a life and let Faith be free to make whatever kind of music she feels. She's not trying to be anyone but herself...she's not trying to be Reba, or Celine, or Aretha. She's better than all 3 put together, in my opinion! She's got soul and we're lucky to have the gift of her wonderful music. I can't stop listening to this CD. You're right- it does grow on you...makes you want to get out and dance-Go Faith!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing if you expect country","review":"If you are looking for country this is not the CD for you. There was maybe one song that remotely sounded country. I was on a road trip and thought this CD would be a safe buy...I was wrong. I listen to most genres and I still wouldn't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I've always been a Faith Hill fan, but for some reason...this is the first actual CD, \\"Cry,\\" I've ever owned by her. It's a great album, though. I first heard the song \\"Cry\\" on some new music listening thing on AOL, and then went immediately out to buy the CD! The other songs are really great, I especially love \\"One,\\" it has a really great beat. Other songs like, \\"When The Light Go Down,\\" and \\"Stonger\\" still have that country flare, and really bring out her voice. I'm not a big country star, but I recommend this CD to anybody! It's definitely well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love IT","review":"i love it. sttrong voice,but not all of songs sound country. Faith is broading her horizons."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Cry\\" amazing","review":"I've always liked Faith's voice. This new material brings out her best vocal qualities yet. It was well worth the wait. Faith fans will enjoy the rich, emotional sounds on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I have been a Faith Hill fan since '93 back in the High School days. I always thought I would love the first two albums the most but the cd Cry has changed that. I can't belive how far she has come, and there is no stopping her. She has outdone herself on this album, and I look forward to what is next for her. I do think it is funny that when she first started out in Nashville, before her first album, she sold t-shirts. Now if you go to her website guess what you can buy....t-shirts. Of course it is different now that she is popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM LACKS TRUE HEART ,(BORING) ZZZZZ...","review":"THIS DRECK OF AN ALBUM LETS ME KNOW THAT FAITH HILL HAS LOST HER CREDIBILITY AS AN ARTIST AN THAT IS A SAD WASTE OF TALENT !!!! SHE IS CONTENT TO SING ON CRUISE CONTROL WITHOUT ANY REAL CONTROL HERE,THE PRODUCERS RUN THIS SORRY MESS OF AN ALBUM !!! MAYBE A CHANGE IN CAREERS FAITH LIKE A VEGAS LOUNGE SINGER OR A KARAOKE CLUB SINGER WOULD BE MORE WORTHY OF YOUR TALENTS FAITH !!! QUIT SLEEPWALKING THRU YOUR CAREER GIRLFRIEND !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The best word to describe my reaction to this album was surprise. This is not the Faith Hill people are used to hearing. After two months of anticipation, I was excited to buy this, only to be quickly let down when I put it in my CD player. Faith showcases her beautiful voice, but the majority of songs are not typical Faith territory. There's a lot of pop and R&B influence on most of the tracks. Two or three tracks (Cry, and This is Me) actually sound (kind of) like country music. If current Faith fans are hoping the album is similar to her latest single \\"Cry\\", they will be let down. This CD should not be filed under \\"Country\\" in any store. If you like Celine Dion or the latest LeAnn Rimes, then you'll like this. Faith may feel like she grew and improved on this album, but she has undoubtedly alienated many of her most dedicated fans by ignoring her country influence. If you're a country fan, spend your money on Dixie Chicks' \\"Home,\\" not Faith's \\"Cry.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is definitely NOT what I expected","review":"I ran out and bought this CD because I loved Faith Hill's music. This CD does not sound like the music that I enjoyed listening to from Faith. Out of the 14 tracks I only can stomach the song \\"Cry\\". The rest sound like Faith sat down with a Casio Synthesizer and threw together 13 tracks.I am hoping her next album is more like the Faith Hill we all know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"credit given to the wrong person","review":"You want the real version of Cry pick up Angie Aparo... it is his song and a whole lot better. Angie has real tallent and real heart he is the one that put the heart in the song and i can't believe Faith not only uses the song as her own but she even named her album after another person's song... I have yet to hear a song from Faith Hill that has actual tallent and heart considering the songs she sings were written by other people and song by other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Will Cry just A Lot","review":"Now i'm not one of these people who roam around rubbishing everything but i call a spade a spade when i see one. I have enjoyed all of Faith's Previos work from TMAIA to Breathe. But this has got to be one of the worst releases this year. It seems as if she is more interested on how she looks on the cover than whats on the CD. None of these tracks are enjoyable to listen to and they are all over produced. Im not sure what faith is trying to be? but it seems like those who are guiding her career want to turn her into a mariah carey/britney and Celine wannabe. If that was thier intention there sure have suceeded because the music in this CD is just as shallow as the music in those \\"artists\\" that i have mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dissapointing","review":"Simply put, this album stinks.Faith Hill's last album was an obvious jump in the pop direction, however, it didn't completely alienate her old fan base the way this one does. To be honest, I wasn't incredibly fond of Breathe, I found it entertaining. However, I heard the first single off this record and I liked it. I figured, \\"Faith is a good performer, the album can't be that bad.\\" I was incredibly wrong.The album is half R&B/Soul music, and the second half teeters on Gospel. Absolutely nothing here for country fans, not even a mildly enjoyable country/pop song. Cry is this album's one saving grace. If you are a fan of Faith's old music, you will be terribly disappointed with this album. I still very much enjoy her old music, and continue to think she is an incredible performer(not to mention incredibly attractive), but with this album, she has lost any country fans that she had left. Faith, if there is any way for you to come back to country music, just let me know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith Hills new CD will make you cry !","review":"First off, If you are looking for a country cd, forget it. There isn't nary a twang anywhere to be heard on this cd, not even a steel guitar. That is not bad except Faith forgot to put any good songs on this CD except the title song Cry. She tried to cover all the bases and does alot of very different types of music and fails miserably. Her last cd, Breathe, had the same problem, except she actually had 2 good songs on that one, Breathe and The way you love me. I guess you will have to go back to her sophomore effort, Take Me As I AM, to find one that is listenable all the way through. The songs are way too varied to please a listener track after track. My advise is to just get the CD single and skip the full length unless you are a die hard fan of Faith Hill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not UP!!","review":"I was disappointed in this album. I like Faith's singing, but this album is a downer -- you can tell by the title!I much preferred Shania Twain's new album -- happier, catchier songs. I also preferred Faith's earlier albums to this one.It's not country, not rock either. I wish I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'M SO BORED I COULD CRY","review":"I'm sorry--this album is the worst. There is not one upbeat song. The emotional angst associated with Breathe was one thing, but Faith can't make a career out of negative emotional turmoil associated with every song.I have tried to like this CD, but in my book, it is a huge thumbs down.Pick up the pace, Faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith Hill and Shinia Twain are just not real country","review":"I respected Faith Hill when she came out with \\"This Kiss\\". It was a simple and melodic tune which you just couldn't help but like. At the point, she had a choice to become a respected singer who does tasteful music or to become a superficial so called country diva. She choose the later which is regretable.She had some potential and now she is just going to be another shallow, superficial \\"pop-country\\" singer. By the way, this is not country music. It is soft rock. That's it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"Not nearly as good as 'Breathe'; this album sounds like she's trying too hard to branch out even further than before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss that old Faith Hill","review":"Faith Hill's videos in the 1990's looked more upbeat and sweet and as guy I thought at that time she looked like a million dollars she was typical hot blond that all guys look at. Now I don't know how she got to this stage in her music but now her music is a mess cluttered in my opinion with hip hop and R&B and just it is simply a mess. Her videos are now cluttered with wet hair too dramatic that her videos are stupit and she is a great looking woman there is no need for her to look this rediculous. It is not the fact that she left country roots that is bad enough its the fact that the material here just plain out stinks. I do not like the style of this music here I really hope she makes a country album here since breathe what is going on. Please Faith Hill go back to country everyone will appreciate it. Where is that hot blond with the tight jeans on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Faith Hill was much better when she stuck to her roots. I found the album to be boring. \\"Cry\\" is mediocre at best. I expected something much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on faith...","review":"Ms. Hill once again disapoints all fans from country to pop alike. With tracks that are so terrible you need to pull your spice girls cd out to get them out of your head, \\"Cry\\" needs to be put where it belongs...in the garbage. Dont expect any country. Im not a country music fan, and i still hated the pop. Cry is the only sort-of okay song on the disc. so if you want to spend 15 dollars on one song, go right ahead. Go for shania twains \\"up\\", thats where the real quality lies."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"At first listen to this CD, I thought that I had just wasted my money. But after a couple of listens, I really knew it was worth it. Faith does a fabulous job on this CD. It is completely different from anything she has done before. Again, she has outdone herself!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This CD was well thought out. The songs have such wonderful meanings and are wonderful to play when you are in the mood to relax. It is not all love songs but songs of every emotion. It is, by far, my favorite Faith CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not country, but another fantastic album!","review":"Faith Hill is probably going to get a lot of bad reviews for not making a 'country' album. Her voice, though, is not just a country voice. She can sing anything, and she proves it on Cry. The album is much more soulful than anything else, but the album is still fantastic. The songs make you want to smile, make you want to cry, make you want to get up and dance. The album makes you want to feel emotions and think. I think, by far, this is her best album, and probably one of the best albums of 2002, country or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"The photo is the best part","review":"If this is supposed to be country...It seems Ms. Hill has completely gone \\"POP\\" or some other genre. Some of the tracks on this disk have a \\"RAP\\" rythum track. I haven't seen any videos of these songs yet, but can only imagine what could be going on. Maybe Ms. Hill and Ms. Rimes can form a duet and open shows for ? If you just want to look at the picture, get the disk, if you are expecting anything that sounds like country music, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAITH!!","review":"I loved \\"Faith\\", tolerated \\"Breathe\\" and hate \\"Cry\\". It's just terrible. This is no where near country, which isn't the real problem. No matter which genre this album fits into, it's just bad...at points, I wondered if I was listening to an SNL parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"Faith's latest album does not do her talent justice. I bought this CD because I'm a fan of her music in the past - but what a disappointment this album turned out to be. It's not even worth downloading from the internet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the original","review":"In all honesty, I'm not the biggest Faith Hill fan, but she does put out some good stuff. I have heard her version of the song \\"Cry\\". Unfortunately, I am a big Angie Aparo fan, and let's just say she doesn't quite match up. If you like the song \\"Cry\\" I HIGHLY recommend you listen to Angie's version of it on his CD \\"The American\\". You'll find that, like most things, the original is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Cry\\"? I cried laughing!","review":"I only give Faith's latest c.d 2 stars because...It's pathetic! Don't get me wrong, Faith is an amazing singer and performer, but to be honest it's a little boring, The only good song would have to be \\"Cry\\" and \\"When The Lights go Down.\\" The rest are so bad I cried my self to sleep laughing!If your truly looking for a good Faith c.d. I suggest you import \\"There You'll Be: The Best Of.\\" Which features amazing songs such as; \\"There You'll Be,\\" \\"Breath,\\" \\" This Kiss,\\" and many other classic #1 hits! I hope this helped you in determining wheather or not to buy her new album, but don't take it from me. \\"Cry\\" already sold over 2 million albums, so go buy it and see for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS CD NOW!!","review":"THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL CD FAITH HAS PUT OUT.EVERY SONG IS A GEM FROM THE FIRST TO LAST SONG.WITH AN HOUR RUNTIME (60:43) EVERY FAN WILL ENJOY THIS CD.IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS CD ALREADY BUY IT NOW DON'T WAIT.GREAT JOB FAITH!!!!BUY IT NOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith HIll","review":"I believe Faith Hill is a better artists than what is in this album. She has more talent and ability than this album shows. She should try not to be so pop orinated and just stick to singing songs where she can show off her beautiful voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only she did the song Cry justice","review":"If anyone is buying this album for her song \\"Cry\\", I would suggest you forgo purchasing this album, and instead pick up the original version by the man who wrote the song, Angie Aparo (on the album \\"The American\\"). While she is doing a good job with her marketing machine, she is forgetting that it is actually about making good music, and not the way you look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big diappointment","review":"Cry was good on the radio, so I bought the CD. What a waste. This might be an OK CD for a romantic dinner, but it will get on your nerves since most of the tracks sound the same.There is no catchy tunes on this CD. All the songs are really slow. There was nothing there that just grabs you. There weren't any tunes that were really upbeat, just constant droning. Breathe was tons better.Best description for this CD is sellout (and not in a good way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder on Music Row","review":"What can I say, this cd Sucks! When Faith started to go pop and Fans expressed their unapproving opinions, Faith didn't listen! She started out with great potential, named as the next Tammy Wynette. What happened? Many more Albums like this and it wouldn't surprise me if I read in Country Weekely that she had been dropped from her music label. Don't go out and buy this cd! Go to Applebee's and buy a steak dinner, it will be much more satisfying and won't leave you naucious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angie Aparo","review":"Im quite surprised that no one has mentioned ANYTHING about Angie Aparo. He wrote the original song, and I dont see a word on here about him. Go listen to his version if you haven't already, it is a LOT better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"In accordance with some other reviews on this album, I would suggest buying just the CD single of Cry and saving the rest of your money. I am a huge Faith fan, and have been disappointed by this effort. Usually on her albums, especially the past two, the best part is that you can listen to every song on the album. Now, I am skipping almost all of the songs, especially the ones between Cry and Stronger. I hope she doesn't forget what kind of music got her to where she is now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment for Faith Hill Fan","review":"Faith should not be trying to go \\"POP\\" and give the people what they want.

I bought this cd for [X] and still feel it was a waste of 10 bucks! Cannot believe Faith released this album! She has such a beautiful voice but this cd does not do her justice at all!!!!

It's not country!! There is not one country song on it. I like pop music just as much as the next person, but my true passion is country music. As a pop album, \\"Cry\\" is great, but as a country album, \\"Cry\\" is an impostor. What happened to the days of \\"It matters to me\\" and her other early cds? I love Faith Hill just as much as the next person, she's talented and beautiful and got a wonderful family to boot! But this album is not country. If you're looking for a good pop album, this is a great bet for you, if you're looking for a country album, however, this is definitely not the cd for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CD to cry over","review":"Faith Hill's earlier CD featuring Breathe and other tracks is one of the best CD's I have ever heard. Truly romantic and sensual. Unfortunately, I took on 'faith' that her latest CD would be at least as good as that one. What a mistake! The songs all run together, little new or original and there is nothing to make me even want to hear even one track again. A real disappintment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Have Faith!!","review":"This is truly an amazing work of art! Faith had already narrowed the gap between contemporary country and mainstream pop with her last release, \\"Breathe.\\" \\"Cry\\" is intended to appeal to both her devoted \\"country\\" fans, as well as reach a new audience. This is not a country album, which may disappoint some; however, nearly all of the tracks are outstanding in their own right. I was blown away when I first heard the title track, \\"Cry.\\" Other highlights include the sweeping \\"When The Lights Go Down,\\" and the sultry \\"Beautiful,\\" where vocals in the verse are actually spoken, rather than sung. Then, she almost branches into hard rock with \\"Back to You.\\" The album concludes with a beautiful soft piano ballad, \\"You're Still Here.\\" Faith is a vocal powerhouse and and she creates a masterpiece here with \\"Cry.\\" She is an \\"artist\\" in the true sense of the word, and is as great a talent as any in the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, beware, beware","review":"I made the mistake of thinking that a title listed under the DVD section was a traditional DVD. Unfortunately not. Where one would expect the playlist to be an assortment of videos and/or concert footage, it is simply a still picture. There are a couple of interviews, etc. with Faith, but nothing that I would want to pay $31 for."},{"rating":"2","title":"shhhh.... she's singing","review":"From the first track to the last Faith once again proves that she can belt out a song like no other female artist.

Thank you Faith for giving us a reason to cry, laugh and love again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm losing faith in Faith","review":"I have loved Faith for quite a while. I love country and pop so I am not one of the people \\"crying\\" about how she sold out. Faith has a great voice. I like the song \\"Cry\\" but had a headache after listening to the album. I sounds like garbage. \\"Breathe\\" wasn't much better. I was hoping that her new album \\"Cry\\" would be a great album, especially after hearing the title track. Unfortunately, I was terribly mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed fan","review":"Cannot believe Faith released this album!

It is rather slick and \\"pop\\". Yet...it is a showcase for the studio musicians, the backup singers, and her voice. It is basically perfect. A couple real country songs, such as \\"Stronger\\", make this perfection fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did Faith Go?","review":"I bought Cry today. I have to admit I hated Cry when I first heard it, but then I grew to really like it. However, this album is not the Faith I know and love. I really liked Breathe. It had some great songs on it that could minimally pass for country ballads maybe. But this album. Not hardly! I have 2 maybe 3 songs on this CD that are good. Cry is okay. Stongest songs are definitely Stronger and When The Lights Go Down, which if given any airplay will probably be chart toppers for Faith. However, I sure feel that this album should not be played on country radio. It isnt fair to other artists who actually sing country music. She is far from country on this one. Probably a grammy winner, but should stay on AC where it belongs. Faith Hill please come back to country. You have a great voice and we need you. If this album can be played on country then pull out Chris Gaines too!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cd!!","review":"This is my first Faith Hill cd,and I can say I'm really impressed.She has a powerful voice, and really uplifting,feel-good,emotional songs.I liked the lyrics in the some of the songs, cause they seemed to be solely about Faith herself.I just don't think it's fair that some die-hard country fans aren't willing enough to open up their minds, to what is truly good muic.There are some misses, maybe the last 2 songs which didn't really strike me as standouts, and I do wish Faith would have some more songs which showed of her voice to it's true extent, so this album doesn't get the full five starsBut even tho' critics bash it, and fans hate,I reccomend it to anyone who is in search of well-sung,overall enjoyable music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Cd I Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS IS A GREAT CD I LOVE THE WHOLE CD.FROM THE FIRST TO LAST SONG IT WAS GREAT.EVERYONE SHOULD BUY THIS IT WOULD BE A GREAT CHRISTMAS PRESENT.IT RUNS NEARLY 61min.THIS HAS TO BE FAITH'S 2 BEST CD FIRST BEING BREATHE."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great album","review":".After hearing mixeed reviews about this cd, i finally bought it and was pelased that i had. Faith Hill has a beautiful voice, and though these songs are different from previous cd's it is great. The cd is a great choice. I appreciate the fact that Faith Hill always has a great new sound for her cd's and refuses to cut teh same, or very similar cd's every time. THis is a great group of songs and a wonderful cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disapointment","review":"I am very disapointed in \\"Cry\\". It is not what I expected. There is absolutely no country in it. So if you are expecting country music here, you had better look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is What Is Ruining Country Music!","review":"Faith Hill is a no talent wannabe! After saying this let me explain that I don't think it was always this way. Back when Faith was actually singing country music I thought she was a very good singer with great songs. However, once she decided she wanted to make pop albums. I don't care if Faith wants to become a pop singer so long as she admits it instead of trying to label it as country and forcing those of us who want to listen to good country music listen to the imitation pop music she puts out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled YAWN","review":"Don't get me wrong--I think Faith is a talented vocalist, but I really believe she made some poor song choices on this album. After listening to it numerous times, I still come away feeling this is one of the most boring albums I've listened to in a while. After One, Cry, and Free, the CD loses its soulful groove and becomes a monontony of dull, sleepy songs that simply don't grab me. Maybe I'm missing the point, but I am seriously surprised at the number of good reviews this CD receives. I'm a Faith Hill fan but I can also admit she could have chosen a better mix of songs that would showcase her voice and give her a chance to spread her genre wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED?","review":"I cannot believe there are so many positive reviews of this album. I am giving it 2 stars because there are only 2 good songs on this album, \\"Cry\\" and \\"When The Lights Go Down.\\" The 2 main categories of music I listen to are Pop/Rock & Country, and she misses on both of these. There is too much noise on this CD, too much enhanced guitar, too much sythesizer. I applaud Faith Hill's attempt to move over to pop as that is how I would classify some of her best songs, but this CD just misses that mark entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed chance","review":"Faith is obviusly looking to be recognised as a great singer not just a Country singer. The problem for me is very much as the first couple of reviews mentioned. This album is over produced and detracts from the great voice Faith has. She does not need all of that and I think that is why her earlier recordings allowed the voice to be centre stage.I would be very careful before I bought another of her albums if this is an example of where she is going, especially with the price of CDs in the UK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I got this CD from a friend because she knows how much I love Faith Hill and that I religiously listen to Breathe. I have to say I was sorely disappointed when I listened to Cry. The only good song on it is number 2, the one they play on the radio. It's not even the fact that the CD isn't really very country, moreso, the songs are just sappy and boring. Number 4 and 1 are okay, but those are the only songs that I can bare listening to. Don't waste your money on Cry. If you want to listen to a good Faith Hill CD, buy Breathe and listen to Cry on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a response","review":"I very rarely write reviews, but I looked over a few on here and realized I had to chime in. I believe Faith Hill is one of the most brilliant country artists to come down the bin. Take Me As I Am, It Matters To Me, and Faith were masterpieces of interpretation, vocal prowess, fully developed albums. Faith Hill as an artist however began to go astray on Breathe. Breathe was an album of phenomonal moments spread out over mediocrity. With Cry, Faith Hill's search for new audience completely led her astray. \\"Cry\\" and \\"When The Lights Go Down\\" are the only even vaguely listenable tracks. The rest of the album is a mish-mash of pop-wanna-be songs that don't even begin to live up to the potential of the artists. Sometimes fans become blinded by loyalty to an artists, and I don't believe it is fair to people to buy an album based on those opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAGGHHH!","review":"I was so disappointed in this CD. The songs were completely pop, which i normally don't mind, but this is FAITH!! I wish she would go back to being country. The single \\"cry\\" seemed like the album would be good, but almost every other track has some sort of funky, even hip-hop sounding beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me cry","review":"I thought this album was just not up to her previous albums. Almost every song was slow and boring. It sounds like she had post partum depression when she recorded this album. This is coming from someone who loves Faith Hill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop garbage marketed as Country","review":"I, for one, am completely over this Faith Hill mess (actually, I was never on board with it). This is pure garbage from the Nashville pop machine that has a really hard time marketing real Country music, thus their surprise at the success of O Brother, Where Art Thou?This CD is obviously marketed to young girls (she even looks like Britney Spears!?!?!).Avoid at all costs. For more like this garbage, see Shania Twain."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is she thinking","review":"ok i was so happy when i got this cd i put it on in it sucks the only singer that can make country sound good with pop/rock is shania twain . faith hill is better of singing country if i was u dont buy this cd cuz u wont be happy with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper thin Artist","review":"I never quite got all the Love that Faith Hill has gotten over the years&still don't.I felt from the first time I heard \\"this Kiss\\" through Now that She was a Lucky 2nd-Tier Act who got over in a very Watered Down time in Music&after hearing this Album I feel right on the mark.She has a Decent Voice but Not Worthy of Being Called A Diva or Somehow that Merits the Kind of Hype She is Getting with each Album.Boring!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Country! Just Waste Your Money!","review":"First it is not a country music! Second, I listen to this CD several times maybe I find at least 3 beautiful song, but I can not find even 3 beautiful song in this CD. I really waste my money for this CD and I never waste my money for this singer again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan ready to \\"Cry\\" with Joy!","review":"It's great to have Faith back in the spotlight! For that is truly where she belongs. \\"Cry\\" is full of such emotion, and powerful lyrics, when you listen to it you can feel all of Faith's hard work come through in every song. All in all a beautiful piece of work, and one of my favorite. It seems as though this \\"star\\" from Star , MS just can't go wrong! \\"Stronger\\" a very soulful song on the cd is something different for her, but I am glad to know her musical background comes from more than just that of country. Faith is on top of the world, and the charts! Thanks to all of us who had \\"faith\\" in Faith!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Faith Hill's New CD","review":"I love Faith Hill's new cd. I am a big Faith Hill fan. This cd is great. I wuld recommend it to anyone. I love the different style of music that is in this cd. It shows a different side of Faith and shows her talent and lets people know that she can sign more than just country music. I love the song Cry that is on her cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One good track, a few decent ones, and lots of mediocrity","review":"The \\"Cry\\" song is very good, but the problem with this album is that the rest of the content falls off quickly.There are not any terrible tracks on this album, but conversely there are very few good ones either. \\"Cry\\" was the only song I'd in fact worth listening to on this track for me.Most of the tracks range from mediocre to average.Faith's voice is good, that is not the problem. It just seems to me that most of the songs lack the feeling, catchy rythems, etc. of Faith Hill when she was at her best (which for me is by far her first two albums - \\"Take Me as I Am\\" and \\"It Matters To Me\\").There is too much hip hop sounds on this CD, and it is not clicking for me. While I don't mind hip hop on a hip hop album, this sound does not fit Faith Hill. I think she should stick with what she does best, country-pop with occasional full blown country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs","review":"The songs all tell a story, as country often does. But the sound of the entire CD is definately pop. \\"You're Still Here\\" is all pop on this album, unlike her single, which has country twang. \\"Stronger and \\"When the Lights Go Down\\" have beautiful lyrics about humanity and hardship. Faith fans know that each new project, the singer changes her style completely, and this creation is definately different than her previous albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOULFUL LIFTING MASTERPIECE!","review":"Faith is finally being Faith and not some cookie cutter Nashville pretty girl! Rock, R&B, and Country combine to make this a MUST GET ALBUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have never really listened to Faith Hill before until I heard her song Breathe and then the song The Way You Love Me and I thought those songs were so wonderful. I had to buy this album after I heard Cry. The first time I heard the album I was so so about it, but now having heard it 3 times, it grows on you and I have not found a song yet on this album that I do not love. I love this album and am definately a Faith Hill convert!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This album is awesome! I find myself listening to the WHOLE album, then putting it on repeat to listen again and again. Faith takes her music to a new level in Cry as it's a mixture of songs that speak to one's soul. So far, it's my favorite of all her albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"Let me start off by saying, this album really grows on you. I went and bought it the first day it came out (when the store opened), and tore open the package, and started flipping through the songs. My first reaction was shock, because the songs did not seem to be typical \\"Faith\\" songs. I went through all the songs one by one the next day, and started to acknowledge things I liked about them. Even though all of the songs are not traditional Faith Hill songs, they are still extraordinary. I have learned to appreciate her voice, and not be picky about how \\"country\\" one of her songs is. If an artist changes their style, it shouldn't matter. It just shows how talented that artist really is. Faith still has the best vocal chords that I have ever heard, and that wouldn't change even if she decided to start a rap career. I will support her always."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I'd wanted this type of music, I'd buy Celine......","review":"I eagerly haved looked forward to each & every Faith Hill album. Her early work helped spur me to make major changes in my life!!! I continue to play her previous albums all the time.This album, although incredible if you like loud, pounding, strong music, is NOT my idea of Faith Hill at her best. She has slowly, but surely, moved from her roots & has put out a product that her original fans will not relate to. With this album, her producers seem to want to attract a new audience. Unfortunately, they'll lose the very fans who helped her get to where she is today.If her goal is to attract new fans with a new genre of music, please include some songs for us \\"old timers\\" along with the new ones. The last cut of the album is beautiful & is Faith at her best! At least we have that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Faith","review":"Faith Hill's newest album breaks some new ground for her. It is much different than her last effort, much more slick and polished (maybe too much?), more adult contemporary/pop than country. She seems to be trying out several different musical styles on the same CD, maybe not sure what she is best at. What is right with this CD: her likeable, strong voice; her ability to convey emotion, especially on some of the gospel oriented tunes (mate Tim McGraw is very good at this too); the variety of songs. What is wrong: the producer made it a little to polished--is Faith having fun (example: easy to hear on the new Dixie Chick's CD Home) or is she working?; again, the producer layered so many sounds (drum machines, synths, bass) that at times it is hard to pick out Faith's voice from all the mess; maybe too much variety in song style. Next time, Faith, let them bring your fine voice to the front of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD...Pop sound, defintely not Country","review":"I like Faith Hill's music and this CD is good for the most part. It is mostly ballads/slower songs but it is different than any other CD she has produced. If you are looking for country, this is certainly not it. I wouldn't even put it in a contemporary country category...it is very much pop/easy listening like Celine Dion. The title song that she just realeased, \\"Cry\\", is as close to country as it gets in relation to the whole CD. If you liked the album \\"Breathe\\" better than any of her earlier albums, then you will like this CD. There is no steel guitar, no fiddle, no twang. Some of the songs almost sound like a light jazz. So...if you are diehard country...forget it. But if you like her music over the past 3-4 years, then you will not be disappointed because this is a further step in that same direction. To put it in Loretta Lynn's words, \\"They pushed her pop\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country Music?","review":"When I first heard the single \\"Cry\\" on the radio, I thought to myself...\\"Great song....it's not country music, but it's a great song.\\" This sentiment exactly reflects my feeling for the entire album. There are many fantastic songs, none of which could be called \\"country\\" by any stretch of the imagination. There are a few songs that I might even dare to classify as...*gasp*...R&B.Overall, I really enjoy the album. Its not what I expected, but I will not deny a great song when I hear it regardless of its genre. I recommend it to those listeners who enjoy many genres of music, and those who have an open mind. To the staunch country music traditionalists,I say.... Stay as far away from this album as you possibly can and go buy the new Dixie Chicks album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented Singer -- (From a forever fan) :)","review":"Faith Hill to me is a very talented singer. I love her songs; they're simply inspiring, and beautiful. Well written too. This cd will not dissapoint any TRUE fan of Faith Hill. If you love her voice (who wouldn't??), then you will be overjoyed with this soundtrack. Faith always puts her best into her work. She works hard, has a wonderful family, and earns what money she gets by singing till her heart's content. We should all be so lucky.God bless Faith Hill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"profiling this album","review":"it seems to me that my previous review of this album was correct. winning her awards only solidifies what i said about her change over to more of a pop sound. its always good for an artist to explore other things. faith's roots are and always be in country music, but it was a refreshing change to show her abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfaithfully disappointed","review":"I guess I am just too big a country fan..if I had listened to some clips of the songs on this CD before hand, I wouldn't have bought it. It is VERY adult, contemporary and with the exception of \\"Cry\\", all of the songs sound the same. I still love Faith...but I am already anticipating her next CD with hopefully less orchestra and extras and more Faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad","review":"I love Faith. I will always love Faith. If not for her music for the person she is. I'm disappointed in her latest album. I don't know what less to say but it's just not good. The songs are strange. Where did she get these song writers from? They don't flow at all. And the producers basically shot the dying horse in the head with all the loud background singing and instruments. Faith's voice is beautiful but she just sounds bored on this album. She needs to take some time off and remember why she got in this business in the first place. And she also needs to admit that this is not a country album. This album is 110% NOT country. She needs to be very careful now. LeAnn Rimes went pop and nobody bought her album. Her fans and peers turned their backs on her. If Faith doesn't get her butt back in the cowboy boots she might find herself on VH1's \\"Where Are They Now?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This cd is a really big let down. It doesn't matter to me that it's not country...the problem is that it doesn't have any depth or feeling. The qualities that made Faith Hill Faith Hill are not in evidence. The emotion and realness have been replaced by slick production, questionable musical arrangements, embarrassing lyrics, and a plastic persona. I think Faith Hill is one of the most talented singers around and quite possibly one of the most beautiful women in the world but I think that what many people related to about her was how real, warm, talented, and beautiful she was and how real her songs were. There are songs on each of her first three albums that I have played repeatedly for years and they can still touch my emotions. I'm disappointed that Faith thinks that by branching out she has to completley change everything about herself and her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't Cry about this one!","review":"Faith's voice seems to become more and more polished with every album she puts out. Just listen to her first (Wild One) and you will see her voice is much more mature now compared to her voice then. Although she has always been great. This album just really makes her shine. She touches almost every musical style with glory. A must have for any Faith fan, or any music fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith is Awesome!!","review":"I own every one of Faith's albums and CRY certainly does not disappoint. Believe it or not her albums live up to her actual concert quality. She puts on an awesome live show, which is also heard in her recorded music. She gives 110% and it is obvious. The third song, One, was actually written by her backup singers and is an excellent showing of Faith's diversity. Throughout the album she moves from a country feel to a soft rock feel to a jazzy feel effortlessly . . . she can do it all!!! I strongly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent across the board","review":"Why the big stink (oink,oink) over \\"This is not Country enough\\". Who cares. Faith can do great country - she has proved it. Why are you upset about her \\"spreading her wings\\"? She sounds great! She is hot! This is good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling... Beautiful... Faith","review":"This album is truly phenomenal. I give it four stars because I wish she wrote more of the songs. But nonetheless, Faith has such a powerful voice that captures emotions unlike any artist has. The words she sings are sincere and have a way of making you believe that they're hers, but also feel that they're yours. I love the new honest style of the new album. Cry, Free, One, If You're Gonna Fly Away, Stronger, Back To You, You're Still Here... they're ALL going to be hit singles or #1's. They're my #1's definitely. The album is diverse... it's everything you need to feel then, now, and tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fish Out of Water","review":"Cry makes me want to do just that ... it's a pity Faith's abandoned what works in search of something that just doesn't exist, at least not on this album. The only thing more patetic that this attempt to \\"cross-over\\" into pop divadom is Faith's \\"Cry\\" video. Faith, honey, not all the black eye make-up in the world will gain you entrance into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame ... let's fire a few producers and get back to what works."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Faith","review":"Faith, Faith, Faith - what are you doing?? I can't believe you are trying to do so much R&B. You are not an R&B singer, you are a country singer. I would not recommend this album. She needs to go back to her roots. I think she is trying too hard to sell albums, and it is very apparent by this mess of an album. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word - Disappointing","review":"I knew it would simply not matter what Faith Hill put out, some folks were going to sing her praises regardless of the result.But let's \\"call a spade a spade\\" - the CD is a disappointment and will not be well-received by the majority of her fans. It is simply an exercise in self-absorbtion.What was she doing when she recorded this, singing to herself in the mirror?Bottom line is I would have cancelled my pre-order with Amazon.com if I had known the CD was this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Next?","review":"Now she is on the cover of Country Weekly posing a Farrah Fawcett look and this woman is not 25 years old she has a family and not many mothers do that on magazine covers. What is going on with Faith Hill I loved Take me as I am and It matters to me and Faith even Breathe was okay. Cry is completely now out of hand and the only reason why it is climbing the charts because Faith Hill is singing it. The song is terrible one of the worst releases of the year. That song is awful and it seems everyone is using it even t.v sitcoms. Go back Faith if she wants to try new things go release it in some other section of the music store not in the country genre because anybody who calls this country is darn crazy. Check out Elizabeth Cook and Kelly Willis now those women are singing country. It has always been said especially in country music an artist who stays with what they started will always be successful and those who leave there roots will be pulled out gone from the buisness sooner or later."},{"rating":"2","title":"faith hill cry cd","review":"I bought and listened to Cry Cd by Faith Hill and not only am I a really big fan of Faith Hills but When I heard that album I imediately heard songs that were closly related to me and about me in the past.

With this album she attempts more challenging material, but doesn't bring to it the vocal skill, emotional depth, or inspired delivery to bring these songs to life.If you love Faith, the celebrity, you will revel in this next chapter in her career. If you are looking for artistry, you'd be best to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me want to cry!","review":"I really wanted to cry after wasting my money on this cd. I will never, ever buy another cd after hearing just one track I like. That's it one track. I don't know what Faith was trying to do when she recorded this album but it is not consistent in any way, shape, or form. Sorry to be redundant but I hated this cd. Wait until a few more songs come out on the radio before you make the decision to buy this. It is sad because Faith has an amazing voice and this sounded way too manufactured and digitally enhanced for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"Sadly, I was very dissappointed with Faith Hill's new cd. There is not an ounce of country on this album, and it's just nothing special. Not that I'm not a fan of hip hop, but her country style was just more original and the hip hop thing is just overdone. Personally, i think she was much better and more successful at the mainstream-but-still-country act, and now she's really \\"crossed over,\\" but her hip hop music isn't even that great or catchy. Compared to her past 2 cd's, this one is a real dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word sums up this album","review":"When i heard the lead of single \\"Cry\\" i was excited about buying this album.The songs on this cd sounds as if they were written by two year olds.Trust me its that bad.There are about three half way descent songs on here.Cry,When the Lights go Down,You Belong.The rest are horrid.I too cringed when i listened to this.I still dont know how she could actually listen to the finished tracks,and think these were the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I have very broad taste in music, however I have to say that I am very disappointed in Faith Hill's latest CD. Given the very mixed reviews, I thought I'd buy it and see for myself. Unfortunately, she and her producers seem to be focusing on maximizing CD sales and getting radio play on pop stations. \\"Breathe\\" was okay and had clever songs that felt accessible. \\"Cry\\" feels as if she has completely lost her unique qualities and joined the other pop divas, whose CD's I assiduously avoid. I don't like overwrought, over-produced music, and that's what \\"Cry\\" sounds like. Instead of being adventurous and gutsy as some other reviewers have stated, this CD comes across as blatantly commercial. Faith can't quite seem to figure out what style she's trying to assume on this CD and it's a major disappointment from a very talented woman. I recommend she fire her producers, be content with the money she already has and make some music that sounds at least vaguely sincere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faith Hill- CRY","review":"This is definately not your best work Faith.

Faith Hill is a joke that has worn out it's welcome. Everyone claims she's gone from country to pop, rock, rap whatever. She has done none of this. How can you have a style when you have no entertainment value? Her songs are written for her; the production is over the top, trying to push a product that is nothing more than fluff, and the studio magic can still only make her nothing more than a mediocre singer who shouldn't be singing in the first place.

The description of harsh climate, life in lonesome, empty spaces is realistic but its nothing innovative that one wouldnt know about without reading this book.

Having traveled with Norris through her \\"Cloister Walk,\\" and having learned her lexicon in \\"Amazing Grace,\\" I was prepared to look around Dakota with her penetrating vision, to listen to the wind with her attentive hearing, to think deeply about what we were seeing together, and to let my heart grow still as she taught me. Now, though I've never yet been to the high plains, I have truly been to Kathleen Norris' unique and personal Dakota -- and is that not the best accolade for a travelogue, that the reader honestly feels that he's made the trip? I gave this book to a deep-souled friend who needed the time of quiet contemplation it provides, and I recommend it to you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"uplifting as the Dakota sky!","review":"An enjoyable read especially the descriptions of the Dakotas and its peoples.

That was a puzzler, b/c DAKOTA has nothing to say about growing plants and everything to say about people.

I found the book clear-eyed, poetic, unsentimental, deeply spiritual and altogether riveting.

In fact, we did Kelo-Cote shots as well, and I swear my scars look worse now. I developed red vein-y things immediatly after each set of shots (there were 2). I am continuing to use this simply because the Doc said so. I actually have way more luck with ScarZone - which is an immediate fix. The white cream of ScarZone (as opposed to kelo-Cote's clear/yellow-ish oil) masks the redness of the scars after it sinks in.

Whereas this may appeal to someone who sports a \\"Question Authority\\" sticker, it is not the Hornblower I know. Overall, it seems that the movies did not do too well with one of the greatest heroes of fiction - but at least Gregory Peck's Hornblower was decent - this one is not quite the material from which a Commodore Hornblower is made... The kind of person portrayed by Gruffud is, above all, childish (as we all know, \\"cool\\" is the same as \\"cute\\").

This is one of the best romantic works of fiction I have read, and I have read my fair share. It definitely goes on my top 10 list. Jessie and Lucas jump out of the pages and become real people. The supporting characters are equally as real. This story will touch your heart and your soul.

The main problems with these are that with me, they moved around a lot. I would have to re-adjust them throughout the day. And most importantly, within a day of using them, they had cracks in them and already started to wear down. I also bought two sets and they both wore down at exactly the same rate.

I was pleasantly suprised with the amount of info on other designers. The DVD is divided into 4 topics, exteriors, propulsion systems, fuels and miscellanous topics. It's an excellent in-depth coverage of autos(& other vehicles) of the future.The other DVD, 2058, is also informative and speculates very well on what life might be like in the year 2058. If there is one thing that diminishes this DVD, it's the movie-like segment about the power station in space.

Grant uses Austin Osman Spare's books as a springboard for his ideas, and his admiration for both Spare and Crowley are obvious throughout.

The description doesn't do the bag justice as it has many features not shown in any of the photographs. To start there is a large back pocket to put all of your changing needs, which is quick and easy to access. The heart of the bag contains ample room with six pockets total; two elastic pockets on one side and 4 layered pockets on the other. There is also a front flap with a magnetic closure with one zippered pocket on the outside and a wallet organizer on the inside...the perfect area for mom's stuff. There is a cell phone compartment on the front of the bag and a bottle pocket on each side of the bag. The construction and material are very sturdy and everything closes up nicely so there is no risk of spilliage. Finally, the graphite and green is very unisex, where many diaper bags are not so father friendly.

My son is almost 6 months old and I have rarely used this bag, yet, the bag is totally torn at the zipper of the main compartment. The smaller pockets don't really hold anything so that is a complete waste. I can barely fit a receiving blanket, a change of clothes, diapers, travel wipes, a bottle and a nursing cover at the same time. If I do the bag is stretched to the limit. Which, is probably why the bag tore in the first place. I still have to bring a purse with me because there is just no way I could squeeze my wallet and necessary purse items into the bag along with the baby stuff.

I will never buy JJ Cole products ever again and I will absolutely no recomend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Recommend","review":"When I first bought this bag, I was happy with it. I liked the different compartments it had to put things in, the changing pad it comes with is really handy when you're out and about, and I liked the fact that it was a messenger bag. I picked it because I liked the way it looked, and I thought the padding on the strap would be more comfortable than other diaper bags out there (although it did hurt my neck and back after carrying it for a while). My problem with the bag is that it didn't take long before it started becoming frayed and eventually it got so worn, that the main compartment of the zipper broke and it was no longer usable. I don't remember how long it took for it to break, but it was before I was ready to retire the diaper bag.
