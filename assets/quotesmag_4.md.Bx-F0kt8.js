I have horribly dry feet and my right heel has a habitual crack that I cannot get rid of. I thought I would give these booties (plus the recommended tea tree oil lotion; sold separately) a try for a deep moisturizing. I wore them for several hours the first night, and it actually seemed to help, for about an hour. Then almost magically after an hour, my dry feet returned to their normal state. I attempted to wear them overnight, but they annoyed me so much that I couldn't sleep. The gel-like insides cling to your feet. It almost feels like you have wet socks on. They are one size fits all, so they are a little big for my size 7 foot. Therefore, when walking in them, the booties slide around a little. Overall, I would not purchase again. Especially, for the $20 price tag, and that is just for the booties."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster!!!!","review":"I only used this product for 3 days and then I experienced a nightmare.

I will not buy his next book and recommend others avoid him. Cliff hangers are fine in weekly serials, and unexpected plot twists designed to draw one into the next book are fine, if well done. But to simply cut off a book in mid-chase is inexcusable.

This one is a little more \\"accessible\\" than some of their offerings. First, it is in a musical style readily recognizable, Anglo-folk-rock in the general vein of the Strawbs and perhaps Lindisfarne and countless others. The band spends much of their time letting the \\"rock\\" element influence, as in the jaunty opening track \\"Days of Sunshine\\" and the absolute killer version of Dylan's \\"Tom Thumb Blues.\\" The blasting Hammond and stylish guitar noodles on the latter just blew me away.

But this book is unusual. First, there is first class scholorship -- he knows how to look for ancient artificats, and how to read the picture they paint for you. Secondly, He shows you how he \\"backward engineered\\" the strategy and tactics of Arminius the German and followed his insights to find what no one else had been able to place for hundreds of years-- a 2000 year old battlefield that probably changed the course of history.This is one terrific book. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Legions.","review":"This battle has always fasinated me.............No person will ever explain the actual events they are lost in time.... Major Clunn in my humble opinion has come as close as anyone to giving us the details of this battle.............I could not put this book down..........It's not just boring history he made these people come alive.......I agree with his basic premise..........Varus led his Leigons south toward the Lippe River and was diverted northwest by Arminus........The approach from the south fits all the historical descriptions of this running battle.............My guess is major Clunn will be vindicated in his thesis as time goes on and more discoveries are made on the Varus trail from Minden to Kalkreise.......... Outstanding Book and a great read.."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this, buy the other two","review":"Some of my objections are similar to those already noted, especially the lack of maps and the annoying fiction. I bought the three major books on the Varusschlacht (Murdoch and Wells in addition to this one), and Clunn is the most irritating. He's a mediocre writer at best, and the book has too much redundancy, contradiction, and error. The narrative, with its imagined dialogue, is incredibly annoying. If you consider just the archaeological story, the book is okay. But even that is too drawn out, and the discovery of the most sensational artifact - the face mask - is completely glossed over. He doesn't even credit the person who found it. I recommend the other two books in combination. Wells does the best job of providing a historical background, and provides a sufficient number of maps. Murdoch's book is best read after Wells. Clunn's book is a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"The ending was a monumental let down.

Chapters cover how Taekwondo evolved upon the Korean peninsula, the code of honor to which its first practitioners adhered, the mental and emotional benefits of practicing the art, and personal growth in the skill beyond the black belt, among many other topics. Some black and white photographs illustrate this highly thoughtful and informative discussion of what is now a widely taught martial art and physical discipline.

For those who want to explore the metamorphosis of depictions of the darkest of human emotions from the 1960's on through the rest of the century, it is a reflection of life and reality at any time in history and an example of an attempt at portraying the realities of human nature by a midcentury filmmaker.

Although J.K. Rowling is ending her series in the next few years, I believe that her greatest writings will be remembered long after. Harry Potter is one of the best movies I have seen in my life, and it is worth watching now if you have managed to dodge peer pressure and curiousity all these years.

I would have paid more money for a \\"fully loaded extended addition with new special features\\" if it had been offered at the same time. Now, I will not buy another set for this movie, since I already have one.This is a missed opportunity for fans and Amazon. People WILL buy within the spectrum of offerings.

This was the perfect deal for us! Packaging was minimal, they come in the slim cases instead of the full case a regular dvd would come in and since we usually end up taking them out of the cases anyway and putting them in our dvd case, that didn't really matter. This doesn't come with any extended scenes or bonus features but still has deleted scenes in the menu.

Her wonderful voice is definitely the main attraction of the entire record, and it never disappoints. The production on the record is warm and engaging, and the musicianship is top notch---they really took their time assembling a great team. I think this record really opened up Tift's audience, and it's easy to see why. I know it's a few years old by now, but I listen to it often and think it sounds just as good as when it was first released."},{"rating":"1","title":"No So Interesting","review":"My wife introduced my to Tift Merritt's music when we were dating ... so I've got a soft spot for Tift and was really looking forward to hearing her second album, Tambourine. I'm disapointed.There's not mush to this album. It's lost the alt-country sound and is more of a boring pop album. Bramble Rose is much, much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album and a step forward from her debut","review":"Good stuff - blues-rock that is energetic, has horns (what song isn't better with horns!?!), and translates well into Tift's energetic live show. A few other reviewers have mentioned the couple of Sheryl Crow knock-off songs as being too poppy and knocking this album down a notch. That is fair criticism, but Sheryl Crow also wishes she could make an album that rocks like this! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning.","review":"The first song I heard was \\"Good Hearted Man\\", and my first word was \\"wow\\". The same with the rest of the tracks. Those who have heard her other work are saying, \\"what the...\\", but the important thing is the here and now, and this album is definitely impressive. Plenty of emotion and tons of skill, this is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't Make Me Forget Bramble Rose, But....","review":"This is a rocking album, and Tift's vocals are still hers alone. This album does remind me of Dusty in Memphis and you can hear the influence of Dusty in Tift's vocals and style, but there's an original artist here who is still developing. Maybe I'm in the minority but I thought Bramble Rose was really a resonant album that got better and better after many listenings. This album comes off initially as a cut below....something you'd put on at a party, or listen to along with a Tom Petty album. Or maybe like it's trying too hard to be the \\"breakout\\" album. But, settling into it, the album does what it does awfully well, that band is tight, and she's a very deft songwriter who is just going to get better with time. And her singing is mezmerizing and those other adjectives that mean you want to hear her again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Petri Dishes","review":"I'm using these dishes for mixing Acrylic paints and in that capacity they do the job I require.(Sorry to all you biologists and lab people out there.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT STERILE!","review":"I just bought a sleeve to use to create cultures of a few different edible mushrooms and to isolate a yeast strain that I use in brewing.

There is absolutely no mention of separation of variables, the section on greens functions forgets to mention at all what they're used for, and further how to do anything with them, and numerous other grave omissions. I feel a more apt title would be: \\"An overview of PDE's for the advanced student, and interesting applications.\\" So perhaps, for the right teacher this will be a fine book, but beware, you are going to have a lot of work filling in the large gaps the book leaves.Also, thought this has no bearing on the quality of the book, he has a strange obsession with the number 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warn multi winch mount","review":"This product is great and the price from Amazon is very competitive.

The unit is sturdy, and reasonably maneuverable. I quite enjoy being able to remove the winch when not in use, or to mount the winch to the rear of the truck, or to another vehicle.

I found it was just a rehash of other Tae Bo videos with kids working out with Billy instead of adults. The moves are basically the same. Having taught kids martial arts for 10 + years, I doubt if most kids would get into this video. After doing it a few times I think most kids would be back to the video games. IMO, kids would find this boring...I find it after a few viewings boring. I think Billy could have engaged the kids in more fun activity while working out. If you're into Tae Bo and want the kids to do it with you, then try this one. Otherwise if you want the kids to exercise, get them out of the house and into a fun activity that will be varied and not bore them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it should be","review":"This video was a little disappointing. It really didn't appear to me to be kid friendly. Billy does a good job with the adult Tae-Bo, but he didn't seem to have it with the kids. Besides I think most of the movements were the same for the kid's Tae-Bo as they were for the adult Tae-Bo. I didn't care for this, I thought he could have been more creative. In my opinion Billy should stick to adult exercise videos. If you want a good kid's exercise video, check out Kick to Get Fit Jr. For Kids, Rich Grogan shows what creativity is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Children's exercise video","review":"This video is NOT very good for kids. The movements are very similar, if not the exact same as the adult Tae-Bo video. Kids are kids and they need to be treated & respected as kids. Sure this video has children doing (attempting) to do the movements, but it is not at all children oriented. My families personal favorite is Kick to Get Fit Jr. - For Kids, Rich Grogan realizes that kids are kids, and should be treated accordingly.Sorry Billy, pretty good job with the adult video, POOR job with the children's video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids","review":"I use this frequently with second-graders. We have a weekly exercise class with 3 other classes. It gets them moving, and the boys really like it. One word of caution, you have to set ground rules (lots of room around each kid, no touching or hitting or kicking others). The only problem is that Billy gets quiet at times when he's giving really important information (like how to kick safely without locking your knees). Most kids can't hear this info in a crowded room."},{"rating":"1","title":"More frustrating than motivating","review":"There isn't a lot of instruction in this video, so unless kids come to it with a working knowledge of kickboxing, they're not going to benefit. The moves aren't explained, which is essential to prevent injury, and Blanks doesn't cue well, so it's difficult to keep up. The nine year old in our house hates this video and finds it frustrating to try and keep up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically the same thing as the regular Tae Bo","review":"A little to hard for kids IMHO, but if your kid is a work out freak or something, I guess this would do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong","review":"The page states size D but the thread was size 00.

Paris' voice does NOT suck, and she did NOT eat people, so cut the heiress a little slack and listen to the lyrics, and not her provacative outfits.Plus, we can't exactly bag on her-she can go a million dollar shopping spree and not be broke.Her voice is okay, but I suggest just burning a couple of her songs onto a CD, and not spending 17.95."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irony Illustrated","review":"I always get a laugh out of this title.

For somebody like Paris Hilton the socialite, who is trying to make her way as a singer, is nothing more than a absolute disgrace. Her debut single, Stars Are Blind is a absolutely terrible song. Her voice and image seems to be more like a knockoff of something Britney Spears did awhile ago. I really hate this song a whole lot, because it sounds bad. There have been great new acts like James Blunt who've done well, but Paris Hilton should try to go another route, she is very bad, and we don't need to listen somebody awful like that. She should really stop singing, permanently.Song: F-Worst New Act Of 2006"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Can't Amazon Allow a Zero Star Rating?","review":"I admit it; I didn't buy this CD.

I think it's catchy and upbeat and while that's the case here, the rest of the cd will decide for me whether or not I become a fan yet.

I have lost respect for the music industry. Whatever record label, company or whatever Paris is signed under..they need to be sued.

It's so forgettable, I can't even remember exactly what it sounded like, other than it was really bad. Thank God. By the way, I did not buy this single, nor did I waste my energy downloading it. My friends and I were subjected to listening to it in a movie theater 3 times while we were waiting for a movie to start. We hated it, yet we could not escape it for fear of losing our seats.

They were hard to find, glad I found them on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HAPPY AT ALL","review":"My son figured out how to open then before he turned 15 month old and now he is 21 month old and broke 2 of them.... so I am not very happy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look nice, but that is about it","review":"#1 problem I noticed is that it made both the knob and the cover easier to pull off. I figured I could live with that since he still could not turn my stove on.Then I tried to use my oven. First time using my oven the knobs melted. Now only 2 of my 5 knobs work the others were so melted they don't work any longer.This may be okay if it was stated that they aren't heat resistant, and their was an easy way to remove them every time you wanted to cook, but it just doesn't work like that.I hope this helps you decide which covers are best for you and your family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, Didn't work!","review":"They didn't work on my mothers oven. I purchased them because she has dementia and keeps trying to cook on the stove top. We removed the knobs, but she somehow finds a way to turn the stove on, so we had to turn the gas off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but fragile hinge.","review":"These are great to keep our kids from turning on the stove, however the hinge joint is pretty weak and these are easily broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't work very well","review":"We read all the reviews and while mixed, we decided to try them out. The bottom line is that they don't really do the job. There are two problems with them: (1) it is pretty easy for our 20 month old child to remove them by either simply pulling on them and removing the knob from the stove panel or by unlatching them (he primarily just pulls on them and the knob with cover comes off; one of the reasons that the knobs come off easily is that the plastic covers take up space and therefore the knobs can't be pushed in all the way, therefore their \\"grip\\" on the stove is compromised), and (2) every time you need to use the stove you have to unlatch the covers which becomes burdensome.Anyway, we threw them in a box for storage after a few weeks of trying to deal with them. Unfortunately, i don't know what alternatives we have to address this hazard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits stove knobs perfect, easy to use","review":"It seems like baby-proofing a home requires spending a huge amount of money on horribly cheap items that often don't work.These stove knob covers are the exception-- they are inexpensive, fit perfectly, a breeze to install, and do exactly what they intend. We recently moved to a home with a gas stove and our little one became obsessed with those loud, clicky stove knobs. These covers were the perfect solution for us and work very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit my Bosch stove handles","review":"These were too small, and did not fit my Bosch stove gas handles. =( Sad I couldn't use these, but the concept is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Hinges","review":"Both base and cover are plastic, held together by a sturdy metal pin which acts as a hinge. Problem is that the pin is way sturdier than the plastic it's mounted in. I have 4 of these, and 2 are broken: the pin broke off from the base in one & the pin broke off from the cover in the other (plastic's not sturdy enough in either piece). Design problem is exacerbated by the fact that you need to pinch these to open them (take a circle and pinch it into an ellipse), which puts a lot of additional stress on the plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last long...","review":"These covers, while effective, are very fragile. The plastic around the hinge pin is fragile and breaks easily. 3 of the 5 in my set have broken so far. Time to replace them with something sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be RECALLED","review":"This is a safety product, so please take the negative reviews to heart. My guess is that it's only a matter of time before it gets recalled. I reported it to cpsc.gov, and everyone else with a complaint should too. Our 15 month old figured out if he tugs just hard enough he can pop them open and get to the knobs - and if he pulls harder, he can get the cover and knob off entirely. Yes it depends on your childs level of curiosity, but do you really want to take that chance - especially as toddler's interests change day by day, minute by minute. The failure of this product could cause catastrophic injury or death. Just because some people say it works great for their kid doesn't justify the danger it poses to others. Please report this product as I did and get it off the shelves, and out of peoples homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible... they are pulled off too easily.","review":"My 15-month-old son pulled these off (and broke one) within about 5 minutes of installing them. Also, he was able to turn the covers which ended up turning on the gas.Bad design. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't stop disgusting 'poop eating'","review":"So it's obviously a disgusting habit that many puppies go through. I've read up as to why they do it whether it be lack of nutrients in their diet, or too rich of nutrients. I've also read that dogs can 'eat their poop' due to boredom, etc. I picked this product because I was able to get it fast, and because it has a money back guarantee. Long story short, I have a Chocolate Lab and he does not like eating these tablets, so I have to break them up into 4 pieces and mix them with his food and hope he doesn't pick around them. Regardless, I've been using these tablets for almost a month now and he still comes back with poop breath. I guess I'll just keep trying other products until I find something that works, because it's embarrassing to tell someone not let my dog lick them because he's a little poop eater. Maybe it'll work with your dog, but it sure didn't work with mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"One of my dogs ate the tablets eagerly, the other dog refused to eat it.

I would definately recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Try and Make Me!","review":"This is a very handy book with lots of touchingly humorous stories that help get the author's points across.

Sure. Revolutionary? Not.","review":"This book contains some interesting ideas about how to handle difficult children, though it's not clear whether the book is for MILDLY difficult kids or EXTREMELY difficult kids (for example, it's hard to imagine that parents with a mildly difficult child would ever need to use physical restraint). As a result, I'm not certain the book presents a coherent plan for dealing with EITHER type of difficult child. Some good advice is provided, but it's hardly revolutionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay except one thing","review":"I find the book quite useful in outlining strategies on dealing with non-compliant children. However, one thing I can't get past is the recommended 'hold down' approach. The authors justified that method with their experience, but I can't imagine what this teaches the child - 'I can hold you down because I'm stronger than you'. You can only do this for so long, and it advocates violence, no matter how they defend it. They said children actually become more loving as a result. Maybe those children just become more accepting of things because they deem their parents as unpredictable and willing to resort to 'violence'?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gift!","review":"What a gift Dr. Levy has given! If this book had been written when I was parenting and teaching, I could have done a much better job. It offers a wonderful, new approach to handling children. All we ever knew was reward, threaten, punish. Dr. Levy offers something much better. How fortunate the young parents of today have access to this superb guidance.

However, if you have web development experience and a do-it-yourself mentality, look elsewhere. I was expecting some information about programming and setting up your own blog.

Very cool. I think anyone out there interested in dynamic publishing should have this book. It is easy to read and follow. Dig in! I'm holding back that fifth star for three reasons, too little HTML editing advice, (pick up something else for that if you are a HTML novice, you will need it) Chapters five and six appear to be out of order, and don't quite offer enough detail, and the Chapter on RSS seems to skimp over the nuts and bolts.

It is a masterpiece of mid-century camp, with groovy and sometimes frantic Afro-Cuban and Latin arrangements of familiar Broadway tunes, topped by the light and inimitably breathy phrasing of Miss Peggy Lee. Some of the songs are just so far out there -- like the \\"cha cha\\" version of \\"Surrey With the Fringe on Top\\" -- that you can't imagine how she could get away with it. And yet she did, and still does, because every track is still remarkably fresh after nearly four decades. This is a combined album, actually -- \\"Latin Ala Lee\\" has been reissued with \\"Ole Ala Lee\\", and since the sequel is almost as good, this is a terrific bargain purchase.One fun fact: the Beatles loved this album, and their version of \\"Till There Was You\\", which I think is on the Meet the Beatles LP, was directly inspired by Peggy Lee's version.

I added all of the ice at once and it had a hard time blending the ice all up. The stir stick came in handy, without it I don't think the ice would have gotten chopped. Once I finally had the drink blended, it was to perfection - no ice chunks, which was very nice. Then the time came to use the spout.

First of all it is ALL plastic, so it will break easily. Secondly and the worst thing of all, the fluid will not come out of the nozzle like it is supposed to. My old one did. I thinned it down thinking it was too thick for this machine. Still only a little would come out and when I say a little, I'm talking about a tablespoon. One would burn up the motor trying to fill a glass. I had to take the lid off and pour it into a glass. If it's thin enough to pour, it should be thin enough to come out the nozzle. HUGE disappointment. But I found my old one and that's what I'm ordering. Both are made by Back to Basics. Hate is a stong word but I hate this machine and I'm taking it back to the store.

For the highly dedicated runners, you will be able to relate to Brett easily and will enjoy reading this book. For the more recreational runners, this book also has a very good storyline that everyone can enjoy and may provide some inspiration along the way. Finally, for non-runners with a runner in their life, this book (along with \\"Once a Runner\\", by John L. Parker) is a must read to help you understand the motivations for us seemingly eccentric breed of people. Overall, I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far Too Cliche","review":"As an avid runner I am very excited for any work of fiction that discusses the runner's experience. However Maurer tries far too hard to match John L. Parker's gift for designing witty dialogue, and ends up creating character interactions that are far from believable. Add to this the main character's cliche obsession with Steve Prefontaine, the fact that Jim Ryun is referred to as \\"Jim Ryan\\" and constant insufferable references to a main rival known as \\"The Kid\\" it is easy to see why this work was (as someone already noted) apparently self-published.In sum, the story is actually fairly interesting and not a difficult read, though I would never pay more than seven or eight dollars for a copy because the money would be better spent on OAR or Again to Carthage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Garden Design Book","review":"I was truly disappointed in this garden book. I was not inspired or intrigued by any of the gardens shown. I do admit that the book may appeal to someone with a very small urban courtyard and a preference for the avant garde style garden. The gardens were mostly minimalist with emphasis on huge graphic shapes imbedded in the lawn or piles of crushed glass layed out in pyramids. Really, an \\"aluminum garden\\"?? If there is no plant life, isn't it really just a patio and not a garden? The photography was less than stellar, with several photos out of focus. The two to three page spreads per design usually just had photographs of the same object from three different angles. I do not recommend this book for anyone who enjoys gardening with plants, discovering new plant varieties, or are looking for inspirations for plant combinations. The hardscape designs weren't very interesting either."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST novel about Hong Kong","review":"I don't know much about Mr. Lanchester's background, but it's clear that he DID live in Hong Kong and he CANNOT tell a story. There are weighty issues in the book that he simply refuses to face, such as, as far as the readers could tell, the main character has one single sexual experience - why? If it's because of his love for Maria, Lanchester keeps it a secret from his readers. And there is the child between Stewart and the nun would have to be a bi-racial child and he would have to suffer a certain amount of discrimination in rural China. But Lanchester didn't even bother to touch upon at all. All the major events in Hong Kong and China are glazed over. And Please Please tell me what's the point of tagging a short story about a flighty British woman in the beginning? The novel reads like a first draft - sloppy, careless and uneven."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"Having lived in Hong Kong for almost 10 years I looked forward reading FH.

But the more I thought about it, the more I wasn't.See, the story of Moses freeing the Jews from Egypt (from the Bible) does start when a burning bush tells him to go. God is using it to get his attention. And once Moses finally goes, God uses him to lead the Israelis out of Egypt and straight to the border of the land they were supposed to go to. When they got there, they panic at the people they'd have to drive out of the land, and that's when the problems started. God was so unhappy with their lack of faith, He then made them wander in the desert for 40 years. This was at least a year after the burning bush.While initially cleaver, this just doesn't hold up to any thought.

I was hoping to find good solutions and ideas (modernist or traditional is not an issue) to help bring a bungalow into the 21st century. The main problem with the book is that it seems 15-20 years out of date. For example, the bathroom square footage and storage areas in the plans are not generous (but this is ok for vacation or second homes). In this respect, the plans in the home have a lot in common with bungalows from the 1920s!

I was expecting a lot, and this book nearly delivers all of my expectations. I really liked the book, but I was sure hoping for a more delicate, ingeniously devised twist that I had begun to assosiate with Stephen Hunter's writing.The action sequences are good, but I was left wanting a bit more at the end of the novel. Hopefully Hunter will revisit Earl Swagger in a future novel.I highly recommend reading Hot Springs by Stephen Hunter prior to reading this.If you enjoy Hot Springs, you will surely like Hunter's popular Bob Lee Swagger series of books, the best of which are Point of Impact and Black Light. The latter book details life with Earl Swagger as a father to Bob Lee and as a patrolman."},{"rating":"2","title":"havana","review":"By far the best of the Earl Swagger novels. The character grows from one book to the next. The inconsistancies from the Bobby Lee books, acknowledged by the author, are forgiven as the reader wants to know Earl better with each book.

I tracked this book for months, and couldn't wait. Well, they're here ok, and it's an interesting story, especially with the interface of the CIA and Russians - but it lacks the passion, excitement, and intensity of his previous 'smashes'. Give yourself a treat and pick up 'Hot Springs', or 'Pale Horse Coming'. Then after you have totally loved 'em, you're ready for 'Dirty White Boys'.

Havana is a comic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what I think!","review":"This book is not even literature unless you are a NRA freak! I was expecting an historical novel with regards to the political situation in Cuba during the early 1950's as it related to CIA involvement and activities in the country. Instead, it was a preposterious shootout with improbable situations involving a bunch of sadistic gun slingers and torturers. I can't imagine the author sitting in front of the word processer trying to figure out the most bloody and disgusting murder and torture scenes possible. And then we're treated to pages of gun descripitions and operations - it reads like the old Field and Stream magazine. I'm interested in good literature and not junk like this.

There's just to much cute about the characters and what they say and do. I especially found Short and Speshnev to be below his usual standards. As a film critic Hunter should know better then to write about \\"B Movie\\" characters. Most appalling was his portrayal of Meyer Lansky. Meyer was a gangster, not some oneswise old granddad.

It is not the glasses. I am going to have some eye surgery and hopefully read comfortably again with glasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent collector's item","review":"I had read the Dark Knight Returns years before I picked up this edition, but I can't say that I'm disappointed in having both. First off the quality of this edition is a stellar leather binding which can take the roughest wear and tear.The contents include two of the best comic/graphic novels ever done (Dark Knight Returns - An aging Batman comes out of retirement to get the world back on track and get in his fix of butt kicking ; Batman: Year One - More of Jim Gordon's story intermixed with the Batman origin within the shared background of early Gotham City.) The third, Santa Claus: Wanted Dead or Alive isn't bad, however it's just filler compared to the first two more iconic offerings in this work.A couple of pages of behind the scenes discussion with Frank Miller round out this offering making it a must if you have neither Dark Knight Returns or Year One."},{"rating":"2","title":"A difficult read, but well worth the money.","review":"Frank Miller has to be one of the most difficult comic book writers to read. His panels are beautiful, but more then once I found myself wondering who was saying what, because his speech bubbles are often to very well indicated. But the book itself is purely a work of art, and it's hardback! How can you pass that up! If you are a batman fanatic this is a book you don't want to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical distortion","review":"I feel that Roiphe has capitalized on the celebrity value of Charles Dodgson to sell her story. Anyone who knows anything about the real life of Dodgson is aware that she has distorted this man's life very cruelly. Nabokov wrote a fantastic book on a similar subject to Roiphe but it sold on its own merits not on the celeb value.I didn't think the book was badly written,but there is nothing that makes it special - other than the fact it has hitched a ride on Dodgson's coat tails"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lush and poetic read...","review":"Katie Roiphe provided a wonderful read. It led to an interesting discussion between friends about the factual content, but regardless, it was a lush, poetic and creative spin on the story of C. L. Dodgson and young Alice Liddell. 4 stars for the beauty of the words, the riveting imagery and the strong development of character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Read This Book.","review":"I am not one who reads the classics and relishes the writing style, the genre of the book, or the story content. For a first time novel, this book was merely an exercise is period writing. For relevancy to 'Alice In Wonderland', this was not a story that I made sure was part of my boys childhood. In today's culture, I found it very hard to see any literary merit!!!!!!! The subject of petophylia has risen to a new level in the author's interpretation of Lewis Carroll's childhood. I found the book repulsive, disgusting, and a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated in every way","review":"This book claims to be a sensational new look at 'Carroll and Alice'. Actually it's just a warmed-over serving of old old news. Worse than this - it is totally out of date. All the 'facts' that Ms Roiphe bases her novel on were totally debunked two years ago in Karoline Leach's book 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild'.It's ironic that beneath all this fake 'revelation' and fake 'mystery' in Roiphe's book there is a REAL mystery in Carroll's life that Leach revealed and which would make a great piece of novelisation.If you want to read piece of silly pseudo-history buy this book. But if you want to read a great story - which has the advantage of being totally factual - then read Leach's book. It's better written, more exciting and wil tell you a lot more about Lewis Carroll"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewildering","review":"I picked the book without any prior knowledge of Alice Liddle or Lewis Carrol. Nor am I really familiar with Alice in Wonderland.However I must admire the beautiful style of the language. I am not literature fan, but the book is simply wonderful. It expresses things I thought would not be able to be put into words. It puts forth the deep, perplexing thoughts/feelings of a unique person as well as the other people around him.The reading is a JOY. But the ending.. alas, not knowing what exactly happened leaves me with this unsatisfaction. Otherwise it would get the ultimate 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"the realty is more mysterious than this fiction","review":"I've read this book and I've read Leach's 'In the Shadow of the Dreamchild', which isn't fiction. Even so, Leach's portrait of Dodgson is more moving and more mysterious than this nonsense of Roiphe's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creeped me out!","review":"While I agree that the writing style was interesting and that the subject was engaging, this book gave me the creeps. I couldn't get past the feeling that I was reading about a man who was one step away from being a pedophile. He was already a stalker; given more opportunity, I could see him moving past obsession into inappropriate action. Now, before somebody says, \\"You have a dirty mind,\\" let me say that I am the mother of two daughters, and I would never allow a family acquaintance of the opposite sex to have the access to and familiarity with my daughters that Dodgson/Carroll had with Alice. Whether Roiphe's novel was more history or more novel, I don't know; she certainly seems qualified to handle the subject. However, I felt dirty for having even read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just silly","review":"It's not 'well-written'. It's not 'based on real historical events', and it most certainly tells us nothing about the real Lewis Carroll.If you would like to know about the much more interesting reality that this silly cotton-candy book obscures then buy a good biography or go to a good website like Looking for Lewis Carroll (www.lookingforlewiscarroll.com).But DON'T imagine you can read this and be reading history.It's intellectual junk food for the terminally dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junky and cheap","review":"Just as the other review stated, if you are looking for solid brass (or even bronze) shop elsewhere. These piush plates are actually made of very thin aluminum and very easy to bend out of shape. The antique brass finish looks nothing like antique brass but rather brushed brass.If you are looking for solid brass, go to Lowes where you can get solid brass (unfortunately you have to get the shiny, polished brass, though) for literally half the cost of these cheap push plates here at amazon.The only good thing about them is uf you have to drill holes in them like I did, they are much easier to drill than solid brass, but they are very cheap and will not last. I would also advise against using these on the outside of a door.Poor, poor, quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe antique bronze but certainly not antique brass","review":"I purchased the push plate with the color selected as antique brass.

But anything would have been better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I just watched My Son My Son What Have Ye Done? It wasn\`t much better than The Black Widow or Anamorph.

Alas no, it was as bad as I thought. Surely an actor of Dafoes caliber is capable of much better, especially in the acting department.The ONLY redeeming factor was the beautiful rendition of the song \\"Domani e un Altro Giorno\\" sung by Ornella Vanoni in the opening credits. I played it several times. Maybe the soundtrack would be a bigger hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightening book about the Generation of the Thirties","review":"An interesting book about Henry Miller/Lawrence Durrill and the \\"Generation of the Thirties\\"-Greek poets that include Seferis, and painters such as Ghikas.The book is exactly what the NY Times calls it--a combination of literary history/critique, and cultural history. It tries to provide a deep understanding of the poetry from the decade before World War 2. It dispells the notion that Greece only has offered the world Homer & Pericles. Seferis, for example, won the Nobel Prize in Literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving it!","review":"This is the perfect pre-party CD. Pull up, Tamale, and Like That (i could be wrong on the title but its about a motorcycle.) The song with Foxy is off the chain too. Kevin Little, Beenie Man are also on par with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"This is a bore to read, unless you're really, really into the stuff.

If you were around those years and can remember when reggae was just a music to dance to and listen to, then this CD is for you. Make ths CD a collector's item. Music like this is hard to come by in this age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutley awesome","review":"They dont get any better than this. I wish they had a part 2 of this album. I was never a big fan of UB40 till I picked up this album, and now I know why they remade all these songs. These are untouchable classics!! (And by the way, I'm only 21.... I wasnt even alive in 1975... )"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Agony and The Ecstacy","review":"A superb work by Alex North,better than the Spartacus soundtrack, I believe!

When I was a film reviewer and reporter for the Daily News in the pre-Internet era, I had to rely on an earlier edition of this reference book, but mercifully, only when I needed a quick date or the name of a cinematographer.I agree with the previous reviewer. Halliwell is the Pauline Kael, Roger Simon of film critics and pundits or Will Rogers' evil clone: He never met a film he didn't hate.One example of his capsule reviews that are so acidulous they can give you an ulcer: Halliwell gives Citizen Kane four stars, then, to use Alexander Pope's phrase, he \\"damns it with faint praise\\" such as \\"A brilliant piece of Hollywood cinema...despite lapses of characterizations [whatever tha means] and gaps in the narrative...\\"Fortunately, the Internet has made cranks like Halliwell unnecessary for research purposes.Frank Sanello"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant and Snobbish Reviewing","review":"Don't be fooled by the fancy cover and good advertising. This book struck me as very ignorant and stuck up. Apparently no film is good enough to please this critic, no matter how much of a classic it's considered. The really bad part is that his critiques are childish and silly. \\"The film was too long,\\" \\"boring\\" or \\"gross\\" are just a few of the ridiculous things he says. Never does he mention directorial style, acting or any of that stuff, just \\"boring\\" or \\"too gruesome.\\" Well, sire, could you make a better movie? I smell an angry, failed director in here. Anyway, avoid this and opt for the much more sensible Video and Movie Guide from Mick Martin and Marsha Porter, Maltin's guide, or (best of all) Ebert's excellent film books.

The songs are intelligent and some thinking has been put into the lyrics. My wish is that he'd continue to write (and next time around alone)and experience life and write based on his experiences and not what the top 40 Radio wants to hear!

I found it was a struggle from the beginning and I kept thinking that if I read a little more I would understand why people loved this book. I know I shouldn’t judge a book I haven’t finished, but I could not read one more page. I did think the prose was or could be beautiful had the subject of the words been an adult.

Do you really think that people who disagree with Calvinism are unaware of those texts?People who believe differently can quote a bunch of Bible verses too. The point is not how many Bible verses you can quote, but what those Bible verses mean.To defend your beliefs, you must deal with both key biblical texts AND the problem passages, showing through the use of proper hermeneutics why these texts support your view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates false dichotomy to support its view","review":"This book commits the same logical fallacy that most Calvinist books are guilty of. That the only two significant views are Calvinism and Arminianism. The truth is that a small fraction of non-Calvinists are Arminian. Thus, the book in a sense creates a straw man and then burns it down to support its contentions, hoping the reader will then assume that the alternatives to Calvinism have been eliminated. Far from the truth. It doesn't even touch on other doctrines, such as the Limited Foreknowledge view, the Middle Knowledge view, and especially not the increasingly-held Open-Theist (or Neo-Theist or Open Dispensationalist) view. I'm not a Calvinist, but I can say... there are good books on Calvinism out there. But this isn't one of them. (But I can't help but continue to be dogged by an annoying question... If Calvinism is true, does that mean that God predestined me to be a non-Calvinist?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"I must comment that this book exhibits much of the bias to be found in much of the theological writings today, particularly on the issue of Reformed Theology and Bible versions.It is lamentable that seemingly educated people apparently cannot present an issue without distorting the position of the other side(s). And it's not only lamentable, it is downright sorry, particularly in view of the fact that we are discussing the grace of God (in this instance).I long to find a resource that presents fairly and honestly the positions held by both camps supported by Scripture.

Fact of the matter is that Frank and the proponderance of Dems making these complaints have directly benefited immensely (i.e., have made tons of bucks) from exactly the free market economic practices they complain about.

That is why they are asking this question. Liberal elites are constantly mocking and discriminating against middle America. I am proud to be from middle America. There is no mystery as to why we vote Republican. We have not been tricked to vote Republican, we vote for candidates that have values, morals, love of our country and respect for each other; from life to death. There is more to life than how much money you have, the car you have or house you own. We are not impressed with wealth and power. These are the things that the elitist will never get. Kansas is beautiful, the people are relaxed, educated and extremely friendly. There is simply nothing wrong with Kansas. Instead, it should be a model for both the east and west coasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Insightful","review":"Frank is a brilliant guy and a good writer. That's why this book is a little hard to take. It's very superficial and seems like it was written not as a deep analysis of heartland America, but more as a way to let the elites feel that they are morally superior...they're just getting out-huslted by a bunch of redneck snake-oil salesmen.He could have done a much more thoughful look at why blue-collar America has abandoned the party of Roosevelt/Kennedy/et al.For a much more balanced look at the American electorate, I'd recommend 'The Right Nation' by two Britons, Micklewait and Woolridge.."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for conservatives","review":"If only every middle-american republican would read this book...

His problem however is that he doesn't understand the Dems at all. That the Reps are bad for many Americans is virtually a given. That the Dems are as bad or worse is what Frank does not get. The economic policies of the Dems, not to mention their social policies, are a disaster for all Americans. Communism does not work as an economic tool and that's essentially what modern Democrats are peddling. Never forget that NAFTA, which has sucked more jobs out of the US than any other single piece of legislation, was a bipartisan effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the matter with the Democratic Party?","review":"Midwesterners, and southerns especially, reject the left wing agenda of the Democratic party on moral issues which they do not consider trivial, as does Frank, but central to what has made America strong. They will not consider a Democratic candidate, or any candidate, that does not hold to their values, nor the economic policies of someone they do not trust. Whether this is benefit or ill is a matter of endless debate by economists, but this situation won't change until the Democratic party nominates a more centrist candidate.I gave the book two stars because the issue is important and he has done a service by challenging us to think about what is happening to our country that is changing rapidly."},{"rating":"1","title":"After paying, never received it!!!!!!","review":"I'm very disappointed!

Middle of the road. People in the heartland don't appreciate a 'poll watcher' politician. They want someone who will stick to what they believe. Therefore, they overwhelmingly vote Republican. There you go. No need to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong on many counts!","review":"The author assumes that the policies he believes in are valid without needing to substantiate his beliefs. The Kansas people just realize that free markets and lower taxes benefit the total American society of which they are a part. He seems to think that because some people take advantage of these freedoms and get rewarded extremely generously, then it must be bad for the rest of us. Just look at how the middle class in the US fares compared to any other society with less freedoms and it should become evident that these policies benefit the working class not detract from it. Well written but just not well thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"this guy makes sense","review":"I have just seen Thomas Frank interviewed on the Charlie Rose program and boy, this book sounds great. I've often wondered how the Republican propaganda machine was able to turn a Yale & Harvard Business School graduate, an over-privileged frat boy, into a Joe six-pack populist. This book explains that along with the Democrats poor vision in allowing the Republicans to steal the working poor away from them. Reagan's policies and those after him probably did more to destroy the small American farm than anything else, yet these farmers vote for \\"conservative values\\" . Since the author is from Kansas and actually talked to the people there this book rings true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explains much of the 2004 election.","review":"I read this book because I always wondered why so many of the working poor would vote against their own economic interest.

Then, someone surfed in and signed my guest book. The \\"author\\" of this guest book entry could have been taken STRAIGHT FROM THE PAGES OF THIS BOOK!

Using Kansas as perhaps the best example of this phenomenon, the author does an excellent job of analyzing the cultural, political, and economic forces that have caused middle America to shift strongly to the right over the past 40 years. From this book, I came away with a deeper understanding of American politics, especially the Reagan conservative revolution that forged an unlikey but successful alliance of Wall Street capitalists and social conservative evangelicals to form the modern Republican machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annoyed with conservatives? You're not alone.","review":"If you're puzzled and annoyed with the grip conservatives have on American politics, you need to read this book. Frank shows how Republicans win elections by moving the focus of campaigns away from economic issues and toward \\"cultural\\" battles. They succeed in fooling working class Americans into voting against their own economic self-interests in the process. Well written and informative, it just might make you angry enough to write a check to the Democratic Party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank sees the world with socialist blinders","review":"The basic premise of Thomas Frank's book is flawed. Frank starts with the premise that conservative policies of limited government and lower taxes are against the economic interest of blue collar Kansas workers and farmers, and, in the final analysis, Frank is not intellectually honest or self-aware enough to examine his own premise.Sadly, this fundamental flaw fatally undermines Frank's book. Readers would be well-served to seek out a book with a bit more intellectual rigor."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Matter with Thomas Frank","review":"This book conclusively demonstrates that liberals wear blinders: Mr. Frank and his ilk simply cannot see that people vote for freedom, thus for limited government. Democrats are the great materialists. They think economic parity, by outcome, should be the paramount value to the \\"self-interest\\" of middle America. But it is not, and never will be. Opportunity, the child of freedom, is what they value most. Average Americans have no enmity for \\"the rich\\" because they feel they may be rich too - if that is what they desire. And, by the way, most Americans are not devoted to the simple goal of making as much money as they can. They want to be free, live free, and think freely. Mr. Frank does not acribe any value at all to \\"freedom\\". Food stamps have value; the freedom to work and earn however much or little food one wants has none.A sorry, misguided, poorly reasoned book that only a liberal elitist could love.R. Richard Livorinedlivorine@comcast.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Frank totally misses the mark","review":"Because Mr. Frank cannot possibly understand how people think in Kansas (or Mississippi, where I am from), he doesn't understand how badly his book misses the mark. Economic issues don't matter as much to folks in \\"fly over country\\". We've never had lots of money, and we don't expect to. So the idea of voting Democrat because of economic policies really doesn't appeal to us. What does matter to us is values. Money and jobs may come and go, but our Christian values are always with us. We will never support a party that supports, among other things: homosexual marriage, removing \\"under God\\" from the pledge of allegiance, abortion, abortion in the 9th month of pregnancy (partial birth), and federal funds for obscene art. Lets not forget the millions that the Democrats raise each year from the pornography industry. Mr. Frank misses the mark. It's about values, not economics. Now I have a question: What's wrong with Massachusetts?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with people who don't think like me...","review":"This is nothing but What's wrong with Red State people who disagree with liberalism. He tries to point out that people in Kansas suffer with Republican policies. But he doesn't bother to mention how Kansas has a significantly lower than average unemployment rate, high home ownership rates, and has had solid economic growth. This is another liberal who thinks he knows what's better for the people of Kansas than the people themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly snob sniffery","review":"This book is a perfect example of how liberals just don't \\"get it' when it comes to the \\"blue state-red state\\" divide. Written by someone who steps over the bodies of the victims of the politically correct \\"blue state\\" every day, and can't recognize how morally bankrupt that world is, this book is perfect for anyone who wants to understand why the Democrats are destined to be the minority party forever. I am sure that Frank would feel at home writing for the New York Times or the Washington Post, but of course like most plains state liberals who don't understand the blue states, he wouldn't survive a week in his alternative utopia like DC, the murder capital of the world. I love this book because it gets so many reviews of people who keep the Democrats driving straight for the cliff. Especially those who supposedly live in \\"Benton\\" Arkansas, but have never steped a foot out of Manhattan. Just amazing. Step on it!!! Go Howie and Hilly."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the matter with Kansas","review":"This book should be required reading in high school. To be able to understand the basis for where this country is now and how we got here is necessary to making informed decisions about the two party system of government.I highly recommend this book, but it's not good bedtime reading if you're a Dem like me. It makes for some frustrating enlightenment about how the R's do business..and hence not soothing for sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nailed It","review":"Surprisingly, this book doesn't feel dated. Frank does a good job of mixing political evaluation with personal experience to give a reader a sense of how the country has evolved politically, socially, and spiritually. As someone who grew up in Kansas City, I found his observations to be spot on in many cases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly useful...","review":"The problem with this book is that Frank, in typical liberal fashion, fails to realize the priority of religious beliefs and morality held by many conservatives. Frank cannot fathom that there are people who believe preventing abortion is more important than making an extra few dollars each hour, or that the right to own a firearm in order for the option of self defense is more important than relying on the state for protection.Additionally, the book points out that the Republican Party's policies are less effective for the \\"working man,\\" and yet it curiously fails to provide any facts to support the assertion. If you want something that states more of the same fluff usually spouted by the liberals, purchase this book. If you are a conservative--like myself--looking for an enlightening view into the liberal mind (I am beginning to believe this doesn't exist), or at least into the mindset liberals have toward the conservative viewpoint, you will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light on reasoning","review":"This is a purely antidotal treatment of why Kansans have moved more and more to the right over the last 30 years. Frank keeps asking why Kansans would elect free-market republicans to office when Frank views this as hurting the Kansan's own financial position. Frank continually asks for more labor unions and farm subsidies as the answer to the small farmer and small town financial woes. The question is never really asked about why a small business owner or a factory worker would hold a world view that embraces capitalism and less government, which really is the question that needs to be looked at. The author simply uses microeconomic examples to justify his macroeconomic decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do liberals hate normality?","review":"Great title-but terrible premise. The author approaches the people of Kansas as liberals always approach those they consider common people. Liberals believe anyone who does not live in New York City, Chicago or Los Angeles and who do not worship at the church of Kennedy/Clinton/Kerry/Edwards are too stupid to know what is good for them. The great unwashed can only survive in the world if liberals lead them through their lives.That is the author's whole premise - that Kansans should be indoctrinated by Ted Kennedy.

But I'll try to \\"wingit\\" by memory, which may be a real challenge because the book isquite forgetable.Basically the entire premise revolves around the idea that you morons outthere don't know what's good for you. So, the thing to do is to vote forthe left because they know best.Whoever you are, left or right, liberal or conservative- you probablydeserve a little more credit than that. You'll vote for who you think isbest; best for you or for your country.

There is also an assumption that Kansas is rural and blue collar. Since this is the stereotype the rest of the world has of Kansas, it sells. The fact is that the majority of population in Kansas can be found in its urban centers Kansas City, Topeka and Wichita. These are not filled with blue collar farmers. There are major corporations based in the Kansas City area alone such as H&R; Block, Sprint, Hallmark, World Span and others. The housing market in the KC suburbs is booming. Kansans are educated, white collar citizens who know what's going on in the world and happen to be conservative. I lived there and I know many people who still do.Mr. Frank has written a book of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"Typical...commonplace among self-proclaimed intellectual elites that republicans are dumb, rural people are dumb, red states are dumb.

And what a voice! Some of the numbers suffer from dated 50s arrangements (tons of shimmering violins and harps with celestial choruses), but many others are more restrained, tasteful and even jazzy. Through them all sails Damone's glorious baritone, a rich, powerful and gorgeous instrument. Especially fine are the sultry title track, the swinging \\"Alright OK You Win\\", a wistful \\"An Affair to Remember\\", and a sexy \\"Close Your Eyes\\". The songs were recorded at different times, with some of the earlier ones sounding a bit scratchy, but overall the sound quality is fine. The only real flaw is the non-existent documentation: in addition to zero information on the singer, none of the recording dates for any of the songs is identified. Still, if putting up with such cut corners is the price consumers must pay for access to gems like this, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful collection of songs from a vocal master","review":"Sinatra once said that Vic Damone \\"had the best pipes in the business\\", and this collection of songs is proof of that.

Truly experimental, these compositions are not aggressive in terms of being loud or overcharged with sounds as some of SPK's other albums, rather, the music is soft and ethereal, as are the vocal parts, whether alone or choral. At the same time, it is not at all tranquil or soothing; SPK have infused this album with a sometimes kind, sometimes dark, always quiet kind of melancholy and some songs are almost philosophical, reflective in nature.

The book does not even begin to portray what real life in Ireland is like, instead it hopes for the reader's ignorance about rural country life.

A person with the gift of service may use his abilities to assist the church, but this does not mean he has the gift of air conditioner repair, painting, or computer repair. Hemphill confuses individual service opportunities with spiritual giftedness. Hemphill does not discern between gifts and talents. Lost people may do the very same service for a church that Christians do , but they are not using spiritual gifts to do them, whether they charge the church or not.

A confirmed atheist, when his wife converted to Christianity, Lee decided to investigate the case for Christ. When all was said and done, he found the evidence so overwhelming that he decided that the evidence demanded a decision, and he became a committed Christian. This is Lee's retelling of his investigation and what he found.I must say, now I know what all the hubbub is about! This is a very interesting book.

Strobel draws you along toward his conclusion using testimonies of (exclusively) Christian scholars and it-happened-once-so-why-not -type logic, and quick dismissals of his atheistic objections to the Bible. I couldn't watch this. I had just finished watching the excellent \\"From Jesus to Christ\\" by PBS. That PBS film interviews the real scholars at the leading edge of New Testament analysis and 1st-century thought: Michael White, Elaine Pagels, Paula Fredricksen. And their narrative asks questions as though they really want answers. If you would rather watch a careless man exuberantly kicking off his atheism like a pair of old slippers, rent this.

On Yearlings, the songs are still well crafted, but the tunes just don't entertain the way Revival did. However, if you are only interested in lyrics, you will appreciate this album. But if that is the case, just read poetry. why buy a CD at all? The point of music is to ADD something to words. This music on this CD doesn't add much.

So we get The Chemical Brothers doing manufactured rock and now we get Welch doing manufactured \\"rootsiness\\".

Gillian, you've been lucky someone let you do two albums in this persona; how about trying being yourself next time. We might like you better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience Gillian - You Won't Regret It","review":"The second release from Gillian Welch and David Rawlings plainly shows that the success of \`Revival' was no accident. \\"Caleb Meyer\\" opens the disc with an Appalachian style folk tale/ghost story. Gillian proves she can sing the blues (and David can play them) with the best of them on \\"Good Til Now.\\" Other standout tunes include the simple, yet powerful \\"I'm Not Afraid to Die\\" and \\"My Morphine,\\" one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. \\"Honey Now\\" is a good old-time rock \`n roll tune, but is out of place in this collection. Similar chord progressions and musical patterns make some of the songs sound a little too much like other songs on the album, which did not happen on \`Revival.' Yet these minor faults are the only hindrances keeping \`Hell Among the Yearlings' from greatness. Definitely worth your time and money.Total time: 39:22"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully skeletal","review":"I picked this up after hearing Gillian Welch and her songwriting partner David Rawlings perform on Garrison Keillor's radio show several weeks ago. She performed \\"My Morphine\\" and the tune was so beguiling that I stopped what I was doing just to listen. The rest of this album is no less engaging. Much is made of the dark lyrical textures evoked in these songs, and to be sure, this isn't party music. But it's deeply rewarding and attaches itself to you quickly. My favorite has to be \\"Whiskey Girl\\", a dark-textured elegy to ghosts. Haunting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless...","review":"What a beautiful voice - unaffected and clear; what classic harmonies; what powerful archaic poetry. This recording is so very faithful to the spirit of original, Carter Family-era country music that you'd swear these songs were 75 years old. And where on the guitar does one find those wierd notes that David Rawlings is playing? This is serious music - not standard country fare, perhaps more stark and challenging than your usual acoustic, folk, or singer/songwriter recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncomfortably beautiful and mesmerizing","review":"I could make comparisons but Gillian Welch stands on her own; her voice is rough and sultry, beautiful, and evocative. Her writing is moving, unsentimental, deep, heartful. After reading one of the other reviews on this site, I must say I couldn't care less where she's from, how such a statement (judgment) can possibly bear any significance to how she came to create her music. Why would anyone write a review with that criteria? Faulkner wrote his novels about certain people, but did not exactly live those lives, and he was nothing short of a genius. One cannot judge from where inspiration and creativity flow. In life every thing bears opposite-ness; the dark, mesmerizing soul of Ms. Welch's music and words can only enlighten. I will never tire of this CD. It is moody, halting, pressing, gorgeous. I listen and listen and listen to it, over and over, infinitely astounded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern \\"Old-Time\\" and \\"New Grass\\" Meets the Blues","review":"I heard of Gillian Welch through the \\"O Brother\\" movie and soundtrack (one of the \\"sirens\\"), and began to listen to cuts off some of her CDs. At first, I didn't listen to this one because her other CDs had higher ratings overall in the reviews. But, when I decided to listen, I was immediately hooked. I bought the CD and haven't been disappointed in the least. As a matter of fact, this one grows on me the more I hear it. Gillian has a \\"lazy\\" style on this that is perfect for those moody-weather days (or any others for that fact). She combines \\"old-time\\", \\"new grass\\" and \\"blues-flavor\\" in a modern, acoustic (except for one song) fashion that is addictive. I hope she does more work like this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"instant melancholia / addictive, haunting poetry and music","review":"Welch's voice and Rawlings' guitar sound as intense, beneficent and honest as music can get. I enjoy an extremely addictive mixture here of haunting poetry and music that comes straight from the heart, in an American country/folklike-style that reverberates and finds refuge in my soul immediately. A music of 'instant melancholia', or, if I may borrow some of Welch's own beautiful lyrics here- a music that's like '(...) morphine' that 'will be the death of me'. Very impressive and highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Record of 1998","review":"The first Gillian Welch record was fine, this one blew my socks right off. Right from the first track, Caleb Meyer, the album blows you away with perfectly constructed instrumentation with the ripping lyrics that feel like lemon juice in your sores. Gillian sings of many of these sores like an Appalachian murder ballad. This album is so intense, like a Flannery O'Connor novel. There can be no better album released in 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equally as addictive.....","review":"I can't understand all the ranting about Gillian's \\"roots\\"....like you have to be pigeonholed into exploring only a certain kind of music because of where or when you were born.

After receiving it and assembling it, it did exceed my expectations. Its much better than what you'd expect from this price point. It does hold a whole bunch of snow jackets without problem. The only thing I wish though that it had was heavier than it is. Its weight is lighter than one would think.I highly recommend this to anyone looking for get one.

I was able to screw them in completely, and they come out after wiggling and pulling them (no turning of the screws needed).

There isn't even anywhere that tells you who did the translation. These might seem like little things, but once you are reading and Dante starts mentioning the different Popes of the time, or different Italian noblemen by name, I personally need some footnotes to help me figure out who these people are and why he's talking about them.

Hard to put this little book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good quick read","review":"I read this book in its entirety today. It was a good way to pass the afternoon, and as always I enjoy Francine Rivers' books. However, the actual story part of this book is only about 130 pages (there are devotional-type questions in the back that are additional). The Lineage of Grace books are not on the same level (in either quality or length) as Rivers' other books like Redeeming Grace or the Mark of the Lion series. I would definitely recommend reading the Lineage of Grace series, but you might want to just borrow this book from the library and save money, since it will only take a couple hours to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great book and Bible study","review":"This book was really great.

First of all, he's obviously a good reporter and an honest broker and he does a remarkable job of synthesizng beer's place in both contemporary and historical America. Second, contrary to a statement or two by some reviewers below, Wells is NOT a beer snob and in fact takes pains to explain why Bud got to be so popular and lager came to rule the beer world; he does both without being dismissive of lager or lager drinkers. As a beer geek myself I probably would have liked to have seen a little less travel writing and a little more attention paid to craft beer. But his chapters on yeast and yeast smuggling, home brew competitions and what he calls Extreme Beer are excellent and, by the way, first-class magazine journalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that have rated this book low (3 stars or less) - the supposed mission that the author was on is completely blown by his choice of territory to cover and his personal schedule. This is like reading about the authors vacation - driving from small town to small town and going out for a beer each day. Let me tell you, this gets repetitive very quickly.The only thing I learned from this book are some towns to avoid if I am looking for a flavorful craft-brewed beer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cheap American Pale Lager of Beer Books","review":"Simply awful. Though author Ken Wells may not have succeeded in finding \\"the perfect beer joint\\" (as the \\"premise\\" of this book seems to have been), he certainly succeeded in writing an awful book about a delightful subject.Travels with Barley is uninspired, aimless, uninteresting, and and pointless. I gave the book a very generous 2 stars only because I found the chapter on \\"yeast rustling\\" very interesting -- it would have made a very good newpaper feature article, as very few of the chapters in the books might have. This collection of mediocre newspaper articles is mashed up into one barely readable book.If you know little to absolutely nothing about beer but would like to learn a little or buy a nice gift for a beer lover, then DO NOT buy Travels with Barley (stick with one of Michael Jackson's books [not the King of P--, the Beer Writer])."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Charming Book","review":"This is the book that Bill Bryson would have written had he picked beer as a subject. Wells tells great stories and he writes with an agreeable and pleasing voice. He never patronizes his subjects, whether they are beer barons or beer sippers. As a result, it's fun to travel down the River of Beer with him. By the way, I'm not a beer drinker. I bought this book for my husband, who is a homebrewer, but I ended up reading it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beer Snobs: This Book Is For You!","review":"Although this book is occasionally informative and interesting, Ken Wells devotes way too way much ink expressing contempt for anyone who dares to like American lagers.

I really liked the book, and I was excitedly awaiting this video. I thought it started off with a bang and was great for about the first 10 minutes. After which, the poses were not that imaginative and I noticed that the sequencing was slightly off (ie; the verbal instruction did not match the movement). I didn't feel like I got a great yogic workout after this video. The song during Savasana was a totally cheesy instrumental bad folk song. I think this dvd is not worth the asking price. If you get it, buy it used..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little instruction","review":"The two stars are for the lovely raga played continuously during the practice by musicians right there in the yoga studio. This DVD gives you the options of either David's instruction or Sharon's instruction in the voiceover. What you get here is not really instruction, but rather a poorly-timed loose verbal prompting through a very traditional (and frankly, unimaginative) sequence of postures. There is no warmup; the sun salutation flow begins full on and at a very brisk pace. If that's how you like to practice, then this video might be for you. OTOH, if you like to linger in a posture and if you like to hear reminders about body dynamics to help you reap the benefits of an asana and get deeper into the practice, you're out of luck with this one. If the DVD still appeals to you after reading this review, please buy mine! It's been viewed twice, and is in like new condition; I won't be using it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the song during savasana!","review":"I don't understand why, during savasana, the soundtrack includes a guy strumming an acoustic guitar and singing a song containing rather vapid lyrics. I find it completely disruptive. All the rest of this practice is accompanied by instrumental music played on Indian classical instruments, with NO SINGING, and it works fine as a backdrop to the instruction. Why introduce some folky singer-songwriter at the end, when it's necessary to \\"pacify the sense organs?\\" The whiney singing does absolutely the opposite for me. And yes, I could just mute the television, but there are cues from the instructors that happen afterwards, and it would be counterproductive to keep my eye on the clock (DURING SAVASANA) to know when the song is over and it's safe to un-mute the TV. I think it's a poor choice of music for that part of the practice, and if I'd read about that in a review beforehand, I definitely would not have put it on my xmas wishlist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Packaging!","review":"Just received my order of 3 dvds.

How inappropriate, what a jolt thematically and musically, what were they thinking??? Seriously thinking about redubbing the earlier music to mask this part.I found the practice rather short when you take into account the length of time spent in shoulderstand and headstand.

The author of this book portrayed the people of the Creole Cane River community as uncultured and shallow persons.

As a book for travelers, the phonetic pronunciations are inadequate, they need to be included in both sections, Uzbek-English and English-Uzbek for both Uzbek speaking people learning English and English speakers learning Uzbek.

Still, with 8000 entries it does give at least a reasonable list of words for a concise dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you think that Uzbek is Turkish","review":"There are very few Uzbek-English dictionaries out there. There are even fewer good ones, and this sadly is not one of the best. I used this for first-year Uzbek in college, and by the time I was done there were more hand-written corrections in the book than typed definitions. The author has borrowed a lot of Turkish and said that it is Uzbek, so the more advanced the vocabulary, the more likely you are to be better served on the streets of Ankara than those of Bukhara.

I guess if you are really into obscure German electonica this might be for you. But most of the songs like Throw up or Stop Bothering Michael Jackson simple suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"First off, I wouldn't even have given this album the 1 star I gave it if I had the option. Now let me just come right out and say that I'm A huge electronic music fan, from Trance, to House, to Breaks, to DB & Jungle, and have been for like the past 10 years, I live and breathe it, and am usually pretty opened minded when listening to new music. However, \\"Mu - Out Of Breach\\" is without a doubt the worst, most god awful excuse for music(If you can call it that) I've ever had the displeasure of listening to. I picked it up after reading about it in \\"Mixmag\\", thought I'd give it a try. I Wouldn't even call this Music, it's noise, broken beats, and screaming. I know there's some of you out there who're gonna say it's experimental, but there's no excuse for this mess. Some people are gonna call this art, and that may be so, that said, it still doesn't make it any music.

If you love the Carpenters. or the Fifth Dimension, Burt Bacharach, Sergio Mendes and Brazil 66...I think this album is something you'll dig. It's got gorgeous lush harmonies, quirky subject matter, and arrangements that are hilarious...but also full of genuine love and effort. The FreeDesign calls into being the true sounds of what it might be like to hang out with Puff the Magic Dragon, how it might feel to peruse and frolic in the candy gardens of Willie Wonka. They sound like a blanket by the calm sea, they feel like sun in your hair on a blustery spring day. When I listen to the Free Design, I feel cheerful, safe and inspired, and I hope you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch songs; good compilation. Good for newcomers.","review":"This album has all top quality songs from Free Design, and would be a good introduction album for new listeners. It contains background information on the group, as well as recording studio photos. The entire album can be listened to at one sitting. It is perfect when you are in that happy-go-lucky mood. My favorites are \\"Bubbles\\", \\"Kije's Ouija\\", and \\"Never Tell The World\\". If you like retro 70's t.v. theme music, you'll dig this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean, sweet vibrant sound","review":"I grew up listening to this album on vinyl and I'm surprised and elated to find it on CD - however, there is one cut that is on the original album that is not on this CD and that is \\"Feelin' Goovy.\\" Is there some reason why that was not released with this collection? That's one of my favorite renditions of that song. Overall, though, I must say that the sound these singers have is one of the cleanest, vibrant sounds around, along with The Manhattan Transfer and The Singers Unlimited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, very functional.","review":"These coasters are very elegant and absorb large amounts of liquid.

The editors have collected well-argued and important essays by philosophers, jurists and laymen on most of the politically charged topics of today, from abortion to pornography to environmentalism. Unfortunately, the book has not been updated to include any treatment of behaviors made newly possible by the Internet; perhaps a newer edition will accommodate this angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"The book is well written and easy to use.

Be careful if you're trying to buy this edition used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative and Confidence Inspiring","review":"I read \\"Second Opinion\\" for the first time about 4 years ago. What I found to be very appealing about the book was Rosenfeld's down-to-earth presentation and his obvious care for the afflicted. The book is organized in brief, to the point modules which let you read at your pace. The book is what I call easy reading. Keeps your interest and doesn't numb you with over much medical terminology. I would recommend every person read this book even though it is long in the tooth. Many things we learn ten or twenty years ago are still good and relevant today. Wisdom never expires.

This book is dangerous and highly manipulative. It teaches you to blame all your life problems on nonsensical, farcical, and irrational assumptions for which there is no concrete evidence. This book is one of the many books responsible for the Recovered Memory Therapy epidemic in the 90's.

I read it several years ago when a friend told me that my Dad was an alcoholic. My family always denied the truth, but after reading this book, I could no longer pretend that all was well in my family of origin. This book is very insightful and describes the intricacies of the relationships that exist in both functional and dysfunctional families. It's a great first step in discovering the underlying motivations for compulsive/obsessive behaviors that many of us exhibit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my life - opened my eyes","review":"This book saved my life! It is a must-read for anyone from a dysfunctional family or in an abusive relationship. Bradshaw helps you get to the heart of your hurt, heal it, and move on. He offers understanding of the dynamics at work in abusive situations, and the understanding helps to heal. He has been there, and his analyses make sense, and they let you know you are NOT insane and you are NOT a victim. His insight is empowering and gives us all hope for the future where we might not have had any. I have given several copies to my friends in crisis and truly believe this honest look inside could benefit everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recovery books that work","review":"I have read John Bradshaw in the past, and specifically looked on Amazon for these.

The content of the book is wonderful, and I'm sorry I just didn't get the book version. The person's voice on this CD (narrator Alan Bomar Jones) has a very annoying voice. It is hard to listen to.

Dismas Hardy is one of the more interesting characters in legal fiction, as are many of the supporting cast.I only mark this one down for the somewhat preposterous nature of how certain people close to Hardy personally get drawn into a murder.

Their production is a bit corny. But, the facts that they present appear to be accurate and their presentation is only mildly biased. The fourth part contains a segment about \\"environmental terrorism,\\" which seems a bit biased. The fifth part on the third CD is very recent, very biased, and corny. It covers 9/11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I skimmed through it and at the end, it says, \\"Enduring Freedom Productions.\\" I got this video through my library, but if I had purchased it, I would be pretty upset.

These are just rocking songs that these guys pulled out for a jazz/jam band setting. I recommend it to anyone who likes to rock and who enjoys the playing of these two super dudes.

I find that it follows the same track as others in making the golden proportioning system fit about anything they want it to. Probably the most disappointing thing is the book's assembly: there are numerous overlays in the book that are not aligned with the images they are overlaying. The deviations are from slight to almost 1/4\\" - very bothersome to view. This is more of a problem with mediocre quality control and concern by Princeton Architectural Press. It's good that the book is relatively inexpensive or I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story Lost Among Too many Details","review":"As a previous reviewer stated, this manuscript was written at war's end as an internal British Government report.

It spends far too much time on the romantic triangle that forms an unnneccessary core of the plot. Frankly, I didn't like any of the characters except the African, Abonitu. There was some nice bits of social satire showing the displaced refugee Brits getting the royal screwing over and exploitation from their African hosts that they so richly deserve but for the most part this book is a rather dull exploration of what should have been a ripping good yarn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"I had to read this book for a class I took.

This steamy mixture of violins and saxophones evokes that trecherous combination of desire, frustration and determination. Just put on \\"a simple blouse and skirt\\" similar to what Matty wore at the Pinehaven Taven and everything becomes crystal clear. All you have to do is get some poor sap to help you get all that lovely money. Listening to the track entitled \\"I'm Weak\\" will make you feel anything but (just watch out for the broken glass). This is some serious seduction music...heady, sophisticated and haunting. The poor guy won't know what hit him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, But No Cigar... (Maybe a Cigarette, Actually)","review":"John Barry's pristine rendition of this classic soundtrack was released on vinyl via indie label Southern Cross Records, back in the early Eighties. (Good luck finding THAT version.) Sadly, it has never been re-released in any format, let alone CD. So here's Joel McNeely's version with the LSO on Varese Sarabande, and you know what? You could do MUCH, much worse. Though slightly different in tempo and texture, you can almost feel the Florida humidity flushing your skin, squeezing out so much moisture that you have to strip down to whatever is legally allowed...and beyond...just like Ned and Mattie...Until the actual soundtrack is found, remastered and once again loosed upon the world, this will do in a pinch, slap and tickle...Even purists will hit \\"play\\" and have to admit that Lawrence Kasdan's post-noir vibe comes to throbbing life in every groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shades","review":"Nina Storey is an extremely talented young lady. I went to one of her concerts when I was in Minnesota. Seeing her live was a treat. She has so much energy! I don't know how long she has been with that band but they sure work well together. I bought the \\"Shades\\" CD at the concert. My wife and I listen to it in the car on the way to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful White Girl With Soul.","review":"Nina's latest effort with her new band is a wonderful mix of rock, jazz, funk, and vocal ecstacy. Backed by sister's Cocoa and Yvonne Brown, Nina really packs a punch not only with her words but with melody, harmony and heart. The beautiful thing about this album is that it actually captures the real Nina Storey, if you've ever seen Nina live, then you will agree that the album has the same feeling and quality. This is by far Nina's best work (not including the \\"heroes\\" song she sang at the 98 Superbowl). The album is excellent, I can't wait to see what this redhead can do next."},{"rating":"2","title":"a torchsong elegance that pierces the depths of blues","review":"I've listened to Nina for many years and she always seems to amaze me with her talent, which actually is a God given skill. Her live performances allow her audience to capture glimpses of her soulful work. She has extraordinary presence that is reflected in her music. On the \\"Shades\\" album she takes her audience in the the chambers of her heart in songs like Crown and Left. Keep an ear on this one, but hands off because this birds' got to fly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, bad music","review":"Nina is an amazing talent with one heck of a set of pipes. But the bubble gum blues, rock, R&B, whatever you call it just is not very powerful. Whoever took this great talent and produced this poopie album with it should be put on trial! Her music should be more powerful and in your face, more emotional, not so bubble gum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice, great original lyrics.","review":"This young Coloradoan put together the best CD from this region in decades. Great live, (see Bootleg CD for early mountain town live sets) Shades is a smooth collection of Jazz, Blues, Pop, and Gospel, from the studio that show cases a very dynamic voice, with super backups and solid guitar and bass licks. You will find yourself humming the tunes and searching for the liner notes. She will be big soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"NINA STOREY AND BAND - AWESOME!!","review":"I heard \\"Let Us Walk\\" one day on the radio and was just taken aback by the amazing voice on Nina! I rushed out and bought \\"Shades\\".....that was in May and I STILL get the shivers when I listen to them and realize how very talented they all are!! You have to be amazed at the range Nina has.....and how such powerful sounds can be emitted from a little bit of a woman like her. They're all truly amazing - AND just very wonderful people!! My favorites are Left, Crown, and Shades - and one that's not on any of the CD's - A Better Man.....you have to go see her to hear that one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for the energy and emotion of her live show?!","review":"Well, you won't find it here. I bought this CD after seeing Nina live and was very disapointed. The power and emotion that she emits live somehow failed to make it on to this CD. More of a performer than a songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, nothing to say","review":"...that about sums up this CD. Some day she ought to do an album of covers, especially in the blues-rock genre. For now, her songwriting ability is mediocre (I can't remember a single melody, though I do remember that the words sometimes made me cringe), and her powerhouse vocals deserve a better setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars is more like it.","review":"this is the most soulless overproduced piece of commercial psuedo-\\"rootsy\\" garbage i have ever had the misfortune of listening to. do yourself a favor and avoid this like you would avoid a dirty pair of boxer shorts on a subway platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CONGLOMERATE OF WONDERFUL SONGS","review":"I purchased this cd not knowing a thing about Nina Storey or ever having heard her music. Once in awhile its nice to try what you may feel is an unknown artist. I was more that pleasantly surprised. The variety of songs on this cd is amazing. I felt that I had went through a full spectrum of music types only to finish the with Shades which left me wanting to play that track over and over again. This cd is so amazing that I will be watching diligently for her next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch this mix is brutal","review":"Wow--a lot of this I would hesitate to even call \\"house.\\" The disc starts out with some just nasty techno--other reviewers said it reminded them a little of Richie Hawtin, and I have to concur. I like how Moonshine included crowd noise on the disc--the screams and howls give you some idea of what it must have been like when Carl Cox pulverized this dance floor. The set gets more groovy and housey as it progresses, but it never loses that intital bangin' that absoulutely assaults you when you first slip the disc in. Carl Cox is the man. One of the best parts is that you can tell it's live--it's not some studio mix put together with exact digital timing and all sorts of trickery--it's just Carl ripping it up on three tables. Believe me, it's got more energy than your average mix CD--this is about as \\"live\\" as a CD can feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good...","review":"I don't generally like the sound of Carl Cox, but this was a surprisingly good set. It could do with out the live cheering in the background in the beginning. It's very exciting music though, and is excellent workout music. Whether you like his style or not, you'll probably enjoy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"CARL COX IS MY FATHER\\"","review":"I saw Carl Cox at the Tabernacle in Atlanta 2/17/01 and he put on a SHOW. Hybrid was headlining but they only spun and it really was quite beat until our man showed up. Someone broke out a sign that said what the title to this review is, and let me say that at least for that while, he most def. was. This CD of him in Chicago captures maybe only 40% of the energy and sound that Cox pumps out, but it still kicks so to those who havent gotten the chance to see him yet, imagine how great it really is... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"could only tolerate it once....","review":"like most moonshine releases, aimed at a new techno-pop audience, they don't stand the test of time due to their lack of true musical vision and soul. Carl Cox, who I cannot deny has skills on the decks as proved in this mix, spins a bombardment of your typical hard-house tracks- all looped and filtered samples with no build-ups or brakdowns; nothing that would keep someones interest if it wasn't \\"mixed\\". I could only hear it once, when I tried to hear it again a second time, but found myself skipping through the entire cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very posable, nice toy.","review":"I have recently puchased a stikfas set, and I found that just about any pose you put them in looks real. They're pretty small, only about three inches tall and come unasembled, each indevidual part attached to a prong on a sheet. they are easily constructed with a ball and socket system.Though they're great for posing, overuse can result in wobbly joints, which can be easily fixed by a light coating of nail polish. I have not tried this technique but I've heard it works well.I also realized that they are great for stop motion animating, if you keep them in good condition.Overall, I thought it was a nice product and recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing link between social justice and physical sciences","review":"In the last few decades, as progress has been made in the physical sciences, a hidden order has been revealed in nature. Physicists call it the Cosmic Code. It is an intelligently designed, normative order, the 'values' in which can be derived by analogy from indicators. It is written in a language that humanity can understand the language of mathematics. In attempting to understand that message, of which only a small part has been decoded, scientists aim to uncover a grand unifying Theory of Everything. Contrary to the 'natural order' conjectured by Herbert Spencer (1820-1903) in his Social Darwinism, the Theory of Everything will present objective reality of a normative and positive nature based on the larger scale governance of the universe. It will transcend all societies. The Justice Paradigm is the first book that attempts to uncover that normative order, based upon the Koran and scientific sociology"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this.","review":"The ring section is fairly easy for my 21m old, the hexagon section seems even easier for him, and the square section is practically impossible for him, so this is a toy that can really grow with your child, he also enjoys stacking them on the floor instead of on the pegs, sorting by color, etc. I do wish the colors and/or numbers were written on the blocks just for a little extra educational value, but overall a great toy, well-made and we had no issues with paint sticking or anything. We also have a plastic ring stacker and the other geometric stacker from Melissa & Doug with the triangles etc. sorted by color on 5 pegs. These stacker toys are great for fine motor skills (my son is in OT) and are good brain teasers for toddlers. I wish there were more kinds available (different shapes/colors/styles) from Melissa & Doug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint Chips on Melissa & Doug Products","review":"We love wooden toys and are all about non-toxic products for our baby. Unfortunately, we purchased this product, wiped it down to ensure it was clean, and within days, the paint started to chip. It's chipped all over the item after minimal use for two weeks. I was really disappointed and will probably avoid this brand in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Designs but Paint Is Chipping!","review":"I purchased 3 Doug & Melissa toys for my grandson, while he loves the colors and they are easy to handle, every single one of the toys has chipping paint. Poorly painted and since we don't really know what the paint is we no longer allow him to play with these toys. I am surprised that toys clearly intended for rough play, i.e., pounding, grabbing, throwing, don't last more than a few days. Disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential to be dangerous","review":"A friend got this for our toddler. It's a great idea but poorly executed. We didn't have any problems with paint or anything like that. Problem is, when the pieces come off, you are left with three thin dowels/stands sticking straight up. Anyone who has a toddler knows that is an accident waiting to happen. One trip head first into this thing and the dowels are thin enough to take out an eye. Also, the edges are not smoothed down, so it also has the potential to tear skin if landed on.I would suggest that Melissa and Doug use MUCH thicker stands that are smoothed and rounded at the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint Chips","review":"I was excited that my brother gave this to my son for Christmas, because I am a fan of wooden toys... the less toxic plastic toys around the better as far as I am concerned. However I was VERY disappointed when the paint started chipping off. It was coming off and sticking to my hands...there was no way I was going to let my son play with it! I returned the defective item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damage","review":"Damage when it came, kids wasn't happy at all. Please Don't buy it at all its a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Grandson Loves This!","review":"My grandson recently turnes 1 years old. My daughter just loved the Geometric Stacker. Not only is her son able to learn how to stack by size, he is also learning his shapes at the same time! We love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours and hours of play","review":"Our 2-year old loved this toy and kept playing with it for much longer than any other toy at that age. Great quality, it's durable and teaches about shapes and colors. We highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, this bleeds","review":"Maybe it's non-toxic but after a half hour of our toddler playing with this - although he enjoyed it - his hands were red and there were red stains on his t-shirt. So its in the garbage now. Is it non-toxic I don't know, though if toy makers used toxic paints for years and lied about them, there's little reason to believe a label that boldly says non-toxic. How many pieces of clothing out there with Gucci labels are not made by Gucci?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"When we got this toy out of the box, about a third of the pieces were stuck together because the toy had apparently been packaged when the paint was still wet. When I pried the pieces apart, paint from one piece was stuck on the other piece. After I was done, it was looking pretty ugly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible toy, please don't buy","review":"The toy was made in a very bad condition. All the wood blocks stuck to each other. It took me a while to separate them. The results are the painting is off or stayed in another block's surface. The toy is completely ruined. The wood and painting are in very poor quality. The smell of the wood is very wield. Anyway, please trust me, please don't buy this toy!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning, great value","review":"I love that this toy is great for a wide range of ages. My 10 month old got it for Christmas and is great at dumping the blocks off and getting a few back on. My 2 and 5-year-old girls love it too. They can do higher level stacking and sorting by color, shape, and size. I love that all the shapes fit all the poles and the squares can be put together in different combinations, even if they aren't the same size. This morning I found myself playing with it alone while I was on the phone in the playroom, and my girls were all playing with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for even the youngest.","review":"I have this for my child, and have given this as a gift to a few of my friends for their childs 1st birthday.

It teaches so many things...colors, shapes, patterns, coordination, stacking, designs etc.... I have already given it as a gift too. This will be my toddler gift of choice from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within the first 2 days","review":"One of the wooden dowels came unglued within the first 2 days my daughter was playing with it. Also, the largest wooden (red) circle is very resistant to go on the dowel or come off of it. She likes the toy, but get mad because she can't play with the red circle, and gets upset when it come apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 3 yr olds esp little ones with special needs.","review":"My kids love the this toy, they got it for their bday and we now use it for car trips, aside from them now learning how to throw and them throwing them at one an others car seats only a few feet away from one another they are great. I might make them an only supervised toy now that I read someone had to go to the ER because the kiddo put it on their finger. But I mean it seems quite safe and solid to me. My kids usually break toys with in a few months together. So I will update this if it does break as another reviewer stated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very educational!","review":"This toy is great! It teaches so many things ... colors, shapes, sorting, stacking ... and it also helps kids practice small motor skills and hand-eye coordination! Not many toys can teach all of these skills for this price! My daughter, like others, loved her FP plastic stacker - but I'd say this one is a \\"big girl\\" version of that. This is a toy that can really grow with her. At this age (18 months), I'm trying to buy toys for her that are educational. I think this one does the trick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Mouth","review":"My 10 month old daughter received this toy for Christmas from her grand parents. She started playing with it right away and of course pieces went right into her mouth. Her grandma assured me it was a quality product with safe paint and construction. Well she was as floored as I was then when we saw blue stain all over my daughter's mouth! I took the block and rubbed it with my hand - and off came more paint. We put it up and she has yet to play with it again- maybe when she is no longer putting everything in her mouth, but she might be bored by it then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Hate It!","review":"This product seemed like a good idea. It's colorful and seemed like a great learning toy. After I received it, I realized how dangerous it really is. There are a lot of sharp corners and the post are also scary. My child fell on it and was hurt pretty bad. Also, my little one picked up the toy by one of the post and the post just came off. It's poorly constructed and it's a hazard to kids. I tried to return it but was told my return window had expired. Please don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"My son, like every little kid, puts these blocks in his mouth. The paint flakes off and kids eat it. I don't know what's in the paint but would you eat paint? Melissa and Doug as a brand doesn't mean that the toy is automatically good. Stay away for the painted wood toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great constructivist toy","review":"Excellent for early development of hand-eye coordination, shape recognition and categorization, and creativity. My neice immediately was enthralled with this toy despite overstimulation from competing toys she received on her first birthday (many of which had the usual noises and eye-candy). She's going to be a smart girl when she grows up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"I bought this as a gift for my two year old son this past Christmas and he absolutely loved it! The paint and wood is great quality, they don't chip and don't smell or mark other things with the paint. The only reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because it seems to only entertain my son for so long, perhaps because he has other toys around him I know it's hard for kids to just stick to one thing but the square part seems a bit advanced for his age perhaps as he gets older he will get better at it and I shall update my review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Learning","review":"This is quite a step up from the basic ring stacker that so many toddlers are fond of! I like the fact that the child can stack the pieces in various orders. They are not confined to ordering the pieces by size. This product should provide months, if not years, of experimenting and learning for my 2-year-old. Valuable for teaching early math concepts.My only complaint is that close supervision is an absolute must with this toy. The long wooden poles pose a threat in my mind. Falling onto this toy, or waving the base around could result in injury. I will only allow my child to play with this toy in a seated position and only with me close by.All in all, this is a very educational manipulative with plenty of play potential. Great for learning basic colors, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous","review":"This is a well made toy but my problem with it is that the holes are small enough to get a little finger stuck inside of them. We had to take our 3 year old to the hospital to have one of the disks removed from his finger- he put it on like a ring. Be prepared to go to the ER- unless you want to risk cutting it off yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the material? NOT made of solid woods","review":"Within one day, one of the sticks was broken from the surface of the tray. My 19 months old daughter is a very gentle toy user, hardly breaks anything, so I was so shocked to see it. When I saw the center of the stick, I realized its inside is NOT A SOLID WOOD: some kind of unknown materials look like woods, which also started to make me be worried about other M&D's toys we have. I was disappointed since I am usually satisfied with this manufacturer. I also liked the idea of this toy, however, before the satisfaction of its educational value or enjoyable level for children, I as a parent wanted to have more durable material which won't be broken so easily! Therefore my rating is only one star for its toy's idea. I won't recommend this toy to children who is older than 19 months or very active toy users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead","review":"The red pieces tested positive for lead. How I wish I could turn back time and \\"unbuy\\" this. If I could rate it a zero, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must attend children playing with this","review":"To begin playing, take the blocks off the poles. At first I was worried she would fall over and hurt herself on these exposed poles. Next, the poles fell off, which then exposes this clear glue which my child wants to chew on.Just like the sorting cube I bought with this, the colored paint chips off. The square is 2 shapes which fit to be a square. Seems like a good advanced concept, but mostly concerned of the sharp edges. So those were put away.I should have bought one of the plastic versions of this. The paint would not have chipped off. And maybe the poles would have been attached to the base rather than adhered with toxic glue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design, abysmal fabrication","review":"Quality control on the product is nil. Had to return item because the parts were assembled with wet paint, so ALL of them stuck together--required a knife to separate and all of them ended up with severely chipped paint. The replacement was worse. DON'T BUY IT. A shame, because the design is great--its more complex than other versions. But stick with the better ones--Plan Toys for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable, sticks come off and paint comes off","review":"I really like Melissa & Doug toys however, we've only had this toy for two days and with three children playing with it (total probably 4 hours of play so far), the sticks were not glued into base and quickly popped off (the baby did that first thing after removing all the pieces). The other part I did not like was the fact that paint is starting to come off already on the square pieces (on the corners). Even if the paint is lead-free, I still don't think it should come off after two days of play. I am hoping to write the company and ask them about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning toy","review":"I bought this toy for my 10 month old son and he loves it. It is great for developmental growth and keeps challenging him with the different shapes! Great investment and great value"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Out of all the toys I have bought my child, this has been the most disappointing. The paint has chipped off so easily that I know feel they are unsafe for her to play with. It makes me rethink buying any other Melissa and Doug products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Orleans Brass!","review":"What can anyone say about this exuberant example of modern New Orleans brass jazz? New Orleans has been undergoing a resurgence of brass band music for the last fifteen or twenty years, and this little-known group is an under-appreciated part of that movement. Personally, I like this CD as much as a lot of the stuff put out by the more famous Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Its fantastic rendition of the Munsters theme song is such a standout that it's worth the price of the CD all by itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I did not find the dvd's helpful. The two folks in the 1st video sign entirely too fast plus the back ground for the host and hostess was horrible and it was tough making out their signs. What 'is' of use in the video (both) I learned more easily from 'TALKING WITH YOUR HANDS, LISTENING WITH YOUR EYES'-Gabriel Grayson, also obtained via Amazon, and much more for your money. In Fact, skip the video's and buy 2 copies of the book because you will easily wear the book out if you are serious about learning sign on your own.The 2nd video of this 2 set collection was a little better, clarifying the alphabet, but, save your money for maybe another video, or again, 2 of the Gabriel Grayson books.I showed the 1st video to my deaf friend to get his opinion. He looked at me,laughed, and shook his head no. He said it was too fast for someone new and he didn't care for the presentation. I didn't bother to show him the 2nd video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sign Language DVD Difficult To Use","review":"I found that the Sign Language DVD was not easy to use. The DVD has two people signing to each other in multiple chapters. I thought it was difficult to follow some of the signs and sometimes very difficult to tell which sign went with which word. I felt myself constantly rewinding to see if I could figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALS DVD Set","review":"No Subtitles, would not recomend, bought it so my deaf husband & I could learn sign language, It's useless to us without subtitles. Very Disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful","review":"This product is good only if you already have an understanding of sign language and are looking for a way to brush up. The signs are shown entirely too fast for someone who doesn't know any signs and the mock-scenarios only succeed in aggravating would be learners. Even the sections detailing the alphabet are done too fast to be learned effectively. The only useful part of this purchase is the DVD-ROM dictionary that comes with it. This allows the would-be learner to move at their own pace and repeat words, letters and signs at will. Overall not a good buy, and no, I will not be recommending this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why cost to learn ASL ?","review":"I don't think there should be too big of costs, if any, too learn foriegn languages or other types like ASL. DVD's are not a great way to learn sign language in my opinion. Anyone is going to have to reverse, repeat, rewind and so forth to really learn. Don't do it on any of these DVD's. There is a fantastic website done by a professor of ASLU named Lifeprint.com that is easier to go directly where you want, Visual dictionary, video lessons and just 10x better !! There is no catch just all free."},{"rating":"1","title":"not user friendly","review":"I have an autistic child that we are trying to teach sign-language as well as the entire family learn. This video is not usere or family friendly the kids lose interest within minutes of it being on so they know the first sign that is displayed and that is it. The quality and age of the video is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"'She's seen it ten times or more'","review":"Hunky Dory was Bowie's last album as an aspirant, just before he found fame with Ziggy Stardust. It's a fascinating work on many levels that display lyrical depth, vivid imagery, wit and great musical variety, from the music hall pop of Changes through the sixties pop of Oh You Pretty Things to the cinematic lyricism of Life On Mars, a soaring masterpiece. Another of my favorites is Fill Your Heart, a quirky number with his somersaulting voice over lively piano and cheeky sax. Elements of the folkie singer/songwriter are evident on numbers like Song For Bob Dylan while The Supermen reminds me of his later science fiction work likeDiamond Dogs. Bowie also salutesLou Reedand Andy Warhol here, in fact the whole album makes references to his musical influences. Hunky Dory is a bridge between his earlier music hall style and the glamrock that was to follow, and this was just the right mixture of catchy tunes & brilliant lyrics to ensure a timeless classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"pinnacle of pop","review":"Being an avid rock (NOT pop) fan, I had doubts when I first received the album. However, from the first strains of the chorus of \\"Oh!You Pretty Things\\" I was hooked. I (who tire of songs quickly) have been listening to this album for 2 days straight. And I will continue to listen for as long as the batteries on my cd player hold out. I have a new addiction. Thank you David Bowie for making pop that lives on past its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ziggy","review":"Bowie is one of those rare musicians who consistently produces great music. Is the 70s Bowie the best? The 80s? The 90s? The debates rages on because all his eras are filled with really good music. For me Hunky Dory is one of my favorites. Many Bowie fans claim Ziggy Stardust, Space Oddity or Aladdin Sane as their all-time favorites. Don't get me wrong, those are amazing records. But Hunky Dory has such a eclectic range of the 1970s Bowie. It's got pop hits like \\"Changes,\\" epic songs like \\"Life on Mars?\\" (which really displays Bowie's vocal range quite well), strange songs that work well like \\"Kooks,\\" and experimental songs like \\"Andy Warhol.\\" This record was not just thrown together around a couple successful pop songs. It is well crafted and and every song is Bowie at his best. If you want to get to know Bowie's earlier years then start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything old . . . .","review":"I hadn't heard Hunky Dory in years (many) and couldn't get over how fresh it sounded. It seems to defy genres, which may account for the seeming neglect of Bowie's earlier years on satellite radio. You won't regret adding this one to your library and it may just make you buy the whole collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fill Your Heart!","review":"No matter if you like David Bowie or not, if you like rock or not, this is an inspirful, amazing album filled with emotion! Bowie is a genius! The excellent use of the piano, the saxophone and excellent guitar work in superbly constructed songs, lyrically and musically makes this a rich album, which will enrich your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!!!","review":"Uhhhh...

I started with The Man Who Sold the World, then Ziggy Stardust, then Space Oddity, Let's Dance, Aladdin Sane, Hunky Dory and Black Tie White Noise. I have yet to buy the Berlin trilogy, but I have high expectations.This is most definitely my favorite Bowie album. His style of songwriting truly shines here, and the piano embellishments by Rick Wakeman add even more.Overall, a classic, you cannot go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bowie' best","review":"The more I listen to this album the more i discover.. There are several beautiful songs on this one - including 'Changes', 'oh you pretty things', 'life on mars', and 'Andy Warhol'. This is the beginning of Bowie's most creative period that I believe lasted through the 'diamond dogs' album. It does not have the same concept appeal as 'Ziggy Stardust' and subsequent albums, but musically speaking it is every bit as good.. Bowie and Ronson had a very unique sound that has not lost any of its power in 2006!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowie's second best album","review":"This is the first Bowie album I bought. After that I ended up buying almost all his albums, but I must say that none of Bowie's other albums(except maybe Ziggy Stardust) had the impact this one had on me. When listening to songs like \\"Oh you pretty things\\", \\"Life on mars\\" or \\"Changes\\" I couldn't help but wondering in what fantastic \\"musical world\\" Bowie was living in 1971. Some songs on this album are extremely beautiful and show Bowie's undeniable genius. This album will not leave you indifferent, you'll remember it for the rest of your life. I also think it's not a bad introduction to the Bowie catalogue, it will leave you so amazed that you will want to own every Bowie album (next step is Ziggy Stardust) or at least that's what happened to me. Go buy it, it's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as Ziggy","review":"This album is overrated, literally. The fact that this album has higher marks then Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders From Mars is crazy. It is nowhere as good, not even close.It's not for casual fans, its got some good tracks, but it's really arty and doesn't have a lot of jamming or rock. It's more of a serious fan album, but not a completist album, it's better then that.Basically skip this one unless you love Bowie. Start with Ziggy, Aladdin, Diamond Dogs, Young Americans, Station To Station, Scary Monsters, or Let's Dance, there are just so many Bowie Albums better then this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta be good","review":"I mean, I never heard this album, but, well, it's gotta be good, I mean, Bowie.

The rest of this album is incredibly vapid and uninspired; I feel kinda like I bought an art book because there was some Dali in it, and the rest of the art turned out to be Thomas Kincaid.If you don't already have Bowie's \\"Best Of\\", then you need to get it RIGHT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Life on Mars, Changes, Oh Ypu pretty things....Quicksand....need I say more - should be on evreybody's top five of all time - melodious, tear jerking, classic stuff - Bowie was the 70s"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this album","review":"amazing. rick wakemen from yes plays piano in this and plays better than I have ever heard him play in anything else that he did apart from yes. intenese and unique. listen to this. a genuine record. harmonies and instruments fit together perfect the sort of intensity that only Bowie could pull off. best songs are life on mars, andy warhol, and the bewley brothers, and oh you pretty boy. i enjoy the lyrics. anyone have anything to reccomend to me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sentimental young Bowie","review":"This album spawned a few well loved classics - Changes, Life on Mars - but also contains some of the best early Bowie has to offer including a tribute to Andy Warhol, and a song dedicated to Bowie's then little boy (Kooks). It has a funky, folksy sound completed by quirky, poetic lyrics that are signature Bowie. Hunky Dory feels a lot more sentimental than most of his work ... a young man, misunderstood, writing songs about those who influenced him and those who tried to keep him down. A great addition to any collection - or just a place to explore a different David Bowie sound than most are used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunky Dorry Replacement","review":"This way also An album that I lost in the old focus in 2007 in 2011 I Signed a contract for a truck and cruze but I and Tahoe but I left this album at home so I would not loose it in a repossession"},{"rating":"2","title":"gabriel struts","review":"these struts have greatly improved the driving of my car would buy them again and would recommend them to anyone wanting a nice steady ride"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Find!","review":"While rummaging through my local bookseller's bargain bin, I was fortunate to find this treat!

Author Gryzelda Lachocki reveals the story of the Niziol family who, along with thousands of others, were packed into cattle cars and deported to the dreaded gulags of Siberia to be worked, starved, and beaten to death. Goodbye Tomorrow is a riveting, highly recommended testament to one of the forgotten tragedies of World War II as we are drawn into one family's struggle to survive the harsh and subhuman conditions of deportation and labor camp imprisonment; the strength they discover and cling to when all around them is despair; and their eventual triumph in overcoming their oppressors and enduring their many trials and tribulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"so what will ya say? if Bernie Shaw is not David Byron???","review":"FOLKS!

With my wife being a US History teacher, we expected to see an intriguing story centered around the Navajo marines who used a secret code to help win the battles in the South Pacific during WWII. Instead, we saw John Woo's version of a war movie, which happens to be abysmal. Let me say this right now - SAVE YOUR ...DOLLARS, SEE SOMETHING ELSE! By taking one for the team and spending my own hard earned money to watch this film, I hope in some way I can save many other hard working Americans their time and effort. The action scenes in Windtalkers were violent, confusing, and jumbled. They all started to look the same.

There's absolutely nothing redeemable about it. From the bottom up, everything about this film is wrong.To use an analogy, this film is like a $500,000.00 home in Malibu built from clapboard, thrown away furniture crates, and discarded soda bottles.I'm not going to go into the specifics, all I'll say is that this film has nothing to do with an accurate portrayal of history, or any reality in this dimension!!The acting stinks, the actions sequences are laugable, and the main characters seem about as real as Bert and Ernie. The pyrotechnics are so unreal, I half expected that guy from Second City to appear on screen and say, \\"It blowed up real good!\\"If I were a Navajo code-talker, or even a relative of one, I would be totally insulted at some of the insinuations that this movie makes. It's too bad that these brave men couldn't have been honored with a more accurate picture of their heroism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme A Break!","review":"I like Cage & Slater, and I'm ok with war movies, but this was such a let down. First of all, it ISN'T even about the Navaho Windtalkers, it's about Cage's character and his flashbacks to the brutality he experienced in combat, and these combat scenes went on for so long that I forgot what I was watching. The story-line for the Native American windtalkers was barely noticed because there was no real plot for either Navaho character. The script for these characters was probably two pages. The only big deal was in Hollywood because of the director.

John Woo did a great job with it, making it in the vein of his Hong Kong classics like Hard Boiled and The Killer. It is an extremely flawed film, however. First problem is the lack of realism. I think of it as a western, where the marines are the cowboys, and they shoot ten thousand indians, who are the Japanese in this situation, but only two cowboys die. While those numbers may be a little exaggerated it did bother me. A movie based on true events should give a good and realistic depiction of the events. This movie fails to do that. I would say to any Woo fan to go see it just because it's Woo. But war flick fans may wanna steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I have seen this movie many times.

This guy is so over rated. I wanted to watch Windtalkers but turned it off after the second war action sequence. The war scenes were not realistic. In particular, the first battle involving Cage and the code breakers was too un-realistic. One view shows a bunch of foxholes (or bomb holes) all neatly dug out all looking identical.

And John Woo- what a flash in the pan this guy is. The action scenes are awkwardly staged...something Woo is supposed to be great at. The fighter planes are clearly matted in digitally.

The trouble was that while the purported subject of Native American code talkers is wildly fascinating, the actual subject of the movie was extensive, profane, ceaseless blood and gore.

The sentimental relationship between the two main characters Joe Enders and Yahzee is well depicted. The only weak point in the movie is that neither the remaining characters nor the Navajo codebreaking are sufficiently emphasized. If you took Enders and Yahzee out, the film would look like a good documentary.Nicolas Cage is once more very good in the role of an unhappy man who has nothing left to expect from life. The film is advisable even to those who don't like war films, just for the wonderful acting of him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by Woo","review":"I thought this would be about Navajo \\"Windtalkers\\", and theirspecial contributions-- WRONG.

It gets harder and harder to beleive that Nicholas Cage has won an Oscar. His performance was absolutely HORRIBLE! This movie should have been more appropriately titled We're Stealing Your Money and You're Watching This Garbage.Cage seems to think that he can get by on his name anymore, mistake. It may have worked and got him into films (real name is Coppolla) but its not doing anything here. I honestly believe that he has forgotten any acting skills that he may have ever had. I'm still in shock as to the fact that they didn't recast somebody who could properly portray a true story. What's next for Cage to butcher? Superman?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Windtalker is a Windbreaker","review":"The weakness of the storyline and plot is surpassed only by the really bad acting of Nicholas Cage. This man is truly the luckiest person in Hollywood. He lacks talent. He lacks good looks. And he lacks charisma. He is capable of only two expressions, and both of them resemble a constipated hound dog. If he were not Coppola's nephew, he would be delivering Domino Pizzas. If it's possible, his performance in this movie is even worse than that in Captain Corelli's whatever. And Cage manages to do this without affecting a Dracula-like phony Italian accent.

I thought it was going to be a story about the Navajo code talkers and their significant contribution to the war in the Pacific against the Japanese. It never once told why the Japanese wanted so desperately to capture a Navajo in order to break the code for them. Nor did it even delve into why this code bedeviled the Japanese.

I even broke the \\"let's wait until it is on video\\" rule we have in our family and went to see it in the movies. Having studied the Navajo codetalker's history , I couldn't believe how minimized their contribution was in the film.Instead of a history on how this program came about, the selection of the participants or in indepth look at how they fared afterward, we get \\"treated\\" to a poorly filmed movie about Nicholase Cage and Christian Slater.

I love WWII movies and can usually stomach even the worst ones, but not this. This movie looked like it was directed by a 12 year old and the acting was horrible. Script was bad. Not worth it. Even the action, people blowing up and getting shot were cheesy. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"All explosion - no story","review":"If this movie had actually been about the Navajo \\"code,\\" it might have been a decent movie. Instead, out of 2-1/2 hours, about 1/2 hour is devoted to dialogue and the other two hours devoted to gory, loud battle scenes - they are endless - in this case, less would have been more. Unfortunately, instead of empathising with the characters, you become numb from watching body parts flying across the screen.The move is about Nicholas Gage's character and the two Navajo Indian characters are merely incidental to the plot. The scenes where they are actually sending code are good and you only wish there had been much more about how having the code helped win the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theft","review":"I hate to be so cynical, but does it bother anybody other than me that one of the few recognized mainstream contributions to modern U.S. culture by a native American group has just been hijacked by Hollywood?

Cage does his part pretty well, but most others seem unnatural characters, it all seems a bit too fake. Too many episodes are beyond the limits of credibility. CGI (computer generated imagery) is pretty ridiculous, worse than a first generation videogame, it would have been acceptable in the 1980s but not twenty years later.The merit of the film, nonetheless, is to have publicised a little known aspect of the Pacific War, and it is a tribute to the valor of the Navajo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cage + Woo = Crap","review":"This movie should have been good.

I thought the acting was great & there was only a tiny part in the movie when the ships were shooting from the water that I thought looked odd. It didn't seem like it belonged to this movie.

When the Navajo Code was declassified, I was eager to learn more about these unsung heroes of WWII. When this movie came out, I was just as eager to see it but when I finally did, I didn't even finish watching it.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing . . .","review":"I rented this movie hoping to learn a bit more about the Navajo codetalkers that served in WWII. I didn't learn anything about the program at all. This movie is all about the fighting, and the acting during the fighting scenes stinks. I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage's films, but this one is definitely his worst. There is absolutely no character development and very little plot. Save yourself the time and money, and skip this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"mindless gore","review":"The only beautiful scenes are the ones solely dedicated to the Navajos or their homeland. The rest of the movie is unrealistic, stupid gore. Cage kills all the baddies in effortlessly brutal ways.In addition, the movie is historically inaccurate.

In this movie, you always stand up so the enemy has a better shot. Because of this, the battle scenes look like Napoleonic battles with the solidiers in WWII garb. The movie shows both sides to be equally stupid - immediately giving up any cover when the enemy is spotted. The inane battle scenes, plastic emotions of the actors, and the portrayal of the solidiers of both sides as dumb grunts makes it easily 1-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"windtalkers","review":"if there were an award for the worst pictures of 2002, i would nominate this. this movie managed to take a potentially good story and make a mishmash of utter nonsense out of it. nicholas cage's emotions run the full gamut from very angry to very, very angry with absolutely nothing in between or at either end. if one is fond of gruatuitous violence this is the movie for you. i quit watching at the completely improbable scene of the navajo, whom cage was to be shepherding, dressing in a japanese uniform and \\"pretending\\" he had captured cage. this only served to allow more staged violence. and, by the way, i noted the deciduous trees on \\"saipan\\" exhibiting their fall colors??? where was this thing filmed? numerous grade b saturday morning cowboy movies were more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete [bad]","review":"This is one of the biggest waste of film I have ever watched.

Maybe massive troop movements, battle plans, or enemy movements but not simple things like that. Also I got sick of old Nick firig five shots only to watch five dead enemy soldiers fall to the ground. I also didn't know soldiers had no fear of enemy fire and rarely took cover. Maybe it was because the japenese just came screaming at the marines instead of firing at them. I could tell this movie would be awful wthin the first 30 seconds and I was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windtalkers","review":"Disappointing to say the least. This WAS NOT a factual film....this was an insult to the Brave Men who gave their lives and saved thousands.

First off, if you like WWII films, you will love this one. Second, I can understand how some people could say it lacks in story.This is meant for action fans, and war film fans. It was NOT meant for the art house people that would rather sit through some French romance film. This is meant to excite, and cash in on the wave of post 9-11 war films. Like a good John Wayne film, it was meant to be a good John Wayne type action film. It wasn't meant to replace \\"Gone With The Wind\\".Afther I owned the DVD for a while, I decided to buy the director's cut edition. It adds to the film, and really makes it more complete, because the original cut of the film left out some details in the story(like the romance between Cage and the nurse). Check it out, but don't look for \\"Citizen Kane\\".

While this does save this film from the dreaded one-star rating, because I morbidly appreciate 'so-bad-it's-hilarious' filmmaking as much as the next guy, it doesn't save this movie from being a complete and utter failure.

Nick Cage is a fantastic actor and I enjoyed most of the characters. However; the story and most of the scenes were no where near the realism of Private Ryan. As one of your coined \\" the private Ryan of the Pacific\\" I found incredibly inaccurate. Plus if you pay attention you will notice much of the combat scenes take place in a desert setting. The battle for Saipan actually was more of a jungle setting somewhat like Guam or Okinawa. As usual Hollywood should pay more attention to accuracy then they do. Many in the audience saw this and it certainly hurt the realism and effected the story as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good war movie","review":"This is a good war movie with some drama added.

As a history of World War II buff, I thought that I would learn lots more about the code, the people who developed it and used it as well as the traditions behind it. The movie was lacking in all of those areas. While there was some good social commentary about prejudice toward Native Americans, I felt that this problem as well as their important contribution to the war effort were grossly understated. What the film did not lack was blood, guts, and pyrotechnics. While I understand that war is certainly not pretty, we all all seen that kind of thing before in other films. If you like that sort of thing, this is the movie for you. On the other hand, The Windtalkers had the opportunity to illuminate the contribution of a proud, heroic and patriotic people.

Nicholas Cage's performance is so bad that every time I see him on the screen I just want to look away. It was painful to sit through 2 hours of the movie focusing on him and not the codetalkers (who the movie title suggests to be the main characters). The two codetalkers and the other sergeant (played by Christian Slater) who is supposed to protect one of them are my favorite. Seeing them always puts a smile on my face. To be honest I like everyone but Nicholas Cage's character. Get someone else to play him and I'd have rated this movie 2 stars higher for mentioning the role of the Indians in WWII.

Especially refreshing was the fact that the story takes place in the usually neglected Pacific Theatre, where most books and movies concentrate almost exclusively on the ETO. While it is based on factual events, some things were rather unbelievable, but those can probably be attributed to artistic license. Overall, it was a very enjoyable movie, and I would recommend it to any fan of war movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood","review":"How disappointing! I expected the true story of the Windtalkers, and what I saw was a war movie with a white guy as the hero. Did the Nicholas Cage character even exist? Some of the fight scenes could have been shortened in order to give the background of the Navaho, how they were put into Indian schools as children and punished if they spoke their own language, how they struggled with whether or not to become code talkers, how they set up the code, and their life after the war. Some day someone should make a movie about the Windtalkers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally---a movies about Native American soldiers","review":"This is perhaps the only movie so far that has any envolvement showing the parts that Native Americans have played in any of our wars. Yet the fact remains that Native American men have taken part in every one of our wars. Even the War Memorials in Washington, DC portray African Americans, Latin Americans as well as Americans of European descent. Why, I ask are Native Americans so neglected. For heaven's sake! These people are Orignal Americans. This is their country too, and many have died in all of our wars for it. It has come to my attention that Clint Eastwood is in process of making a war movie about Iwo Jima and that Adam Beach is in it. I can't wait to see something new in the way of a war movie showing envolvement with our wonderful native peoples"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"To have taken such a fascinating story and turned it into such a piece of blancmange is sheer artistic incompetence. Windtalkers is a prime example of a director with no knowledge of - or indeed interest in - the realities of combat. At no point in the film is there even a suggestion that Wu was concerned about accuracy. The characters are cliched, the sets are straight out of the 1950s, the action is stilted and unconvincing. Rather than a *rating of 1-5, there should be a set of minus ratings for this film. Windtalkers is embarrasingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Terrible","review":"This is an action movie, not a war film in the tradition of the realistic classics we've been lucky enough to have released in the last decade. This is one of those stories in which you are required to shut your brain off in order for it to succeed. Here in John Woo's pseudo-Schwarzeneggerian version of World War Two, rifles never seem to run out of ammo, a grenade can clear an entire hillside the size of two football fields, and the morality of war is as monochromatic as an old church tract. I say all this with disappointment, because the subject of the Windtalkers deserves its time on the big screen, and it deserves much better than what it had here in this completely stupid insult to modern intelligence and the memory of the men about whom it was supposed to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"ful of stereotypes!","review":"It is a well done typicall Hollywood movie but I have seen all this so many times.

Nicolas Cage's character is a marine corp sergent who is in charge of making sure that his Nevajo Indian companion who acts as a code talker doesn't fall into the Japanese hands. This movie supposedly took place during the invasion of Saipan during WWII. The enemies, which are the Japanese Imperial Army soldiers, were basically nameless and faceless. The only purpose they serve was to be shot, just like the Indians in your old typical western movies. The movie doesn't give you the perspective of what the whole war was about. Also, it was a little unrealistic that at the end when the marines were sent to scout a hill that was supposedly heavily bombarded by the American battleships, and yet, you don't see a single shell hole anywhere. It could have been made better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Cinematography, but poor acting and unrealistic battle","review":"I found this movie to be a major disappointment. The acting was terrible even by Nicolas Cage. The guy who played Ben Yahzee did a pretty good acting job, though.The battle scenes were just terrible. The Japanese apparently couldn't hit the side of a barn while Cage takes out 3 standing out in the open from 75 yards with a hand gun. Many of the Japanese soldiers just ran up to get stabbed or shot. The bombs were too fiery; not realistic and I know as a former Artillery Officer. The bit where Yahzee and Enders trick the Japanese into thinking Enders is a prisoner; get real. A total joke.On a bright note, I thought the cinematography, especially of the Arizona Desert with the bluffs was awesome. I'm glad that the Navajo were given credit for their service in WWII. It's just too bad that it couldn't have been a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea, that could have been better... way better","review":"Windtalkers is suppose to be a epic war movie place in saipan island during WWII. Right from the get go the movie starts and lets you know the settings and whats its going to be like for the rest of the war parts. There guns and gear are very accurate, and some of the battle sections are pretty huge. As far as the reality of it all, its horrible, like it was edited for little kids. It doesn't feel like there in a real battle, and the over acting in the movie is heartless, no feeling comes from the actors. Its a very good idea, really badly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Dog of a War Movie","review":"I actively hated this movie. After twenty minutes, I was looking at my watch, wondering how much more I could take. Instead of a movie about Navajo code talkers, this is just another silly Hollywood take on a disaffected white sergeant who has to regain his humanity in the trenches after watching his former command die before his bassethound eyes. The battle scenes are endless, unbelieveable - and boring beyond belief. Cliches fly faster than the bullets and severed limbs. Nick Cage's character is badly conceived and poorly executed. The direction is uninspired, with lots of people jumping up for no reason and getting shot, then other people running to the rescue, and getting shot. Too bad the movie makers lacked the faith - and courage - to tell the story from the Navajo point of view instead of going for mock celluloid heroics that undermine the sacrifice of real soldiers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit","review":"I couldn't be more disgusted. a single well-trained soldier would survive just fine. Apparently someone working on the film told all the actors to charge and never take cover. The military advisor to this film must be as frustrated as myself. John Woo has really fallen far. Windtalkers, Face Off and Mission Impossible II don't even come close to his more famous HK films made with Chow Yun Fat. They're contrived, but not enjoyable. Woo has gone too far.

(Sundazed)","review":"'Introducing...' was the band's first lp as it USUALLY is great to always here a band's(any band's)for that matter very first effort.Originally released in 1965.Two bonus tracks are added on.It's been SO long since I've heard any music from the San Francisco five piece.Beau Brummels had managed to benefit from creating their own brand of harmless good-natured laid back pop.Heck,I think my own parents would even get something out of this reissue.The Brummels have much to offer the listener in the way of employing somewhat rich melodies and soaring harmonies in the making of their music.Key tracks include \\"Laugh,Laugh\\",\\"Just A Little\\",\\"Oh Lonesome Me\\" and the rocking \\"That's If You Want Me\\".Should appeal to fans of the Byrds,Lovin' Spoonful,the Monkees,Grass Roots and the Searchers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Peek at the Inner Dragon","review":"Something intriguing about getting inside a dragon's head - a black dragon's head at that. The book was engaging from beginning to end, dragons being what they are, one that wonders why the mighty dragon race needs humans for anything. While this dragon dabbles with humans, she ultimately finds them lacking, which lands her in hot water with Takhisis more than once. One of the better novels I read recently, one I'd surely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorite DragonLance Novels","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I predominately like the fact that it focuses on a dragon, which is why I started reading Dragonlance novels in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good book.","review":"The story of Kisanth starts out slow but picks up and is one of the most interesting books I've read out of the Dragonlance Saga. Basically Kisanth(Onyx as she is known in human form) wakes up early. Some fairy folk need her help and in return they offer to train her in a mystical power. She learns patience and earns a artifact from these people in the end (Somewhat a tragic end for the fairies) Not to mention gaining the ability to shape change. (That would be above mystical power) She then meets another black dragon and finally ends up in the Black Wing.(Not all at once) Along her journey she learns to be patient and a lot about herself and others of her kind. Ultimately though she learns a hard lesson of betrayal. This is an awesome book and I would highly recommend it to all fans of Dragonlance and fantasy books in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"This book is flat horrible. It has a broken, no sense story line about a virtually replaceable villain from the chronicles series.

The instructions (which are awful) suggest supplemental anchoring in windy conditions (I live on a mountain side so yes, that fits). But they don't really tell you how to secure it properly.

I have also given \\"The 2,548 Best Things Anybody Ever Said\\" (a compendium of volumes 1 though 4) as gifts to a number of people, including my pastor and some of my childrens' teachers.Many of the quotes require a deep wit, and often the quotes that are the best are completely lame until one understands the context (for example, Amy Carter's quote of \\"No\\", which was given when she was asked if she had a message for America's youth.) Robert Byrne also will string quotes together to make \\"virtual conversations\\" between historical figures (such as Plato and Hemmingway).An awesome companion to this is \\"Mrs. Byrne's Dictionary of Unusual, Obscure and Preposterous Words\\" (by Josefa Heifitz Byrne, I believe) which shares a similar style of insightful humor, but is applied to a dictionary of words one would be hard-pressed to fit into any conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressive","review":"Of course, the title tells one that this book is not long on quantity, but implies that it's very high on quality.

How is this turd of an album getting a higher overall star rating than the likes of De La Soul's \\"Stakes is High,\\" or Redman's \\"Whut? Thee Album\\"? Malarkey.After all of that, why was I so generous as to grace it with two stars?

If people would take the time to listen to them and not say ohh look they talk about weed, they must be another group of f*ups, they would understand that they speak there mind and they don't care.

Alexis Korner is helped out by more than a few famous guys (like Stevie Marriott, Robert Plant and Keith Richards) and that shows the great respect they all had for him. I bought this when it first came out and there are quite a few highlights such as \\"Steal Away\\" with Robert Plant on vocals and harp, \\"I Don't Know\\" and a killer version of \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" with Korner solo on acoustic guitar. Although it doesn't start until the period of the late 1960s, this set is the one that gets my vote for the anthologies that are available at the moment. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? Well, I dunno but I would probably have run to 4 1/2 if there was a button to do it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a world of wonderful animals","review":"Suprising the children by using vertically opened pages, this book begins with a simple storyline and evolves into listing an impressive range of exotically named animals. Jonas' lifelike watercolour illustrations with clean lines are given an unusual perspective through the playful use of scale and contrast of shapes. Included in the book is a good glossary of the animals named within the story, a pronunciation guide as well as a list of each animal's country of origin. I like the fact that Jonas included extinct animals in her listing which can serve as discussion sparkers on environmental and conservation concerns with children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diggety Devon ROCKS!!!","review":"As an adult I absolutely loved this CD and kids seem to love it even more!

From the opening Psuedo Silk Kimono to the final refrains of White Feather, this one album takes the listener on a journey through the deep feelings of an individual who has experienced love and loss in a young life. Fish delivers both the sadness of songs like Kayleigh, Bitter Suite and Mylo and then winds up with brilliant revelations like Childhoods End? and White Feather. If you own no other Marillion album or cd, it must be this one. It is in my top 5 favorites of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A conceptual album, classic Marillion, inspired lyrics","review":"This is a very enjoyable album.

It's in my top 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"REPEATITIVE SONGS, NO VALUE FOR MONEY","review":"I have been a fan of surrealistic Marillion music for more than 20 years. I especially enjoyed the early releases. However it puzzles me why any fan would rate this compilation \\"Misplaced Childhood\\" by more than one star, if any. I purchased it without looking at its track titles, only to discover repeated tracks in a two-disc, pricey CD set. Out of 20 songs in the set, 15 are repeatitions, two of them are recorded three times!!! This is unacceptable and I would say, shows lack of respect for fans who buy the CDs.Yes I love Marillion music, but I'd rather use my stereo player to replay my favorite tracks as many times as I want. The repeated tracks in this CD set are slightly different but this is not a good justification and there is no value for money here, especially at a price of $19.99 plus shipping. I do not recommend this CD set. You're better off buying the original releases, or pay $0.99 to download each individual song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadows of greatness","review":"2 1/2I suppose the 80's were a tough decade to get your progressive fix, but that is no excuse for this simply being derivative mostly of lesser Genesis, with a small helping of greater."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Trip Down Memory Lane","review":"I used to spend my college summers in England with family.

Will I still enjoy this?\\" I ordered it for fun and I can't believe how great it still is to listen to.All the words came right back to me. I love the way one song doesn't really end and blends into the beginning of the next song with a slightly different theme or story continuation.Misplaced Childhood is not hard to listen to nor is it easy listening. It is great to listen to while walking, cleaning house or driving the car. I love Kayleigh and especially Lavender. I have to say that I have never tried to get another Marillion album though so I have none of their other work to compare it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the very best!","review":"This Marillion album is one of the very best!

I've followed They Might Be Giants from their culmination as the Strangest of the Strange back in the 80's to present day, and I'm sad to say I was highly disappointed by this album. The live tracks (the vast majority) seem uninspired and bland, and the absolutely abyssmal cut of \\"The sun is a mass of incandescent gas\\" left me punching the \\"forward\\" button faster than the attack of a mantis shrimp. Ugh!The only redeeming thing on this album is the intriguing song Doctor Worm... but I couldn't help thinking how much better it had been had it not been so overproduced and loud - imagine the song with nothing but percussion and vocals; that would have been a truly amazing song, not the \\"listen to us kids! listen to us kids! version that festoons Severe Tire Damage.Do yourself a favor and pass this mess up and get John Linnell's far superior solo effort \\"State Songs\\" instead, or break out TMBG's \\"Apollo 18\\" and revel in what the band USED to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to TMBG","review":"This is one of the greatest cds I have (I don't give out 5 stars much).

It's a live album, with a lot of popular TMBG hits. Most of the songs are done well, but some of them can't be done so well live (Particle Man, Why Does the Sun Shine) Anyway, it's still a great cd. Go buy it if you like anything you've heard by TMBG. If you really like this album go to Flood or Then: The Early Years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why a live album?","review":"I love They Might Be Giants...I've loved them since 1990 when I bought \\"Flood.\\" But for the life of me, I can't figure out why they made this particualr album. First of all, most of the \\"live\\" versions presented here are not all that different from the studio ones. Oh, except for the fact that they're poorly mixed. The song selection is not all that great, either (do we really need a live version of \\"Spider?\\"). Some of the songs don't even sound like they were recorded live, but rather \\"re-recorded\\" in the studio. Why, I ask? A few notable exceptions: \\"Why Does The Sun Shine\\" is absolutely awesome here, in addition to a slightly peppier version of \\"Particle Man.\\"After fourteen years of entertaining us with their crazy, hilarious, and endlessly catchy music, John and John have never actually released an out-and-out \\"bad\\" album.

A refill will last a couple of weeks. The funny thing though is that my razor arrived in like 3-4 days. But everything else I buy from this site usually does not arrive so dilligently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky Lotion","review":"Some sort of an electric pre-shave lotion makes for a very nice shave. Therefore, when I saw this product, I tried it out. The liquid conditioner that is automatically applied with this shave has a very strong fragrance. (SO strong that it gave me a headache- How would YOU like it if someone chose a fragrance for you to wear, a fragrance that you didn't like? :-( ). If it were possible for me to replenish the conditioner cartridges with my very favorite \\"Williams Lectric Shave,\\" I would keep this shaver. However, Braun is trying to make a market for themselves in these cartridges and they are one-time use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, should be rewritten","review":"As oracle has intoduced rman with version 8 as its primary backup tool, I expected the book to dwell mainly on the new tool and explain features, usage and common procedures for backup/recovery with rman in depth.

I think this book had it merits in Version 7 and probably it covers all the old stuff very well, but it is nearly useless for version 8. Unfortunately there seems to be no better book on this subject right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little description of RMAN","review":"This book has a very little descrition of RMAN, which is new to Oracle 8.

As a biographer, the journey should be rational, orderly, objective, without bias. Henry Hart fails on these points in the chronology of James Dickey, but succeeds in his own efforts to promote himself, using Dickey as a vehicle. Mr. Hart is much like American cigarettes; \\"much air and little tobacco\\". From Dickey's genteel southern upbringing to his war service record (Mr. Hart sees military procedures, practices, and routines as \\"cute\\" or \\"strange\\"), from his ventures in the jungles of commercial advertising to his non-stop committments on the lecture/poetry circuit, Mr. Hart only reflects on himself as the naive little boy pressing his face to the Christmas-time storefront window of life experiences.

Unfortunately, the pop-OUT trimmer is useless. It pops out about 2/3 of the way up so you can't see what you're trimming and can't cut those long hairs that the foil refuses to cut.

Although sleek-looking, this one's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is going back.","review":"I bought mine last week and have been very disappointed. It did not come with a case, the side mounted trimmer is virtually useless, and the slidng switch is very hard to activate.Every other shaver I ever bought came with a \\"travel\\" case to keep it's various parts together. This one didn't.The Trimmer folds out at a right angle to the body of the razor which puts it completely in the wrong position for proper use in trimming hair.The sliding switch was designed with a built in lock which is pushed in to allow switching to the On positions.

The banter and over analysis by each character truly is Seinfeldian and I'm sure YEARS ahead of its time. The use of the camera is also delectible; often you will hear conversations by characters off screen while the camera is focused on someone merely \\"listening\\". Often a character will be looking straight at the camera (YOU) while they are speaking to another making you feel like you are more connected to the movie. And of course Jack has a big tirade that brings the house down!The only unfortunate aspects are Candice Bergen disappearing midway through and an ending that was less than fulfilling. A perfect rental and a good buy; if your a Jack fan it's good, if your a fan of thoughtful conversation it's a MUST!

I liked the idea of a shaver being cleaned, sanitized and charged after each shave so I bought the Braun. So far, it shaves much closer than my Norelco. The shaver is not quite as \\"mobile\\" as the Norelco due to its shape and it is noisier than my Norelco, but it is comfortable on my face and does a good job. The cleaning system works well but is also noisy for about 5 minutes. You do have to replace the cleaning fluid cartridge after every so many cleanings, but that doesn't entail a lot of money. All in all, I like the shaver and would buy it again. I do use a pre-shaving fluid on my face and it seems to help with the closeness of the shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for teenagers, a joke for men with real facial hair.","review":"I'm sure this is great for peachfuzz, but real men don't have time for toys like this.

Fortunately, this CD incorporates all of these delightful pieces on one CD as well as Gerswin's Rhapsody in Blue. Pianist Daniel Adni's gives excellent performances of all these works.

Of course it was interesting to read Billy's take on the gay part of the story but, I think even with that removed from the picture, this is a moving story of a boy's dream and his struggles to achieve it.

Each track is distinguished in its unique style, ranging from bossa nova to acid jazz to the fusion of contemporary jazzy-funk. The vocals are smooth and soulful that aren't wailing nor boisterous. The instrumental arrangements are tight and brim, at times, with an international flavor.Inner Shade is very much the equivalent of fellow Brit band Incognito, and its almost difficult to make the blurred distinction between the two well-defined. Regardless, both bands may have a similar style but are enjoyable and worth equal attention. As for Inner Shade's \\"4 Corners\\" the album is wonderfully groovy, and I look forward to their future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Corners is incognito at its best","review":"4 Corners is a CD that you can listen to without wanting to skip past certain tracks. I'm an incognito fan, and took a chance on an Inner Shade purchase, however I was not disappointed. It has the overall sound of post \\"100 degrees and rising\\" Incognito (No Big Horns). My favorite tracks are \\"Little Sunflower\\", and \\"mood to mood\\". The \\"4 Corners\\" track reminds me of a song on Nuyorican Soul's CD \\"I am the black gold of the sun\\". So... if you like your music with a mixture of jazz and funk, with a touch of Maysa's vocals, I think that you will like this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's No \\"Right\\" in Writing","review":"If I had read this as a young teen, I would have probably become a writer. It's funny,imaginative,and completely original. Everyone's voice counts in this classroom, and they are all as different as fingerprints. Get it for a kid you know...especially one who doesn't think writing is cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using Your Imagination","review":"This was a wonderful book. I started reading it one morning, and by the next morning it was completely finished. I love to write, but I never thought of how many different, unique ways there are to write, until reading The Fruit Bowl Project. This story opens up your imagination in so many different ways. When a famous singer comes to and eighth grade writer's workshop classroom and tells the kids his secret, school became much more exciting. The kids were given two weeks to complete an assignment using seven ordinary, everyday events. The twist, it had to be written in their own style, displaying their personality, in any way imaginable. I really enjoyed this book, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Comedienne of Her Day","review":"Joan Davis's original comedy was much copied by later comedians, but none could imitate her technique. Her TV series was too short for many of us and her life too tragic. Joan is appealing, goofy, and a master of timing. You cannot help but love her and the way she makes you laugh. Never raucous like Carol Burnett, never phony and self-centered like Lucy, but always hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Married Joan Vols 1 & 2","review":"This bought back many memories of my youth and early TV.

What more could you ask out of a detective story?"},{"rating":"1","title":"graphic realism","review":"The writer reminds me of Tom Wolf in his graphic writing style. Klavan became a Christian and his writing took on redemptive characteristics. But think Flannery O'Connor and don't assume a sanitized text. Human nature's not pretty. The narrator describes himself as \\"a penis with some human personality attached\\" and meets a girl (Emily) he falls in love with at first sight. He is then seduced by his boss and begins an affair with her. His redemption comes when he breaks it off with his boss and gets beaten to a pulp in an effort to \\"become a better man\\" for Emily's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap book with a horrible translation","review":"I just ordered this edition of The Double because it was simply cheap. When I started reading it, I realized the many typos and horrible grammar. There are times where I'm not sure what is going on because the translation is so poor at telling this story. Do not buy this translation. It's not worth wasting your time on. Instead I will have to delete this version and buy a different one with a more competent translator. All of this because they were too cheap to actually get a professional translator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digiread edition is FULL OF TYPOS","review":"Physically, it's a nice enough little book, and the paper looks to be acid-free. But there seems to have been *no* effort at proofing it. Digiread is willing to take money for a book that they were unwilling to spend money proofreading. It's bizarrely shoddy work, and I think this says a lot about the company. I emailed them about it, but they did not write back. My impression is that they really don't give a damn -- not about literature, not about their customers, and not about the quality of their product.Kind of a shame, really -- it's a great little novel. :(The Double"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos","review":"I would not recommend this particular book. In the first 11 pages there were 4 typos. (I have not read further yet). When I read, I immerse myself into the story line and when a typo pops up it not only takes away from the meaning but it is also very distracting.I would perhaps recommend buying from a different publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"On The Double","review":"Should I blame Borges (\\"The Other\\"), Conrad (\\"The Secret Sharer\\"), Gogol (\\"The Nose\\") or Poe (\\"William Wilson\\")? I honestly don't know. All I can say is that the short works of these authors, all four of them, will stay with me far, far longer than Dostoyevsky's The Double."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear the doppelgänger!","review":"This was a quick read. I picked it up because I recognized the reputable name of the author. An interesting book from my perspective because Golyadkin, our hero, bore such a strong resemblance to a mentally challenged man I have befriended. He repeats your name at the end of every sentence, he is paranoid, displays constant indecisiveness, talks the talk but too timid to walk the walk, talks too himself and has ended up in a mental health care facility. The 'hero' does not talk to himself directly but I believe the doppelgänger to be a figment of his imagination. He appears at our hero's lowest moment and becomes more involved as Golyadkin displays more and more irrational and paranoid behavior. Nice twist at the end, considering it is a classic, I expected him to get the girl and live happily ever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is NOT Written in the First Person......","review":".....despite what certain illustrious reviews may tell you. It makes you wonder if they even actually read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Translation of \\"The Double\\"","review":"I strongly advise against ordering this particular translation. It is awkward and deviates significantly from the original text. In addition, there are several typographical errors throughout the book. Since the translator isn't even listed, I'd be willing to bet the translation is so old it's out of copyright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"Not sure what it is, but this just doesn't work at all. Maybe it is Love Hurts with Deeper Well but there is no continuity here at all. What are you trying to do? Too many bad songs with bad arrangements. Calling My Children Home, Where Will I Be, Love Hurts, Green Pastures all stink. Are you kidding me? Another huge missed opportunity. Tulsa Queen, All My Tears and Born to Run are terrific though - just too many bad songs here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emmylou Harris SPYBOY","review":"Great live performance by one of America's best country/rock women singer/songwriters. Highly recommended for anyone who follows Harris's career and especially for anyone who likes it when Harris ventures a bit out of the country genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music experience","review":"Emmylou at her best and the band Spyboy ties it all together. As the music and vocals entwine the experience becomes more mesmerizing. Emmylou never sounded more alive as her haunting voice leads the listener through a variety of upbeat tempos surrounded with meaningful lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another superb effort","review":"This is a terrific live album that spans the years of Emmylou's music. The backup band - Spyboy - is awesome. People who didn't like Wrecking Ball (I did!) will not like the tracks taken from that album. I also know why she hasn't produced a studio album in such a long time - touring and appearing on a myriad of other albums (e.g., \\"Teatro\\" Willie Nelson), \\"Northeast kingdom\\" (Cheri Knight); \\"Other Voices, Too\\" (Nanci Griffith), \\"Friends of Mine\\" (Ramblin' Jack Elliott\\", \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\\" (Lucinda Williams), \\"Poison Love\\" (Buddy Miller), \\"Treasures left Behind - Remebering Kate Wolf\\", and the upcoming tribute to Tammy Wynette to name a few. Emmylou Harris just keeps getting better and better. I hope she contiunes her remarkable collaborative efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emmylou Harris:Spyboy","review":"I have been a fan of Emmylou for many years. This CD is a great one. Her rock, folk, and country talents show through on this CD. One word sums it up:GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment...","review":"I love Emmylou and hoped that this finally(!) new release would provide my next Emmylou fix since \\"Wrecking Ball.\\" To be truthful, I guess I really bought it for the new version of \\"Love Hurts\\" and was not disappointed with that one song, which was as soulful and gut wrenching as anything she did with Gram Parsons. But I did not care for any of the other songs, mostly remakes of songs better covered in earlier works. I guess if you're touring with a rock band it's hard not to give them space, but they drown out and overshadow Emmylou's beautiful voice and style. Hoping Emmylou will return to her roots...the soil is as rich, friable and fertile as it's ever been for her gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"An absolutely masterful CD. Buddy Miller, Brady Blade and Daryl Johnson incinerate, and Emmy, well, she radiates. Brilliant singing and playing. I get goosebumps hearing this recording - \\"Where Will I Be\\", \\"Green Patures\\", heck, man, EVERY song. Buy the CD and turn it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"shouldn't have been released","review":"This was recorded on an off night, and Emmylou's voice is not in peak condition. Also, because \\"Wrecking Ball\\" -- the album that got me interested in current Emmylou -- was recorded for another label, many of those songs could not be released on this album as planned.Around this time Harris with the Spyboy band were doing really smoking renditions of the Wrecking Ball material. If you can find a copy of her Tonight Show appearance where they did \\"All My Tears\\", and compare it with the recording of that same song here, you'll get an idea of what an amazing live album might have been made under more fortunate circumstances. Hopefully better material from this period will be bootlegged. In more recent performances her band has become considerably tamer.I don't think this album would work for fans of \\"more traditional\\" country either, but I wouldn't know about such tastes.N.B. \\"Born To Run\\" is not the Bruce Springsteen song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emmylou is one of the greats. Sadly, this album is not!","review":"There are a few kinds of music that Emmylou sings that don't work. This album has them all. The tunes are banal and she is trying to make her voice carry them. If you'd like to hear Michael Bolton sing country-folk, you might like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift","review":"This was a gift to my fiance and he loved it!

Tina Arena was very beautiful. Glenn Close was wonderful too. Micheal Ball has always been my favorite broadway singer. He was wonderful in Les Miserables, and he can do no wrong! Sarah Brightman was terrific, and Micheal Crawford was missed. Lottie Mayor is so wonderul,she is my new favorite. Everyone should leave Antonio Banderas alone. He was wonderful. He did a terrific job, and he would make a great Phantom. Andrew Lloyd Weber is wonderful, eventhough he stole most of his stuff from the early Italian composers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"If you enjoy broadway musicals, this is the DVD for you.

Out of some 26 performances there were only two that I found myself fast forwarding; Bonnie Tyler's Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts and Ray Shell's Light at the End of the Tunnel.

I couldn't sit down for a minute! I was afraid even to blink! It was breathtaking!

And music needs Andrew lloyd Webber!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Birthday Celebration","review":"The show starts with a very nice rendition by Donny Osmond from \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat.\\" The Phantom of the Opera songs were disappointing. Mr. Bandares struggled through the songs but Sarah Brightman was able to lend her beautiful voice to save the songs in part. For the most part the video is enjoyable if the listener does not expect the usual power and passion of Andrew Lloyd Webber music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Enjoyment","review":"Anyone who enjoys good music should have this video. We play it over and over again to the extent that when I stop ordering it for family members and friends we should get a backup in case we wear it out.

All of my other mugs hold a good deal more than these.I wouldn't buy these particular mugs now that I've had them (they were a gift!) nor would I give them as a gift to anyone else.

As with most books written today on Wicca, the author mixes up a batch of \\"instant Wicca lite\\" and serves it with a big ladle. Today Wicca seems to be whatever anyone feels it is at any particular time of day. This \\"blind leading the blind\\" approach to Wicca is very puzzling, but seems to be what people want.So, if you don't really care what Wicca is truly about, and want just another idea whipped up in someone's backroom overnight, then this book is as \\"good\\" as any."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is nothing new","review":"This is not true magick. it is a man made form. It is just another neo-paganism or wicca book."},{"rating":"1","title":"book","review":"The book begins with a discussion of the nature of witchcraft. Part of this section explains why women, by their weaker nature and inferior intellect, were supposedly naturally more prone to the lure of Satan. The book title itself has maleficarum, the female noun, and the writers (incorrectly) declare that the word femina (woman) is a derivation of fe+minus, faithless Satanis, or she devil with udders.Has some good spells to turn people into rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitest?","review":"Obviously skilled in her practice, the author really gets her hands dirty with this book. The only problem I have with this book is that, well, I just didn't understand what she was talking about. I've read many books about general practice and little about theory and, as the name of the book suggests with the inclusion of the word \\"theory,\\" I expected to learn something about the theory of \\"witchcraft.\\" I just didn't. It seemed like she was trying to be abstract and mysterious while battling the need to be technical and explanatory. I felt, throughout the book, that she was being creatively fictional (and not the inspirational kind) rather than paying attention to the mission of the book. Teach the reader about theory in a way that invites the public rather than a way that nurtures a mere minority!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...something borrowed, something blue.","review":"Nothing really new here. Essentially this book is comprised of common \\"outer-court\\" Gardnerian material mixed heavily with mystical Hebrew concepts found in the Kaballah. It also contains a fair amount of non-Craft \\"self-help\\" style material, which appears to be the only original stuff contributed by the author.If you have a couple of beginner's books already, then you have most of the material this book contains. The only difference is that this book is written with a bit more maturity than most Llewellyn books and is therefore not as sickly sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for those looking beyond the basics","review":"After reading through many of the basic \\"fluffy\\" new-age books, I was searching for books that discuss more than Wicca 101... and this is one of them.

Wow i bought this book thinking that it would be different from other 101 books well i was right there the authors opinions are not opinions i encourage anyone to have ugg there horrible at one point the book tells you that you must be born a witch that normal everyday people cant be witches what a load of crap!! There is no serious theory in this book only one authors convoluted opinions.. save yourself the time and aggravation and put your money into something more useful.. Everyone's money is hard earned and id hate to see anyone waste there money on this kind of horrible prose .. patrica telesco or silverraven wolf scott cunningham those are much better authors to spend your money on for a book if your looking for a more advanced text to make you think try Aj Drew"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of something old with some bad attitude thrown in..","review":"This book, on its most basic level, has nothing new printed in it. All this book is, is simply a rehash of what other authors have printed in their books. This in itself would normally not bother me, as most books these days have nothing new in them, but overall it was her attitude that ruined this book for me. Throughout the whole book she kept harping on about how her way was THE way and that if you did something differently, that wasn't pre-approved by her, then you weren't a real witch. I gave this book two stars because there is some very basic info in this book; you just have to pick through all of her ego-trip material. I also gave it an extra star because all of that said, boy can this lady write. Her use of words astounded me and it moved me to the point where I thought that she deserved another star. I think that if she were to attempt to write something fictional, it would be hailed with great success"},{"rating":"1","title":"And here we go again","review":"Essentially this book contains the same material we've seen again, and again, and again. Primarily this book is simply a re-write of common and widely available material that has been around in print for many years. Mixed with this are the uninspired musings of the author, and nothing really unique there either.My advice is to save your money and go back and read the beginner's books you already. You won't miss anything by passing on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book, which I bought for a friend who is new to the Craft. As stated prior in at least one other review, it was full of misinformation and egotism. There are a few nuggets here and there, if you can wade through the florid writing style and self-aggrandizing \\"me-me-me\\" statements. My advice is to keep looking. There is nothing in this book that cannot be more clearly explained without the excessive italics, exclamation points, and sophomoric attempts at intimidation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immeasurably ancient and forever young","review":"I don't agree with some (ok, a lot) of what is in here, but what I do agree with is utterly profound. This is a book that you may read through all in one hit, or you may read piece by piece, dissecting and ingesting the wisdom in small amounts. My favourite description of a Witch is from this book \\"A witch, like the earth, is both immeasurably ancient and forever young\\" I believe the book is the same, one that offers ancient wisdom and also a fresh outlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This is simply the most horribly written book on witchcraft I have ever read. DO NOT waste your time reading or buying this book. Between the disinformation and the ego-maniacal proselytizing,it took all I could do to stomach reading the entire thing, which I did solely in the hopes of there being some improvement, and because I detest not finishing what I start. Most of what the author states as truths or necessities are in fact her own opinions. Any serious practitioner who buys this book will be thoroughly disgusted and feel cheated out of their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypnosis DVD","review":"This is definately NOT worth the price.

Also is voice I found annoying and could not relax. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Piece of Prog Heaven","review":"Breathtaking and provocative, \\"The Devil's Hall of Fame\\" is definitely a piece of work indeed. Adding a \\"Beyond\\" to their name, \\"Beyond Twilight\\" offers up a new sound to go along with the band-name change, as well as the smartest move on the band's part, the addition of vocalist Jorn Lande. For those who haven't had the pleasure of hearing Lande thus far, I assure you that he is definitely the Vocal God of the New Millenium. Pigeonholing his voice is next to a sin, since he is able to take on a huge variety of sounds to amaze the listener with. \\"TDHOF\\" is no exception as he puts in a fabulous performance that is well suited to the dark and often times heavy prog METAL to be found within this package. This combines the the complexity of Symphony X, the dark heaviness of Abstrakt Algebra, the progressive ambience of Ayreon and the operatics of Savatage. Those looking for a mix of these elements will be in seventh heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS/CDs IN THE METAL WORLD (JORN LANDE)","review":"This is definitely one of the best metal CDs and one of the best vocal performances that has come out in a long time due in part to the legendary vocalist Jorn Lande. Not to take any thing away from the Danish band and the main songwriter/mastermind Finn Zierler, but Jorn makes this an outstanding CD. It is heavy, powerful, dark, and melodic all rolled into one. The story line is also cool!!! You can sit down and listen to it from start to finish while taking you on a musical and philosophical journey. Every song is great!!!! Definitely a hidden jem!!!This is also Jorn's best vocal performance IMHO and that says a lot because all of his work from Ark, Masterplan, Millenium, Mundanus Imperium, The Snakes, Vagabond, Allen/Lande, and his solo band JORN are great!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Errrrr.....","review":"Not pleased. Having listened to this after Beyond Twilight's BRILLIANT release \\"Section X\\", this is just a very weak effort. I liked Jorn Lande in Masterplan, especially the Aeronautics album, but the lyrics here (not sure if he wrote them) are just laughable.\\"I will break out from this madnessThere is nothing here but sadness\\"....Come on. Rhyming for the sake of rhyming..? Any song on Section X blows this album away. And it doesnt hurt that the singer is one of the best I've ever heard. Good job with the replacement boys. Basically..\\"hellfire\\" starts with a minute of robot speak that gets very annoying (Ayreon like), and godless and wicked has lyrics like \\"Godless and wicked, creepy and cold\\", I barely got through this album. I'll give it two stars because musically its got some good parts, but the lyrics and arrangement , especially in the case of hellfire, killed it for me. Pick up Section X instead, its one of the best albums I've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is pretty good, but its the ones that come later that shine","review":"Ignoring chronological order, my first R.A Salvatore experience was with the Legacy of the Drow collection, so when I went back to read all the books in order, I was a little disapointed with this.While a very interesting read, this first book is litle more than your standard fantasy book, full of battles, goblins, orcs and the like. However it does set the groundwork for some greater novels ahead.So do buy this book, but dont let its simplicity cheat you out of the later books to come. There is much more depth in the later books and they are why R.A Salvatore is a such a well known author."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"R.A. Salvatore is a poor writer, whose work is extremely derivative, to the point of stealing names from other authors. This book was full of boring action and perfunctory character development. It depressed me by its badness. If you've already read and enjoyed books by this author, go for it. If you are new to fantasy literature read Tolkien or LeGuin."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book was ok","review":"this book was fine except for the grammer and spelling errors. the charectors were good the plot was ok. how ever, i bet this guy had a fight with the editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, I really did","review":"Many of my friends have read this series and said it's unbelievable. I started it, I think it's utter drivel. I don't oft put books down. This is one. In fact, I threw it away so it's horribleness wouldn't contaminate the rest of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Book! One of Many in the same series!!!","review":"This is a fantastic book, which begins this series after the Dark Elf trilogy (another fantastic series by the same author). After reading this book in two days I went on over the next year or so to purchase the two trilogy's then as each book came out I purchased them. You could say I was addicted. They are up there with the best books I have EVER read, R A Salvatore is easily one of the worlds greatest authors. And Drizzt Do'Urden is the best! In the latest novels his friends have also played a big part, especially young Cattabrie and Wulfgar. Can't wait for Silent Blade, keep it up Bob Salvatore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Icewind Dale Trilogy- The Crystal Shard, Streams of Silver, and The Halfling's Gem, brings to life the story of a good hearted dark elf ranger named Drizzt Do'Urden and his adventures in the northwestern reaches of the World of Faerun. The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. RA Salvatore has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies. Duty, honor, bravery, magic, dragons and heroes are all about. A great trilogy indeed and a \\"must read\\" along with RA Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply AMAZING!","review":"By far one of R.A. Salvatore's greatest works. This book launches a story that will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for more with every page you turn. The story is in-depth and easy to follow without being boring. R.A. Salvatore is reknowned for is his talent at character development and this book is no exception. Read it! You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drizzt is the greatest superhero in fantasy","review":"I read every Drizzt book by R.A Salvatore except for book 3 of the Hunters Blade Trilogy..I'm halfway done that now but don't want to finish it because I erally don't want it to be the end of Drizzt novels.. Anyway,over the years,I've come to really adore the character of Drizzt,his arch enemy Entreri,the ever sly and clever Jarlaxle,the lovely Cattiebrie, and the grumpy dorf Bruenor..I never really liked Regis or Wulfgar to much though.. The Crystal Shard didn't really have a great villain,other than Errtu the Balor Demon,but the rich and detailed characters more than made up for the only negative aspect of this novel.. I'd recommend anyone to read the Legend of Drizzt novels simply because he is the greatest character in fantasy.. imo of course :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Good","review":"I wasnt expecting alot from this one really, but i was really surprised. If you are a fantasy reader, this is an enchanting read. Seeing Drizzt for the \\"first time\\" is pretty cool, and it feels pretty cool if you've read the dark elf trilogy too. I really like the crennshinibon thing, but i was dissapointed with how Kessel was brought down. I wanted a big showdown, but got..... well you'll see.It really is great, especially for you salvatore peeps out there. To keep the Drizzt train rollin', you gotta have it , right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book, Fantastic Author","review":"This book is by far the worst Salvatore book I've read (and I've read every single Drizzt book and the frist 2 Demon Wars books.) It reminds me of a \\"B\\" movie. However, I still highly recommend it, because you have to read it to read the rest of the series. The rest of the series is one of my all time favorites (right up with Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fantasy Adventure","review":"This is a fast paced action adventure, a great read and the birth of Drizzt Do'Urden. A must read for any fantasy lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic fun!","review":"This was a great story! I was thrilled by the battle scenes andvery memorable characters. I was never annoyed or bored by the eventsthat take place and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book, Streams of Silver. If you enjoy fantasy books than this one is definitly for you. I am not really sure how I missed it all these years but I'm glad I found it. This book is set in the forgotten realms world but you don't have to have read any of the other Realms books. Salvatore's world descriptions are great. This is just a fun and great read. I suggest you check it out as soon as possible! Salvatore has me addicted, this is fantasy at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enthralling fantasy story!","review":"This first installment to the icewind dale tril, serving of the introduction of many salvatore characters. The sheer brillance of story creation and telling is a testament to salvatore's early mastery of this genere. The novel is captivating from beginning to end, with each part unravelling a more epic section of the plot. The telling flows with the grace of a dark elven swordsman, as it weaves in and out of encounters with monsters, and other conflicts of ALL sorts. if thats not enough, the end is the best part---if you are a true lover of fantasy---READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Beginning!","review":"A true worthwhile read for all fans of the the Drow Elf Drizzt Du' Urden. This book begins the adventures of the Companions from the Spine of the World. While at points the characters seem to be behaving inconsistently with their later incarnations, I believe that all in all, the book is a great way to start the whole saga of the Dark Elf, and his adventures above menzzoberranzan( I think that's how it is spelled) as well as his future adventures in the search for Mithrill Hall and his Eventual return (although brief) to his Dark Homeland."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Beginning to an Epic Trilogy","review":"The Crystal Shard is one of the greatest books I have ever read, rivaling with Slaughterhouse-5 and Breakfast of Champions (both by Kurt Vonnegut check them out). I think the Salvatore is a very talented writer. There are a few things wrong with his writing, but that can be expected with any writer. Salvatore's will keep you at the edge of your seat. I've read Tolkien's books and Tolkien's is the founder of the Fantasy genre, but I think people that write that Salvatore steals ideas from him are speaking prematurely. The book has a fabulous set of creative and interesting characters. All in all Salvatore is one of the best writers of the modern day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack! I restate my review here:","review":"Remember my review? Sure you do, the one with the Rating system. Remember how people enjoyed it? Well, to say the least, I direly regret that review. This book can be summed up in one word: Abhorrent. This book is not literature. It is nothing. Nihil. Whatever. This book is just ad nauseum for teenagers, nothing more. (Sorry for exercising my Latin)Do not read this book, it is a dreg of a book. (Do not take offense) It is a read for young adults who are familiar with fantasy, yet have a sub-par taste in literature. No, this book is a waste of good trees, art, and ink, that's for sure.

Salvatore is really not a very good writer. When I was, oh, ten or twelve, I absolutely adored this stuff. Then I got older, and I found that that had changed quite a bit. Salvatore's characters are very flat and bland, even when they're not obvious Tolkien rip-offs. Having a drow as a central character is novel, but that's about all it is. I think it strikes a chord because everybody feels persecuted sometimes and wishes that they were strong enough to DO something about it. Drizzt is a guy who really IS and CAN. Really, though, the dialogue is trite, the battle scenes are unspeakably tedious, and, though I can't outright condemn it (I sure as hell enjoyed it at one time), I can't recommend it to anyone either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad","review":"Who was the real enemy....

This book had every monster of fantasy you could think of from halfling to dragon this book has it all! Its none stop action and keeps your attention every minute.

Whatever you think about Nazareth, this is a lousy DVD. It is not as described. It does not recount their history. There are no interviews, no detailed portrait. It does not look at their legacy. There are no unreleased tracks from Expect No Mercy. The 'memorabilia' section amounts to a bunch of crappy photos. Truth be told, this is just a low quality recording of an incomplete BBC 'Sight & Sound' concert broadcast from 1977. The extras merely comprise the aforementioned photos, plus a few (embarrassingly bad) videos tacked on. One thing the DVD does reveal is that Manny Charlton really wasn't a very good guitarist. At their best Nazareth were a great band, but this is not Nazareth at their best. It does them no justice. Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I took a listen to this CD the other day, not really knowing much about Kelly Price, and I was blown away by her vocal power! Although many of the songs on the album are nothing particularly original, Kelly Price sings with such grace and elegance that it's hard not to like the album. A big standout on the CD is 'As We Lay\\", which shows off Price's amazing talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"KELLY PLEASE BELT OUT THE SONGS","review":"EVERY ONES KNOW THAT SOUL OF A WOMAN WAS THE ALBUM KELLY WAS SINGING HER BUT OFF.

KELLY NEVER REALLY GIVES U THE VOCALS THAT SHE HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR THIS WAS THE TIME FOR U TO SHINE KELLY.... THE BACKGROUND VOCALS CARRY MOST OF THE SONGS WITH KELLY GIVING A LEAD THAT IS JUST OK, BUT SHE IS NOT DOING TRICKS WITH THE VOICE LIKE THE FIRST ALBUM. BUT I MUST GIVE THE GIRL THE PROPS SHE WROTE 99% OF THE ALBUM WHICH IS SMART ( MORE MONEY GIRL ) BUT THE ALBUM IS A ALBUM THAT U CAN PLAY FROM START TO FINISH.

The girl can sing. I wish she would do a gospel cd. Her songs speak of the trails and issues facing everyday relationships. She lost over 100 lbs and looks and sounds even better. I love the song '3 Strikes'; you mess up three times you is out! She wrote most of her own songs. That needs to acknowledge. 'The Lullaby', has kids singing the chorus (so cute). Overall it is worth the money......"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's back and better than ever","review":"This new album by Kelly Price is great ! She is proving that she is the next big thing in female vocalists. Since Whitney has decided to continue to allow her career and life to spiral out of control, it only seems right that a singer who was good enough to back her up sees the opportunity to step forward and shine does so. This album is just plain nice listening music. At times the vocals are a bit overpowering, but those who liked Soul of a Woman know that is just part of her style. My favorite song on the album is the remake of As We Lay which is a classic in its own right. But Kelly Price takes it and tweaks it just a bit in all the right places to make for a real sharp and updated sound. If you liked her previous release and all the work she has done with R. Kelly you will like this new material. Also her new look is absolutely fabulous ! I think this is going to be what really sends her over the top !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirror, Mirror -- Kelly is the bombest of them all !","review":"This record takes 'Soul Of A Woman' to the next level. KP has truly put her foot in this one. The writers showed up, the producers showed up, PaJam, Shep, W. Campbell, R. Kelly and others really did their thing. This record shows that real music is back on the scene.Her melodic tone coupled with lyrics of issues that are sure to hit almost anyone who listens right at home. Songs like 'You Should've Told Me', 'She Want's You' and the irresistable cover 'As we lay' are more like listening to an mental motion picture. Each song paints a picture makes the listener indulge.....Kelly - You Should've Told Me you were coming like this......Much Love !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful Woman","review":"Kelly Price returns with Mirror Mirror, her sophmore effort. It leads up to its expectations, and even more! She is a wonderful singer and has a beautiful voice. You feel like she is singing just for you, like she was your friend or something. My favorites include the title track (AWESOME). I Know Who Holds Tommorow and As We Lay, you can just feel the power and emotion in her voice. Another touching song is The Lullaby, which is dedicated to her children, who sing with her. I think Kelly should duet with Mary J Blige. They would sound great together. If you like R&B/soul type music, this is a great cd for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the \\"R&B\\" of today. Kelly makes a solid singer/songwriter.","review":"There is definitely some material here worth checking out:You Should've Told Me, At Least (The Little Things), She Wants You, National Anthem (Interlude) (My favorite, should've been a full song!), The Lullaby, All I Want Is You, As We Lay and Love Sets You Free.Yes, that's almost the entire CD, but this CD isn't without its faults.Good Love is very generic and almost unmentionable. 3 Strikes is catchy, but nothing to brag about and Like You Do Feat. Meth brings variety, but I wouldn't shed a tear, had it have been left off the album entirely. And as much as I Know Who Holds Tomorrow features nice and powerful vocals, I disagree with the editor's review, and say it is definitely overshadowed by other songs.Overall, a good release, but some songs weren't necessary.Cover Art: A-Inside Art: B+Songwriting: BVocals: AProduction: B+Overall: B+4.4 stars.If you're an R&B; fan, you should like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reflection of a star.","review":"Kelly Price's sophmoric effort is everything and the proverbial bag of chips at the regular price! Where SOUL OF A WOMAN introduces her talent at being more than a backup singer, MIRROR MIRROR takes her straight to the top. She is definitely the diva of the millenium and her voice is so natural that no extra instrumentation is needed to accent is any further. Kelly is one of my favorites and at the the top is where she belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost flawless from start to finish","review":"Kelly's debut CD left me unmoved. The song's had (to steal S. Chan's phase) \\"monotonous melodies.\\" But not this time around. Kelly Price has not only sung, but also co-written and served as executive producer on the best contemporary R&B disc I've heard in a long time. No, it doesn't set any new trends. But the hooks are in the pocket! The vocal arrangements are beautiful. The lyrics are mature and thoughtful. Ballads and up-tempo numbers are sequenced to flow seamlessly. Does one really need to say anything about Kelly's voice? The ad-lib the she delivers just before \\"As We Lay\\" ends will stop you cold. I find the K-Ci/Gerald Levert number to be overwrought (thanks to the men) and the Teddy Riley cut a bit noisy, but still this is a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless","review":"Kelly Price's \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" CD left me completely breathless. With her combination of honesty and soul, you know that she wrote most of these songs and this woman has experienced some things in her life. She is the TRUTH. I am buying her cd now from amazon because I borrowed my buddy's and over the weekend andnI just have to have it.....yall need to check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I took a listen to this CD a few days ago and I was blown away by Kelly Price's talent! She really can sing quite beutifully. Although the material on the album really isn't all that original, Price pulls it off with style and soul and proves that she will be going great places with her amazing talents. Look for 'As We Lay' on the album, the best track on the whole thing, that showcases Price at her absolute best."},{"rating":"2","title":"one eye opening cd","review":"this is one cd you can listen to everyday and not get tired of it.after a long day's work pop in the cd to do some serious unwinding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Voice","review":"Kelly Price has a very powerful voice.

I liked the later chapters on fruit beers and the herb & spice beers, the idea of using hot peppers (they advise caution) as a flavoring has appeal to me, might help with the flavor some. Chapter 15, the last one, has mead recipes again, I appreciate that one, it'd be the one I'd most want to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst acting ever-dumped it","review":"The acting was so bad I could hardly continue watching and when it came to the second movie, I dreaded it just as much.

I think that have a charm that goes along with low budget fare. Seeing that these were produced in 1979, you can't blame the producers from shying away from super villians. This was a set of pilots set to introduce Captain America into a TV series. While it's no Incredible Hulk or Spider-Man, it's a good show. If you consider all the bad movies and TV shows out there, it's ok for an afternoon. I only wish it were written better and the lead actor, Reb Brown, had an acting coach on the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"The first captain America wasn't bad, the second one he has a CLEAR and CLEARLY PLASTIC shield and wears a seemingly over sized motorcycle helmet the WHOLE MOVIE.So yea typical marvel SURE YOU CAN MAKE THE MOVIE AND NO WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT!just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America/Captain America 2: Death Too Soon..","review":"These are pretty good movies. captain america is one of my favorite superheros. i do belive that these movies are just episodes from a tv show. i'm not sure thought if they are it is still awesome. these movies are great. if you have not seen these movies then i recommend you do"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain America Lives!","review":"For all of you being so overcritical of this 70's version of Captain America, just get over it. Watch it for what it is. It is easy enough to look back 35 years at a show through the eyes of someone in 2011. I enjoyed it back then as a kid and it is enjoyable now. Just like with the 70's Spider-Man, Incredible Hulk and Wonder Woman, they are all dated but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy them thoroughly. I won't disagree that Reb is not a great actor but you know that is the same criticism many have leveled at Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher for the original Star Wars trilogy for years. So either you just sit back and enjoy it, flaws and all or just be miserable. I for one am happy that it is coming out on DVD, now if we can just get the Nicholas Hammond Spider-Man series out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mt. Whitney: The Peak and Surrounding Highlands","review":"While this book's contents and descriptions are adequate for the trails covered it is incomplete in it's scope of the Mt. Whitney region. I returned it as it did not include a reasonable selection of available trails or even primary ones such as the High Sierra Trail or Whitney Portal. Odd, considering that it's title states it's The Hiker's Guide to the High Sierra. I have to travel significant distances to experience the premier hikes in North America and prefer my hiking guides to be more detailed to enable me to make a more informed trail selection decision in an area I've never been to before. This book might serve someone adequately that is already familiar to the region. The backpacking tips and outdoor advice seemed dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, I Can't Believe It!!!!!","review":"March, 14, 2007I bought Gypsy's first album in 1971 after I heard it at a friend's house.

A friend's sister went to college and claimed she didn't know it was in her car. I lost it for a couple of semesters. Then another friend borrowed it and tried to tell me he lost it, only to find it a year later in his car. On CD for >[a certain price] is a bargain.

This isn't Wolf Urine Lure for the faint of heart. Mixed into a Gimlet or a Martini, this can be an experience that only a hardened drinker will really enjoy. For the novice, you'd best be served by mixing this with a good, high end tonic water (never diet tonic water! Yuck! It taste terrible!) or perhaps a fortified wine along the lines of Dubonet to create a flavorful and enchanting cocktail.So, on a warm summer evening, enjoy a Wolf Urine Lure and OJ or perhaps Grapefruit Juice, a truly refresing experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solves one problem, starts another","review":"Don't get me wrong, it is a fantastic product for keeping deer away from my garden of aconitum plants. One major problem, however, is that is seems to have the opposite effect for werewolves and wolf-man hybrids, which are now a constant plague every month for the neighborhood. I suggest buying some squeaky toys to distract them until morning.

I told her since she was officially an old Cougar, she needed wolf urine to attract a date. Well, the packaging wasn't clear enough on how to apply the urine to get the desired response. Apparently boiling it down to a thick sticky paste and coating her body concentrated the effect to the point that the wolves in the neighborhood want let her leave the den. I'm going to need a couple more bottles to get through the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the cellar","review":"One is immediately drawn to this vintage by the colour, which is an elegant, pale straw hue with an appealing peachy fruit on the nose. It has an incredibly effervescent bead -- the whole glass teams with bubbles -- culminating in a frothy layer at the head.The palate has panache, with a firm, mineral acidity that cuts through a rather elegantly styled, poised meaty presence. As with most Chateau Deerbuster products, this has the signature leafy-fresh character, which softens into a slight rancid feel towards the end.Even though it has a rather short and crisply defined finish, I still believe this has the composition and acidity to age well in the cellar of any self-respecting urine connoisseur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important detail missing...","review":"What they don't tell you is whether the urine was culled from submissive wolves reacting badly to being scolded, or whether it is from manly alpha males, virilely marking their territory.

So have to use one clip of nails at a time, what a pain when you are installing plywood or OSB (still does not adavance every time). Just the other day I had a nail jam in my gun, took over 30 minutes to fix. Long story short switched brand of nails to BC & Eagle. What a difference, no jams and can use multiple clips!!! Do not buy these, you would think Bostitch nails would work with their framing nailer??? Plus come on amazon, you shipped these without an extra box, half the clips are falling apart due to shipment. Noticed someone else complain about this????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our needs are the same!","review":"This man writes from the heart, a very dark heart soaked in dark love!

It was an enjoyable read, and quickly got me up to speed on Albert Einstein and his extraordinary life's work. At $13, it is priced right, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is curious about Einstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"OPENS YOUR EYES TO THE COMPLEX","review":"This book is everything it claims to be. It attempts to break down the very complicated world of physics that Einstein was so involved in. It gives a great history of his life and those who influenced him. It was an easy read in terms of the organization and language used, but make no mistake about it, the topics, theories and concepts are not easy to understand at all. I found myself reading certain concepts over and over again but still not able to follow - but I do not blame the author - I simply am not equipped with the mental capacity to follow Einstein's logic. And that is OK - this book served its purpose in that it opened my eyes to how much there is to know and understand about how our world works. Even if I learned only how much I have yet to learn, I am sure I am smarter for reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"Not a bad book for collector guns, but it is very outdated and contains nothing on newer weapons and technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"oldie but oldie","review":"the book is very detailed and complete for a time long gone by. It was excellent for the time it was written in but those times are no more. I would recommend something more up to date that emphacizes modern materials, modern technologies, current trends and needs and uses. It is sad but the era of elegant custom made hunting rifles and shotguns has been pretty much replaced with durable, low maintanence, mass produced military style weapons that this book doesn't say much about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Mankell creates the usual tangled web of mystery, but this time without providing a portrait of the murderer until the end. More murders were committed in this novel than are committed on average in Sweden in a year, expressing Mankell's negative outlook for the future of that society. And for those who think that the ending flops, I recommend reading Hannah Arendt's conclusions about her interviews in 'Eichmann in Jerusalem', about the banality of some psychopathic criminals."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not as great as his others","review":"This book, along with Chris's other books, really make the Book of Mormon come alive.

All his other books are so great.If you are looking for the best book ever read tennis shoes and the seven churches.It is very good because it has some action in it unlike the feathered surpent. seven churches is cool because it talks about scrolls and there is this one guy and his name is simon and he wants the scroll of power but the kids dont have it.And as simon is talking to the kids his flesh is rotting off. it is a very scary book in some parts and good in all parts.If you want one book to read read TENNIS SHOES AND THE SEVEN CHURCHES!

This year, I ordered several used copies from Amazon partners. If you're also buying used copies, be aware that the song list has undergone continuous minor revisions over the years. About a half dozen songs come and go between editions but the vast majority have remained intact. Also, there are several formats: piano/vocal, organ with pedalboard, button organ, etc. Although I haven't done a thorough cross-check, it appears that songs remain in the same keys between formats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old","review":"I was very disspointed with this music. Most of the songs sounded the same...musically and lyrically banal. I can't BELIEVE other reviewers rated it so highly. I'd like to return it. Yes, influenced by Hootie et al, Edwin McCain, but a poor rendering...kind of like the kitsch version of really good, interesting music. A thin veneer of interesting music, quickly seen through at about the 3rd song. Uck."},{"rating":"1","title":"...filler for adult contemporary stations","review":"This is the sort of music you hear in airports and waiting rooms, driving you crazy but nonetheless getting stuck in your head. Like Hootie and Edwin McCain, this is tailored for adult contemporary listeners and leaves one annoyed at unimaginative lyrics, vanilla hooks, and what must be the whiniest-voiced lead singer in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your sick of teenie boppers this is your CD","review":"In an age where it seems that those with little to no talent are dominating pop culture, it's very refreshing to stumble upon someting like this. A truw diamond in the ruff, sister hazel's new CD Fortress goes above and beyond their previous. It contains many songs that will just etch themselves into your head. And on the CD they come one after the other. Its one of those CDs that you can put on and leave on, not having to skip throught the bad tracks that seem to be the filler betwen good songs. not on this CD every one ha a unique style, and an enchanting character to it. Its a must have for anyone whos enjoyed sister hazel in the past, or any one looking for some good, REAL music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth It","review":"I would like to start of saying that this is one of the best CD's out there right now. All the songs on here are great, and you will just want to keep hitting play on your Cd player. This is a great CD to sing along to. There isnt one song on this Cd that i skip. There lyrics are down to earth, and it is just a great harmony mix. They do a fantastic job!! This is well worth your money, and you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sister Hazel's best release yet!","review":"Sister Hazel's new release, Fortress, is the band's best release to date. It is evident that the band has matured musically and lyrically. The album begins with the innocent and upbeat \\"Change Your Mind\\". Ken Block's optimistic lyrics, combined with its catchy tune kicks off the album nicely. The album's shining star is \\"Champagne High\\". Blocks heartfelt lyrics about attending the wedding of an ex-girlfriend should be the band's biggest single to date. If you like a good solid rock album with poetic heartfelt lyrics, then you will love \\"Fortress\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic pop-rock-folk stuff","review":"Although this CD doesn't beat the quality their aucustic first one (which is still my favorite), it is better and more varied than their Somewhere More Familar CD. Any fan of the \\"working bands\\" like Hootie, Matchbox Twenty, and Edwin McCain should get this, but I would also recommend it to people who listen to modern country radio, since quite a few of these tracks could be played there just as easily as on a rock or mix station. Tracks to listen to: Change Your Mind, Champagne High, Your Winter (a really powerful song), and Fortress. The second song, an instrumental, is also pretty cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"Sister Hazel has done it again. Fortress is a soulful journey for the heart and mind. Songs like Change Your Mind Champagne High and Your Winter have chart toppers written all over them. This is one CD that I can play from beginning to end and never tire of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"WOW - I'm late to the Sister Hazel party - I just bought 'Fortress.' I've never written a review before, but after listening to this CD for two weeks straight I had to comment. THERE IS NOT A BAD SONG ON THIS CD! Unbelievable. Great lyrics, great music, great harmonies. I can't get past \\"Beautiful Thing\\" and \\"Shame On Me\\". I hope this band gets everything it wants in life - they deserve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fortress is the next best thing to live Sister Hazel","review":"This band is full of talent. All five guys bring something special to the stage and it is very evident in this album. They tried to capture the essence of their live show and came close. But, nothing can beat Sister Hazel up close and personal. If you ever just wanted to be someone else, the song \\"Change Your Mind\\" will be very encouraging. If you are trying to get motivated or feel like being spontaneous \\"Beautiful Thing\\" will become your anthem. When you feel like crying your heart out \\"Out There\\" will move you deep in your soul. Every track will fit into your life in some way. This album is truly inspirational and will suit almost every person in almost every mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD for a long drive!","review":"For the first time in a long time, I have found a CD that I can listen to more than once! Every song on the CD is great, and are all so different so you won't get bored listening. The vocals and guitar are amazing, they switch things up from poppy sounds, mellow and beautiful songs, and classical guitar. This is one CD that I will be listening to for a long long time! I would recommend taking this CD along on vacation or a long ride because it will keep you entertained for hours, and will never fail to put you in a good mood! I am so happy with my purchase, and you will be with yours!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic group with plenty of good songs","review":"Several months ago I knew absoloutly nothing about Sister Hazel, and my mother had several tickets to go see them at a small club, I said no. Well, after getting familar with this group I am ticked of I said no because this band knows how to rock. Change Your Mind is my favorite track, and the most played on the radio, but there are so many other good tunes on the disc as well.This is one of the few CD's these days you can let your kids listen to, it's very clean and A LOT of fun to listen to. I rank this group up there with Creed and Barenaked Ladies for the fun factor, you will love the songs they sing off of this disc. Worth every single penny. A pop group that does a great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET HOOKED ON HAZEL!!!!!!!!","review":"Everything about this band just clicks and \\"it's a beautiful thing\\". The lyrics are meaningful, thought provoking, insightful, uplifting, fun, and simply brilliant. The powerful vocals and instrumentals blend together flawlessly so that the end result is music that will get inside your head and not let go...you will want to dance, you will want to sing along, and you will be a \\"hazelnut\\" for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE......More sweet music","review":"Sister Hazel has done it again, only this time they show how much they have grown as artists. If you liked \\"...somewhere more familiar\\" you will fall in love with \\"Fortress\\". The music still has the Sister Hazel feel to it but it will move you more than \\"...somewhere more familiar\\". Of the hundreds of cd's I own this cd from beginning to end is by far one of the best. You will not be dissapointed, if anything this cd will turn you into a BIGGER fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best band for your money","review":"This is by far the best band around right now. Their songs take you through every emotion you can think of. There are up beat, fun songs like Beautiful Thing and Elvis, Deep, spirtual songs like Strange Cup of Tea, and heartfelt songs like, Shame on me, Champagne High, and Your Winter. This CD will stay in your collections for a LONG time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cd","review":"Sister Hazel is sticking with what they do best in this cd- catchy hooks and awesome vocals. Ever since I was sent a free promo cd from the band back a few months ago, featuring Thank You and Beautiful Thing, i knew that this cd would be awesome. Change Your Mind is just as catchy as past hits, Happy and All For You, and is sure to be in your head for days. My only complaint is that they left \\"Sometimes\\" off the cd. This is one of those cds that you can listen to straight through without having to skip every other song. Congrats to the band on a great effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome New Release from Sister Hazel","review":"The new release from Sister Hazel may well be the best one they have. It contains some wonderful talent with both the music and the vocals. You can really feel what the songs are conveying. Another added bonus is the bands' consistant tendancy to NOT add vulgar language into their music. They keep it talented and don't have to resort to bad langauge to sell CDs! \\"Fotress\\" is definitely worth getting. The only downside is that the fourteen tracks make a little bit longer CD than usual. But it's still a wonderful CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 guys from Florida.....","review":"This CD is worth every penny!!! SH rock's at the best of times, but this is Out of This World!!!

Change Your Mind and Chanpaign High (radio release late October 2000) MAKE this CD. A Must Have!! 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time fan's opinion","review":"Being a huge fan and having seen many shows I highly recommend this CD. I feel it has better tunes and a lot more cohesion compared to the earlier CD's. Yes... they have more than this one. Many people say they are just another \\"Hootie\\" but their music and lyrics all have feeling and meaning. If you ever get a chance, check them out live.... I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE for the entrepreneur!!","review":"This book is very comprehensive and touches on points of business that the creative artist ignores.....The tips on marketing/advertising are invaluable!! The 'cold-call' concept is elevated to reality in this book. Many designers/web developers do not have a clue to expand business beyond the ol' word-of mouth....This book makes networking an attainable goal! Another asset is the readability of this book. I read it cover-to-cover in about 2 days. You do not have to have a degree in marketing or accounting to grasp the concepts. It is about time that someone came up with a 'Business' book from a marketing perspective! I am so glad that I found this book.....before it was too late!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder in E Minor","review":"Robert Goldsborough has captured most of the elements necessary to write a good Nero Wolfe book. The dialog between Archie and Nero is not up to Rex Stout's standards, but it's not bad. All the regular characters show up as scheduled, and the plot is pretty good, though a bit contrived in its motive for murder. Certainly a good read for any Wolfe fan who is missing their \\"favorite fatty.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Hard Following a Legend..","review":"Rex Stout was a legend. His Nero Wolfe books are among the best in Detective Fiction. Robert Goldsborough did an admirable job in trying to live up to Stout's traditions. The first of these, Murder in E flat, with minor exceptions would have fit in rather well with the middle of the road caliber Rex Stout novels.. and that is high praise indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first novel as the new reporter of Nero Wolfe's cases","review":"I enjoyed this novel as the first by a new writer. I think Archie develops as a character in his own right and liked the way Nero Wolfe's past was in bought in to enrich the story.I would recommend this to readers who enjoy plots dealing with crime and intrigue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Moisturizer!","review":"I purchased this body butter in the Guava. It is very rich so you won't need to slather a lot on like drugstore brands. This leaves your skin feeling velvety soft without a greasy residue like you might expect from a body butter. It is especially hydrating for dry areas like your elbows and knees. The Guava body butter has a pleasant, light scent which reminds me of Hawaiian Tropic suntan lotion. Bonus: my BF commented on how good I smelled after I put it on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excitement at it's very best !!!!!!","review":"Let me start by saying that my family is happy that I'm a fast reader, because with this book being so intense I could not put it down. Which means PB& J for dinner until I'm done reading. There are characters that you will cry with, laugh with , relate to, love, hate and sympathize with. This book has it all. There were so many twist and turns just when you think you have something figured out, it's much deepier than you imagined. My emotions were all over the place. You will be on the edge of your seat from start to finish ! I loved the excitement and the ever so clever way this book was written !*** Very well done***Keep them coming E.D Johnson!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good book by Twain","review":"The main story line is OK, but Twain spends way too much time on the meanderings of the American claimant character. It seriously detracted from the main story. The ending was kind of left open as well, leaving off on another of the American claimant's unintelligent musings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This is a fascinating collection of menus from a diverse range of celebrities, athletes and politicians. If you're looking for the Britney Spears and Paris Hiltons of our day, this book series (this is the second of two) probably isn't for you. However if you want to know what Marilyn Monroe ate at her first playboy spread, etc. then this is a fascinating read. Each of the menus are preceded by a short history lesson about the celebrity and menu itself. It would be really fun to host dinner parties using these menus. Definitely recommend, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children under 5","review":"It takes a building engineer to put this together so it is not for the age it states on the product, would be fine for ages 6 up maybe.

She is 5, but our baby, who is 20 months, also plays with it. I had such a hard time finding this set in stock, and was so glad when I was able to get it before Christmas. It can be built in many different ways, so it is a great toy for helping to develop kids' imaginations. I enjoyed building it too. The only drawback is that there is no storage box/bag included, and there are lots of little pieces. I solved the problem by using an old toddler-sized comforter bag and putting all the pieces in that. I am sure my kids will both be playing with this toy for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a Disappointment","review":"Based on what I had read about it, I had high expectations for this book, but I struggled to finish this book and only did so because I was so far into it. I was disappointed with the character development and thought the writing style left a little to be desired. The stream of consciousness sentences which changed topic mid-stream were distracting to me, and I often had to read parts over and over again to get an understanding of what was being said. I found the characters to have great potential but overall to be underdeveloped. I especially thought that she could have done more with the relationships of both children with the mother. I didn't mind knowing the ending from the first page, but when I got to the ending, I felt that I didn't know much more than when I started. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great operettas","review":"This is one of the great operettas of musical theater.

A magical wondrous experience. Beautifully produced in the traditional lush M-G-M style of old. Very old fashioned and sentimental, tear jerking and pretty - this film represents Hollywood's best from an era long since gone. Recent reviews claim in revival screenings the film still weaves its magic. Never previously released on dvd so this is your only opportunity to see what old school magical film making was all about. Buy these other MGM classics (Great Waltz, San Francisco, Great Ziegfeld, Blossoms in the Dust, Waterloo Bridge, Camille) . . . . and enjoy Hollywood of old. Avoid the unlicensed cheaper Chinese versions - stay with authorised Warner Archive prints only of the MGM classics. The quality is terrific for a film of this age."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"For many years, I would watch this movie on TV every May 1st.I would wake up in the middle of the night to feel the emotion and joy of Marcia and Paul in love. Now that I have it on VHS, I can watch it as often as I wish.They do not make love stories, nor musicals like this any more.It is a classic. It moves me every time I watch it.

Not only is the Page's scene from \\"les Huguenots\\" incorporated, but also a long opera scene from \\"Czaritsa\\" [composed specifically for this film] is included. This is pretty high-brow stuff, especially for its day! Jeanette MacDonald looks gorgeous as ever & sings magnificiently. Nelson Eddy wears too much makeup as usual but..what a voice! For a film historian this movie is indispensible. Otherwise, , these movies aren't for everyone's tastes but if you have a sweet tooth like me, then indulge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than happy","review":"When I bought this vhs, I was not expecting such a quality in sounds and clearness. This film was made in the 30 after all. And what made me happier is that the story keep us awakened from the beginnig till the end. The lovely voice of Jeanette MacDonald is an enchantment in all the opera'a arias she sings. Nelson Eddy is also good, but not enough to be the opera singer they expected from him. But what a story! And, woudl it be only for Jeanette lyrics and her fascinating eyes, it is worted more than the price I paid for it.

The glass shelves are 12 inches wide. Not all that space is usable either, as cables from the back of your components push the devices out from the back wall. A cable TV box ends up sticking out 3 inches over the edge and a surround sound system, two inches. I had to buy another couple of pieces of wider glass to put under them for support. I also have issues with putting the unit together, if you follow the directions you are likely going to end up redoing it all over again. Just study the pictures and figure out the best way to go about it yourself and trash the directions. For the money, I think you can do better with another TV stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good TV stand","review":"Fits perfectly for my Samsung DLP tv.

The author did a very good job of crafting a series of individual stories together into a mosaic. The stories collectively provide insight into the feelings of our brave ancestors, who set out on such a dangerous voyage, all to create a better life for their family. I would highly recommend it, especially so for the school kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Security issues, data binding, Schema languages, & much more","review":"Now in its revised and expanded second edition, XML and Java: Developing Web Applications is a solid reference and superbly organized guidebook written specifically for computer and website programmers. Individual chapters cogently address the basics of XML, parsing and serializing XML documents, using SAX, security issues, data binding, Schema languages, and much more. Instances of sample code help flesh out the principles taught step-by-step in this most instructive text. An accompanying CD-ROM contains sample programs ready to run, along with trial versions of WebSphere and DB2. XML and Java: Developing Web Applications is a very highly recommended resource and reference for web programmers at all skill and experience levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Java/XML books on the market","review":"Even if 9 different authors wrote this book, the logical flow remains intact and the writing style is consistent, clear and concise, without any redundancy. The authors provide plenty of well written, relevant code examples, almost to a level of a cookbook. I was very pleased to see some pretty advanced topics covered in details and, while the focus is on Xerces, JAXP get a good coverage too. In my opinion one of the best Java/XML books on the market"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of advanced XML for Java developer","review":"I found this book very useful, covers a lot of unique topicsin advanced XML processing, practical and to the point.Especially enjoyed coverage of advantages and disadvantagesof different techniques.Would be nice to cover these topics a bit deeper,little more on architecture.How about making 3rd edition 1000 pages,maybe without CD-ROM, put code online(any XML/Java developer has Internet access now).And Websphere and DB2 getting outdated very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Few moral judgements","review":"It was helpful to read a non-Christian study on street children.

It offers poignant reflections on the African-American's place in today's society. The poems are intense and absorbing.

What a dissappontment it turned out to be. I'm not going to review how bad the characters where compared to the other books or how the ending was a let down. Other reviews have stated that.What gives it two stars is how the author just seemed to throw away the rules and maked it up as he went along. It's like he never even read the Spelljammers boxed set rules or the AD&D; rules. For several things, glabrezu are not that powerful, nor can they grant the powers that it did, gateways to the abyss cannot be opened in to the phlogiston. A dimension door cannot be open in the phlogiston, nor do they work that way. Astal projection to the phlogiston is also imposible.It's one thing for author's to bend the rules like they do in so many D&D; books but Russ Howards just threw them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insider academic","review":"My landlady in Oxford was Mavis.

It cleans teeth by both pulsation (in-and-out movement) and oscillation (side-to-side movement). Reviews say the Oral-B toothbrush is comfortable and easy to use, although some testers complain that it's a bit noisy. The built-in power sensor is a helpful feature that stops bristle movement if you're brushing too hard. There's a two-minute timer (but no auto-shut-off) with 30-second beep to signal you to clean another area. The Sonicare toothbrush above gets slightly better ease-of-use scores, but the 7000 series is less expensive for essentially the same features.For value for money toothbrush, look no further than Oral B - However I would recommend if you had a little more money to look for Sonicare products - it's just that little bit better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Investment","review":"I've had my 7850DLX toothbrush for about a month and I'm very happy with it. It cleans very well and is comfortable to use. When I used my manual brush I didn't spend the recommended time brushing. With this brush I know I'm doing it two minutes every time.

With the price of dental care, this brush is a very good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaning machine!!","review":"At first use the large brush was too big, however after swapping to the small brush this toothbrush is awesome!!

What we have is a description of animals and people as the safari progresses, interspersed with impressions of the porters and others on the trip. And some historical background, often relating to dangerous animals in Africa, and the depredations of poachers. Occasional tidbits of biology are thrown in, but this is not like a John McPhee book on the area at all. I found it only mildly interesting. The photographs are by a famous and experienced photographer, and I suppose in their day they were excellent, and probably much better if we could see them as proper scans at high definition. But as prints they leave a lot to be desired. The resolution is not good, nor are the colors for the most part. They seem grainy and insufficiently saturated.

It is sad to see that he had to back himself up with a \\"big band.\\" Orchestra, strings and all...it would have been nice to hear him do it solo, or would that not cover up the error of his ways well enough? Trust me, your local Marriot hotel will be featuring these great interpretations of Jazz standards in their hotel elevators. Pure cheese baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Kenny G is trying to get back to his roots. . .","review":"Kenny G started off as a darn good jazz saxophonist, but then went commercial. Though he's at least doing some more traditional jazz stuff, some of the classics just shouldn't be messed with, especially in the syrupy, dry commercial way he does them.

I always like to have a CD start with a strong piece - this one does. Summertime is moody and wonderful. You want to sit down and just listen to it, allowing no distractions. The fact that the songs he chose for this CD are all old standards, well-known by this listener, is one reason it appeals to me. I don't have to learn to appreciate it, each track is immediately enjoyable as I hear Kenny G's rendition of tunes with which I am already familiar. The Girl From Ipanema, and Stranger on The Shore are so well done and beautiful you'll want to replay them over and over again. This CD is NOT simply good background music for a party - it stands on its own to be played anytime.I can only hope Kenny G's next CD will also be familiar tunes - how about a Kenny G CD of Show Tunes - I'd love to hear him do Camelot, Oklahoma, or West Side Story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Marsalis, here comes G!","review":"G overwhelmed me with his smooth jazz!

An earlier reviewer had the gall to argue that Kenny G is talented because he \\"mastered the suspended tone\\" technique. To clarify what this means, Kenny G bastardized circular breathing in order to hold a note for a long time. If this constitutes talent, then the musical world is in severe, severe trouble.In the words of Brian Bromberg, \\"What about vibe? What about soul?\\" Kenny G is lacking...incidentally, the TRUE Kenny G is Kenny Garrett, the master of the alto sax and forefront in REAL jazz.

The Louis Armstrong classic \\"What a Wonderful World\\" was horrendously mutilated by splicing in Mr. G's weak, obnoxious, nasal sax lines. It is my honest opinion that the sound of nails scratching across a blackboard is more appealing than listening to this obvious and feeble attempt to be taken or mistaken as a serious jazz musician.

Also, for those people who say \\"but these are nice old songs and he plays them so well\\" I say you probably haven't ever heard the originals as played by the great jazz artists of this century (and they are ALL available on CD).

I go to the store every once in awhile to look at jazz albums, and I remove his stuff to the easy listening section.

I also don't like this album because he tried to play standards such as Round Midnight, Body and Soul, The Girl from Ipamena etc. Kenny G is not a jazz musician, and I CAN'T believe how he has most of the United States fooled into what he thinks jazz should really sound like, and what he thinks a saxophone player should really sound like. It was like he gave the jazz musicians of today the finger. Kenny G is a disgrace to all saxophone players of past and present.

It's time to put your tone controls or graphic equalizer to work and experiment to find the best settings to make the music more presentable. Put a note listing the best settings inside the CD case for future reference. These recordings are so old and out of print that you won't find them anywhere else, but they show the feelings and intensity of the oldtime performers trying to scratch out a living doing what they do best.

Simple concepts that could be explained in one sentence drag on for pages. As a reference book, it is completely useless, because you will just not be able to find a simple succinct example.So, if you were looking for a book to teach yourself C++ pass this one by, but if you are unfortunate enough to have this as the required text for a class be ready to read and re-read the same chapter again and again and again before you can figure out what the authors are doing their best to obscure from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of words but very little information","review":"I wish I had been able to browse this book at a store before buying it.

Programming is not hard, I can imagine a relative smart kid can learn C++ or even assembly in 10 yo. There is no need to spend many pages to explain a simple idea again and again. The sample examples are very long and have no insight at all. The author may be a beginner of C++ himself. If you have absolutely no programming experience in your life, this book may be fine.

There are many good, important points made in the book, unfortunately they are all lifted from other books.

That's because it loses video sync on extremely bright signals, like the Wii's pure-white menu.It also appears to blow-out the highlights of DVD video sources, and loses sync on over-bright video signals from DVD as well.So basically, I am returning this unit and trying to find something that does not interfere with my component imagery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well enough for me","review":"I'm running a Wii, XBox 360, PS2, Dreamcast, and Mac Mini through it and all work fine. I've never seen the problems some other reviewers mention with bright screens and losing sync, so perhaps there are several hardware revisions in the market. There are a few bells and whistles that could have been done better: you can assign any of a long list of source names to each input, but you can't add user-entered names, so the Wii will always show up as 'Gamecube,' and the Ethernet switching is essentially useless--- it's a 2-to-1 multiplexer, not a hub, so only one port will be active at a time; a five-port hub would have been tremendously more useful with modern consoles and other devices. Overall, though, it works just fine as an input selector. There's a barely perceptible loss of sharpness compared to going directly into the receiver; I only notice it with things like text windows on the Mini, and never when playing a game or watching a video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money.","review":"This is much cheaper and much more versatile then the other products I have found for video/audio switching. The fact that the fiber ports are also switched is a huge bonus!. I think there is a possibility that the quality of the video is however slightly degraded. I did swap out to some really nice monster cables and I did still notice just a slight drop in video performance. However I am willing to swap that for the very nice convince of switching between devices with out having to unplug cables or switching things around.BTW this is not a game Amazon why did you ask me to rate this game?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"For the most part, this product does what it says, however, during certain parts of movies the screen get this weird effect where a large black rectangle moves from the bottom to the top of the screen. It seems to happen where the screen changes drastically from dark to bright lighting, but I haven't nailed it down. It REALLY ruined the experience of the movies we were watching. However, it's the only product out there that does this at this price point. It was unacceptable to us though, and it is now sitting in storage.

I was expecting drama and personal conflict, not a recounting of facts. Blame me for being too shallow and vapid for a scholarly discussion, when I was looking for drama.

I could not get through it from beginning to end, but was forced to search and read ahead to find material that I could better understand and that was more interesting to me.

The discourse is limited to a one-dimensional view of architectural theory that seems to dismiss the most potent ideas of critical theory and radical critique. The book is structured around themed chapters containing several extracts with a logic of \\"this is a critique of this\\" in a rather naive way. The author's ommission of Heidegger's thinking is bizarre and his critique of Loos misses out the crucial influence of the intellectual milieu of early 20th century Vienna (Kraus, Wittgenstein etc.). Some interesting lesser known figures are brought to light (Kracauer for example)and there is some fantastic material here extracted from larger works, but be warned! this is a book with its own agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageously bad.","review":"There's no suspenseful or horrifying moment in this film.

Better!!","review":"OUTPOST is an extremely interesting little Scottish film. The story is a simple one, a group of mercenaries are hired to escort a client into a war-zone in Eastern Europe. Easy in, easy out. But nothing is ever as easy as it sounds, is it? Soon, the mercenaries are being picked off, one by one. How can you fight something that isn't there?Some of the previous reviewers have termed this a \\"zombie\\" movie, but it isn't. A zombie is killed by a head shot. These creatures aren't. It's a bit more complex than that. And there lies the fun. OUTPOST is a gory blast of a good time and has one of the more unique plots than one would find in a horror film. Yes, it's all been done before, but OUTPOST makes it seem fresh. It also boasts some of the most disturbing images that call back to a all too real past.Your mission--see OUTPOST. It's a quirky, delicious horror treat. With a SS officer or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low budget with a high gloss finish","review":"Surprisingly good, is how I would describe this Nazi zombie film. It is impressive for several reasons.* Original screenplay.* Well done cinematography* Better than average acting* Decent musical scoreThis film is very memorable and fun to watch. The gore is not over the top. For a low budget work, it comes off as costing far more. The Nazi zombies have a measurable cruel streak. It makes them very interesting. The characters are not very likable, but this seems to have been done on purpose. The film builds slowly and it is a very long time before we see any zombies. They are introduced in a very creepy fashion, and the originality of the film takes off from this point. All in all, OUTPOST is a very good addition to the Nazi zombie genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low budget, but creepy as heck","review":"I liked Ray Stevenson's character, his partner and the scientist they brought along. The rest of the mercenaries I could probably outclass with random people taken off the street. Somewhat unbelievable that they were battle-hardened mercs. That aside... even with the low budget of the movie, the horror factor was fairly impressive. The story line held together, the \\"opposition\\" is frightening as heck, and the inability to ever really see them clearly is that much more creepy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outpost: A slow, tedious place to visit","review":"I'm a fan of Romero, the various homages and spoofs--Sean of the Dead, Fido, et. al.--but found this film slow and tedious. By the time the gore came, I found little to care about or react to. The idea of a Nazi experiment to create an invisible, perhaps indestructible army seems somewhat threadbare by now. It was creepy thirty, twenty or even ten years ago. This isn't the worst movie ever made, just a disappointing one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not scary. Ray Stevenson was good","review":"The film was shot well and well played out. But I never thought Nazi Zombies could be kind of boring. How many times can they read \\"Mien Kaumf\\", it must be tough.It is very well acted, but there is very little story for the actors cling too. I am really mad because someone on the board compared \\"Outpost\\" to \\"Dog Soldiers\\" which it sure as heck is not. The direction and action scenes are not even close. This was a film someone looked at the script and said for half a million we can make a horror film and become rich!You really just sit through the film waiting for something to happen. Which is painful. Go see Dog Soldiers and \\"Pontypool\\" is you want to enjoy a couple of real horror action films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't Waste your money on this movie.

They discover that the guy who hired them are looking for more than some gold. There dealing with the supernatural and physics to create some super soldier. Well of course they awaken the soldiers that protect this place and are taken out one by one. The story had real potential of being so much more but it did'nt. The acting was good and the effects where not bad either. The story just was kind of boring and the pay off was no that great. You just kept waiting for something more. I will say this you might want to rent it but not much more if even that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfull","review":"I will admit, the acting was good but the story was weak.

Upon securing said bunker, strange things begin happening, growing increasingly bizarre as well as lethal. Everyone already knows that OUTPOST is a nazi-zombie movie. However, this one also has a nice little sci-fi angle, dealing w/ super-soldiers and the third reich's obsession w/ bending / controlling the laws of physics. In atmosphere, OUTPOST is along the lines of an excellent combination of SHOCK WAVES, THE BUNKER, DOG SOLDIERS, and SESSION 9, w/ a twist of DEAD BIRDS tossed in for flavor. Lots of horrific deaths ensue, and the undead nazis are genuinely scary. If you enjoy military horror, zombies, and action, then add this baby to your collection immediately..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A well spent 90 minutes\\"","review":"\\"I bought OUTPOST because I am a huge fan of Ray Stevenson and the story interested me. Stevenson is one of the most overlooked actor's today and he is \\"Top\\" as the leader of the 6 man fireteam. The location, uniforms and sets are beliveable. The firefights were intense for a small budget film. If your looking for another zombie slasher movie this is not one. However, it does have it's share of blood and guts. Again I give this 4 stars because it does exactly what a movie is supposed to do, it entertains.

The scientist hires a small group of thug, mercs to take him to the bunker, in some war torn part of Europe, suposedly to find gold. The \\"gold\\" ends up being a piece of scientific equipment that is supposed to be the result of continued work on Einstein's Unified Field Theory.There is a lot of British Military action, Nazi zombies, and an earie anamated propaganda film, circa 1940's.

The top was worse than the bottoms; the holes began appearing after the first wash & every time I wash them (hand wash) they have more holes.If they had been manufactured with better quality control & were thicker I would definitely be in love.

His metaphors are original, concise, and leave you thinking. At the same time, Amichai's poetry is not inaccesible. His writing is simple enough to grasp the first time through, but also complex enough for you to peel away the layers of meaning as you read again and again.While some of the poetry is political or cultural in nature (Amichai is an Israeli and Jew), don't let that discourage you from thinking it doesn't have any application to your life.

Rahab persuades her family to seek refuge in her house and they watch in amazement as the Jordan River parts and the Israelites return to the land of their fathers. Even more amazing is the 7-day march around Jericho and the eventual fall of the walls.

But Rahab plans her escape, and finally, she offers the king something he can't resist.The Israelites are marching onward, their sights on Jericho. Many have heard of their God's power and quake in fear of what the Israelites will do when they reach their city. Even with their tall walls, trained army, and military strategy, Jericho is no different.Rahab is curious when she hears of Israel's God, and even more so when something mystifying enters the gates of Jericho. She begins to wonder if a God, who held so much power, could accept a person with scarlet staining her past.

If you truly dissect the book, there are interesting sides of it, but just as a plain reading, I found it simply boring. It is short and doesn't go into any detailed description of the many events that are told to the reader/listener, it's value were supposedly the mocking of the protestant ruling class of Ireland.

ANY cable that allows the signal to be turned on and off (think light switch or telegraph) will work. You don't need special gold conductors etc. anymore than the telegraph operators of 1880 did!!Monster made its name decades ago selling better speaker cables to audiophiles willing to pony up big bucks. Even then, tests at very advanced labs showed that cheap lamp cord from the hardware store performed as well for 99.9% of listeners, but Monster prevailed. Good for them I guess as there's one born every minute you know.The bottom line is that a $2 HDMI cable will work just as well as this cable assuming no conductors are broken. Do a search on any AV forum for cheap cables and you will find a web site where you can buy 5-10 HDMI cables for this price and toss out any you feel aren't working for you.is binary.

Good use made with effects, some good scares and very tense scenes. And the caliber of the acting for a low-budget horror should give the cast and director something to be proud of (no Academy Awards, but you know...)The serious flaw that made it often unbearable is the plot. Take Nazis, occult, time travel, mind control... then put a plot twist in just about every scene in the film and place every single person under suspicion and you just get a tangled mess.

Why was I surprised? I'm not the biggest Williams fan. His old stuff was great, but lately he hasn't done too much to talk about. Schindlers List and Jurassic Park were great, but I find it hard to consistantly listen to them. Saving Private Ryan's score was boring overall (probably due to the nature of the film), and only the first two tracks were worthwhile. The Patriot, however, is constantly enjoyable. If you are a Williams fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. If you aren't, chances are you will enjoy it as well. It's very patriotic, with a solid main theme and several smaller ones surrounding it. Personal favorites are tracks 1)The Patriot and 7)Preparing for Battle. I have listened to it several times through already, and plan to listen to it even more in the future. Grab it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"An outstanding piece of art is exactly what John Williams has given us.

Overall this is Williams best work in years! You should pick it up ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe Inspiring!","review":"John Williams once again proves he is one of the most gifted composers of our times. Experiencing this latest masterpiece is an emotional rollercoaster. The music thrusts listeners into the elation of victoryon the battle field, swallows you with the fear of hiding from invading enemy soldiers, and pacifies your senses with the warm feelings of family, home, and love.The music is not predominately military in nature. I was very pleased to find a mixture of celtic influences throughout more of the artistic pieces. The violins in 'The Patriot' track are absolutely haunting. This CD will please you as both a patriotic work of art and as a beautiful collection of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Williams blows this one","review":"Well, I don't want to be a wetblanket and ruin all your fun, but seriously, if you actually saw the movie and listened to the music, you would hear how Williams blew this one. He did not write a dramatic score, he tried to put an action or military score into a dramatic movie. He should have taken notes from Horner's \\"Glory\\" or Hans Zimmer's \\"The Thin Red Line\\" first. I am not saying that John Williams is a bad composer, he is good for movies like \\"Star Wars\\", or for the Olympics where upbeat, exciting music is needed, but he can not write a decent dramatic score. Williams should stick to movies like \\"Home Alone\\" and leave the drama to James Horner. This is a decent soundtrack in itself, but it does not fit with the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back Off","review":"John Williams utilized brass instruments to a point where it actually hurt my ears in the theaters. There were also moments that were so overglorified by his music that it was funny. Someone tell this character about choirs, strings, and woodwinds. Those instruments can be quite powerfull."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"Strangely unoriginal for John Williams. It sounds as though another composer is doing their best to mimic him.

I am going insane here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So what happened to the T-Rex and Darth Maul?","review":"This score is terrible. As soon as the opening theme started I was almost convinced that the scenery of South Carolina was going to be taken over by pre-historic beasts. And later on the theme evokes that Darth Maul is the enemy to the American Colonist and well as to the British Crown.This is got to be some of the worst scoring for a new film. The only thing that is new is the attempt to score traditional 18th century music to fit some of the scenes... And that only required orchestration of known melodies of the time.I like the themes of John Williams. He does borrow a lot from the masters. Anyone who has taken at least one Music Appreciation or Music History course can hear that many of his themes come staight from the European and American Masters. But the score for the patriot is just re-vamped Williams from his many other film scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Track #4 is the only worthy bit of the whole CD.","review":"You may as well skip to track 4 for a rousing theme, which in the movie, was played over the final battle scene. Every other track is a waste, mostly repetitive and dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Williams is great as usual","review":"I'll probably buy any John Williams score, but that's because each time he outdoes himself. I think The Patriot is one of his best. He's careful so as not to fall into a trap of copying the music from that other war-time drama he scored, which is great. (By the way, I mean Saving Private Ryan). The music is stirring and soft and just wonderful. I highly recommend this CD to anyone that is a Williams fan, or anyone that is a fan of orchestral music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God....what a lost opportunity!","review":"This is the WORST soundtrack I have purchased in years. Not able to capitalize on period music as was done for the movie \\"Barry Lyndon\\", the producers of this film chose to 'recruit' a score that sounds like a combination of bombastic noise to shrieking atonal junk that sounds like a cruel mixture from Psycho, West Side Story, with a dreay amalgam of Brood Fest 2000 uninspired sonic goop. What a freakn' mess! Every cut sounds the same. Every cut is BAD. Buy the soundtrack to Barry Lyndon and leave this loser on the shelf. I feel so ripped off. This is not a soundtrack. It is background gunk that is so unoriginal and uninteresting you wonder why they bothered to even press CD's with this flotsam on it. The producers hit bottom on this soundtrack..then not satsified by that depth...they called for shovels and started digging deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Williams' worst.","review":"Man, this score really, really stinks!

Highly recommended listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Modern Classical Music With The Touch Of Patriotism","review":"I listened to almost all the scores on this Album and wow, they were just excellent. Each and every one flows exactly with the scenes they represent (but you'll only get that if ya seen the movie).

The storyline was interesting, if a bit unoriginal; the idea of saving multiple worlds is not new. It did have an interesting little tie-in with an investigator, but even that lacked flavor. I never felt very connected with the characters throughout the course of this book. I didn't particularly care what happened to them and I couldn't empathize with them. The only highlight of this book was the writing, which was on the better side. But all in all, this one's a book to miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAAAAT is the DEEEEEAL with this BOOOOOOK?

You could almost imagine a guy at the door saying, 'OK, one-liners over there, riddles, this way, shaggy-dog stories, yeah, come on in, you're good...vaguely humorous observations?

If he did, it would come across better."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth no more than a dollar","review":"come on jerry.. i am probably your biggest fan and even when i bitch about everything, i am not an iota bitter about your billion dollars but this book is just a print out from a few web pages pinned together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful.","review":"Anyone who had any doubts about the longevity of Seinfeld's initial schtick will be clearly vindicated by the contents of this book. This awful, awful book. This book is what happens when a limited, one-dimensional gimmick is singlehandedly responsible for the fame of a given celebrity. It is a case study in trendy humor. Barely above the level of \\"you ought to be a redneck if..\\", Jerry's observational \\"didja ever notice..\\" formula becomes scathingy obvious af ter the the first ten pages. Not only can you start predicting how every joke will end for the remaining 95% of the book, the experience is even more excruciating when you start hearing his whiny voice in your head. This book is clearly for pop culture historians or Seinfeld fanatics _only_. Just look at what readers who like the book recommend. I mean, in the words of its irritating author, \\"Who ARE these People?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"close to being a rip-off","review":"If you're enough a fan of Seinfeld to be looking at this, you're not gonna get something you haven't seen before.This book is nothing more than the transcripts of virtually all the stand-up segments from the Seinfeld show, so you've probably heard all the jokes. There's no new material. It seems like somebody just got some production assistant somewhere to transcribe all the stand-up stuff and then sent it off to the printers as a way of churning out even more money for Seinfeld & Co.If that isn't bad enough, Seinfeld seems a lot more witty and insightful in person than in print. When his jokes are written down, they seem crude and whiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this book for Die-hard Seinfeld fans?","review":"Jerry Seinfeld is a stand-up comedian.And his ever famous Sitcom-'Seinfeld' is worth a million laughs,with George Costanza,Elaine Marie Benes and Cosmo Kramer. But his shows are to be \\"watched\\" and not read.This book is a collation/collection of most of his classic one-liners - but all you're left with imagining the real episode on dvd,when you read though any of it from the book.I've even watched that DVD-Jerry seinfeld: Live on Broadway? Well,Jerry Seinfeld must be one of the masterminds of the show and the script, but he can't pull it off without the remaining 3some."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Loved the show. Hate the book. I bought this to read on the plane during a recent trip because it had short passages that could be read seperately and still be enjoyed.However, I didn't find most of them funny, even when I imagined him on stage telling them.

Your gonna love it. It's stuff you've thought about but didn't think that anyone else was thinking about.The book is those little monolouges you see at the beginning of all the oldish episodes. All the good ones at least. Anybody could read and everybody should!!Do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest man alive","review":"I'm a big Seinfeld (the sitcom) fan, and the most funny parts of the show, I think, are those introductions where Jerry is doing what he's the best at: stand-up comedy. I couldn't help not to laugh at those commentaries about everyday situations. I thought that there had to be a book about these. So I looked up on Amazon.com and found it, \\"Sein Language\\" both in paperback and hardcover editions (I bought this last one)! I read it in three days after the delivery, and I got to tell you, this guy is the funniest man alive! His comments are so intelligent and well written that I couldn't believe my eyes. The book itself is a solid hardcover, with a nice sleevecover and thick pages. There are B&W photos of Jerry in the beggining of each chapter (the book is divided into aspects of life, like dating, jobs,etc.).If you like the sitcom and love to laugh, you gotta get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason this book sells for a penny...","review":"This book was hugely disappointing. I'm a huge Seinfeld fan - my Tivo is always jammed with episodes and I'm anxiously waiting for the DVD release. I thought the DVD \\"Comedian\\" was pretty entertaining, but I simply could not get into this book and read 1/3 before putting it down for good.If you're like me and assume this is any sort of story you'll be disappointed, too. The book is nothing more but a series of jokes, each a paragraph long or so, that do not make up much of a larger story. If you're familiar with the show, you'll have already heard most of the jokes as intro's to the show.My suggestions- if you're looking for Seinfeld material, the \\"Comedian\\" DVD is good or be patient and wait for the episode series to come out. If you're looking for a comedian's book to read, Drew Carey's is a bit older, but pretty funny nonetheless.There's a reason why \\"Seinlanguage\\" sells for $0.01."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sein of Our Times","review":"\\"NO SOUP FOR YOU!\\"\\"Ya-da ya-da ya-da\\"\\"Poppy was a little sloppy\\"\\"If we pick do we not bleed!\\"\\"Thank God I took off my heels and put on my himalayan walking shoes!\\"Who could forget the hysterical comedy of a show so simple it becomes complex. The man behind it all does not disappoint us with this culmination of all things extraordinarily ordinary.A great book not only for the Seinfield Fan, but for the fan of stand-up in general. It only takes a few pages to get hooked into the writing.Although I do agree that stand-up is meant to be performed, it doesn't take much for your imagination to bring it to life.I definitely recommend Seinlanguage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"What a waste of money.

It's such an easy read, that I finished it in a matter of hours, while at work. His observations ring so true, which makes them even funnier. Great investment if you ever need a quick pick me up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasionally funny but fairly thin","review":"This book is a collection of Seinfeld's brand of humour, arranged in paragraphs and, to an extent, topics. There is a problem with such a format. If you're a great fan of Seinfeld, chances are, you'll know most of the material in the book (a big part of it is the same as some of Seinfeld's comedy bits in the TV show). If you're not a fan, then I think that it's best to see most comedians live, and if a book is some attempt at a reproduction of their act, it's not nearly as funny.From my experience, the best comedy books take advantage of the book form to provide lots of content that's different to a live act (for instance humour involving/incorporating images). For a purely verbal, observational style, nothing beats personal presence.For maximum hilarity, watch Seinfeld in his show or in his act, or read a more involved comedy book. This one, while it has its moments, has neither aspects of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Seinfeld is one my favorite comedians of all time. Seinlanguage really shows his comedy well. The book is filled with his great material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seinfeld is the best at making the everyday funny","review":"Some people have stated that the long-running Seinfeld sitcom was a show about nothing. Which is probably true, but largely irrelevant. A large amount of very good comedy is based on the incongruity of everyday events, which to some people is nothing. Seinfeld continues in this mode with the short vignettes in this book.The stories vary from the problems of finding a parking spot in New York City to the absurdity of professional wrestling. Each is funny and demonstrates Seinfeld at his comedic best. He is the best at taking the everyday things of life and making them funny. I urge you to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected very funny","review":"I just read the book version first published in 1993. As expected it is very funny. Seinfeld is an all around great comedian whether he creates a TV series, does stand up comedy, or even writes a book. His situational humor always comes through. Maybe some of you also saw the TV show he recently produced \\"The Marriage Ref.\\" He appeared on it a few times, and again he was winningly hysterical.The book gives you some insight about his family background and how a comedian thinks. If you like Seinfeld you will enjoy the book. The version I read is very short. I am a slow reader and I read it in about an hour and a half which is just about right. Given the subject and levity of the book, it certainly should not be any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tootsie Pop Pump","review":"This style did not come in my size (I needed a half size) and so I cannot write a proper review about the product.

I only wish I found these books earlier. There are puppies playing with a ball, panda bears eating bamboo, birds flying, snails, rabbits, a zebra, a spouting whale, and a sleeping cat. Instead of red words, as in \\"Look Look\\" they are yellow, which isn't as nice as the red, but stills looks good, particularly on the black.

Then, my husband found this new one, \\"In My Hometown\\". While the themes of Tom's music are aimed at children, the style isn't at all juvenile. They're funny, touching, rousing, and raucous, by turns. He and his co-writers also use very different musical genres on each recording, which never happens in mainstream music. So far, our favorite song on this CD is \\"Da Baby Sitter\\", about the new sitter - an ex-con named Harry the Hat! We also loved \\"Dog Rules\\", the third of Tom's songs about his Golden Retriever. This Be-Bop song lists all the things that makes a dog, a dog, like \\"any food that falls on the floor is yours.\\" Wonderful artist, wonderful songs, and a wonderful new recording!

He also loves \\"Don't Miss the Bus,\\" which features real bus noises and reminds me of my own late-for-school days. My parents came to visit, and because this is a \\"Don't leave home without it\\" item for us, got to know Tom Chapin as well.

The variety of music styles on this album shows the imagination and talent of Tom Chapin I loved the music so much that I got the album myself and I am now playing it for my own children even though they only speak danish. They absolutly love it and so do I. Finally some music for children that even adults enjoy.

I bought this and it's great because I can lock it when traveling and disengage while camping so the family can access normally. Great item without worrying about drilling holes into the fridge.

In outlaw hagiography, he is surely the darkest angel. Now, \\"The Chivalry of Crime,\\" an impressive first novel by Desmond Barry about the unholy terror of Jesse James, allows readers to touch the very root of violence in human nature and explore the American fascination with outlawsBarry, a Welsh immigrant fascinated by the fantastic tales of the American West, bit off a huge hunk of frontier mythology and chewed it fairly thoroughly. As a new work of \\"re-imagined\\" history, \\"The Chivalry of Crime\\" is perhaps not as literarily weighty as Stephen Harrigan's \\"Gates of the Alamo,\\" nor as quirky as Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian,\\" although Barry is a writer of equally enormous talent. The book's flaws are rather minor and technical, and it remains an entertaining historical yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chivalry In Crime","review":"Desmond Barry's novel strikes gold with every word. Set in a mining town soon after the conclusion of the Civil War, during the reconstructionist era, the book sings the tale of a young boy who has lost everything. His parents moved to the town from Europe, and was nearly destroyed upon arriving to the town. Joshua's mother was claimed by pneumonia, and his brother and sister died similarly thereafter. He and his father have given up religion, and Joshua has developed an intense hatred of God. His father became a drunkard, drinking until late in the night, and mining all day. Joshua desires passionately to acquire a gun and defy God's commandments. The story revolves around his struggle to acquire the gun, and what he does with it. It is a passionate, well developed novel about hatred, love, and the refusal to be a statistic, another worthless miner. I would reccomend it to anyone who wishes to read a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is supposed to do","review":"These spades are used on my Monster cables. They work as advertised.

On the way, a young badger named Beaufort is thrust into the role of leadership despite his reluctance. This gives the story of courage, determination against almost impossible odds, betrayal, and hope.

May the meaning of these lyrics ring out loud for all to hear and understand. Very Powerful as sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time! (1 star because there is no zero)","review":"What a truly awful book, masquerading as a biography it is more a commercial for some other book written by the author. I'm sure Courrier thought he was illuminating the work of Randy Newman for the masses, but this appalling effort is an overwrought theme clabbered with Freshman English opinion. Too bad the author wasn't as interested in Mr. Newman and his work as he was about his assumptions concerning what it might mean to him. Poor structure, wandering voice, nothing to recommend this work. Randy Newman is an artist that deserves a descent examination."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can skip this book","review":"It would not be accurate to say this book is totally worthless. It does contain a few facts about Randy Newman that I didn't pick up from the liner notes.At the same time, as the other reviewers noted, the author is unbelievably arrogant and opinionated. As one example, you may be surprised to learn that the scores for Awakenings, The Natural, and Ragtime are bland and unimaginative. I guess I am misguided, because I thought they were great.This book also contains the most shameless examples of page filling I've ever seen. Almost every subject is a springboard for a few pages of details that have nothing to do with Newman. Indeed, it's not clear that the author has even met Randy Newman.Like most people who are reading this page, I think Randy Newman is great. He deserves a serious study. This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic book","review":"i wholeheartedly agree with the review that gave this book one star only because you can't give nothing.this book is a complete waste of time about such an important figure in music.i can't understand how there isn't a real serious and complete study of randy newman and his music.probably the greatest songwriter the united states has ever produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid quality - great price!","review":"As director of a public library district, I ordered three of these screens for use in various meeting rooms. After a few months of use I can say we are very happy with them! They were easy to mount on the wall, the mechanism that retracts the screen seems durable, and the screen itself is bright white and shows projected images very well. If I ever needed more screens I wouldn't hesitate to buy this model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALMOST as good as the original","review":"I was one of the few people (it was not the biggest hit on Broadway) to actually attend a the original production of Tenderloin. I also have the first \\"original cast\\" LP. I've never known why the show itself flopped, since the music is certainly catchy and fits the story-line perfectly. Perhaps there was just too much competition on Broadway in the 60's for musicals. This rendition of the show doesn't quite have the livliness or depth of the original, particularly the orchestral support, but the improved technology of a CD over the old LP makes up for it and makes this a valuable addition to anyone's collection of show songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good concert version","review":"This CD is a good concert version of the original Broadway show. Jerry Bock's score and Sheldon Harnick's lyrics can be schmaltzy, but they invite one to sing along. Some of that schmaltz is satirical. Adding some of thew dialogue helps the listener to understand the context for a song. Still a favorite, \\"The Picture of Happiness\\" is a politically incorrect assessment of prostitution. \\"Artificial Flowers\\", while satirizing the kind of pulp fiction of the day, still manages to be sentimental. And \\"My Gentle Young Johnny\\" combines satire and sentiment in the yearning of a prostitute for one special man. One surprise for this listener was realizing that David Ogden Stiers can sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really WONDERFUL book!","review":"They say pictures are worth 1000 words, but as far as I'm concerned the book doesn't need words!

It spends more than half the video teaching counting from 1 to 10 and blasts through the addition and subtraction without much explanation. The video should have assumed the kid knows how to count to 10 and focused on the title of \\"math circus\\" and its claim to teach addition and subtraction. Do look to other leap DVD titles like letter and word factory I & II those are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been much better","review":"In its defense, I'll say that my child loves to watch this. However, I wasn't wanting only entertainment, I was wanting quality education. And my child likes almost all children's videos.My complaints are that speech of the characters is difficult to understand, the sound is harsh, the visuals are unnecessarily busy and the action happens too fast. Its more entertainment than education. The concept of adding is introduced but the addition tables not taught. A child that can already count will get very little from this other than amuzement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Educational Show","review":"I think this whole series is excellent. My two pre-school aged sons love it. It teaches counting and math facts while it entertains. There are many lessons set to music, which usually helps children remember the information. I recommend this show, and all of the others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out too simple, then gets complicated too quickly!","review":"I bought this hoping my five year old would learn the concepts of adding, and I was very disappointed. It starts off counting from 1-10 which was way too basic for my son, and quite repetitive and boring, then without explanation it starts addition without explaining how to add! And the use of the faceless boxes to represent numbers was just confusing. The dvd really dragged on. I would not waste money buying it! I do like the Leap Frog Phonics dvds, especially with the funny professor but his character is a real let-down in this dvd. Save your money and buy a better dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap Frog Math Circus DVD","review":"LeapFrog: Math CircusGreat video for the car.

You can't go wrong- they're fun, educational, and hold the kid's attention. Stock up now if you have family and friends with babies- they'll love these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth 5 just for the math practice","review":"I would have to agree that Leapfrog put a lot into this one math video. My son loves the option to practice his math facts. He sits on the floor with his counters and answers the problems with the remote! Learning math is FUN! I hope Leapfrog will be making more math videos with this same option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest","review":"This was the hardest Leap Frog to get our grandson to watch. Maybe the letters, words and stories seamed like so much information he didn't choose to put this subject in. I had him participate with this after a few months using the other DVD's. Now he's proud when he understands and comes up with the right answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Very dissappointed since the letter factory was so great! It does not keep my 2 year old's attention. I don't see my son learning too much from this video. They go through the numbers too fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We loved the Letter Factory for our kids, and really think it played an integral role in helping our daughter learn her letters and sounds. I was looking for the same type of \\"fun\\" video to reinforce the number concepts. This was clearly a disappointment, although my expectations were quite high! It didn't flow as nicely and went into the more difficult concepts too quickly without much background or explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the Letter Factory or Word Factories 1&2..","review":"I bought this DVD after my son learned most of his letters from the letter factory. My son enjoys the other 3 Leapfrog DVD's but since day 1 he just walks away from this one. It's boring.. they don't spend enuff time on the numbers themselves (but it did teach him the number 0 wich I'd forgotten about) and the quidgets don't even count out the numbers (ex. they say 3+2=5 instead of 3+2=5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) If your child already knows his/her numbers than maybe it'll be more interesting to them. My son doesn't ask for this video.. I recommend BumbleBee Kids 123's or Brainy Baby 123's. If all else fails there's Sesame Street's 123 Count With Me (wich my son LOVES and asks for almost every day). This DVD was a waste of time and money, I'm going to try Richard Scarry's 123's and probably will sell this one on eBay.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Math learned quickly","review":"My three-year-old nephew already knew his numbers. He loves watching this video---picks it over Dora and others. He can now add all the single-digit numbers and some double digits. He has some blocks that look like the quidgets in this video and that helps reinforce the concepts when he isn't watching. He loves to stack them up, starting with, say, 2 blocks and 4 blocks, and putting them together to make !!6 blocks!! He gets so excited."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY DISSAPOINTED","review":"The Math Circus is a disaster. After a REALLY GREAT EXPERIENCE with The Letter Factory and The Word Factory, The Math Circus is not reccommended. It can not be compared with the prior videos of Leap Frog in any way. My child (3.5) never watch it all over. It's very boring to him. Also, I don't like the grumpy and aggressive attitude of Mr. Websley in this video. It doesn't make sense and is not in armony with the teaching process of my child.I reccommend to Leap Frog to separate the counting from 1 to at least 20, and the recognition of numbers in one video and the addition and substraction techniques in other. They don't mix together for a 3 years old child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leapfrog Let Down!!!!!","review":"Like other reviewers I was dissapointed with this DVD. There are too many concepts being introduced in the 35mins. Leapfrog would have been better to make 3 separate DVD's - Numbers to 20, Addition, Subtraction. I am a school teacher and you never introduce number sentences (3+2=5) until children have a firm understanding of basic nember concepts (one to one correspondence, number order, before and after etc...). The DVD is still entertaining for children but I wouldn't recommend buying this one for educational purposes. Maybe Leapfrog should stick to words and letters!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After buying the great leapfrog \\"letter factory\\" and \\"talking word factory\\" this DVD has been a big disappointment.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOES TOO FAST","review":"This DVD covers addition from 1 plus 1 to 3 plus 3 plus 3 in about 60 seconds! It does not give enough BODY to the addition explanation and is hard to follow. It was a pure waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leapfrog has made better","review":"Though this is full of educational information like the other Leap Frog DVDs, they have changed gears a little bit. First of all, Professor Quigly is completely different (different, annoying voice and different mannerisms). Second, there aren't really any familial-type interactions between Leap, Lily, and Tad like there are in the other videos. My daughter still likes it (she's 7 months), but it feels like it was more of an afterthought to the Reading/Writing videos.On the positive side, it does have an interesting method to teach math. I cannot yet vouch for the effectiveness of the method."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could be better","review":"It seemed like the viewer would need just a tiny introduction to math prior to viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have to start by saying that I love leap frog products. In this case I was highly disappointed. It does not explain the concept of math it just starts adding things together. The songs were not intertaining and my 3.6 year old was not interested. Overall not a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tries to cover too much in one show","review":"I think this DVD tries to cover too much content: counting, adding, and subtracting. It jumps from counting, to counting in 10's and mixing up adding and subtracting, and can only serve as a mere INTRODUCTION to numbers/math. Also the sound quality was not as good as the other Leap Frog DVD's I own. Nonetheless, my kids still request to see it occasionally and they have learned to count in 10's up to 100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid Approved","review":"My kids loved this video and I love it because they are learning and they don't even relize it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD","review":"These videos really help kids learn.

I catch my daughter singing the songs to herself all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Leap Frog video","review":"I love Leap Frog movies and my 4 year old can't get enough of them. This makes it easy for them to learn their numbers and get a visual idea of what that number looks like while learning how many items that number stands for.

There are a lot more and a lot better films out there for your entertainment dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a great film,but action packed","review":"Steven Seagal will never be acclaimed as a great actor,but his films are action packed and exciting.This one was filmed in my hometown of Bridgeport,Ct in 2007 (due to the State of CT giving generous tax credits to movie makers).This one features Seagal as an alcoholic degenerate gambler ex-cop on a losing streak.A benefactor (Lance Henriksen)buys his \\"markers\\" and allows the disgraced gambler to \\"work off\\" his debt by assassinating various bad guys.Standard Seagal fare here,lots of shooting,car chases,and of course Steven beats up hundreds of guys along the way.Nothing great or original here,but a great 90 min.thrill ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steven Seagal formula film","review":"Another blood and guts epic with a young daughter as \\"human interest\\":I bet Steven Seagal like Elvis Presley wonders where the formulahas gone wrong?

Made an action packed movie full of drama, humor, suspense, romance, and a strong, yet vulnerable woman named Drea Smalls, played beautifully by Renee Elise Goldsberry. Ms.Goldsberry'sportrayal of Andrea(Drea)Smalls gives credence to the reality of the statement \\"Behind Every Strong Man Is an Even Stronger Woman.\\"In a lead role opposite Steven Segal, Ms Goldsberry brought beauty, vitality, and spontaneity to her character Drea Smalls. The chemistry between Segal and Goldsberry was natural and edgy. Congratulations to Steven, Renee, and the entire cast of Pistol Whipped for a memorable performance. I enjoyed this movie.

Unlike Segal's previous film - the tight and fun \\"Urban Justice\\" - this one has no discernible story, no explanation for who's doing what, done what, or why and has more plot holes than it would take to fill the Albert Hall.I watched it with my wife (who, like me, likes Segal) and she had the same reaction: why were all these people doing this and who were they?No answers were forthcoming..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BoreFest starring Seagal's Body Doubles","review":"Another Seagal film and another waste of my time! If the movie was 20 minutes long it would be one of the greatest action films of all time. I can't stand these low budget films, I hate how instead of giving us what we want we're subjected to seeing Seagal walk around talking and smiling for 90 minutes. If the man could act, if the script was well written, then it would be a different story. When we do get action, it's mostly body doubles. The only good thing about this film is the final shootout at the graveyard. It was done like a pro but they obviously put their entire budget into that and relied on the script and Steven for the rest. The movie is a failure and should be avoided.I also saw Van Damme's new film The Shepherd which comes out the same day and it was freaking spectacular. It was filled with martial arts, high octane car chases and tons of action. Why can't Seagal give us that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"only one scene.....","review":"the other folks said it all...there was just one scene that touched and that was when he looked in the fridge and sighed...\\"Man, I ain't got xxxx\\"That did it for me.

There is certainly a lot of mirth in the movies.The sad thing is that I really need to come to terms with the fact that his best days are behind him, as are his best movies, and it is time to find a meaner, leaner martial arts fighter-actor.Worth a watch but do not expect too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pistol Whipped is Watchable (that's a compliment)","review":"In the Direct to DVD league Pistol Whipped is better than average. I recommend Pistol Whipped to fans of Steven Seagal or even for the casual action fan with low expectations. There are so many Direct to DVD Seagal films that to put Pistol Whipped into context I'd say it's 1 of only 3 or 4 of Seagal's post Exit Wounds films that I'd recommend. The others being Belly of the Beast, Urban Justice and, maybe, Today You Die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better DTV films","review":"Was looking forward to watching this but was a little disappointed.

It gives general explanations but seriously misses a beat in the details. It would be more accurate if Nolo sold this as a supportive \\"basic knowledge\\" book and NOT a \\"how to try your case\\", book.And as a suggestion I would say that they should have more detailed books that are customized per states? That actually get into the nitty gritty, for instance, how to actually fill out a Complaint Cover Sheet? ect. This book just tells you you need to start your Lawsuit by filing a Complaint.

I teach preschool, two year olds in fact, and Todd Parr is one of their favorite authors. We read all of his books. I was particularly moved by The Family Book because it deals with real families. From single parents, to two moms and two dads. It addresses things like how close some families live to one another to how very far away they live and how some families are the same color or adopt children. It is all done in the cutest pictures. I enjoy all of Todd Parr's books. The Okay Book and Do's and Don'ts are among my favorite. And now The Family Book leads the way! And whether you agree with the description of what a family is or not, they are factual description that apply to many people and children will at some point come across a friend who has two moms or has a single parent. It's a nice way to open the eyes of everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for kids","review":"I was looking for a book about non traditional families for my son.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Todd Parr! Love The Family Book!","review":"Todd Parr books are always a big hit in our house - my husband and I like them because they are inclusive, they spark conversation about difference and sameness at the level my kids can understand, and because we can always find an element of ourselves in his text.My kids love these books because of the fun and spunky illustrations AND because on every page they see themselves or other families we know.Parr brings up the kinds of differences that previous reviewers have mentioned - families with two mommies, for example, or families that don't look like each other -- in a completely matter-of-fact way. He doesn't get preachy or didactic or pass judgement - he just states it as fact: some families have two daddies. True! Some families are adopted. True! Some families look like their pets. True! All are on the same footing. This is the message I want my kids to get from Parr's books. Being different is not weird or wrong or remarkable - it just is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homosexual propaganda","review":"My 2 yr. old checked this book out from the library today.

I didn't know my daughter would be exposed to this without my consent! My daughter,age 7, asked me how it was possible for families to have two mommies or two daddies. Apparently this is a book about many diverse types of families. I don't have a problem with that. I do have a problem with the public school system allowing the homosexual marriage agenda to be taught in the classroom. It is disguised under the label \\"character education about diversity\\" and teaching about \\"tolerance'. I think teaching tolerance is wonderful. Tolerance can be taught in public schools without being anti-tolerant of Judeo-Christian views as well. I feel similar to the other reviewer, who explained that she is not ready to get into teaching the \\"birds and bees\\" to her young child just yet.

The whole albums awsome but those the songs that really stick out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for singing along!","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this album is definitely more commercial than DKM's other albums, but it's still one of my favorites. The songs are simpler, less Irish, and more of the sing-a-long variety with repetitive lyrics (Gonna Be a Blackout Tonight and This Is Your Life), but there's something about the album that just plain makes me feel good. If you're looking for something edgier, this isn't it, though, try \\"The Singles Collection.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Right at the top","review":"DKM continues to deliver what has always been best about them: honest, fun, thoughtful, rocking music. What makes them intersting is that they continue to evolve musically while maintaining the Irish edge to their work. In other words, they don't latch on to a \\"formula\\" and milk it for all its worth, but instead are willing to go out on any number of limbs to get their message across, without losing the spirit and fun of what they continue to do best. I think it's the best album they've put out so far. It won't disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely fun","review":"\\"Workers Song\\", and \\"Kiss Me I'm Sh*tfaced\\" alone make this an album worth buying.

No more exciting guitar riffs and captivating drum beats. The pipes are piercing. Ken Casey can only be tolerated for so long. The last thing we need is for DKM to become the next Flogging Molly. DKM are almost hardcore, they're badass guys like in Barroom Hero.If you like Al Barr check out his old band The Bruisers. You'll find that even he came hard back in the day. Bloodshed is an awesome song.I don't want to bash the band, but please respect the older goodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the f@#k happened!","review":"One of my favorite bands has left me with a bad taste in my mouth after hearing Blackout. While there are a few good tracks on here most don't come even close to their previous stuff. The version of \\"Dirty Glass\\" sucks my ass. The original on the split they did with Face To Face had a different singer on the female vocals and she was vastly superior. The biggest problem with this album are the vocals. What the hell happened to the amazing vocals of Al Barr (Bruisers forever), he seems to have disappeared on this album. Ken Kelly should stick to playing bass. He's okay singing a line or verse here or there but his vocals are far too prominent on this album. I know he's the only original member left but that doesn't mean he should make himself the focal point of the whole album. If I was Al Barr I'd be pissed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another commercial victim","review":"It seems that alot of the bands that USED to have a hard edge are going broke. This has to be the case because The Murphys were the last band I figured would roll over for money. Well it happened. This album is a total and complete disappointment. If you love DO or Die and The Gangs All Here, avoid this disc. The edge is gone and has been replaced with....basically nothing. The whole disc just seems empty of any heart that was on the other discs. It gets two stars for the use of Bagpipes, but as for anything else worthy of mentioning, I have yet to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing!","review":"Why can't the Drop Kick Murphy's do anything new? Every album sounds the same, and that was cool for a while, but I'm sick and tried of hearing the same old thing over and over again. Don't get me wrong these guys can play a wide range of song styles and in this album they sure as hell do that but it's like they have about four or five styles and that's all we ever see in every album. Blackout is NOTHING new. I swear it's like it's just a b-side track to Sing Loud Sing Proud. If you are a die-hard fan of the Drop Kick Murphy's get this CD, but personally I'm sick of hearing the same old stuff over and over and over and over and over again. For the love of God, EVOLVE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do or Die Fans Stay Away","review":"It seems a lot of the positive reviews here are from DKM fans that thought Sing Loud, Sing Proud was the Dropkick's best album. I liked Sing Loud, but I really thought it was a shadow of Do or Die. With Blackout the DKM continue to distance themselves from their premier album.With Blackout, I think, the DKMs just sound like a high-school punk band that's trying to model themselves after the DKMs of old. Their celtic, blue-collar, everyman, sing-along style which was at its most potent in Do or Die, and was still powerful in tracks like The Gauntlet and The Spicy McHaggis Jig on Sing Loud, now seems to have been replaced with the common teenage punk rage of most punk bands.I'm sure most punk fans will like this album. For those, like me, who felt the DKMs were a band that brought something new to the genre back with Do or Die, I think those days are past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Murphys Record Ever. . .","review":"Dammit! Whats happened to these guys? Everything has slowed down and gotten pretty boring. Al, who was once a great aggressive frontman has now decided to lose his edge and try to actually carry tunes instead of just growling the lyrics like he used to. I also liked them much better as the 4 piece they once were. It would be tough to still classify these guys as punk rock anymore. . .as far as musical styles go anyway.Nothing beats The Gangs All Here or anything recorded when Mike was still singing with them. Dont bother with this one if youre a fan of the older stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff - but not their best","review":"I really enjoyed this album. In fact, it keeps getting better and better each time I hear it. Having connections with the Guthrie family, I was pleased to see a punk band write the music to one of Woody's unfinished songs. Yes, this album is different from older Murphys music, but that's what a band is all about. You can't expect them to keep cranking out the same old thing over and over, or eventually no one will buy the new stuff. Overall, very good album, could have been better, but I am pleased with it the way it is. Once you get over the difference in the sound, you will find that this is, in fact, a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED","review":"This is a standard a.v. selector, made by monster cable. Monster cable does make some of the best cables around, they are all I use for my audio, even though they are a lil pricey. But monster means quality. But.... Its just not worth the price tag on this thing! For top of the line quality nothing beats this, but if you can afford this then you can afford a t.v. with 4 s video inputs such as the top of the line sony wega, so why not spend your money on that? Its good quality, but I think I'll spend my money for the $50 rca one, or even find another one for less, but if you got money to burn on a selector, go ahead, but the money can buy alot better things."},{"rating":"1","title":"HP Print Server JetDirect 615N Ether 10/100 1xRJ45 Enhanced I/O (EIO) J6057A#ABF","review":"I bought this product a while ago and have not had the chance to review it until recently.

Lyrically compelling -- humane personal testimony without the turgid self-obsession that marks so much singer-songwriter material -- the images from these songs remind me of James McMurtry's best work; wry, plain-spoken observations of the quiet terrors of normal life. All of that alone would make this a worthwhile collection, but it is the sonic quality of this cd that makes it so arresting. It rocks!!!Much of it has a frenzied, throbbing, train-wreck sound that brings to mind Bob Mould. Like Mould's best stuff, the hammering of the music never gets in the way of the hook. I can't get these songs out of my head, and I can't (don't want to) get this cd out of my player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This recording contains some solid compositions. Unfortunately the delivery of these same tunes is dramatically sold short by the mediocre band employed by Fish and, for the BBC, a poor sound quality.

This CD, sadly, is not like this. The music does have nice individual pieces, but none of them fit together or the content of the BBC program. \\"Aldebaren\\" sounds like it would be better on a sci-fi soundtrack, \\" I Want Tomorrow\\" doesn't fit with the CD or the show, and then songs such as \\"Epona\\" and \\"Fairytale\\" didn't fit.

I had hear other material from Enya, but this was a must have. I will admit that I come at this from a different angle than most of Enya's fans. I grew up listening to The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, early King Crimson and Renaissance. This CD has a similar lush , dreamy and consistant soundscape as their best mellow material . This CD is the perfect thing to unwind with at the end of the day. This is not traditional Celtic folk music. It is all about electronic overlays.

It was only recently that I was browsing through the videos at the library that I saw a documentary film on the celts, which I checked out. Aha! What a revelation. Enya does the soundtrack for this film and now the music on the CD has so much more meaning. Especially the song that was played during the sequence where they were filming an Irish city that is now submerged under water. If you like this CD, I am telling you, you HAVE to go to your library and seek out this video....it all comes together."},{"rating":"2","title":"...echoes from the past...","review":"The Celts is Enya's first album. It has it's own charm when you compare it to the other Enya albums. The Celts sounds somewhat more simple, because there are other instruments used and less synths. Look in the booklet for the stories that are beyond the songs.I often go for a walk with my dog in the woods, and take this cd with me. It has a magical feeling, listening to The Celts in the woods. Try it yourself.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy I am!","review":"I was very eager to receive this cd and it played and sounded great!

Although its not going to make you run to the dancefloor or pump your fist in the air, its powerful in its own quiet way. Theres a deep quiet beauty to these sad songs, entrancing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible","review":"I purchased this album in 1987 when it was first released. (The original cover in B&W with the dogs). If you have had the opportunity to see \\"The Celts,\\" (BBC) you would understand the entire album much better. Her songs convey a great deal of power and energy and her style is very unique to the point of not really being able to classify her in the Celtic or New Age genre. Every other one of her albums has been wonderful but in my mind. This one is the best.(Did you know that she was once part of Clannad and that her sister Maire and 2 brothers are still in the band?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Enya","review":"This is simply the best ablum she has put out so far.

AAA+++!!!","review":"I discovered Enya way back after renting the movie video \\"L.A. Story\\" a romantic comedy with Steve Martin, with the soundtrack filled with Enya's enchanting music. After scrunching my nose to the tv screen and wearing out the rewind button to decipher the microprint music credits (\\"Enya???\\")... I've been an Enya fanatic ever since. Great movie by the way. Enya's the best! Check out her family's group \\"Clannad\\" & Maire Brennan for music just about as enchanting as Enya's. Enya looks as pretty as her music sounds too. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It grabs your heart and leave you breathless","review":"This cd is enchanting. You feel close to earth while listening to the music. I am Welsh, so the song \\"dan y dwr\\", which means \\"under the water\\" in Welsh is so dear to me. It is abour a small Welsh village that was drowned by the English, against the whole if wales protesting. Enya captures the mood and feeling.It gives you a feeling of proudness, and all celtic people, relatives and others will feel a tinge down their spine while listening. Mellow but strong, good for the soul and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll make a fan out of you!","review":"This is the first Enya CD I ever bought.

This one is good to have for the person who wants a full collection. If you're not very familiar with enya's music I wouldn't advise buying this one first. The only song in English on the cd is I Want Tommorrow. The electric guitar solo seems very out of place at first but you get used used to it after a while. There is a really beatiful violin solo during To Go Beyond II that also catches you off guard. The best songs are Aldebaran, I Want Tommorrow, Epona, Triad and Sun in the Stream II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the album","review":"The Celts is haunting and beautiful.

Not all movies are \\"Gone with the Wind,\\" or \\"Titanic\\" or the like. Rockula has goofy characters and a nutty plot. However, this movie does have one redeeming thing: it has some kicking music, with a particularly wicked performance by Toni Basil called \\"The Night.\\" And, for those who find humor in such things, it's worth it just to see Bo Diddley in high top sneakers, biker shorts, a tank top, a yellow cape, and wire bats on springs waving around his head.They evidently did not come out with a sound track for this movie, and that's a shame. If there is a sound track out there, I hope someone lets me know where to find it. I've looked all over the place, and have yet to locate it.Who cares if the movie's dopey? Watch it for the tunes!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie needs no review","review":"Horrible, absolutly horrible. A chore to get through. The only saving grace is Toni Basil as the mother (she has a great bod). Aside from that this whole movie stinks to high heaven.A teenage vampire wants to fit in. He can't even agree with his reflection. He's always arguing at his reflection in the mirror! Let's see 'vampire', 'reflection'....... You see what I mean? Anyway, he forms a band named 'Rockula'.

The younger generation needs to know about these people. The variety of these people ranges from soup to nuts. I was a friend of Bob Basker, and am disappointed that his work with Miami GAA is barely mentioned. I also met Kameny and Troy Perry, and stood near Ginsberg without speaking to him (all in 1972). Those were heady days. These potted biographies, in many cases, are likely to be the only ones to ever appear on specific persons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic powerful blend of traditional songs and creativity","review":"Picked this CD up at Wupatki National Monument out west. The songs are based on traditional Hopi songs but with embellishments such as flute and occasional background nature sounds. A great mix of drumming, chanting, rattlework. Definately easier for most westerners to listen to than powwow songs. A bit more tribal than the latest Carlos Nakai but generally in that genree. Sounds somewhere between Nakai and Douglas Blue Feather. Really suprisingly great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Terrible\\"","review":"Summer time heat requires waterproof mascara.

I have used it in spool form (like this product) which requires you to attach your own adapters. And I have used it in precut lengths in which the vendor attaches the adapters.

I can hardly imagine an end-use situation in which buying a spool of this stuff would make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"BTE almost lost me with this one","review":"I was very disappointed when I first listened to this CD. There are some good songs on this CD but BTE got away from the good guitar sounds of \\"Deluxe\\" and \\"Friction, Baby\\" on this one and instead relied heavily on synthesized music. The synthesizer sounds more like tape hiss than music on some of the cuts. This CD is not representative of the BTE sound on their other three releases. Although I do not recommend this CD, I highly recommend \\"Deluxe\\", \\"Friction, Baby\\", and \\"Closer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This garden grows on you.","review":"After listening to \\"Deluxe,\\" \\"Friction, Baby\\" and \\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\\" literally hundreds of times each, I still find it difficult to pick a favorite among the three. \\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\\" is certainly the most atmospheric and experimental of the three, with layered textures throughout. If you're looking for a power pop sound, try \\"Deluxe\\" instead; if you want a rougher, guitar-edged sound, opt for \\"Friction, Baby.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great follow up!","review":"I was skeptical that this cd might just be a one-hit cd (At the stars is getting lots of air play) but when I bought it, I was amazed. It was obvious that they have gotten a U2 (awesome!) influence, and I think the added electronic embellishments add to the disc. I reccomend this CD -- you won't get tired of their great songwriting and tight vocals and arrangements! Great job, BTE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!","review":"As a huge fan of the \\"Deluxe\\" album, I felt \\"Friction\\" was a nice follow up. This latest album doesn't compare.

It doesn't even sound like the BTE that I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantly improving itself, the latest offering for BTE.","review":"If you play their three major LPs in order, you can almost feel the band Better than Ezra evolving. They start off as a country rock band like Gin Blossoms. Then move into harder stuff around the level of Bush. With this album, they are fully an alternative rock band. I think the sound works for them. They combine great songs (the best is \\"Beautiful Mistake\\" for my money) with technical expertise, and the result is the album I urge you to buy, the one that's going to turn the best American musicians around into stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is the best cd I have purchased in a LONG time!!!

If you haven't bought this one yet GET IT!

There's really no songs on the CD that I strongly dislike, but there are a few I tend to skip over. And there are those few -- \\"At the Stars\\", \\"Live Again\\", and \\"Everything in 2's\\" that I think are quite simply incredible. One thing I really like about HDYGG is that it has a good mix of faster songs with heavier guitars and the slower, softer ballads. This CD may be off the beaten path for BTE, but then again, they as a band are off the beaten path. It's what makes me such a huge fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a album with a beat.","review":"It looks like BTE did it again! They put their minds to work and came out with another great CD.

Since the time that I have bought this album, it has not been 5 feet from my cd player, in the car and at home. It is that good. Every track is not without beauty... every pluck of the guitar string, to every vocal pitch, Better than ezra pull off ART. If you haven't listened or heard of Better Than Ezra except for their hits \\"Good\\" and \\"Desperately Wanting\\", then you are indeed missing out. Trust me. I bought this album.. and figured, what the heck, I'll go to a concert too. Seeing BTE live is an incredible experience! You won't ever forget the first time that you see them and you will talk it over with your friends for a long time, hoping and praying that they will return soon.Whatever you do, buy this album, support a phenomonal band.

I am also surprised that so few people, if any, have made the radiohead comparison. there are some songs on here that sound so much like Thom Yorke its embarassing. ANyway, if you're a big RH fan, this is a terrific album to hold you over till their nxt release. or, if you just like BTE, well...you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful.","review":"Never mind the reviewers who cast away this cd as a bad artistic departure for the band. Okay, so they leave the guitars and grunge sound behind on this... but, that surely is not a bad thing. This album sees Better Than Ezra at their peak. The instrumentation and lyrics are purely amazing. The songs have a lot of layering to them... every sound fits perfectly (even the small electronic blips). This album is very complete and cohesive. The way the songs are layed out tells a story. I was sad to see them leave this sound behind in their newest album, Closer. I really hope they return to this type of record. It seems that they really could not go wrong. Their experimentation payed off!I would compare this to Jimmy Eat World's, Clarity, which is another record on this level. Definitely check this album out as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional, for a change...or maybe I just am dillusional.","review":"This album is excellent.

It is probably the most beautifully composed album I have ever heard. 13 of the 14 tracks on this cd are just awesome songs. The only one I really don't like is Track 1, that french title song. But other than that, just a standout album from what I think is the most underrated band in the music business. Give this album a chance. The standout tracks are \\"At the Stars\\", \\"Allison Foley\\", \\"Live Again\\", \\"I like it Like That\\", and \\"under you\\". But like I said, 13 of the 14 tracks on this album are amazing. In my opinion this is the best of the 3 albums they have released. Hands down. Granted, Friction Baby had some really powerful songs, but this album cooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This is my first cd from Better Than Ezra. I can't stop playing the cd. The songs \\"At the Stars\\", \\"Under You\\", and \\"Live Again\\" are definately my favorites. \\"Live Again\\" may be one of my favorite songs out right now. I haven't heard these guys on the radio that much though. But they should get alot from this cd. Although it does hold about 3 \\"filler\\" songs......it still is a great cd.

BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A change, but not for the better","review":"I've always been a fan of Better Than Ezra, but after listening to their third album, I found myself longing for the earlier days. \\"How Does Your Garden Grow\\" just ain't that good. The musical style is slightly different on this album, which would normally be a refreshing change, but with the exception of maybe 3 or 4 good songs, the songs on this album just totally stink! I was hoping for more songs like the hit single \\"At The Stars\\" but the rest of the songs just seemed empty and lacking in creativity. This was a real disappointment. If you really want to check out this band, get one of their earlier albums, \\"Deluxe\\" and \\"Friction Baby\\"...don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"They just got so good all of a sudden.","review":"The first album, Deluxe, really blew. The second album, friction baby, blew less, because it started to sound the same after the first 6 songs. This one however is great, accomplished musically while being lyrically challenging. The electronica touches and orchestrations really flesh out the songs and take Better than Ezra to places they've never been before. How did they get so much better all of a sudden?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful album with lots of emotion","review":"I have been a fan of Better Than Ezra since 1993, when I was only in third grade! I remember hearing their stuff on the radio, and oh does it bring back memories...their third (or technically fourth for those of you who know about surprise) is such a beautiful album chock full of emotional songs that have become stuck in my head forever...their classic better than ezra rock combined with other melodious and unusual instruments creates just a beautiful sound...the words are poetry, if you can figure them out-that took me a while to think about what they meant. Better Than Ezra is the best music group on earth and they give the most kick butt concerts! Get this CD...it is definetly worth it, it really grew on me. See ya fellow Ezralites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, yet somewhat unexpected album; give it a shot!","review":"This album begins with two rather unconventional songs; however, they are somewhat slow in the making.

If you have an ear for quality music, I encourage you to check this one out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"With this album, something went wrong...","review":"After heared from the new Better Than Ezra album I looked forward to get it, since \\"Friction, Baby\\" is one of my most favourite records.

With the possible exception of the Euthyphro, these are all very, very important dialogues, and, as such, it is important that the translation be accurate, yet readable. Having translated part of the Meno myself, I can attest to Grube's wonderful job at rendering into clear and comprehensible English all that he could from Plato's beautiful Attic Greek. These are wonderful dialogues, and Grube does a wonderful job at making them accessible to the modern reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"Front cover looks as if its been folded 10 times but otherwise, the rest of the book is in tact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let your spirit dance freely...","review":"...and purchase this CD!

Finnish, a Finno-Uralic language (i.e., related only to Hungarian and Estonian and totally alien from all other European languages), sounds vaguely Eastern as sung by the talented vocalists of Värttinä.

The first is organic, enticing, moving, brilliant in almost every way. The second is rather forced, somewhat muddled, and just generally not very interesting. This may be because the first section is a straightforward exposition of Auster's family history while the second is a quasi-artsy autobiography of sorts.If you read through the other reviews here, there are many who loved the whole book, so my reaction is probably in the minority, so don't be afraid to pick this up.

I understand the points he was trying to make but he took way too long to get there. I was also frustrated with the way the author glossed over the big blowup that changed everything. The author should have spent more time writing about what happened during and after his blowup instead of page after page of his everyday life leading up to it.

Also on the label are graphic examples of the different print styles... with a much greater print height to tape width ratio, indicating that the text is 5/8ths to 3/4ths the width of the tape.

Virtually all the labels have fallen off after extremely moderate use. The stickiness on the back makes these completely worthless.Further, the so-called \\"metal\\" tape is just gray plastic tape.I don't expect much for the the $40 or so, but labels that actually stick would be a minimum. I intend to get a Brother label maker, if they're still sold, as THAT one sticks better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had also bought this label maker with great promise as it has a number of features the more basic model I had did not. However, I quickly found it jammed when printing, and thus you had to reprint, eating up the tape quicker, which is not cheap. Also, I recall it requires a lot of batteries, which seem to be exhausted quickly, compared to other things I have that use far fewer batteries, like digital cameras. So, it became an expensive item to maintain (printing tape and batteries), which i got tired of doing.

Long story short, DON'T buy this label maker, there are serious defects and problems with it. I've changed batteries, hooked up to 3 different AC adapters, changed cartridges, and still, blank labels. This just can not be a coincidence that so many people are writing about the same issues with not one shred of firm reaction from DYMO.

After reading the troubleshooting guide, I found an extra AC adapter I had, plugged the label maker in, and the text came out just fine. However, the inability to work with batteries bumped my rating down to four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labels fade with time","review":"My main complaint about this label maker is that the labels fade over time. I've seen other people say that theirs actually printed faded labels to start with. Mine did not, but the labels that looked good when I printed them are barely legible after a few months. Disappointing!Eventually the printer stopped working altogether. It displays \\"tape jam\\" when you want to print even though everything is perfectly clean inside. Good riddance!

I bought this from Amazon a few months ago (August 05, 2012), then my needs changed and I did not use it right away.

There also appears to be some type of sticky fiber near the top which may or may not be the remains of a spiders web. I posted a photo here. The clump is hard to get a picture of. The moth \\"floated\\" to the top, possibly because ti is completely dried.Apparently, this how Marshalls Creek Spices decides to add protean to their spices.

It's a nice short, fun read. It tells the story of an ancient Amazon living in the Black Sea area, who enters a Goddess temple for a vision quest, and wakes up in modern day America. The book details her perceptions, as a woman from a matrilineal, female honoring society, of modern day America.A lot of perceptions are painfully obvious, such as her thoughts on television, food, and spousal abuse. But it's fun to read her reactions to these situations.It's a juvenile sort of inspiration, but totally worth it if you have a few days and an interest in the Goddess religions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique wonderful read !!!","review":"What a great story -with comments that really hit the mark about our modern civilization.

From the description, I expected it to be a beginner level instructional video on the foundations of yoga. The instructor says at the beginning that it is something called \\"Key Yoga\\" (no idea if I spelled that right) which is \\"dynamic.\\" What she means is, it's really more like calisthenics.In the first two minutes, she basically has you doing crunches. That is not Yoga, as far as I'm concerned.

Although maybe someone could point to the other Acoustic Disc release, RETROGRASS, as a counter argument. I wouldn't argue with that actually, but I prefer the music on this cd more. The clear, ringing tone of the banjo on this cd is beautiful.The mountain-banjo-style tracks are particularly great, such as CHILLY WINDS, CHINQUAPIN PIE, and TWIN SISTERS.

First of all, this book makes nearly everyone think of a memory they have, which may be a worthy writing topic, whether it's a vacation, former home, or any other special place lodged in someone's fond memories. So it helps generate topics for writing stories in classes.Second, because of the wonderful metaphoric language, JEMIMA makes a good model to use in the study of methaphoric language, a common topic in K-8 curriculum.To obtain this book, use a used bookseller like the one found on this site."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised","review":"The THX Ultra 800 component cable from Monster does what it's supposed to do.

Even on TAPE, it never loses ANY of the sound quality the CD had. Enya is a beautiful singer when it comes to her second album, \\"Watermark.\\" It remains still soft, touches you in the inner depths of your soul, and you never, ever get tired of it.If you're looking for music to soothe you down, why not check this one out? It's worthy of many Grammys for Enya. But don't buy her recent album, 'A Day Without Rain.' Even though ADWR has a few good songs, all of them dull in comparison of Enya's second album. \\"Watermark\\" still remains my personal favorite Enya album, thanks to her, her talent, and God."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent CD to \\"sail away\\" on...","review":"I think, like a lot of people, first encountered Enya by hearing Orinoco Flow.

It is perfect for certain days only, so don't expect a song for every occasion. The music is soulful, even meditative, but the lyrics work like magic. Just read the lyrics to \\"On Your Shore\\" or \\"Exile\\" and you'll see the quality talent being dealt with. I do not really care for \\"Cursum Perficio\\" or \\"Orinoco Flow\\", but I can just skip them. Otherwise, I love this album. It can really appeal to one on a deeper level than relaxing or beating stress. The intimacy of the album makes this more than just another \\"New Age\\" album. There's sadness, joy, and beauty in equal measures. The peace and calm do not interfere at all. Just sit back and enjoy repeated listenings. I've listened to this album for four years now and I still love it. I hope that you get into it, too. Also, the one song on the album that's my absolute favorite is \\"Exile\\".

The lyrics are hauntingly beautiful; the lyrics are EXTREMELY poetic, and her voice is enigmatic and warm. She never ceases to make good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"When this album was released, and Enya was virtually unknown in the U.S. it would be difficult to guess that she would become the phenomenon she did (just on the strength of this surprising, startling album). Yes, most people first heard \\"Orinoco Flow\\" and most (including me) have tired of it. At the time, though, it was something new and very refreshing. A very peaceful, ethereal voice. Enya has been classified in later times as a New Age artist, but her music and experience certainly belie this label. She is remarkably talented, having spent many years performing with her sister Maire's band, Clannad.This album is never tired, never dated, and one can lose oneself in its waves. Particularly soothing tracks are \\"On Your Shore\\", \\"Miss Clare Remembers\\", \\"Evening Falls\\" and \\"Na Laetha Geal M'Óige\\" (which is my favourite song here and is sung in Irish)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Repetitive rhythms that take you away","review":"New Age music is hard to define for those who have not heard it. But if you had to name landmark albums in the growth of New Age music, this would probably be one of them. Released in the late 80's, this is probably one of the most popular New Age albums, especially by a female artist. The musical pieces are a collection of both instrumental pieces and songs, all of which remind one of nature scenes. Many of the pieces sound similar, and listening to this CD will give you a good feel of Enya's vocal range and talent. But all the pieces are good, and some are downright great; especially the famous Orinoco Flow. Overall, a good buy for relaxing music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for EVERYONE","review":"I've had many friends over the years comment on this CD when I was playing it.

It never leaves my side at work. You know how it gets, the boss wants those stat's and reports yesterday, project problems and delays. What do you do, slip the CD into your MultiMedia PC and let the music spill over you and wash away all that stress. It relaxes and centres at the same time and I am by no means a \\"New Age\\" person but this is the only way I find I can describe the music produced by Enya. It seems to transport you to that quite place many of us have forgotten in this mad world of ours. Buy it you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make this your first Enya CD. ... TEN ! STARS","review":"This is absolutely a thrilling work. The beauty, the smoothness, the emotional impact, is beyond anything I have heard in many years.

How could I recommend it to you more highly??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enya's classic","review":"This album is what could be could be better described as her trademark within the New Age genre. The subtle music from the title track is enough to make you relax. This was the first of Enya's albums that I became acquainted with and still my favorite. The music contained is for the real connoseiur that likes the different attitude of the author; from the calm Watermark to the more energetic Orinoco Flow. It is an album that will bring inner peace and relaxation to our normally fast paced lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watermark CD","review":"I ordered this CD knowing full well that it was \\"used\\". It arrived with the cover entirely rippled from being in water. The CD was all smuged with the back ink on the front of the CD. This black ink is all over the backside too. I tried three CD players, nothing would work..This CD is dead.I have written three times to them. After two weeks, I geta note saying we need the paperwork back to review the sale. What paperwork?...I got \\"no\\" paperwork and I thought that strange as well. Now I understand why they did not send any.I wanted my money back but without varification I bought something from them (except the chg. on my credit card through Amizon)...I get nothing. Very disappointed and dissatisfied. This is the first time I am dissatisfied with amizon.Read my record..In 6 years this is my first negitive.Betty Morgan"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"A great disappointment. I was expecting a better product from this artiste. There is so much much non-directional filler instrumentation that I feel like I bought a CD that was an Enya / New Age elevator music collaboration.

I wanted something diffrent from the harsh guitars and drums of pop/rock, so I went ahead and bought this CD. I was not dissappointed. I love it so much.

Very nice CD","review":"Each track is different from the others. Very relaxing to listen to without being boring and repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Enya's finest","review":"Chances are that if anyone has heard at least one of Enya's songs, it probably was \\"Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)\\". This song is enlightening, upbeat, happy, beautiful & innocent. However, there are other songs on this album that have a different feel to them. One of my most personal favorites is \\"Exile\\", which has an almost \\"hopeless\\" feel to it, but the chorus lets you see a light at the end of the tunnel. \\"Storms in Africa\\" is another upbeat, enlightening song, but with a more definite drum beat. \\"...Evening Falls\\" has an almost eery beauty with allusions to the spirit world, & is best when played at night. All in all, this cd is worth its weight in gold. No Enya collection would be complete without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOTLEG CD","review":"PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A BOOTLEG CD AND SHOULD NOT BE ON SALE.

Este disco es uno de sus mejores porque cada cancion es romantica y es fiel exponente de su estilo unico. Quiero hacer destacar algunas de ellas: #1-4 y la Serenata.

She produced the record herself, and delivers music of rare beauty. Regular musical collaborators Howard Lees on acoustic guitar and Rory McFarlane on bass are on top form. With the likes of Richard Thompson and Helen Watson also pitching in, the result is pure class.Collister is a fine writer herself. \\"Kicking In My Stall,\\" co-written with Helen Watson, is an instant classic. But usually she prefers to interpret songs by others. She chooses songs that tell stories, songs to engage the mind. She doesn't bother with the kind of pap that gets you into the singles charts.As ever, her voice is remarkable and enchanting. Do yourself a favour and buy this exquisitely crafted record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating page-turner","review":"I am a long-time true crime reader and this book was one I didn't want to put down.

This is the first in a series, so feel free to invest in this character. She'll be around for a while. It's smart. It's well-written. It's engaging. It's fun. Take extra sun block to the beach.

It is written by a man who wanted a little more than most and when faith was not enough, flight had to do (as in fleeing prosecution for a growing laundry list of civil & criminal charges). This man is no prophet. His tone condescends even from the written pages of this book from his lofty immaginary place. A simple Google search will tell you more about him than just one reviewer.

Susan Friedman has created a set of simple and direct Qi Gong exercises that I could learn quickly and actually do. The video gets directly to the routine without any preliminary explanations. The exercises are easily followed and can be completed in about 15-20 minutes. It might be helpful to have some previous knowledge of Qi Gong, and I do have that, but it isn't essential. The only other Qi Gong video that comes even close to this one in clarity and accessibility is Eight Simple Qigong Exercises For Health - The Eight (8) Pieces of Brocade, done by Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming. My next purchase will be Friedman's book Heal Yourself With Qigong: Gentle Practices to Increase Energy, Restore Health, and Relax the Mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"we've needed this for years....","review":"As a counselor who has ran quite a few groups for male perpetrators of violence, I heartily recommend the wisdom of Wexler's course.

The amazing vocals of Chris Wood tear through your eardrums with his insane ability to reach both high and low ends and everywhere in between. They made a few changes since the last album as far as members. Their new bassist and drummer work together as well as beans go with tortillas, or as chips go with hot, spicy salsa and the lucious jalapenos diced within. This record is HOT!!! Hot like a Hot tamale, or Hot Butt (you know that burning). The tapping technique that the bassist uses in a few of the songs is one that I would like to hear more often. The beats of the drummer are some of the best beats I have ever hear, this album is just amazing. I cannot say enough good about this album, this band has really progressed. Definitely pick this one up if you love the sweet mix of metal and hardcore. xDIONx"},{"rating":"1","title":"not helpful, at all...","review":"We bought these for our very standard kitchen cabinets, and they do not work.

Then I bought a Russound speaker box and the pins were too large for it.First of all, these are great. Second, buy one pair and make sure they fit whatever you are going to try them in. These are built well -- I would have given them 5 stars except I had one of 8 break during crimping.It's a great design, and well-manufactured and works great with Monster Cable -- however, you need to make sure it will fit in your clips before committing to them.

It's mind-blowingly erotic and yet the main character, Greta, remains kind of innocent. I also liked that it is a real novel with a real story and you get to know Greta as she struggles to find success as an actress. Does pony girl racing really exist?

This is only the second review I've written but I was so mislead by the other reviews that I thought I should write. Greta has no problem following a strange dirty man into a filthy attic to please him with her mouth but balks at construction workers catcalling wondering if they thought that would get them anywhere with women. Well, it only took Dirty Bill telling her to follow him for her to do so. I understand submissives wanting to please a dominant but that's not what was going on in this book.

John Huling's album was playing inside the exhibit. I was so drawn into the exhibit by the music, I had to have it. Listen to Jelly Music and imagine all sorts of jellies, both large and small, floating (and some of them GLOWING) slowly through the water pulsing with colors and light. A great selection of synthesized music, John Huling truly captures the beauty and mystery of the jellies along with the essence of the ocean in which they live.

A bad guy does a very bad thing and gets away with it on ingenuity and pure dumb - and I mean dumb - luck. The protagonist is a creep of the highest order and does not deserve our sympathy. It is neither fun nor interesting to root for him, especially after he commits his crime and the true silliness of the plot takes over.

He combines history with the paranormal to form a story that captures and holds the reader's attention"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheeky thriller that spans two centuried","review":"Fires of Eden gain points for sheer nerve. There's a story about awful things happening at a tropical resort, and it seems awfully familiar- although I was pleased that a goodly number of characters survive the carnage, instead of the one or two who usually live to see the dawn in stories like this. But at the heart of the novel is a journal which recounts a rousing adventure in which one of the main characters is Mr. Samuel Clemens. Ever since \\"Ragtime\\" came out in the 70's writers have felt free to have characters from history come into their novels and do their bidding. Mr. Clemens is a very believable character, and the adventures he has a century before the comtemporary action of \\"Fires of Eden\\" are, as a reviewer of his day might have said, a ripping yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research, good storytelling.","review":"While this story is certainly well crafted, and is the best modernized version of Hawaiian myth I've ever read, its ending is awfully formulaic for a writer who's created such masterpieces in the past.Simmons does prove here that he can tell a \\"double story\\" as well as anyone, skipping back and forth between the present and the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for external lighting","review":"hooked up a couple led lasers and ccfl tubes outside case works greatwould recommend it to everyone ok ok"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is This?","review":"Nobody can sing Roy Orbison songs except Roy Orbison.

Some information was incorrect or maybe geared more towards peak travel periods as we went after labor day and a lot of the opening/closing times of buildings were incorrect. One exampe, the book suggests getting up very early to reserve tickets for the Jefferson Monument, we decided to take our chances instead of getting up very early in the morning as the book suggested.

He is showing himself as an awesome musician, singer and writer. All 12 tracks were all either written by him, or he had some hand in it one way or another. His vocals are so clear and he can really belt out those high notes. The only fault with the production is that he does need some heavier back up singers, there is some, but its just not enough to help. Once again this is another production from \\"Boy band Heaven\\" Orlando, Florida. But he is far from typical. This cd has quite the sound for a debut. I WANT YOU TONIGHT has powerful words behind the vocals. FOREVER FRIEND has a thoughtful sound to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd I own!!","review":"I thought I was the only one who heard of him, but I see from all these positive reviews that I'm not the only major fan.

Since her debut album \\"First Love\\" she has managed to stay on top of the expanding pop music scene in Japan.

This is a valuable asset in understanding what makes Utada Hikaru such a powerful player in Japanese music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely excited","review":"I am extremely excited about this CD, because it has ALL of Utada Hikaru's best songs on here.Final Distance is the amazing version of the original song, Distance, also by her. If you ever get a chance to see the video for Budokan 5 with her, Traveling is just an awesome song. Hikari is, of course, the intro song to the PS2 game, Kingdom Hearts. Can You Keep a Secret, Wait and See, Automatic... so many great songs.If you are a new fan to Utada Hikaru, I strongly suggest this CD. You will not find a better mix of her songs, in my opinion.I agree that Ayumi Hamasaki is a great artist, but I find Utada Hikaru's songs have a stronger and deeper feeling to them because of the difference in voices. Ayumi Hamasaki did the intro to the PS1 game, Thousand Arms, with the song 'Depend on You', as well as the ending if you ever recall playing and don't remember who she is, so you can get an idea of the difference if you've played that and Kingdom Hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Collection To Own","review":"I've always been a big fan of the great Utada-san, and when her best album was released, I was estatic anf bought my own copy right away! And so far...I have not regretted it since!Owning all her works from the innocent days of \\"First Love\\" to the heart-wreching reality of \\"Deep River\\" is absolutely amazing. As a fan, I'm really honored to own this album. Just to hear that innocent fifteen-year old girl grow into an incredible musican is one of the greatest pleasures when you're a fan.Personally, I really love how she brings out the flair of her old style and mixes it in with her new music. It's like she's blending some secret recipe--in this case, music--that made her into the wonderful singer she is today! Not many artists are capable of that feat. But Utada is one of the few singers that manages to impact your heart. It's like her listerners can actually feel the mood within the song because she delivers it so beautifully.Overall, a good add into your Utada collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book.....","review":"I'm only about half way through this book but its the best thing I've read in quite some time.

There are a few good songs: Sentinel, Beyond the Realms of Death, Seeler, and Desert Plains. Some other songs, were simply an embarrassment. The vocalist's attempt to hit the high note in \\"The Ripper,\\" is nothing more than ridiculous. The guitar solo in the beginning of \\"Metal Meltdown\\" was omitted. The worst song, is probably \\"Electric Eye,\\" performed by \\"Scary German Guy.\\" Not only was the \\"Hellion\\" left out, but the singing sucked, and the guitar solo was HORRIBLY butchered.

Looks like he got his ideas by making cut-ups of \\"The Hot Zone.\\"And, of course, there's lemurs.

Unless you are a professional and are able to sort through the exercises to determine which are safe and which are not, I would look elsewhere for advice on stretching and/or yoga.However, if you are trained in biomechanics or movement this could be a good reference for ideas for partner classes, workshops or demonstrations (but you will have to know what to leave out).

I'm a yoga instructor and photographer and have to say that this book fails at both.

There are just a few poses for two. Seventy five is also a huge number for the amount of poses and adjustments shown here, it is very repetitive. The photos in the book are not that good either. It is very hard to really enjoy any of the images since they have way too little contrast and look mostly gray all over. I've been trying to find a good book on yoga for partners and still haven't been successful at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"This is a great book to get anyone excited about the possibilities of partner yoga.

Initially I had a small coolant leak from the heater hose going into the head that managed to spray coolant over the entire engine. I replaced the heater hose, but the car began to overheat. I replaced the thermostat and had the system flushed, but it still overheated. So, I bought this to eliminate a potential head gasket problem or cracked block etc. I was surprised to see that there were no exhaust gases in my coolant system (the indicator read negative). As a cheap step (before I replaced the water pump) I replaced the radiator cap and the overheating problem went away.

My issue was that with the single chamber when the coolant level rose in the radiator the test liquid would become contaminated with coolant, giving a false positive. (Yellow coolant plus blue liquid, gives green color) The two chamber design eliminated this problem for me, also I found the hand pump simpler to use than hooking up a line to the intake manifold or other vacuum source.

I am pleased that John Saul has cleaned up the supernatural element in this latest action/suspense story. However the characters need more development, we also need another bit of drama going on in the sidelines. Double plotting is a great literary gimmick when the author is presenting something not terribly innovative, usually another derivative novel about crime and ugliness. Neil Gaiman certainly presents a more interesting novel about the homeless in \\"Neverwhere\\" And we get the best poetical immersion experience concerning the plight of the unwanted in James Herbert's \\"The Others.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mahatten Hunt Club","review":"While the plot was terrific, and the story itself, very readable, the fact that the main characters, all found the correct person to relate to ,in the tunnels,(that we were told were teaming with thousands of homeless people,) was so improbable it spoiled the book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of excitement","review":"When Jeff Converse and Jagged are being transported to Riker Island, their bus is intentionally wrecked and burned. They escape to the underground of the city...the subway tunnels of New York. There they are hunted like a sporting game by the Manhattan Hunt Club. An excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survivalist Writing Gets a New Name","review":"John Saul's novel The Manhattan Hunt Club is an intriguing piece that places it's mark among Survivalist Writings. In it Jeff Converse, a college student, is convicted of a murder he did not commit. However, things take a turn for the worse (yes, it can get worse) when he is kidnapped during a routine prison transfer, and placed in the subway system of underground Manhattan.During which, he is a pawn in a game of survival, when \\"hunters\\" are stalking him like game. Jeff Converse, with the help of a sexually frustrated serial killer named \\"Jagger\\", must fight for survival, and freedom.This has been my first read of John Saul, and even though I thought his writing was not extraordinary, found myself intrigued by his work. I think the works of David Morrell or \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\" do a better job of what I call \\"Survivalist Fiction\\", I do think this piece ranks up there with very good survivalist writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best by a Long Shot","review":"I like some of John Saul's work, but I thought THE MANHATTAN HUNT CLUB was a pretty mediocre effort.The concept of this novel (people living in the tunnels underneath the New York Subway) is potentially interesting, but Saul invests little effort in creating believable characters or a realistic plot. In particular, I found the identity of the villains to be ridiculous. The overall silliness of this book made it hard for me to enjoy.In short, THE MANHATTAN HUNT CLUB is pretty lackluster. My advice is to try some of Saul's better known work, such as SUFFER THE CHILDREN or THE GOD PROJECT. Those novels are more exciting, and have much stronger plots and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook specific comments","review":"If, like me, you appreciate a great reading of a great book as you drive to and from work or pass time on a trip, stay away from the Brilliance Audio version of this book, read by David Daoust. To quote Simon Cowell, \\"It is a complete and utter mess!\\" The storyline itself is \\"okay\\", but Daoust's reading is horrific! The phrasing is all wrong, there is no emotion, the characterized voices are just plain STUPID, and it all seems as if Mr Daoust is reading the book for the first time as he commits it to tape! Unbelievable that an author would allow the marketing of such a terrible reading of his material. Obviously, Mr Saul doesn't care. If he did, he would have every copy of this recording yanked off of the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manhattan Hunt Club","review":"Mr Saul is one of the best writers!

Maybe the next book will be better... i hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes galore","review":"As someone who is interested in the underground and people who supposedly live beneath the surface, I was eager to pick up this book, but I had to stop reading after a dozen pages. Not only is the writing style distractingly dumbed down, but the homeless are demonized in a way that reminded me of stereotypical racist literature. Like they are from another planet. Unfortunately something that seemed to be about an interesting subject deteriorated within the first few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just plain bad","review":"I thought that the premise of this story was pretty interesting. An original setting that could make for a great thriller as some man fights to survive in the tunnels under Manhattan while being hunted by ruthless corporate old money big wigs. But Saul just has to be about the worst writer in America today. I stuck with this tale just to see if Saul could wiggle his way out of a structural disaster that occurs when he gives about half the pages to a character (the father) that detracts and is un-needed. Saul manages to make it feel that this is the first draft we are reading. The ideas are not built up at all or lead into fruition except for the descriptions pertaining to depravity in a couple of his characters. This is perhaps the most half assed bit of piece meal cut and paste editing that I have ever come across. Very uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way Around it...This Book is Awful","review":"I actually like Saul's cookie-cutter, Stephen King styled every-book-is-the-same horror. Sure all the characters are the same in every book and the plots are insanely predictable, but they were enjoyable.I was expecting this book to be the same. This is the kind of tale I would have conceived of when I was thirteen. I couldn't even finish it. All the characters are wooden and so horrible you don't even care if they live or die. And the whole \\"everyone you think is good is really evil and everyone you think is evil (felons, drug-addled homeless people) are actually good, just misunderstood plot in the book is so contrived and overdone. *Yawn* I actually think that he ended up making Jagger crazy because someone finally said to him, \\"You know John, not everyone in prison is innocent,\\" to which he probably replied, \\"Fine! I'll make the gay guy a crazed murderer. Happy?\\"Overall very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jean-Claude Van Damme was more convincing","review":"You know, I like these storylines much better when they were movies!I betrayed my long standing rule of John Saul only in emergency, on the basis of some good reviews. Unfortunately, what I found was the illbegotten offspring of a half way decent Jean-Claude Van Damme movie (hard target) and the sublime Silence of the Lambs.The storyline was not original, the characters were pat and cliched, the writing made my teeth squeak. Unless you are a solid John Saul Fan - avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Saul","review":"A young man has been convicted of murdering a woman in the subway.

He imagines that he has escaped, but finds himself trapped in a game in which he is anything but free.The story itself is interesting, but fairly reminiscent of something else I've read (maybe the Most Dangerous Game??). Anyway, if you're a Sau fan or not, you should enjoy this twisted tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should be thrilling but it's not...","review":"In \\"The Manhattan Hunt Club\\" John Saul takes a premise that has been done a few times (people hunting people) and moves it to a new location. Jeff converse has been falsely accused of murder and, after his death has been faked, becomes the prey for human hunters in the maze of subway tunnels and sewer system beneath the city of Manhattan.Unfortunately, a good premise does not a good book make. Saul never manages to pull \\"The Manhattan Hunt Club\\" above mediocrity. His characters aren't particularly interesting and, for such an exciting concept, the novel moves at a snails pace. These problems are rounded off with suspension-of-belief breaking coincidences. Somehow Saul has managed to fail to deliver intensity from a premise that almost exudes it naturally.\\"The Manhattan Hunt Club\\" has made for TV movie written all over it.

While I am generally a fan of John Saul's-- I realize he's no Shakespeare, but I read everything he releases-- I was least impressed with this novel. While it was well-written, I felt the plot too closely mirrored other, older, BETTER works of a similar theme, not the least of which being \\"The Running Man\\" by horror master Stephen King.

By the time 2000 came and I hadn't heard anything about her making another song I knew she'd bitten the dust. I guess the album didn't sell well and she was dropped. I have to make some excuse because for her to just drop off the planet makes no sense. I haven't heard anything about her in magazines or the news. It's a mystery.

Roslyn Carrington writes about there joy & pain in such a beautiful language you will simply not be able to put this book down.

Despite the artist name on this CD, the Daevid Allen Trio, it was actually a very early formation of the Soft Machine. Pretty much for the true die-hards and completists. Sound quality isn't very good, but semi-listenable IF you take the time (like I did). Cuts here I thought were so-so include \\"Love Is A Careless Sea\\" and their epic - the ten minute folk-ish \\"Dear Old Benny Is A-Turning In His Grave\\". For the record, I've heard better sounding bootlegs. Enter at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLDER DVD BUT I LOVE IT","review":"My daughter had the complete set and we started when she was in Kinder with vol.1 and now she is in 5th grade reading on a 10th grade level.

The music is not challenging, which is to say it's a good place to start if you're interested in exploring the ambient world. I heard some of this CD on the Public Radio show \\"Music from the Hearts of Space\\", and was quite taken with it, even though my background is, shall we say, rather \\"square\\" -- I live on Bach and English church music.The cut that first got my attention was \\"Point of Safety\\". It was intriguing enough to get me to buy the CD. Since then, I have obtained several others, mostly by Roach (if you like this one, I'd suggest \\"Quiet Music\\" and the relatively new \\"Midnight Moon\\"). Since this recording is a collaboration with other artists, you get more than just Roach. I haven't been able to assimilate some of the other artists as easily as I have Roach's music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could do More","review":"I like the individual chapters in this book that explain arguments in very clear ways. What I don't like are the choices of readings in the back.

He is a very small dog (5 lbs) and his urine leaked through these pads. They are pretty small but that is ok but I have used many pads and I rarely have issues with any leaking especially under the plastic. I would not recommend these to anyone really because they are too this and have nothing to absorb even a small dogs urine. I love my dog but that doesn't mean I want to be cleaning up the tile when he pees in the right spot!

There is just way too much material out there relating the story of America's royalty. I thought I would read this short book to get greater insight into the Kennedy family and the book holds up. Not only is it concise, but it is packed with information both on the family and President Kennedy. Also, I feel it is very balanced in showing both the weaknesses and strenghts of this President and his family. It is probably one of the better short biographies of this President.I recommend this book to anyone wanting a snapshot of this President. As with all short books, it doesn't delve into great detail about JFK and his family. However it serves up enough of the dirt about the family and JFK. Such dirt as the adulteries of both Joe Senior (Gloria Swanson) and Jack (Marilyn Monroe, and many others). It also shows the family and JFKs strength. A nice portrait of the family and JFK."},{"rating":"1","title":"For people who have $$$ to burn","review":"For the rich, and uneducated person who believes that somehow Monster cable has magic wires, and therefore will pay 4 times the amount that they should cost!

He said the 8 - way splitter degraded the signal. He said HBO uses a different frequency and the 8 - way splitter degraded the signal to the point where I couldn't pick up HBO channels.

Among my favorites are \\"El Sol\\", \\"Of a Broken Heart\\", \\"Desire\\", and \\"Jesus I / Mary Star of the Sea\\". The guitars and drumming throughout the album are simply amazing. If you are a person that is sick and tired of all the new/garbage music, I urge you to buy this CD. Trust me, you will be happy you did! The CD won't be leaving my player anytime soon.Billy Ogle"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly","review":"I am a huge fan of the Smashing Pumpkins. This cd is a little bit different from the Smashing Pumpkins. It has the sound of Machina but only fresher. Billy Corgan's vocals are still as good as they've ever been and with Dave Pajo, Matt Sweeney, Jimmy Chamberlain, and the beautiful Paz Lenchantin to back him up, it makes the perfect combination. If you liked the Smashing Pumpkins will definitely want to own this album. I'm looking forward to see them in concert. Oh and some people think that this is a religious album, it's not, the religious things in the album are metaphors that Billy uses in his lyrics. Just because he says Jesus in a song doesn't make it a religious song. If you want religious songs listen to P.O.D. or Creed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy is back","review":"After hearing the new Zwan record I can't help but feel a bit of excitement knowing that, once again, Billy Corgan and a new batch of talented musicians are back on the scene creating music that rocks outside the box. In a world of nu-metal, Ppearl Jam [takes], and nu-grunge it's refreshing to hear a voice from the recent past bringing a cool new blend of rock energy. The album, although not as pleasing to the ear as the smashing pumpkins, proves to be some very good music! I recomend this cd to anyone who appreciates creativity in their rock! Thank God Jimmy is back on drums again as well~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy's 2003 Comeback Kid!","review":"The album was just fantastic. Guitar heavy, wonderful back up vocals courtesy of Ms. Lenchantin and the signature Corgan lyrics make Mary Star Of The Sea a remarkable achievement. The DVD is filled with great Behind-The-Zwan footage. Each song on the album shines even the 14 minute Jesus I/Mary Star Of The Sea, despite its ludicrous length it never lets down. The album takes you back to the late 1980's where Corgan left off before entering the wacky world of The Smashing Pumpkins. Run to buy this album or order right off Amazon.com, you won't regret this happiness mind-job from the best new band around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Rock Ring","review":"Thanks to Zwan, I am feeling excited and renewed again with music. Fresh, new, with stellar loops, old-style solos resurrected and spiced, this album rejuvenates the soul. Biased as we Corgan fans are, the new band truly creates an original, euphonic sound by mixing all the right ingredients: meaningful, memorable lyrics, tight guitar intricacies, heart-thumping drum beats. The music on this album brings a much needed light to the cookie-cutter music scene we are exposed to so frequently on the radio... and echoes with a fate accepted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of sunshine...","review":"Happy rock. We can't always be dark and brooding, can we? I love the feel of this whole album...Zwan is definitely not the Smashing Pumpkins, though. As great as they were, it is an era that has seen its time. Corgan is moving on and evolving his sound into something that is sure to have far reaching appeal. This is perhaps the most rewarding aspect of this album - experiencing another level of Corgan. I love watching artists grow and change...IT'S A GOOD THING! Definitely recommend picking this one up. Throw it in on a cloudy day while you're driving with the windows down...bring in a little bit of sunshine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No, this is not the pumpkins!","review":"Billy Corgan's second major band is definately quality all around. I've heard people saying that they sound like the pumpkins, and I'd just like to say I disagree. The thing is that Billy has a fairly unique voice and you could say that anything he did with distorted guitars sounded like the pumpkins.But as far as the actual album goes, all I can say is listen to the demo tracks. There is a decent range of musical styles here and they are all done well. Oh, and anyone who's a fan of Paz Lenchantin are in for a treat as her backing vocals are all over the album. Also, it seems like Jimmy was allowed to kinda go nuts on some songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Bottom line, Billy Corgan and crew are riding the wave. He's still able to write some music, get it recorded, and people will buy it. Oh, and it also gets played on the radio and the various video TV station thingies. I like it, and it's worth owning if you're into that kind of music and if you were into the Smashing Pumpkins. End of review.It cracks me up when people try to write a Rolling Stone type review.

The lyrics are deep, which is a plus as it is, with some of the music out today. Still the same amazing vocals from the smashing pumpkins. The sound is a light rock, a lot more upbeat then the SP. Great music to listen to for any mood, anywhere. I give this an A+!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"While I was among the SP fans that were shocked at the release of MACHINA, and even moreso when the band called it quits soon after, I didn't give up hope. I had faith in this new project called ZWAN. However, Mary Star of the Sea did little to soothe my little heart.With this project, Billy Corgan seems to be attempting to claim the radio mainstream with songs that are nothing but faint echoes of what the Smashing Pumpkins were at their best. Despite Billy's hallmark vocals, the album, overall, lacks fire and heart. You'll catch wisps of old school Pumpkins sound, it's distorted and somewhat dulled...not at all what I expected from this master songwriter.I'm disappointed, and the album will probably collect dust somewhere in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pisces Iscariot 2?","review":"How utterly disapointing.

I was pretty excited about this project when I heard that Matt Sweeny of the incredible (although short-lived) band CHAVEZ and Paz Lenchantin of A PERFECT CIRCLE were involved, too bad the whole thing sounds like a Billy Corgan solo album. This disc isn't a complete mess, Jimmy Chamberlain's drumming is always a treat and all involved are great artists. The biggest problem is Corgan, who has yet to record anything superior to SIAMESE DREAM, which would be an even better record if everything he's done since didn't sound the same. A very plain disc that goes just beyond boring. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZWHAT????","review":"Okay, sadly enough, grunge IS dead. Hell yeah, it was short lived, but it spawned some incredible bands and if the Smashing Pumpkins weren't a good enough alternative rock band for Billy Corgan to exist in, then i say let it go cause nothing will ever top their ultimate album: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. The new stuff is similar given that the man's voice cannot be mistaken for anyone else, which is what made the pumpkins so unique and great, i think. Fans will like it for that, but the feel is different. I would've rather corgan to have never sang again without his true bandmates than this. Maybe i'm just bitter. Mayonnaise."},{"rating":"1","title":"bomb","review":"The cd is horrible, no wonder the music industry is in trouble. If that's not enough they include one of the worst DVD's ever produced. I was looking forward to this, but it's going on the back shelf...save your hard earned money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!","review":"Face it...99% of you are looking at this album cause you loved The Smashing Pumpkins and Billy Corgan. Yes it may be an all star cast of performers, but Corgan is the man which makes this tick. The cd is full of the touches left on all of Corgan's music. Some of the songs are great. Some are just good. Yes, track 13 is incredibly long and tedious, but it isn't entirely a bad song. I love the slower \\"Desire\\"...my favorite on the album. The other standouts are the quicker paced \\"Settle Down\\", the poppy \\"El Sol\\", the beautiful sadness in \\"Of A Broken Heart\\", the harmonica filled \\"Come With Me\\", and of course the new single \\"Honestly\\". I really like when Paz (the female bassist) sings along with Corgan on many of the tracks. It creates a nice vocal balance, not heard with the pumpkins. If you liked the Pumpkins...definately buy this cd. If you like good music and not most of the stuff you hear on MTV and modern rock radio...buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Boring, plain and simple snore CD","review":"This is a bunch of \\"Same-Sounding\\" crap. I can hardly tell the difference in the songs. Sounds more like a seriously watered down pumpkins album. Corgan needs a new sound, this album is just plain boring. I'm sure I'll catch some heat from avid \\"Billy\\" fans, but I am just being honest in saving people some $$$. You should either copy this CD or download it first before you buy. I seriously recomend you take this advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Resurrection?","review":"It's tough to tell if this is vintage Pumpkins or something else. It is easy to tell that this is a major debut, one that will make an impression on radio, television, tour venues, etc. The sounds are rich and harsh, a la the first Pumpkins album Gish, but the meldoeis have some of the more austere pairings of the later Pumpkins albums. The most interesting songs have a nearly indy-rock sound--Settle Down, Declarations of Faith, and El Sol--possibly pointing to the influence of Paz from A Perfect Circle, Dave Paho of Slint, and Matt Sweeney of Chavez. It also doesn't lack from the power and allure of Jimmy Chamberlain's drums or Billy's terrific guitar work. Overall, a distilled mix of what made music great in the '90's. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!","review":"I'm not as analytical I'd like to be but let me just mention that this is a great album. Billy has always been one to exceed my expectations and beat the adversary criticism that he's slapped with, and this record is yet another bold and at the same time, honest statement. Every song seems to sink in deeper with every listen and you just have to love it. Every song is a big favorite of mine and it would be harsh to point out a single one so I won't. Any tSP fan will love this album and if you like good music you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn*","review":"Well, the smashing pumpkins were indeed one of the great rock bands of the 90s. Unfortunately they kept growing steadily worse ever since Mellon Collie, hitting their ultimate low at Machina:the machines of god.Luckily, this album doesnt sound like the oh-so-plastic Machina, and it does indeed appear that Billy has returned a bit to his roots, what he does best..It all starts out pretty promising, but as I was listening to this album I found myself extremely bored. Where the heck are the catchy hooks?Despite Billy\`s characteristic guitar strummings and Chamberlains heavy...drumming, this somehow just seems WRONG.Now, this is by no means a BAD album. It\`s just oh so mediocre.I am sure you hardcore Corgan-worshippers out there will want to pick this up, but for the rest of us this is just another album that will get dusty on our CD-rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zwan Review!","review":"Whats one thing better than another Smashing Pumpkins Album? The new Zwan album! Billy Corgan's vocal's skills get better with ever album he puts out, and this album perfectly shows his singing strength and talent! This CD diplays a little differnt musical style than the Smashing Pumpkins, but still is an enjoyable rock experience! If you like the band Smashing Pumpkins, or even if you dont, you should definitly check out this band! From one music addict to another, i give this album 5 out of 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HappyZwan","review":"The highly talented Billy Corgan returns with a new band, and theyu call themselves Zwan. While the CD is nothing compared to the rage of early Pumpkins or the experimental band toward the late 90's, this CD is nontheless a more uplifting than most of the dark melancholy of past Smashing Pumpkins CDs.Generally, Corgan's vocal powress still shines admist the 14 song-set here and the music is alt-rock-pop. Lyric, Honestly and Endless Summer are the few classic alt-rock tracks while Of A Broken Heart is a gorgeous ballad with its heartfelt ernesty.The only flaw here is the overly long title track which could have benefitted with a snip or replaced by several other tracks they performed on tour but not released. Overall, Corgan and friends don't deviate far from his ex-Pumpkins yearning but the CD is still nonetheless filled with rich melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"An orgy of self-pity.","review":"This combat memoir is amazing. Most young soldiers find themselves disillusioned after their baptism of fire, but return with a new maturity. Not so George Lince. This veteran has merely catalogued a vast array of bitches, gripes and moans about his WWII experiences: his buddies were dishonest and lazy, his gear was antiquated and, yes, the food was terrible. Even worse, his father was unsympathetic and his girlfriend left him. This is not a case of combat angst; this is common whining, a display of self-pity carefully nurtured for fifty years. Even worse, the book is padded with long passages from other (and better) books. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"This book tries to teach piano the way rock and folk guitar is often learned: it tells you to form chords by putting your hands in certain positions, giving short shrift to the principles of chord construction and voicing and virtually ignoring the principles of voice-leading. The inevitable result is a confused and unmusical pianist. For adults and older children I use John Thompson's MODERN COURSE FOR PIANO.

Facts by pure numbers do not necessarily establish accuracy. Inaccuracies do detract from credibility. To say that the book was 50% accurate is enough to tell me that I need to find another book to use for my research. Almost accurate only counts in darts and horseshoes. If I back check the authors sources and find a single source that does not match, the entire work (as well as the author) is called into question. I may as well do all of the research myself, in which case why do I need this book at all? And if the journalists did not want you to notice that the U.S. government supported X, they simply will not write it. There are enough criticizers of the government within the media.

Then he repeats it several different ways for good measure.Give me a break.There is no redeeming value contained in this utter work of fiction. It's amazing how far someone can go by mingling a few truths with utter nonsense. If the author had just come right out and admitted his feelings about America, no one would have taken him seriously.

I knew a seated walker would be just the thing. I can walk and then sit when necessary. The only drawback to this particular walker is the back rest. It does not go in and lock properly and is stubborn about being removed. So there is a great deal of yanking which for someone with arthritis in their hands and arms would be difficult to manage on their own. Otherwise I have been very pleased with it. Light weight and portable, it easily fits in the back of my compact car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong style for razor ordered","review":"This is shown as the refill for the tiny moustache razor, wrong...., not the right ones, now I have to return and find the right ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, effective, but you can do better","review":"The blades are inexpensive, work well and they do last for a few shaves. They were the first ones I tried, and I actually have a Merkur razor so I thought they'd work well together. However, after trying the Derby Extra's, I have to say that those are much better blades. As always your mileage may vary. I would recommend getting less than a 3 pack and just giving them a try if you really want to test them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single Blades","review":"Being a man of color I rely on the single blade razors.

If you buy a Merkur Razor, this is possibly the worst choice in a blade. They are incredibly expensive, dull quickly, and provide a rather rough shave.If you are using a Merkur blade as your first DE blade, maybe you think it's great, but there are so many better choices that are a fraction of the cost.Please get a sampler pack of blades when you get your first DE razor. Derby, Gillette 7 O'Clock, Israeli Personna, and even Wal-Mart blades are a much better choice. These are terrible. I buy my favorite blade (Israeli Personna) for about 10 cents a blade with shipping. Derbys are pretty good too, at about 13 cents a blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never will I buy these again!","review":"When I purchased my first Safety Razor, I bought a pack of these from Art of Shaving thinking that they were the best. I then used them for YEARS thinking this exact same thing. The amount of money that I wasted is horrifying. The time that I spent trying to get a good shave from Merkur blades is incalculable.I bought the Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades and could not be happier! And the best part... $8 for 100. Yes, $8 for 100 blades. Add to that the amazing shave, and you have yourself a true bargain!In case you are wondering, I use Olive Oil as a shave oil, then lather using Jack Black Supreme Cream. It is a bit of Shaving Bliss! I have even gone to shaving once a day!Don't Buy Merkur!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Tried these blades because it came with the Merkur razor that I bought. I've been using a Parker with Shark and Feather blades. The Merkur blade felt like I was dragging a brick across my face. Not a good experience at all. I would rank it behind Derby. Well behind Derby. They may work well for some, but I won't be using them. The razor itself is good, but not the blade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"My first double edged shaving set came with these blades, and they were satisfactory.I recently tried another brand(Gillette 7 oclock) and was surprised at how much better they were.The Merkur blades work just fine, but for the same price you can do much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merkur double edge blades","review":"After 40 years of shaving the quick way I decided to try it the way my dad did it. Much more challenging and fun. Turns a chore into an experience. The Merkur blades (to match the Merkur Futur DE Razor) work extremely well. Not a single nick and not bad for a novice. Great shave. That is in comparison to the Feather blades (made in Japan) that I felt compelled to try because almost everyone acknowledges they are extremely sharp. It is true that they are much sharper and the shave is incredibly smooth. But I did cut my myself in about ten places without knowing it. Too much for me to handle without more practice. Go with the Merkur blades, platinum coated made in Germany. Buy an expensive razor and have fun shaving."},{"rating":"1","title":"How are these ranked so high?","review":"I decided to try the Merkur blades that came with my wonderful Merkur Slant. I was quite surprised when they were some of the worst blades that I've ever used. They were so bad in fact, that I threw them away mid-shave and switched to an Astra Platinum to finish the shave without issue.These blades seem to caused a large amount of razor drag despite being in a very aggressive razor which lead to irritation post-shave. I feel like they are quite dull and in the bottom quarter of the 30 some odd razor brands that I've tried. Needless to say, I'm quite disappointed since I'm quite impressed by the quality of Merkur's other products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sharp as before?","review":"Got these 3 packs of Merkur razor blades from DERazorblades. The Merkur blades I've had before were very sharp. These were surprisingly dull, even from the first use. Maybe they were old, or knock-offs. I emailed the vendor but never got a reply back, called the customer service number, but all you get is an answering machine with somebody's name. Amazon's great customer service did give me a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best All-Around blade so far","review":"I've used a DE safety razor for about a year now, and the Merkur blades seem to be the best overall. For me, they seem to shave closer than the derby, and they hold their edge longer. They are not as sharp as the Feather blade, but I absolutely do not recommend the feather for the neophyte; it is much too sharp.In short, the Merkur blade provides a close, comfortable shave at a reasonable price. If you're new to DE shaving, I suggest you buy a sample pack with blades from multiple manufacturers.There's also a good website for DE blade users, [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll never go back!","review":"I'll never go back to those overpriced disposable razors again! These blades last so very long. Every man in America should switch to these. You will save heaps of cash and get the best shave yet!

As for the performance, it is like nothing else by any other conductor, or even other Furtwangler recordings. It is variously described as ferocious, cyclonic, volcanic, etc. In other words, not at all like the 1954 Philharmonia recording. But it still has all the familiar Furtwangler touches; the tempi varying in the same ways at the same spots. It is basically the standard Furtwangler interpretation circa 1951-1953, but more so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Pretty","review":"Let me get right to it.

This is one of the worst pieces of garbage I have ever listened to. When I opened the cover of the c.d. and saw his new band members, I knew that something seemed wrong. Then when I played it, I nearly puked. What the heck is George trying to prove by playing this rap-rock or whatever the hell people call it. I feel really sad about the whole thing too because I am a big fan of Dokken's and wished George would have stayed with the band and not allowed his ego to get in the way. Now I hear that he broke this band up and is trying to get the original Lynch Mob back together except for Mick of course.

The opening track is pretty good, but it all goes downhill after that. There is more rap than good guitar playing on this cd. George Lynch's playing used to make my hair stand on end, this cd just made my skin crawl. I had trouble just making it through one listen. There is nothing even close to previous Lynch Mob releases. Gone is the great tone, the inspired solos, and the straight forward, in your face, guitar oriented rock and roll. Rest in peace, Lynch Mob."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh wicked sensation....where art thou?","review":"If you are expecting this to sound like the Lynch Mob that we all know and love, then you will be sadly disappointed. There are about 4 songs on here that I think are listenable and only because they have a pretty good vibe and guitar solo. I see the direction that George was going in and it was brave to try something new and I will give him credit for trying to expand. Maybe if he had done all the songs in the same type of style he would have had a winner but some are as bad as the ones on the Dokken \\"Shadowlife\\" album.

Instead of doing what he does well, he put out some kind of rap or hip-hop to an already crowded market. Lynch Mob will never recover from this one. If you're looking for the sound you've come to expect from George in the past, I'd recommend you give Dokken's new CD, Erase the Slate a listen. As for George, maybe he can shed this mistake by going back to his old style with a solo album. I don't think folks will even consider anything with the name Lynch Mob on it in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Release Makes Me Vomit!!!","review":"Most of the other reviews on this page are ridiculous. I have been a George Lynch/Dokken fan for so many years, and let me tell you - I was extremely excited to see him put out a new CD. I ripped open the package, threw it in my player, and my jaw dropped to the floor. I sincerely thought that the wrong CD was placed in the case at the factory! He is an incredible guitar player that basically put his talent on the shelf for this one.This is a horrible attempt to captilize on the popularity of hardcore Rap music, and we all know that Rap rhymes with Crap, which thouroughly explains this CD. I returned it!!! Go get the new Dokken instead - sounds like Tooth and Nail era stuff - GREAT!!

Is he able to perform songs off the other albums when they go on tour?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should appeal only to the most hardcore Georgr Lynch fans!","review":"If you're looking for the melodic flavors of the previous Lynch Mob incarnations you're looking in the wrong place. In fact you'll hardly find any of the George Lynch trademark guitar sound, or style here.What you will find is a stale collection of bad attempts to be innovative and ground breaking. Every track is reminiscent of something that has already been done to death! Can you say Korn, Snoop Doggy Dog, Tool, Stabbing Westward, Living Color, etc... There's nothing new here folks.I am George Lynch's biggest fan. He is one of my all-time favorite guitarists, but this album is very disappointing. Especially, the tinny drum mix. It sounds as if the drummer were playing on a kit he bought from the J.C. Penny Christmas catalog.Don't do it! If you're a big fan of the former Lynch Mob, Dokken, or George's solo album...

Even though Marty was not my favorite, I feel he can do better than this. Musically, his band is not really tight. I feel there is one really good musician and the others could be replaced.

When I first picked it up I felt that the bristles were a little rough.

Though, my cats did rub against it a little after examining the product after they \\"used\\" it I saw that basically no hair had caught on to it.I could easily make something a little rough with catnip on it for my cats to rub their head against.Not worth almost 20 dollars.

But a week after having it my wife called on my land line and said she was calling and calling but I wasn't picking up my cell. I checked, and it had no indication of any calls. I tried calling out and it wouldn't dial. It was frozen... sort of. So I thought, maybe it needed a reset. I powered down, powered up, and it worked fine the rest of the day. Okay, it was a fluke. But then it did the same thing the next day, then the next.

After about a year, it became very difficult to hear callers as they spoke and as time progressed, it just got worse. After having the phone for two years, I went against my better judgment and bought another Motorola phone--the KRZR.I loved the compactness, the V-Cast features (which turned out not to be worth it--talk about slow web surfing!!), and the deep red color of the model I chose. However, now, again after one year, the phone is LOSING ITS ABILITY TO AUDIBLY RING. It sometimes rings aloud but most often I have to keep it in my HAND so I can feel the vibration if someone calls. Why don't I keep it in my pocket? Because the vibration is SO WEAK, you miss it. Even when it was fully functional, the phone vibrates so weakly, you can't feel it in your pocket. I'd strongly recommend skipping this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality","review":"This phone was terrible from the start.

I was a little disappointed initially with the sound quality when not using the speakerphone. But since then it either started working good or I got adjusted to the quality ;-). One other complaint I have is that you have to open the phone to use the speaker phone. But once you get used to opening the phone with one hand it wont be such a problem any more. When you open the phone and place it on a flat surface (say when typing something or so) it wobbles because the camera protrudes from the rear. Once again this is a minor issue.I like using the QWERTY keyboard to enter my contacts and notes. The calendar allows you to enter events. I like this functionality a lot. You can assign shortcuts(4) to things that you do the most. Bluetooth functionality works well. The battery is really good (although most batteries tend to do good at the beginning).

The 2 megapix camera resolution plus autofocus feaature is fantastic.CONS: Video playback quality is a little coarse, but nothing that cant be overlooked.

It's always full of fingerprints which ruins the visual appeal of the glass face.

Also kinda heavy but I do like the speakerphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"sync software will wipe out contacts on your computer","review":"The phone is reasonably good, assuming you don't mind it crashing once or twice per day. If you need to sync with Microsoft Outlook, however, you need to buy software separately for about $40. It will take an hour or so to download. After a couple of syncs, you will find that a lot of information has been lost on your computer. The phone, for example, cannot deal with a contact that has just a business name and no person's name. First the contacts show up as headless zombies on the phone.

Nevertheless it is the first work I have had the good fortune to read that is unafraid to expose the underlying causes of the French Revolution, and to reveal something more than the popular characterizations of its leading actors.The sixteen women who are the focus of this account are true heroines, true martyrs of the Revolution. The author has done us a great service in providing non-fictionalized biographies of these Carmelite nuns - they represent sincere people from every walk in life who are determined to follow their consciences no matter what 'everyone else' may think and do.May their history inspire our compatriots to imitate their example, cost what it may."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is Sublime!","review":"Fiction often manages to embellish reality, the writers taking liberties that highlight the dramatic and obscure the imperfect. Ironically, Professor Bush's meticulous research of the Carmelite archives does the opposite. The facts he uncovers reveal the poverty of the fiction.The literary representations of the Carmelites' story were made to satisfy secular audiences. The fictitious Blanche de la Force, von le Fort's vacillating nun afraid to face her martyrdom, stressed the all-too-human perspective where personal drama eclipsed the supernatural calling of these nuns who moved God to act in history.Thus, Professor Bush succeeds where others have failed. He pierces the supernatural mystery of the Carmelites' martyrdom. He recounts how the nuns, moved by grace, took upon themselves a task so daring as to seem impossible: They intended to save France."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"I cannot recommend this item.

Once there she gets involved in a 'rumor' about her family and finds out her deceased mom and very much alive grandmother slept with the same guy and they made a movie about it: The Graduate! Now she becomes obsessed with finding this guy. She goes and finds him and a romance ensues (onces she's sure he's not her dad, I'll admit that part was kind of weird.) It goes on from there. I won't ruin the ending, but it was a bit anti-climatic. I can see why Jennifer Aniston is trying to disown this one, but it's a decent rental. It is better than some of the other romantic comedies Hollywood has been trying to shove down our throats lately, that's for sure. Give it a try!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumor Has It....","review":"I agree that Jennifer is not a very good actress. When there needs to be softness, she is still harsh, blunt, and to the point.

While a bit of both, it wasn't enough of either to give it the identity it needed. And that's a shame.Given the premise -- Anniston suspects she might be the love child of The Graduate's Ben Braddock -- this held a lot of potential. But once the jig was up, there was no place to go. We were left with under-developed characters and story lines that were shallow and incomplete. Opportunity lost.The likable Anniston has a few good turns and Costner delivers a solid performance, but even they couldn't fill-in the missing pieces. A-List stars and slick production alone do not a good movie make. At least not enough to fill 90 minutes or warrant a $10 ticket or $20 purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time with few laughs","review":"The critics did not like this film but the trailer looked goods so I rented it and it was bad the trailer shoed all the good stuff.

The film is very boring with a few laughs and has ok acting Shirley McLain is the only good part of the whole movie as she steals every scene she is in. I found Aniston whiney and COstner boring.

The Graduate was about a specific moment in American Social History, and a national zeitgeist that propelled it to the fore of American culture on the wings of Simon and Garfunkle's timeless score. None of those elements is present now, and as for how this movie stands on its own, ask a twentysomething."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Movie","review":"Thought I'd write this review to counter all the negative reviews. I really enjoyed the movie. Didn't generally care for the Mark Ruffalo character, but liked all the other participants. I think it was better for the Jennifer Anniston character to be concerned before her marriage, than to get married and to realize that it was a mistake. Really liked Costner's character.

Honestly--bet a solid 1/5 of the movie was skipped, skipping every few minutes. Never used to have such a problem except for exceptionally damaged DVDs.The good news is that, from what I did see, I didn't miss much. Don't want to provide spoiler, as if one could spoil such garbage, but -- and forewarned -- the central plot, esp when there is a hook up w/ Costner, takes a turn that is just downright gross.Beware and save your two bucks or whatever the cost has appropriately fallen down to.

She goes on a quest to find this man who she thinks is her father, and when he says he's not she promptly sleeps with him because he's so charming. So what do we learn from this, that grandmother, mother and daughter can have a hot fling with the same guy? Who writes this garbage? This is just asinine and incredibly sick. This makes no sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Jennifer...I'm disappointed in you!","review":"Hate to say this since I'm a huge Jennifer Aniston fan but didn't like this movie. I didn't buy the plot at all and thought it was uncomfortable watcing Aniston and Kostner together. The \\"original\\" movie, The Graduate, is so excellent making this one all the more disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"We watched this movie not knowing anything about it other than the write-up on the DVD case, and we found it to be an incredibly disappointing experience. Aniston seems to have taken a course in emoting one emotion--pensive confusion--and isn't at all believable as a character, especially when she sleeps with Costner's character. Ruffalo and MacLaine are pretty good, but playing characters they've played before, especially MacLaine. If you've seen her somewhat-crotchety grandmother-type role, then you've seen her in this, too. The script is simply strange--this is one of those stories that doesn't seem to be deserving of having a film made about it, as there's very little here that's compelling or even interesting. The back of the DVD says \\"The story is rumor. The laughs are real!\\" Interesting. . . we didn't find much to laugh about at all. Your life will not be missing anything if you pass on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy or Drama?","review":"The premise is great, finding out you are from the legendary family immortalized in the book and movie The Graduate. The actors are wonderful... Shirley Maclaine, Jennifer Aniston, Mark Ruffalo etc... all really good comedic actors. The director world famous. The movie was marketed as a romantic comedy. So what happened...where is the comedy? It's slow, cumbersome and doesn't seem to know in what direction it wants to go and definitley not funny. Shirley Maclaine's character is the only funny one in the film. It should have been marketed as a melodramatic comedy easy on the comedy. Rent it don't buy it, it's not worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumor has It","review":"DVD is for my Wife's birthday and will go well in her library of Kevin Costner movies. We saw it before and will no doubt enjoy it this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aniston wrecks it again. What little there was.","review":"With Jennifer Aniston, it always seems you know what's going to happen in a film. There's never a mystery of surprise in any movie I've seen her in. Terrible acting. Kevin Costner and Shirley MacLaine's parts weren't any funnier. I'll save you time here. THIS REVIEW NOT HELPFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rumor is true, this movie STINKS !!","review":"Yet another incident of poor film making from Hollywood. This trend is more the rule than the exception lately. Jennifer Aniston, though quite good at tv shows, fails to live up to anything remotley called acting on the big screen. She lacks presence and her rather seemingly boring personality in interviews finds it way when she acts too. She just doesn't have the \\" it \\" factor and I presume her future roles will be nothing too spectacular. The other actors were not so great either and for sake of brevity let me just mention than no one in this movie will walk away with an award from the prestigious academy of fine film acting. A sloppy , disheveled movie with little substance and little thought in the best ways to entertain a paying audience. It would be more reasonable to wait for this on video as there is this clever little invention called fast forwarding. Yes, there is some justice in the world. (:>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at All","review":"I knew this was a lackluster movie before I watched it, but I was desperate for HD DVD material. While it was not painfully bad, it was boring and superficial. Jennifer Aniston basically plays herself (or any of her other characters on TV/movies.) She is confused and not sure she wants to marry her fiance-snooze. If that was not enough, Aniston-in typical golddigger [...]fashion-sleeps with Kevin Costner. This is the man she suspected of being her father and she knew had slept with her grandmother! But because he is rich and powerful she jumps in the sack with him. The lone bright spot is the grandmother played by the great Shirley Maclaine, but even some of her lines seem forced and fall flat. The HD DVD version is crammed onto a single (15 GB) layer of the disc so the picture quality is only ok (the DVD version occupies the other layer). If you have absolutely nothing else to do then perhaps this is worth watching. But I recommend you find another diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected","review":"This is far funnier than the typical romance-comedy. Aniston plays her stereotypical female in crisis role. Costner and MacLaine added more laughs. You may know the plot but it's still so funny. I highly enjoyed this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shirley","review":"Interesting Story, but a typical airplane movie (which I where I saw it accidentaly). The acting is ok but not their best, and Reiner... well, let's say he will forever be a god for making Spinal Tap and When Harry Met Sally. This movie, how clever interwoven it is with The Graduate, didn't do anything.Extra star for Shirley MacLaine, she is great in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a sequel, but a great movie","review":"Some people say this is a sequel to The Graduate since it uses some of the same charactors. But it is not really a sequel since it was necessary to change the backstory so this film would work.In The Gradute Ben (Dustin Hoffman), gets seduced by Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) and then marries Elaine Robinson (Katherine Ross). In Rumor Has it the backstory has been changed so that the daughter didn't marry Ben's charactor, but marries the other guy instead. By changing the backstory like this it allows Mrs. Robinson's granddaugher Sarah (Jennifer Anniston) to sleep with Ben's charactor (Kevin Costner).If you are confused then don't worry, I still am. It is not easy to wrap your brain around two movies made almost 40 years apart using some of the charactors in a story that takes place some 25 years after the original.Overall, I thought it was a wonderful movie, very funny and very well done overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Graduate 2","review":"\\"Rumor\\" is a good movie, but you definately need to see \\"The Graduate\\" first - or the movie just won't reach its potential. Kevin Costner is great once again and Jennifer Aniston gives what could be her best performance to date.For those that ever wondered what happened after \\"The Graduate\\" - after as in the next 30 years - then \\"Rumor\\" is a movie you need to see. Funny, dramatic, it draws you in and makes you not want to miss a scene.

It didn't look bad and I've always liked Jennifer Aniston. So, it looked like a winner. Wrong! Yea, Jennifer did play her typical character but I didn't have a problem with that. My problem was with everything else. This movie was nauseatingly (if that's a word) predictable and cutesy in a undesirable and surprisingly unfunny way. Like her mother and Grandmother (Shirley McClain), Sarah (or Jennifer) has her brief affair with Benjamin (or Kevin Costner) but ends up with her boyfriend who she ends up marrying (just like her mother and her sister did with their boyfriends). If I gave away the ending, thank me and save yourself some time and money. Don't bother with this one.

Does that explain my review of the film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not just a rumor - it really isn't funny","review":"With Jennifer Aniston, Mark Ruffalo, Shirley MacLaine and Kevin Costner you would have reason to believe this could be fun. Add Director Rob Reiner and now you are on the comedy train but as the minutes ticked by, it soon became clear this movie was not working. It's the script. From the opening voice-over narration, I was lost on what the rumor was and why I should care. The punch lines were mostly flaccid regardless of the high-priced and competent acting talent delivering it. And how in God's name could it ever be humorous to speculate that the man you just had sex with could be your father? This movie is better to look at with the sound turned off. One exception is Shirley Maclaine who was a welcome respite in this sea of wasted talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumor has had it...","review":"The movie, with all of the big name talent behind it - Jennifer Anniston et al (and even George Clooney as one of the producers) - certainly was a let down. For anyone who is familiar with The Graduate (and who isn't these days), the movie will pique your interest if only because it revisits much of the myth behind the movie and whether or not what took place was based on a true 'rumor' if you will. The movie seemed to bank on too many cliches, especially those we find in the romantic comedy genre and the end, where Mark Ruffalo is waiting for Jennifer outside the elevator after she leaves his apartment in tears is as done and as flat as a climactic scene can get. Go out and rent something else because this movie will surely disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a comedy?","review":"Do you really care about another 30-something coming to grips with adulthood?

The sound is great. the only complaint I have is with the suggested Monster angle plugs. I am using 14 gauge cable and I used the suggested angle plugs on one speaker and just bare speaker wire on the other speaker and I cannot tell a difference, and the bare cabel fits in deeper and easier than the angle plugs, so i would suggest don't waste your money on the angle plugs.The speaker slector works perfect and the sound is crisp and clear just what we were looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after a few months","review":"Product work well for a couple of months, then the right channel went dead.

Im going to return it as well anyways and heres why. If you look at the pictures the buttons on the front they look like volume controls but there not. They are simple on/off switches which let you select which room you want to turn on or off. This is my fault for not reading the description but from the pictures they look just like volume controls which is what I needed in the first place. Just wanted to let everyone know this before making the mistake like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design and low quality","review":"I was very disappointed with this item. The first problem is that the insertion holes are simply too small to accommodate larger diameter higher quality cables. (Yes, like the one's that Monster sells.) Conversely, if you decide to use pin connectors on your cables (also from Monster), then you'll find that the spring loaded receptacles are so weak and flimsy that your cables will constantly pop out. I suffered using one of these for about 6 months until one of the connectors finally just broke, rendering the entire device useless. Honestly I find it baffling that Monster would design and sell a unit like this that is essentially incompatible with their core products. Obviously their design choices were made in the interest of cost rather than quality and function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Cheesy for Monster","review":"Normally I've been really happy with Monster products. They're usually more expensive than the competitors but better quality too. This speaker selector is an exception. There's not really much to it but the wire connections on the back really suck - especially if you're using 12ga or 14GA wire. I can't get the connections to stay in place if I move the unit at all - really frustrating. I don't know why they didn't design it to use with their own crimp terminals like I have on everything else. If you want my advice, look for something else. I'm returning this item, my first ever return after many years of Amazon shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a serious Audiophile setup","review":"Dissapointing. The sping-loaded connectors at the back of the selector are not particularly strong, so thick or rigid cables under tension (e.g. twisted at odd angles) easily slip out. The depth of the connectors is also not great, so wires cannot be inserted very far to compensate for the lack of traction. Connections might be better using Monster Cables' own Angled Gold Pin connectors, but I didn't try those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for the money","review":"I am using this for an outdoor speaker setup including 4 sets of speakers on 3 separate outputs. The unit is a nice size and seems to be good build quality. The connectors are solid and I had no issues. My only complaint is that when I only have my zone 2 speakers selected there is still some output to the zone 3 speakers. Its very low volume but noticable.Since this is an outdoor setup its not a big deal for me but keep this in mind depending on your application.Update: After a year or so the unit now seems to play full sound over all three speaker pairs. I have to lower my rating for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"18 gauge wire or thinner only","review":"I should have read what an earlier reviewer said. The spring loaded wire connectors in the back will not hold even moderately thick speaker wire. If you are using 18 guage or thinner (cheap) wire, this might work. If you are running thicker wire - like most higher end setups - it won't work. I use 12 gauge and 14 gauge speaker wire and couldn't even get the wires to go into the cheap connectors on the back of the unit. I return very few items, but had to return this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"High input handling!","review":"Perfect for your high output receiver or amp up to 150 watts per channel!

Because it was from monster cable, I suspect it was made this way on purpose so that you would buy their connectors.

This movie is a great example of the political brainwashing the US Government used on its citizens in the 50's. It is a depiction of the HUA (house committee on un-American activities) that was designed to rid the USA of the red menace. This movie shows how citizens spied on citizens, turned in their neighbors for suspicious activity, all in the name America and freedom. Rights were trampled and the innocent were incarcerated. There is a strong parallel between the activities of HUA and the early German secret police (SS). We, the USA, practiced what we were fighting against just a few years earlier.

It's slow. It's dull. And its last scene sends the message that the U.S. would be a pretty good place if we could just get rid of that darn Constitution!

Later in the war his deferment was changed to a 2-A deferment with the explanation that having him serve was not in the national interest. Despite not serving, Wayne did support the military through participation in USO shows for U.S. servicemen.I guess it would have been better if we had let the government take care of his children if he had perished in WWII?

I think it would be good for someone in the 8th grade or those who wake up someday and realize that there are hostile people and governments in the world. As an aside, I read this book onboard a ballistic missile submarine..it was in the ship's library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best...","review":"I consider myself a huge O'Brien fan. He is truly one of the most gifted story-tellers alive today. The Nuclear Age, however, failed miserably to live up to the excellent standards set by his other works. That said, it is by no means a bad book- just not the most captivating and engaging read. If you plan to read O'Brien's work, DO NOT START with The Nuclear Age. It doesn't do his talent justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"needed this book for school but it was an fast and informative read for anyone interested in the Sociology of parenting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Delphi DVD","review":"Terrible. I paid a professional installer to put this unit in on Saturday and it was broken by Monday. It makes all sorts of noise even when it is not on, leading to believe it IS on, killing my battery, it wouldn't play any DVD's today and the screen went green. Wouldn't eject the DVD, wouldn't turn off. Took it to the installer this morning and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. They said they'd seen quite a few that went bad like this. Hoping the manufacturer warranty will cover me but I still paid installation that won't be reimbursed. My advice, don't bother. A waste of money and a heartbreaker for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gossip at its best","review":"This is a good book about Janet. It tells her complete story, but tends to be a little gossipy at times. I loved this book! I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down. A good read for a true Janet fan. I'd highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I expect","review":"The cover of the book shows that the author is Bart Andrews with J Randy Taraborelli, author of a MJ's book Magic and Madness. This book is actually a blending of Magic and Madness, and the other half on Janet. If you have read the Magic and Madness, then you will definitely felt boring. This is a problem of same writer writing books for two singers from the same family. I think this situation should be avoided.Janet is surely a person to whom I have great interest. According to the writer, she is almost the only one that escaped from the madness of the family. How could she manage to do that? Only a book fully for her, not this one, can serve the purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat perfect story, but it seems to be more about Michael","review":"Well this is a very good book, I learned some new things about her that I really like because I'm such a big fan of hers the only problem is when I buy a book about Janet Jackson, I dont really care what Michael was doing on every page, but other than that it's a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to read","review":"I have read so many books on Michael to the point that I feel like I know him. I can not say the same about Janet. I'm actually surprised that there are virtually no books about Janet and her career, marriages, etc. This book was not very informative or maybe Janet is actually boring. With all the press about Michael Jackson and his estate I'm a little unnerved that Janet hasn't taken a more assertive approach in being more vocal about her brother's death and show support for her mother. What would it have taken for her to sit with her family at the Dancing with the Stars tribute. In the books I read about Michael as well as Latoya's book I really get a sense that Janet so wanted to carve a path for herself that it actually appears she is not a part of her family. Would someone write a more in depth book about this so-called Pop Icon. As of now I don't think she deserves the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Too Liberal for Some Parents...","review":"If you're conservative, this book probably isn't for you. It's full of the old self-esteem curriculum you see so often in our public schools today. There are a few good ideas, but I found it dense and lecturing to parents. Overall disappointing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"positive discipline......","review":"This book was so informative and great to read. I found it very helpful during preschool on my parent co-op work days. I even now have imbedded this material into my head that i find myself doing it all the time. My children are less in time outs and more ready to share their feelings. this book is great. Even the parents at the Co-op have said they loved it. thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be required reading for all parents","review":"There is so much disrespect in parenting these days--people yelling at children, hitting them, belittling them, etc. Some don't even realize what their actions can do to a child's long term mental health and social development. This book outlines many different approaches to discipline, positive time-outs, punishment free (consequence driven) learning. People attend birthing classes--it's a sure bet that they can give birth without them. Why not child rearing classes--I think it would pay off in society and our children would benefit so much from them. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew, we're not the only ones","review":"Helped us to better understand our 2 1/2 year old. A great insight into explaining why our son acts or does things he does since he is still learning how to communicate. Saved all of us alot of grief & frustration. The scenarios were great since we experience close to the same situations. Reassured us that what we experience was normal and gave us other options on how to handle to different situations. Easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great match for the Bostitch Gun","review":"These nails work great in my Bostitch gun, no jams.

Before I got this I was basically paying someone to stick a filament in my face and blast it with heat. Now the sensation is so much less painful. Apply it 20-30 minutes before your session and it'll be good for a few hours. Note: the cap can be a bit tricky. Push down on the cap and twist counter-clockwise. Sad to say it took me the better part of an hour to get that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great!","review":"I ought this cream because my son had a penile adhesion that needed to be pulled back (very painful thing to put a three year old through). I bought this cream hoping for a miracle and it was exactly that. I applied it generously and covered the area with Saran Wrap for about 30 mins and it was totally numb! My son didn't feel a thing. It is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice for me when getting a tattoo","review":"After applying the product as described in other reviews (one thin layer worked in; a heavier layer that sits on the skin and is covered by cellophane) one hour before the tattoo led to a really good experience in the chair. Not the fault of the cream but a note of caution - when you don't respond to the natural pain while getting inked the artist doesn't have any feedback and thinks it's OK to go 100% speed wise. This led to significant bruising of the muscle in addition to the healing process of the skin. FYI - I've had about 50 hours of chair time and this was the worst bruising episode (admittedly it was a Koi done in Japanese style which was heavy color driven, so that may have had another factor).That said I'll never get another tat without this stuff if I can help it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"This is lidocaine and it burns when it is applied. I was looking for pain relief. OTC lanacaine from the drugstore worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"This cream did not work at all so it was a complete rip off for $30. I would not recomend it. I used it for laser hair removal, put it on 30 minutes before, absolutely no difference. My hair removal clinic gave me something 10x better to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laser Haiir removal","review":"I've used before my laser hair removal sessions and was generally pleased with the anesthetic effect that resulted. Of course, everyone must be careful not to overuse lidocaine products.."},{"rating":"2","title":"great numbing cream for shots and blood draws!","review":"I was unsure how well this product would work for the purpose of numbing during blood draws and shots but was very plesantly surprised! This product is great and gets you completely numb within about 30 to 45 mins. I am a fainter and can't stand any sort of needles so products like this are a life saver and especially for little kids who really dislike shots as well. great for anyone who needs it for numbing purposes."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],H={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",H,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(C,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-e6e754a9"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/4.md","filePath":"quotesmag/4.md"}'),L={name:"quotesmag/4.md"},G=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
