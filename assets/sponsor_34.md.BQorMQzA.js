They said they would pay for shipping but couldn't successfully send me a pre-paid envelope through email. Apparently they just didn't take the time to do it.

So far, I only use the rectal attachment because my children are both under the age of two but I have had extremely accurate readings.

I still enjoy this book - it has a variety of projects, ranging from easy(knit bookmark, stuffed ball, etc.) to the harder projects such as baby bootees, slippers, shawls, and sweaters. I also enjoy it because, unlike most knitting resources, it avoids excessive abbreviations (p 17, k 29, yo, etc.) and explains each project, along with the skills needed to complete it, clearly and concisely.I, too, am very upset that it is out of print - I was lucky to find a copy at our library's used book sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Book","review":"At my school library I found a copy of this book.

In a world that is becoming more disconnected, this book will challenge you and help you see God in your everyday life. The writers broaden our view of spiritual journey from churches and bible studies to long walks, shopping trips, and talks on the phone with friends.

The information presented tended to be either too brief or assumed a lot of proir knowledge, which is inappropriate in a book with \\"for Dummies!\\" in the title. There were some good tips but I never had enough info to embark on a project with only this book as a reference. One exception was the info on painting, which was helpful and detailed. Also, a lot of the material seemed a little dated - there was tons of info about wallpapering and installing laminate countertops (I think these options are not as popular as they once were) but not much on installing granite counters or laminate flooring. So, in short, having this book is better than nothing but if you really want to be well versed in home improvement, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.","review":"I disagree with the reviews saying this is a bad book.If you like books like Jane Green's Jemima J and Jennifer Weiner's Good in Bed, you'll like this book too.This book is for anyone who thinks they are less than perfect. Whether you are too fat or too skinny or even just right... you will enjoy reading about Allison's journey from being fat and frumpy one day and a goddess the next. Many people (me included) wish that 'If only I could wake up tomorrow in the perfect body, my life would be perfect'. This is how the story starts.

Allison Penny doesn't seem like a real character to me. Yes, she made me laugh, and I could empathize with her feelings. However, her character did things that didn't seem believable for someone who has felt ugly her whole life. She wakes up beautiful and suddenly has confidence to spare? I think there would still be vestiges of her former hermit-like self there.Granted this was a modern sort of fairytale but the characters were too caricature like. They didn't have much depth and their behaviors, except for Allison, were too predictable.It is a quick, easy read but there is something missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've read...","review":"This book was awful. The plot, the characters, the writing ... the author was exceptionally lazy. I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but this was one of the worst books I've read in a long time. The premise is intriguing, but the author completely avoids any and all opportunity to take the plot and the characters anywhere. I bought this book in an airport and had a hard time forcing myself to read it on the plane--SkyMall was more appealing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book leaves too many questions to be answered. Why did she wake up \\"perfect\\"? Why didn't video boy want to be with her until she was beautiful? Why couldn't he see her for what she was? Why do we care? Allison is never likeable; the cast of characters is sad and one-dimensional; there is no real social commentary or insight in any of the poorly written chapters. I enjoy a fluffy fairy tail as much as the next chick but this one is a sad tail and not worthy of the 50-cent bin at Borders."},{"rating":"2","title":"far, far, above average!","review":"This book is infinitely better than your average chick lit. Elyse Friedman is one of the sharpest, funniest, most observant writers I've read in a long time. The story of her heroine, Allison, could just be turned into a fairytale or wish-fullfillment fantasy, but it winds up being an extremely funny and edgy romp, laced with a lot of black humor and razor-sharp observations about men, women and society. Some of the scenes with Allison's evil roommate, Virginie, or the smoothly handsome suitor George (a Prince Charming who turns out to have some weird sexual proclivities) are worth the price of the book alone.This will definitely appeal to the Bridget Jones crowd, but it's Bridget Jones with a bite that Bridget never had, and it's far sexier and funnier. This is one of those rare novels that's really worth your money. Read it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"New stuff - fresh sound","review":"I bought this cd directly from Eric Shans, the mastermind behind PHENOTRACT and was incredibly surprised.Why?

It really is! The illustrations are great, but the story line is negative from almost the first page. In summary, this train has problems running from the very beginning, crashes and the dinosaurs get off wondering why they took a trip. It doesn't exactly inspire children to try new things! My son is crazy about dinosaurs and trains and he wasn't into this book as much as I tried to make it interesting. My husband read this to our son on a different night, without any input from me, and told me afterward that he felt the same way.....boring and negative. Every child is different and again, the illustrations really are fantastic, but it's just not enough to make this something we'll read again. Sorry to be a downer myself, but I wanted to share with others who might be considering..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Kids like trains. Kids like Dinosaurs. What could go wrong? Well, for one, the writing is pretty bad. Every third line sacrifices meaning for rhyme (nice, hu?). At the end all the dinosaurs hug for no other reason than it rhymes with chug and trains move like \\"slugs\\" (guess why!). Tunnels have funnels now? Really? And every time the syllables don't line up, the author picks a work and slaps \\"dino\\" infront of it (dinotime, dinoshouts, etc). The illustration is okay and my son likes it well enough. It probably all doesn't matter, but even if it's totally irrational, you want your kid exposed to quality art, right? Besides, you're not going to want to read this thing out loud.

But he provides no evidence, so despite his claims that Dianetics is a science, there's no way for the reader to verify any of his claims, only take his word for it.

The timeframe in which this company sends out things they charge you for the minute you order it but you wont get it for a longer period and that is after they finally mail it.

Part of the problem was that my bicycle pump (6 5/8\\" long) was putting some pressure on the bag, but it wasn't severe pressure, so I don't think this should have caused the zipper to become un-toothed (I made up a word, so what?). Finishing a long ride worrying about your stuff falling out unnoticed is no fun, but I did bang the ends of the zipper down to prevent it from happening again. It now seems to function, but it's not a smooth zippering and I have to test it out -- all the while wondering if it'll open up again. I wouldn't recommend this bag. I mean, bike bags have to do two things: stay closed and stay on. This bag does a poor job of staying closed. The velcro straps have worked fine for me, so it has stayed on just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a few more bucks!!","review":"This was a great low price and high reviews.

Some seem to think that there are some magic bags out there that are actually bigger on the inside than other bags the same size. Sorry. Aside from that it is a good price. But, the top velcro straps will not hold on long, especially if you are doing any off road. It came lose 3 times on a 30 mile flat gravel trail. The position of the straps also makes it nearly impossible to get it tight under the seat. In a tightly strapped position, you cannot get your fingers in there to secure it. That is why most bags have one strap that goes through rails under the seat and wraps around and under the bag. If your stuck with this bag, you can use a plastic zip tie to secure it better. It won't come off and go back on without cutting, but at least it will hold. I would recommend a single strap pack though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zipper broke on first day!","review":"Ther size of this bag was perfect for me.

I got it to hold an extra tube, some quick patches, and some tire tools. It seemed like it did this well, but the seams started coming apart after about 6 months of use. Tried Duct taping it, and that helped it hold up for a little while longer until the entire thing came unseamed... Even along the top!! To be fair, I do most of my riding on trails with jumps, roots, and rocks. However, I would expect a bag made of a fake canvas to last longer than this. Lesson learned... You get what you pay for. I wouldn't recommend this bag to anyone, seems a waste to buy a new seatbag every year.

Dire Straits recorded half a dozen great songs over 7-8 years, but 'Sultans' is the only one on show here. There's nothing exactly wrong with the others - they're just not especially good songs when you measure them against thousands of others recorded over the last 50 years or so.

Some of the worst songs I have ever heard from this great band seem to appear in Water Of Love, In The Gallery, and Wild West End. I mean the vocals are crappy, so as the music. The only good song is Sultans Of Swing. This is a bit overrated Dire Straits along with Making Movies, Communique, and Alchemy.

Every of their other albums are fine. This is the only bad 1 which contains several of the worst songs they ever recorded.I will have to say that Sultans of Swing is the only decent song on this terrible album. Listen to that, the other songs are terrible. And one more thing, Why is it so popular??????????"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Unique Sound","review":"I have never been so captivated by the combination of guitar work and vocals as when I heard \\"Sultans of Swing\\" for the first time. It is truly among the greatest songs ever produced. Even with such a great song as \\"Sultans,\\" the other tracks on this album do not suffer. Upbeat, catchy songs like \\"Setting Me Up\\" and \\"Southbound Again\\" have great guitar hooks and strong basslines. Slower, bluesy songs like \\"In The Gallery\\" and \\"Six Blade Knife\\" display Mark Knopfler's range as a guitar player. \\"Down to the Waterline\\" and \\"Lions\\" are beyond classification as either rock or blues.BEST SONGS: \\"Sultans of Swing,\\" \\"Southbound Again,\\" \\"Down to the Waterline\\"SONGS TO SKIP: NoneOverall, Dire Straits' first album is a classic compilation of laid-back, blues rock masterpieces that hold up better than most songs of a similar genre. This album is by far their best, and is a must have for anybody who appreciates electric guitar and a unique sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best by Dire Straits.","review":"This is a good album from Dire Straits, if you like rocking.

They are the Gods of Rock'n Roll who married the southern style blues with swinging country hip. But perhaps you have not heard the miracle of SACD yet?

In this one song, MK synthensized the major styles of popular music - starting with rock and roll and blues, then a hint of jazz (including references to Duke Ellington's song) and finishing it off with country and blues guitar solo. The lyrics has many layers of meaning: 1. As a paen to jazz players who are under appreciated and yet play for the love music; 2. As a celebration of life and freedom when one accepts and enjoys one's fate and love without regard for what other people think; The instrumentation is so interesting - how one instrument's sound anticipates another. Listen to this several times and each time concentrate on different instrument and you will enjoy this song even more. This was their best effort without question. This is still under appreciated by general public and most critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The debut of one of the world's greatest guitarists!","review":"If you're thinking of buying a Dire Straits greatest hits album, forget about it. This is not a greatest hits type of group. The only way to really understand fully what this great band and their great guitarist, Mark Knopler is all about, is to purchase their individual albums. This is the place to start. Sultans of Swing is a prime example of the effortless ease that Knopler is known for. I play a little guitar myself, and believe me, Knopler makes it sound so easy but it really isn't. His fingerpicking technique is astonishing. But he is equally adept at jazz riffs, rock, classical, country picking. He is a master! This is one of the great debuts of all time. Every cut is wonderful listening! It is the place to start, then collect them all, but stay away from greatest hits packages, because you won''t capture the full atmosphere or depth of this great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great one","review":"I have owned this album for almost twenty years and it never gets old. \\"Down to the Waterline\\" by itself is worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire Sound Quality","review":"I usually look forward to and love buying re-mastered CDs as the technology of today is so much better than when CDs were first released in the 80s. I never owned this on CD until now but must say that there is something very wrong in the sound of this remastered version. The mid-range is skewed, burying the vocals, almost like you are listening to it through glass.

A MUST HAVE !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a start to a band's career...","review":"As many other reviewers have said, this is quite simply Dire Straits' most enduring album. It still holds up well almost 30 years after many of the songs were penned. My personal favourite would have to be 'In The Gallery' - a quiet protest against the agents who exploit artists - whatever their genre may be. This could ring true for so many in the industry! However, all of the songs are gems and Knopfler's uncluttered, stylish Strat-playing gives them a mature nature. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It all started here","review":"Dire Straits' debut during the height of punk reminded the anti music punksters what real music was all about. The bluesy precise picking of Mark Knopfler drives the songs slowly like an old man and woman out for a sunday drive doing 35 in a 55mph zone. There is no rush to get to the next song so slow down and listen and hear/see the rich musical landscapes that are created here. Pure musical beauty. Don't pass this slow driver by! It is still impressive over 24 years later.Also listen to Live at the BBC for live versions of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fancy steppin' out to Angelucci's?","review":"I've already reviewed this album once, but here's an extra rock 'n' roll pilgrimage tip for those of us lucky to live in London:If you fancy \\"steppin' out to Angelucci's for your coffee beans\\" in the Wild West End, you can: - Angelucci's is still there, On the corner of Frith Street and Old Compton Road, just across from Ronnie Scott's - and it still sells the best coffee in London.But not for much longer - Mr Angelucci is thinking of his moving shop (which has been there since 1929) to Barnet in North London. Mister Knopfler doesn't come by so much any more, I guess.Now, some people here have expressed the opinion that Knopfler isn't much good live. In Shea Stadium, perhaps not - he isn't exactly Freddie Mercury, after all. But anyone lucky enough to have seen him in a small venue, playing the roots blues he is inclined to do these days, will know how good he really is.Very."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is not what was in the picture","review":"The Zebra in the picture is one that we have had for a couple years and my daughter takes it everywhere with us.

Unfortunately, unlike some of their other CD's, the story this is based on is excruciatingly boring. If you want to practice your Spanish and listen to a decent story in the process, I'd recommend 'Harry Potter Y La Piedra Filosofal' or Fonolibro's 'Viaje Al Centro de la Tierra,' and 'El Conde de Monte Cristo.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Although this is one of the finest compositions of concert band literature, this recording is utterly horrible. Not only is the quality incredibly poor (I found the background coughing annoying), the manner in which this piece is played lacks fundamental preparation and detracts from the beauty of this piece. I recommend the Tokyo-Kosei Symphony recording of this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emmylou CD","review":"The best Emmylou album/CD.

In 1886, a young man has to go from London to Burma, and engage there into a long river voyage to the deep jungle (a la Apocalypse Now) in order to fine tune the piano of a warlord. Anybody who has some familiarity with the Victorian era can see how badly researched this book was, the dialogue sounds instantly phony, people during that era didn't talk (or think) at all like characters of this book do. After reading very favorable reviews, I felt after finishing this novel that I have lost precious hours of my life and whatever money it costs me to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensitive and Elegantly Crafted Historical Fiction","review":"\\"The Piano Tuner\\" is historical fiction written in the style of Somerset Maughm and E. M. Forster, so carefully and elegantly wrought that the reader is immediately placed in the life, locale and period of the central character, a British piano tuner whose mission is to tune the piano of an eccentric, but seemingly important officer of the British crown, who is stationed in a strategic part of Burma that is not securely controlled by Britain. There are no false or hesitant words by this accomplished and gifted writer, who at 26, has great promise. The only reason that I did not give this novel 5 stars is that the ending is surprisingly abrupt and ill conceived. Overall, a must read, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent...","review":"There's a noticable lack of polish to the writing in The Piano Tuner that distracts from what is actually a pretty good story. In parts, it reads like something from a college creative writing class, which is disappointing for a published book.Sometimes the author tends toward melodrama, and this is where the writing is weakest. The exotic backdrop of the story was compelling enough to keep me turning the pages, though I wish the dramatic tension had been turned up a notch. Also, I felt the ending was a bit of a letdown. (It almost had the same sort of ambiguity as the frequently anthologized story \\"An Occurence at Owl Creek Bridge,\\" but not quite.)There are definite highlights in both the story and the writing, but it's a mixed bag overall. Mr. Mason is a gifted writer for his age, and he's sure to improve. I'd definitely give a look to his next book, but I was only lukewarm on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, stereotypical","review":"Lacked originality in depiction of characters and description of the geography/region. A boring, forgettable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric Underachiever","review":"The sad thing about this book is the obvious poor quality of writing and how opposite it reads to the hype it has received. I am shocked that the blatant errors throughout (a long and tedious read for me) were not corrected by an editor. I am afraid that this book is another in the long line of 'who knows who' books and if this keeps up we will all become illiterate eventually. The author has written something very common and done before, and all the other things that the agents usually reject from writers. I read it to try to find a reason for its big pedigree and found that it is the writer who has that, and a good solid list of family connections. As an English major, and a lover of literature and quality writing, I seriously think he should stick to biology!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure","review":"Great idea ruined by bad writing, weak characters and narrative that doesn't cast a spell over the readers (or at least one of them).It will be up to the others to judge, my impression though is that the author didn't do enough research while working on this book.The language is supposed to be 19th-century British English. The characters, however, seem to be speaking the pompous version of modern American (\\"Good to see you, Mr. Drake\\").The characters are not believable, their presentation lacks observation and those little details that make them come alive.Several story elements (The Man of One Story), while potentially crucial and intriguing, seem to be too sketchy and under-developed.All in all, a disappointment. This could have been one of those epic stories that one wants to read over and over. Thankfully, the author seems to have enough imagination and talent to be able to overcome a lack of skill in his future endeavours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"The title and synopsis promised so much more than was delivered by the text. Essentially, the author's knowledge of Burma and its colonial past is so shallow and his ability to weave personalities into a story-line with credibility is so weak that you become more annoyed with each chapter. The opportunities to insert historical fact are too contrived and out of place. It is a wonder that this book made it through the editorial process of a major publishing house. I give it two stars: one for the author's determination to see his project reach print and the other because it elicited such a reaction from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTIVATED AND INVOLVED !","review":"What a first novel!!..I had no idea I would be so swept away to a land I knew little about...with people who were extradinary, vivid and captivating...I was intrigued by the back cover of the book, but I never dreamed I would be on such a gorgeous journey.I highly recommend this book to those of you who feel excited about a story that is beautifully told and also the learning process that is part of the enjoyment.From the minute you step into Edgar Drake's household until the end of the journey in Burma you are held in the palm of the hand by the author.However,I must admit the ending was a letdown, and that is why it is only 4 stars...I would appreciate hearing from any of you that have read this book to discuss the ending and hear your thoughts.Until then, good reading, it is a box of delicious candy, each chapter more enticing than the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare pleasure","review":"This book gets my highest praise. I did not think anyone was writing like this anymore. It could almost have been written in the era in which the action takes place, the 1870s, since Mason seems to give voice to the best of human feeling and language missing in modern writing.I was in Burma and Thailand recently, not too far from places described in the book. Mason paints a picture faithful to the depth of texture and richness of place.I wonder how many modern readers will have what it takes to appreciate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book and all the publicity around it is a SHAM","review":"I just finished THE PIANO TUNER and honestly, I wish I could have that time back. Oh that I had spent it with a book worthy of reading! I kept plugging away because of all the good publicity around it, but really, this book is a cheap copy of HEART OF DARKNESS with thin cardboard characters, a love story that doesn't work, and a premise ripped off from a famous book that pretty much everyone who would read this book has already read. Don't waste your time with this sham of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dense Disappointment","review":"I wanted to enjoy this book. The first few pages demonstrate that Mason is a more than capable writer, his sentences poetic and his tone believably 19th century. But very quickly it is apparent that this is going to be a long haul. The characterizations are flat. Dr. Carroll is a huge letdown when he finally makes his appearance (actually, he's absent most of the time even after his entrance), and Mr. Drake so quickly devotes himself to this milktoast Svengali that the reader concludes he never had a self to lose to the mysteries of Burma. The book ultimately feels like a depository for every fact about Burma that Mason was able to scrape up in his year of research there, thus he succeeds in creating a lush stage for the action but unfortunately casts his story with puppets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Dull","review":"If you enjoy reading hundreds of pages of dull description of Burma then this is your novel. Honestly, it's just tidbits snipped from general histories jammed into a weakly-plotted novel. Thinly disguised digressions, silly anecdotes (in particular I'm thinking of the sailor). How can the character finally arrive and go on a flower expedition instead of seeing the piano? How ridiculous! A tiger hunt? A tiger hunt? That's satirical, right? They'll send him a piano, but not vaccines?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly engaging.","review":"I didn't know this was Mason's first novel until I tried to find others he has written. Anyone who understands the discipline and magic of music, who has an appreciation for history and culture, who remembers the sexual tension between a man and a woman, and who has the patience to let this story unfold will find this book seductive and engaging. I found myself idenfying with the characters in this book as I had when I first read The Catcher in the Rye, The Child Buyer and To Kill a Mockingbird, vastly different books from The Piano Tuner and each other, but similar with respect to the exploration of inner motivation, purpose and understanding of self in a world too big and dynamic to ever truly know. Mason's ability to step back and allow dialog and letters tell the story in thier full detail was like eavesdropping on a secret conversation while reading a diary -- a delightful, if guilty, pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for PR...","review":"I'm amazed about all the hype on this book. It was a painful read. His tempo is much too slow. His writing is rough and choppy. I read the back cover and they were talking of his lyrical prose. What lyrical prose? He is no better of a writer than most people out there. And by that I mean non-published authors. Seems to be just hyped up because of his pedigree background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly out of tune","review":"Daniel Mason has his moments as a writer and and works well with description, but his characters and plot are preposterous. The entire linchpin of \\"Piano Tuner\\" never rings true, and when the action turns to Burma, it's an exercise in second-rate Maugham with Cliff Notes Conrad thrown in. But the worst is the portrayal of an entire nation as populated by heroic white men and \\"inscrutable\\" ciphers, capable only of seduction or betrayal. I thought the fashion for novels by \\"junior orientalists\\" had run its course with Mark Saltzman; sadly, I was mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Book","review":"I liked this book so much that I've purchsed a second copy as a gift. It's a good read and very appropriate for anyone interested in pianos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Fascinating","review":"This novel is a delightful journey through a world that has been largely lost to history. From the first chapter when we learn of Edgar's mission, to the last chapter when we learn of his fate, Mason never ceases to evoke anything but sheer wonder and awe.Amazing book. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An attempt at being deep, but poetic at times","review":"This book was just an excuse for the author to use his skills of painting a beautiful picture with words. The story seamed to meander. I forced myself to finish the book even after I knew there would never be closure. I found myself at the end asking... WHAT?! What about The man with one story - what was the significance of that... and what about ... and what about... read it only for it's descriptions of the land and not for a an engrossing story. Otherwise you will need a great deal of patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very exciting","review":"It has the exotic historical setting, the intriguing setup, even a map of a country we rarely think about... but the plot just doesn't add up to much. Nor did I learn much about Burma. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly boring","review":"I think people who like this book appreciate it for the macro- perspective of Burma. The first 200 pages are a travelogue of Burmese social, political, historical, and ecological environment. But if you like to read for story and character, then, don't read this book.The remainder of the book devolves into a bizarre story, i.e., the piano tuner is forced into to the military -- that might have been why he was summoned to Burma all along, and it makes no sense. I kind of liked this part of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will I ever learn not to...","review":"fall for the hype on paperback covers! This book was SO slow and boring, but I kept thinking \\"It just has to get better!\\" (My sentiments about \\"Atonement\\" also.) How wrong I was! I never \\"connected\\" with any of the main characters, and I found all the historical stuff about Burma tedious and confusing. Why the piano tuner felt so impacted by the place just never came through to me. Be sure to read \\"The Life of Pi\\"--now that is a book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Tale","review":"Daniel Mason has woven a fascinating tale which combines history, music and medicine in a part of the world most of us know little about.He has thoroughly researched these topics and written a wonderful story that is difficult to put down. This book would make a wonderful movie. It's hard to believe this is his first novel and I hope a second will soon follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first novel.","review":"Mason displays great potential with this historically rich novel about the piano tuner and a visit to the Shan States. His colorful discriptions and interesting character development display Mason's ability to tell a wonderful story. I look forward to his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing historical realism","review":"Daniel Mason's The Piano Tuner turned out to be a disappointment. Impressive as the it was as a first novel, the lack of editorial skill applied to its pages was overwhelming. A few pages into the novel, two facts are obvious: one, that the writer was American while his subject was the British, and two, that the author inappropriately projected his twentieth century values on a different time and place. Most dialogs were difficult if not impossible to imagine taking place between the English because of language use, sentence structure, diction, etc. Certain scenarios were so American in their construct that transferring it to British Burma (or to British anywhere - even today) was ludicrous. The outcome is unfortunate: stilted and contrived.For those readers who are interested only in plot, you will probably enjoy this book. However, if you are concerned with historical realism or style, you will be disappointed before you hit the second chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"the piano tuner","review":"Dear sirs,I am sorry to say that the book, \\"The Piano Tuner\\", was not one of my favorite books. The only reason that I read it to the end is, because it was chosen for our monthly Book Club. It was not my choice. I love to read and I usually feel all books offer some bit of information. That was the case, because the part of the world and history of it was a bit informative, but not enough to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not beautiful writing, but writing trying to be beautiful","review":"The close of chapter 2 sums up the pretentious emptiness of Mason's prose: \\"White. Like a clean piece of paper, like uncarved ivory, all is white when the story begins.\\" This vapid, wannabe elegance should send readers back to Anthony Trollope or Henry James for lessons in the craft. Add to that the besetting vice of much contemporary fiction, the endless so-what descriptions of nothing in particular (\\"Mist beads on his glasses and he removes them to wipe them on his waistcoat\\"-- also at the end of chapter 2). This novel is eye-candy for a culture that has lost touch with literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense, but worth it","review":"Beautiful writing. This is one multi-talented young man. And humble (in person), too, so what's not to like?Well, the beginning was long-ish, and the end seemed to come on too quickly. The middle was perfect.Interesting way of writing dialogue that I've never seen employed before, all in a single paragraph with only commas separating what one speaker says from another. In Mason's capable hands, it works well.Give it a try, pass it on to a friend, and look forward to his next book - after he graduates from medical school in 2 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Feels like Apocolypse Now in some ways. A good book with vivid imagery and character descriptions...it drew me in and I wanted to see where the story went."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first novel...","review":"With the Piano Tuner, Daniel Mason has performed what all aspiring authors long to. This book became a best seller for obvious reasons. The story and plot lines are well thought out. The history presented within the book is fairly accurate. And, best of all, the story is a very original twist on a very old theme. Being a huge fan of Kerouac, I was very used to observing and identifying the conflicts the main character is presented with when faced with traveling long distances away from home, family, and friends. The conflicts here are similar. What makes the Piano Tuner worth reading is the descriptive language and vivid characters presented by Mason. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to more by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money !!","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen ! The acting was awful, as well as the plot and the photography. They must of use only two camera's for the whole movie. It was also out of focus half the time.

Stay away from it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Definitive Work","review":"Followers of the career of Newt Gingrich will be disappointed by this biography. The book is at its best in describing the ins and outs of the local elections Newt fought and won in Georgia, with a lot of background information on each election. But the sections on Newt's Washington career are culled mostly from newspaper articles and interviews with some of the players in the Gingrich era that--surprisingly--add few insights into the nature and character of Gingrich. Steely's prose is often wooden and the numerous changes of tense are jarring. The text in fact at times reads more like a first draft manuscript than a polished biography. Gingrich is clearly the most influential Republican figure of the 1990's and political history demands a sweeping documentation of his career. We'll just have to wait for one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much left out of Newt's Bio.","review":"Let us face the facts. Mr. Gingrich is a hypocrite. While talking about how awful President Clinton was, Mr. Gingrich was fooling around behind his wife's back. None of this is included in this book so I am left to wonder what else is missing. A white wash of a book. I give it 2 stars for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just one of many New Age albums of the 80s","review":"If you enjoy New Age Synth Music of the 1980s then this may be for you? I find it extremely dated sounding now. Some call Synergy/Larry Fast some sort of \\"innvator\\" but in reality this music was dated when it was released back 20 years ago.

Not having heard it for many years, I bought the recent CD re-issue. After playing it, I realized that New Age music is dated and best-forgotten sonic wallpaper of a musically beige period. Nothing more than drivel for Yuppies who think John Tesh and Kenny G are jazz musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metropolitan Suite is SWEET!","review":"As a fan of Larry Fast from his \\"Sequencer\\" album, I was even more delighted to hear this album. His arrangements are expanded beyond the mere emulation of symphony orchestration through the use of analog and digital synthesis, which offers seemingly boundless sonic possibilities. The musical pieces that are covered under the umbrella of \\"Metropolitan Suite\\" are truly tone poems that paint vivid mental pictures of city life during the early 20th century. The remaining pieces on the album are more upbeat, and yet still produce the excitement of mental imagery through Fast's creative use of electronic instrumentation. Only track eight, \\"West Side Nights,\\" seems to lack a bit on the production end as it is not as tight as the rest of the album. On the whole a thoroughly enjoyable album that I will play over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Just Wish...","review":"Amazon would use the true Original release date.

And I was not disappointed. Prof Karres' account is factual, straightforward and unsentimental and should be required historical reading. When she says: \\"I am the offspring of a killer nation.\\" (p. 280) you can accept by this stage in the book that this is not an self-pitying utterance but rather a realistic fear for the future, a fear for all Germans of her generation. Yes, the burden is onerous, and Prof Karres is careful nowhere to shirk it or thrust it under a carpet of I-wasn't-responsible. She paints her guilt bravely and vividly and the reader is awed and sometimes shocked, yes, by the extreme postwar hardships experienced by the ever-expanding and starving family but most importantly s/he is informed. I recommend this book highly to all WW2/Holocaust readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instead, read Walker's \\"Prompt & Utter Destruction\\"","review":"Instead of wasting your time reading this mess, I highly recommend reading J.

Told in the form of correspondence between two former business partners and friends, it works on the level of a darn good tale; a story of a moral failure and an equally disturbing revenge; a description of the rise of Naziism in Germany and how even an old friend could be seduced by its appeal; and the ending packs a wallop. It's not a book to \\"enjoy\\", but one you won't soon forget - if ever. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing story of Nazi Germany","review":"\\"Address Unknown,\\" by Kathrine Kressman Taylor, was first published in \\"Story\\" magazine in 1938. This story (or short novel, if you prefer) is told in the form of letters between two characters: Max Eisenstein, an American Jew; and his friend Martin Schulse, a German who has returned home after having lived in the United States. The letters span the years 1932-34, and touch on the rise of Hitler and on the Shoah, or Holocaust.The 2001 Washington Square Press edition of the book contains a fascinating foreword by Charles Douglas Taylor, the author's son; he discusses the story's publication history and offers some biographical data on the author.I found this book to be an intriguing piece of fiction. The letters begin on a friendly note, but tension soon rises. There are also chillinging twists to the plot. Recommended reading, especially for those with an interest in fiction of the World War II and pre-war era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old person's review","review":"I read this as a short story in high school.

The book, consisting entirely of trans-Atlantic correspondence, shows how seemingly normal people can be seduced by Fascism.When the newly enthusiastic Nazi cruelly betrays his longtime friend and business partner, it is not the end, only the beginning. An unforgiveable crime is punished with an extremely creative and deeply vindictive act of revenge that will stay with you long after the last page is read. Moving, frightening, and fast-paced, this novella has stood the test of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.

I should have read the reviews more carefully, but I did not want to risk finding out the surprise ending. Unfortunately, I can't send this book to anyone on my list: it's a quick read and well crafted, but it's unflattering to Jews (though perhaps it wouldn't have been perceived this way 65 years ago?); and the ultimate message is a great disappointment to anyone who believes that vengeance is not laudable, however cleverly it is accomplished."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial and silly","review":"i read this one based on a reference from a friend....luckily i was just biding my time on a short flight.....not worth your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paige","review":"Very frustrating I bought this game for Xbox and it won't work.

As a theologian, Mr. Edwards showcases his contempt for Donne's early life and work, and uses Donne's later sermons and religious poems to display his own religious erudition. Mr. Edwards appears to see Donne as nothing but an Anglican apologist. The book shows limited understanding of historical or literary criticism, and scant sympathy with Donne's very human struggles. This book merely reinforces the already muddled body of Donne scholarship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horrifying page turner","review":"A tremendous look inside \\"The Hermit Nation\\".Chol-Hwan and his editor bring to life the hell on earth that is North Korea and it's brutal prison camps. The discriptive passages bring NK to life and his excellent use of imagery make you feel as if you're there with him, trying to keep warm through the long winters, or scratching for insects to nourish himself.The book outlines his Grandparents path from Japan to NK through his internment, to his escape to China and ultimately life in South Korea.I finished this book in three sittings and could barely put it down. One of the most compelling books I've ever read. Can't recommend it highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent.","review":"this book was everything I hoped it would be. it was a sad story, but its words were not simlply used up in emotions. as I finished up the book, it really even inspired me to take action regarding north korea. how? that I don't know, but somehow. perhaps I should contact my congressman or find out about some agencies working with north korean refugees.the stories about the camp were horrifying at times and well-written about. the flow of the middle chapters was not perfect, but its content, not to mention the rest of the book, totally made up for it. the chapters at the very beginning and the very end were especially good, particularly his description of his \\"happy childhood in pyongyang\\" and adjusting to life in south korea. excellent book worth my time. if you have any kind of interest in east asia or north korea in particular, you should definitely read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A First Person Account of Life in a North Korean Labor Camp","review":"This is a well written, first person account of life of a North Korean (DPRK) boy who grew up as the son of ethnic Koreans who moved to North Korea from Japan after World War II. The boy's grandfather makes an unknown mistake and the entire family is condemned to life at Yodok - a DPRK re-education or work camp. The grim stories of this young man struggling to survive and while surrounded by death and suffering gives the reader a first hand account of North Korean-style communism.The author, since his escape, has studied and become a journalist in South Korea, writing for the Choson Ilbo newspaper. You can find some fragments of this book in a few of his articles.I recommend this book for readers, students, and researchers interested in North Korea, human rights, communist ideology, history, or government. It may also be of interest to ethnic Koreans living outside Korea to understand the conditions of life in North Korea."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag","review":"This book is must reading for those who do not believe and those who believe all of these horror stories coming out of North Korea. The book is written in great detail about the harsh conditions present in this North Korean concentration camp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrific but true.....","review":"The Aquariums of Pyongyang was one of the most difficult books I've ever read. Difficult in the way that it describes, first hand, the conditions of daily life in the North, not to mention the gulag.This book should be MANDATORY reading for all Americans, and for that matter for all residents of the western hemisphere who are unaware of the realities of North Korea. The human rights crisis taking place there demands that we all understand what is happening in this part of the world. This book does a great job of furthering that understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing up in the North Korean Gulag","review":"If one reads accounts by survivors of the Soviet gulag, as well as its earnest imitations in China and North Korea, the similarities are impossible to miss. Mr. Kang's account is special for the extreme rarity of books in English about North Korea's gulag, for the fact that Mr. Kang entered Yodok when he was a child and remained there until early adulthood, and for the fact that North Korea's labor camps are very much still in active operation.One very interesting facet of Mr. Kang's memoir is his description of his growing interest in Christianity. Ta Chen's recent 3-volume memoirs (Sounds of the River, Colors of the Mountain, and China's Son) have rather a similar tone: the brutality of the Chinese and North Korean Communist regimes made the Christian emphasis on brotherly love powerfully appealing to some of the young people who grew up at close range to the workings of communist governments.Well worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good! Nicely written","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said this book is somewhat poorly written (because of the translation from Korean to French to English), but in a sense that is the strength of the book. It gives it a raw, authentic feel. In a macabre way it is also humorous. Finally the short chapters make for good bedtime reading. Very nicely done book.

I read the book and finished within a week and I'm a slow reader, my wife whizzed through it in 2 days. We were both speechless afterward. A testimony to the human spirit and the will to survive when everyone and everything around you says otherwise. Then President Bush was right, North Korea's Kim cult was and is truly evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"In my opinion this book is on par with Alan Patton's \\"Cry the Beloved Country.\\" It powerfully conveys the plight of foreign oppression with both empathy and clarity.Every US military officer, all federal politicians, diplomats, bureaucrats and personnel stationed in South Korea NEED TO READ THIS BOOK.The author's family willingly emigrated to North Korea. They had been quite wealthy, but felt ideologically drawn to seek North Korean citizenship. Ultimately they were imprisoned.Their experiences as related make it clear that the government of North Korea is by no means a true Marxist state, but has devolved into a cult of personality revolving around the ruling Kim family. No imperial government in history has been more repressive, exploitative or murderous of its people. North Korea's leader is truly evil. Its brainwashed citizens are at once victims and enablers that evil. Their plight is tragic.I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawful","review":"The material is shapeless and Elvis's voice is hopeless.

But no other Ecuadorian poet has gained as much international fame as Jorge Carrera Andrade, the author of this book. In this book Jorge Carrera Andrade reflects on Spanish-American poetry. No other writer of Latin America is better capable of doing such a thing. Jorge Carrera Andrade examines Spanish-American poetry and all of its meanings, and the book's manner of teaching us about Spanish-American poetry reminds us that he was a professor of Spanish-American literature at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Since Jorge Carrera Andrade was considered not only Ecuador's finest poet, but one of this century's foremost Spanish-language poets worldwide, it is fair to say that his reflections on Spanish-American poetry are a treasure that we should protect and cherish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but good","review":"If you like the blues and only blues you should pass on that one.

Being what most of you would call OLD (over 60) my metabolism would make a turtle seem lightning fast. So I bought Lyle's book.

I have been doing the diet now for about 3-4 weeks and have finally broken my stall and lost about 6 pounds.

If you want to lose fat quickly, then Lyle McDonald will tell you how.

You'll know, step-by-step, exactly what you have to do, and exactly why you're doing it.Be forewarned: the diet isn't for the faint of heart. But weightloss is never fun; it's hard work, and generally unpleasant. But it works. The results are, frankly, stunning, and the week-by-week (and often day-by-day) changes you'll see in the mirror make the difficulty worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers the goods","review":"Lyle's title says it all.

This is their story told from a Christian perspective, because it is important for anyone interested in adoption to know that it is an act of Christian love and not just a spur of the moment, politically correct thing to do in order to get good PR.

Godspeed creates music that is relaxing, yet haunting, yet uplifting. It's very odd, they can create a song that is depressing and sad, but be uplifting at the very same time. My favorite track on this album, and my current favorite song period, is Sleep. I recommend you not hear this track until you buy the album, this song alone is worth every lasy penny that you pay for the cd. It is unbelievable and I can't even begin to explain just how.......well, how god damn good it is, for real. I highly recommend this to fans of Mogwai and Sigur Ros. So, if you like any kind of spacey, relaxing, classical/rock music, I urge you to get in your car right this very moment, drive to your nearest record store, and pay whatever amount they are asking for it, it is worth whatever they are charging.

It makes everything else just sound silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it for the 2nd disc","review":"I think shiverneck hit the nail on the head when he said the second disk was amazing. It truly is. The reason being, I think, is that GYBE! gets down to business and talks a little about life instead of the anti-religious and political mumbo-jumbo.dont get me wrong, i am pretty liberal and not religious, but i dont much like music that talks about politics and tries to make a point so blatantly. The beginning of Storm is pretty good, and so is the very end.

The music was so incredible, so beautiful, and it just drew me in. Other then that, just read other reviews if u want to read more into it. If you are into post rock at all, then u will agree this is no doubt one of the best cd's in the genre. If you are new to it, I would suggest listening to something like Mogwai first, and if u like that then go straight out and pick up this cd. I never thought that one day I would be listening to anything this, because for so long all i was listening to was Nu-metal and rock.

Not quite classical music, but definitely sounding composed, this band makes their feelings felt without the need of a voice, except for those random samplings, including recordings of ARCO gas station announcements, and an old man telling his stories of NY.

Others have reviewed the book relatively recently and said the protocol hasn't changed. This is certainly true, but a number of the sections have aged very badly, or cover topics less important in the modern world of high bandwidth links. (Proxy servers, for example, are now a lot less about bandwidth and a lot more about virus scanning and content filtering)The is also a fair amount of coverage of HTTP/1.0 and 0.9, rarely seen these days.That said, the base concepts are still valid and there are things I've learned.

In fact, get everyone to read it except for your grandmother, and you'll make the online world a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, but....","review":"As its name states, this book is a defintive guide. It provides in depth coverage of all important HTTP information in use today, ranging from the basic communications protocol, to cache control, proxies, and security mechanisms. It's extremely well written in clear, easy to understand terms.The organization of the book is one reason I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5. Material on proxies, and especially cache control, was spread through the book, rather than being located in any one area. While the basics of these are important to understanding some of the considerations in writing an HTTP application, a different organizational structure may have suited the material better.This book is still a great teaching and reference book for learning HTTP, but if you are not planning on running your own HTTP server, especially a proxy or caching server, a lot of this book is overkill. I'm sure I'll be referring to it in the future for various other kinds of HTTP information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest working Team","review":"This documentary is a non-sugar coated reality of the Tennessee Lady Vols and one of the most recognized and respected coach (Pat Summitt).

The few answering machines I found didn't have all the features we were used to with the AT&T plus most all of them got less than desirable reviews from customers. Finally I found one rebuilt AT&T 1772 on Amazon; it was expensive but it certainly had everything we were looking for since it was exactly like what we'd been using for years.

The plot concerns a heist and a cop out for revenge. The movie tries to advertise the fact that Snipes' character gets real ticked off, but it's more like slightly annoyed or frustrated. Not much of a \\"Boiling Point\\" here, just a little chip on the shoulder. Hopper, better in everything else, even \\"Waterworld\\", is completely unconvincing as the bumbling villain and Snipes, usually awesome, is reduced to saying cliche lines in a plot that's so boring it's a wonder it's based on a true story.

Its dueling leads Wesley Snipes and Dennis Hopper both have reputations for cinematic intensity. And Lolita Davidovitch is sultry enough as Snipes's shady-lady love interest. But for some reason, the ingredients don't blend well enough to 'boil', and Boiling Point instead barely rises to tepid entertainment. Perhaps it is because Boiling Point really lacks enough overall script development to elevate it to big screen status. For one thing, it takes too long for Snipes to catch the villians, thus hampering the pace with needless sting operations, backroom deals, informants, and the like. Secondly, as the heavy Dennis Hopper isn't nearly as ruthless as his thug partner Viggo Mortensen. In fact, Hopper comes off as misguided at worst! Nevertheless, the L.A. scenery is a plus, as is the costuming. Both manage to keep Boiling Point watchable.

Having said that, this product doesn't work. I was told it is incredibly easy to use. This is true. The underlying problem is that it doesn't give off much humidity. I re-fill every night, and my guitar began to crack. The same thing happened to my friend with the same product. I took my guitar to a pro repair show, and the man said he has fixed countless guitars using this humidifier. He kindly pointed me to a functioning one."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than the previous version of Planet Waves humidifier","review":"This new version, where the top flange snaps off to expose the sponge, is much easier to use than the old version. You can moisten the sponge quickly and easily without any syringe to annoy you or to lose. However, you CAN lose the top flange, and I think I finally did, somehow -- have not seen it in a while.Another benefit to this new model is that the body width -- and therefore the amount you have to displace your strings -- is less. that's good on all guitars but especially where strings are close, as on a 12-string. I've had several different types of humidifiers but now this is best I've found. (Honestly though the ones I admired most were the old plastic 35mm film film containers my friend drilled some holes in, stuffed with sponge, and would wet and toss into the guitar case. I really liked the price$ of those. . . ) Ellis"},{"rating":"1","title":"New ones worse","review":"The old ones were better. I have two and they work fine. The new one I bought is cheaply made.

If you try, you'll miss a lot of the fundamentals of JSF which could hold you back fromcustomizing your own pieces of JSF components. JSF was meant to be pluggable and highly customizable.The book offers an additional 4 chapters online which is a nice bonus. The additional chapters are not needed to fully understand JSF but could save you time if you needed tocode something similar to the chapter's example projects.With JSF In Action, I found everything I would need to program in JSF.

Filled with great standards and top arrangements, you can't go wrong with this one. The remastering is very good too. Has a nice clean treble and good presence. Sammy's take on Body and Soul may not reach the depth of Sinatra's classic version, but is still a fine reading and is definitely the highlight of this album. And it's the only one on this cd that has a trio backing, rather than the big band, so it give the song a nice intimate, after hours jazz feel. A fine rendition for sure.

Will is in fine form, delivering a heart wrenching performance and the band is spot on while still retaining a ruggedness which gives the songs character. Also, the songs are beefed up to full out hard rock mode which approaches the most ragged Neil Young or (dare I say) Pearl Jam. Tracks from the album 'Master and Everyone' benifit from this reworking, giving them a force and power that was perhaps lacking on that record. Recorded prior to the release of 'Super Wolf' you can hear the germs of that album here as 'Summer in the South East' prominently features Oldham collabrator Matt Sweeney and his more rock oriented guitar playing. The recording itself reveals what sounds like a very intimate affair with audience interaction and between song banter.

The opening track, simply entitled \\"Song\\", is a gorgeously lush combination of subdued hip-hop beats and traditional Asian musicianship, reminding listeners of Krush's own roots dug into Japan. Which is why this album works as a whole. The slight reminders of what came before are knots in the music, they hold it together, giving us a myriad of hypnotic vocals (including N'Dea Davenport, Zap Mama and Black Thought, among others) and tripnotic beats, yet all having something in common.

A very nice remote control, Auto-play for both DVD's and audio cd's (also autoplays Mp3's), very easy set-up...just plug in and let'er rip. That is where the niceties end.The Toshiba SD3950 has terrible audio, primarily on Mp3 and CD playback. The sound is distorted, it's as though the outputs are overdriven. Audio on DVD's is not all that great either. You can set up the audio to hear dialogue using the audio settings, but you sacrifice overall audio quality, this because the player raises mid-range and nearly ignores other frequencies. Thus overall audio quality is sacrificed so you can hear dialogue you may not be able to hear otherwise.Bottom line: NICE features, NICE Remote, VERY,VERY POOR audio!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not turn on after 1 day","review":"I purchased this DVD player at Best Buy and was thoroughly impressed with the quality.

Based on the novel written by the Brazilian peasant Raduan Nassar, the three-hour-long movie stands up as a work of art by Carvalho's domination of the cinematic subject, the cast's brilliant acting, its complex script, superb photography, and, of course, its musical score. Gimaraes, the composer, has reached with this soundtrack a supernatural result, which cannot be compared with any musical score in my recent memory (not even Morricone's best, which I particularly like). So, in conclusion, I recommend this soundtrack eyes wide shut. But I think the movie does not receive yet the importance it should have.

No more need in spending hundreds of dollars in levels. For the framing carpenter, all you need is a piece of tube steel long enough to reach top and bottom plates to insure a plumb wall.

There is a place for cartoons and psychedelia - for example, they were an integral, and I think valuable, part of The Old Grey Whistle Test - but here, they are totally distracting and disruptive.

C'mon... A tire comes to life and starts killing everyone in sight? Instead, what we have here is a very funny, very literate, and very absurd little film with some great performances.I fear that explaining what goes on will ruin the pleasure of discovery for those who would appreciate this movie.

However, being original doesn't always mean it's entertaining. Whenever someones head isn't exploding onscreen, Rubber is excruciatingly boring. The story and the script are both pretty bad, as are a lot of the characters. Oh, but Rubber does have gore. If 1981's Scanners was the Citizen Cane of head explosion movies, then Rubber is the Gone With The Wind of head explosion movies.

And to think I put 4 bucks in their pocket. If you want to waste your money, go ahead, I did.

It thinks it's much funnier than it is. I couldn't muster up even a chuckle.So you say, I don't get it. Maybe. But I'm not an average viewer who needs to be spoon fed the plot. But I do expect in a dark comedy to smile, laugh or chuckle. Nothing.Imagine if someone combined Castaway with Special Dead, stir in a dead pan delivery and you have this movie. It's slow, with no climax and the ending, while not abrupt, does cop out (pun intended).

The acting appears uninspired, there are long drawn out scenes with minimal action or dialogue, and no real plot advancement to maintain one's interest.

Someone thinks that either readers are a little naive or the author must be naive to have learned such commonsense at such a mature age.

Each chapter comes across as if it were conceived independently of the others. Biographical information about Bill Porter is repeated numerous times, and a fair amount of time is spent talking about the author's own life issues. Halfway through the book I found myself skimming paragraphs and whole pages, looking to get back to the thrust of the story about Bill Porter.If you are looking for a biography of Bill Porter, this is not it.

His life merits recognition, not just because he overcame the obstacles of his disability, but even more for his humble view of his own remarkable achievements. Bill's story is even more compelling when compared to the author's life history. The book suggests author Shelly Brady is looking for money and fame in the name of a truly great individual. She even includes letters sent to Bill from people who have seen the 20/20 segment featuring Bill which refer to Shelly as an \\"angel.\\" ...

And in his optimism he will not allow his limitations to interfere with his daily course of living and ultimately succeeding. In the book, Bill mentioned his special friend (and author of this book) Shelly Brady as his &#65533;angel&#65533;.

Unlike other romances I have read, this one had no plot at all. A girl finds her sisters being mistreated, she runs away to the west, and meets a guy, they fall in love, and she helps him get better after an injury intended for his brother. It was very very \\"corny\\" (for lack of a better word). I'm sorry, but I'm an avid historian, and 99.9% of men didn't, and still don't, get all \\"mushy\\" over a woman. The ending was very dissapointing, where the brothers finally got to \\"get it on\\" with their new wives that they were so much \\"in love with\\".

But I was apalled to find EXTREMELY graphic sexual descriptions that excited the emotions far more profoundly than the most vivid R-rated movie one could find. Never mind the \\"brilliance\\" of the story line. I could not agree with the first reviewer more. One with any conscience of God's law at all would not be able to even begin to enjoy the story line because of the dominant theme of sexuality, immorality, violence, and the like that pervades the entire story.

Certainly, they weren't people you wanted hanging around your subconscious for very long, let along having to think of them intimately all the time you were writing.

When it opens, the TT fits very will into your hand, and the edges of the hidden area actually help you hold on while you write. Being able to listen to music allows a mix of both business-related and fun uses for the TT as well. The color screen is amazing as well, allowing for a lot more uses of the TT.The only thing I don't like about the palm is the cradle. It doesn't really cradle the TT, and it's a little on the annoying side.

I have had to soft reset it a number of times (more often than my old Palm) but it's speed and colour clarity is simply amazing. The digital voice recorder works very well, have been able to easily convert the .wav files into audio cd format, very handy.Overall, a great unit, very pocketable, sturdy, with input applications like jot/newpen, there's no need to extend the unit to access the grafiti section. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding machine","review":"Wow...this thing does so much!! Software included has Word, Excel and Powerpoint programs that are excellent.

I am a teacher and use it for a lot of data entry, calculation, and organizing and it is time consuming and aggravating to have to double-check all the time to ensure that the correct item is going in the correct field. I was dismayed to discover within these reviews that this is a glitch that is endemic to all model T's. I am even more upset to discover that it eventually just breaks! At the price I paid, I expected to get several years of use out of it. I am hesitant to replace a defective product with a product from the same company, especially if Palm is not backing up their product with a meaningful solution (as is reported elsewhere in these reviews)."},{"rating":"2","title":"bluetooth bluetooth bluetooth","review":"i just replaced my Sony Clie 615 with the tungsten and i dont regret it 1 bit.firstly i also have a t68i with GPRS plus an apple ibook with a bluetooth adapter. the tungsten works flawlessly synching with isync on my mac.I also use my tungsten to surf the web using my bluetooth t68i phone.

Instead of a course that would guide one into a state to receive or project out this is a hard nose fast pace exercise. The exercises are difficult and have a series of indepth info sheets that must be filled out and then all combined to come up with your target. Also, the homework you must do requires an outside person picking targets for you putting them in envelopes and numbering them. This is not a relaxed technique but like taking an entrance exam or those tedious Iowa tests we had in school.All in all from what I did I found it stressful, overwhelming with the amount of work needed to do all the different levels of identifying a target and the inability to get the homework done.

And in those ambiguities lie the greatest turmoil and conflict, with no real answers. What did the brother mean when he referred to a \\"big louse hunt\\"? Clearly, he was involved in criminal activities (\\"plenty of loot!\\"), and clearly, he was coarsened by the war (\\"fodder for my MG\\"). But was he involved in atrocities? Did he murder civilians?

The general consesus in my class is that this is a very difficult book to comprehend. Everything seems like it's been abstracted to the n-th degree. Variables are frequently used without reference to definitions, which in many cases appear in earlier sections. It's a pain to try to look up something then have to hunt around for the meaning of all the components used in the definition. That's not to say this book isn't informative, it just takes a lot of work to glean useful information from it. As a student, I prefer books that are easy to reference.

It has very good worked examples and the exercises in the end of every chapter are challenging and very interesting at the same time. The first 6 chapters are a review of linear algebra, geometry and analysis, so they are a little bit dense, but that is the way it should be since you are reviewing. I read the first 6 chapters in a few days and it really refreshed my memory with many forgotten concepts. The other chapters are very well presented and have clear examples.The algorithms presented in the conjugate gradients chapter and in the Quasi-Newton's methods chapter are the ones used in the engineering nowadays (for instance DFP or BFGS) for solving non linear problems, and the chapter on simplex method also presents the simplex in a smooth but deep fashion.I took the course with one of the authors (Dr. Zak) in Purdue and I believe it was one of the most useful courses I ever took."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for undergrads!","review":"I have a really difficult time with this book and often find myself having to do tons of outside research to comprehend the material.

Carroll is a surprise as the elderly pastor, Father Fitzgibbon. Who knew that he could take on an Irish brogue, dance a jig, and sing a delightful Irish tune? I didn't remember Dick York at all from the series when it was first on TV, but he is believable in the role of the youth center director (a role not in the film).

What a disappointment! The Prologue starts off wrong by omitting the signature whistle signal of the Jets that is so captivating. The Jet Song is horrid, with an insertion by the Jets gang that sounds like chorus boys from The Producers doing a gig in Las Vegas. The two principals have fine voices, but the casting is totally mixed up. Hayley Westenra as Maria has a lovely American accent, while Vittorio Grigolo as Tony has an operatic Italian accent. So in listening to the recording, you basically have to pretend that Maria (or should I say Mary) is the native-born, and Tony (short for Anton, or should I say Antonio) is the immigrant. Thankfully Anita and the Sharks gang carry themselves well enough. If you want to enjoy a recording of West Side Story, I guess you need to stick to the original cast.

Not what is needed for one of Braodway's greatest shows. Hayley Westenra as Maria has a nice voice and is well able for the range, but without any show experience delivers a bland, uninteresting performance.

It's not as though they even used big names for the recording,ie: the complete recording a while back with Kiri Te Kanawa and Jose Careras had their names to recommend it, and it was produced by Bernstein, but this recording has nothing to recommend.Stick to the original cast for the best recording. There is also a recording by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra that is pretty good, aside from a bit of over-acting by some ensemble members, but the leads are wonderful.And the film soundtrack has it's own merits, but this is a major mistake.

This review may be redundant, but I want to point out how many people have said they've been hunting for this album. It's amazing that one album produced by a short-lived, obscure band could attract such a loyal following and elicit such enthusiastic reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science Fiction, Romance... what more does a reader need?","review":"This book was delightful from beginning to end.

Definately not serious literature - must have been a very weak year in the Commonwealth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Been There: She's Got it Right","review":"In this novel of love lost, St. John provides a realistic portrait of a woman unceremoniously dumped. I've been in Nicola's shoes and the range of emotions she experiences is dead on target. St. John accurately captures those lingering feelings of love, the anger, and then the realization that some parts of you are permenently broken after such an experience. Sure, it's a sad sad thing...but St. John incorporates humor and wisdom nicely.I would go so far as to compare it to \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" although a more serious look at modern love and commitment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too clever by half......","review":"The author appears to have swallowed the dictionary. I noticed other reviews here that mention the same thing. We don't need to know how vast a vocabulary an author has - the reader needs to find a story comprehensible. Too make it even more of a chore, the author decided to throw in numerous French expressions/words. I also couldn'tunderstand much of the dialogue between the characters. I winced every time the word 'whizzy' was used. That was complete nonsense. I don't see how this could have been a contender for the Booker. The characters were one-dimensional and I couldn't care less about them. I suggest people don't waste their money on this trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this novel, especially after reading all the good reviews it received here. Although the topic was original, it lacked creativity and exploration of human feelings. The author relied heavily on the conversations, and even so, these were very brief. Unfortunately, I absorbed nothing out of this novel, and not once did I feel connected with the protagonist. Even now, I really don't believe this captured \\"the essence of the thing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"On Being Dumped and Being Dignified","review":"In contrast to an American character, who might wallow in self-pity, eat Haagen-Das and plot revenge, Nicola takes the high road when unceremoniously dumped by Jonathan, her live-in lover of five years. Deeply shocked, she maintains her love for him and her belief in herself through the process of finding out what happened, why he's asking her to leave, and accepting the outcome of that process.Madeleine St. John uses realistic and often witty dialogue between peripheral characters to demonstrate how the break up of two people can have an effect on almost everyone they know. Although she writes with a light touch, she explores the relationship dynamics between four other couples while giving play to the fragility of any love relationship. The Essence of the Thing is a quick and entertaining read, but it could not be described as shallow by any stretch of the imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing, but without lingering impact","review":"This book is a compact collection of scenes which take place during the end of a relationship, along with remembrances of earlier times. Ms. St. John has a complete grasp of the ebb and flow of dialogue through which she unerringly creates the clear presence of the characters and situation, capturing both the humour and poignancy which the spoken word sometimes achieves. The context is also one to which most readers will undoubtedly find certain resonance from their own experiences. However, despite the book being thoroughly enjoyable, and inducing great appreciation for the craftsmanship, I was left with only the faintest lingering taste of the story after it was finished. That in itself is not necessarily an unpleasant sensation, but do not read this book with the expectation of wrenching, emotional reverberations."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does hurt that way","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that this novel relies heavily on dialogue, but, contrary to what that reviewer thought, I didn't feel that this detracted from it in any way. I also thought that it relied pretty heavily on emotions, and some of them are depicted so well it's scary. I know the feeling - the sheer horror - of trying to imagine life, a long life full of long days, without the person you love. Nicola's utter despair was completely recognizable for me - she is a character I could empathise with. Granted, it may not be a very deep-probing novel, the characters may not be drawn in too much detail, but it is a novel that manages to convey certain awful feelings, and portray some dreary situations, in a compassionate and realistic way. And that is no minor achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frighteningly true to life....","review":"The Essence of the Thing captured the modern relationship between a man and a woman. It explored what happened as the relationship disintegrated, leaving one partner in shocked disbelief and emotional pain. What I loved about the book was that it showed so clearly the idiosyncrasies of the human personality and how the quality you think you love most about a person ends up being the very thing that drives you apart. It leaves you slightly unsettled and thinking. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy and Practical","review":"I bought a set of 6 glasses as a gift for my daughter. I had a chance to put them to the test as we shared dinner recently at her house.

Even my 8-yr-old grandson could handle them easily by the colorful stem. Good Choice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Reading all of the other reviews for these glasses, and at such a nice price, I didn't hesitate to purchase these glasses! I was overly confident and donated all of my old glasses, the day it said they were out for delivery. :(The glasses are indeed very beautiful, but, based on the other reviews, I feel like I received a box of rejects! One had a few unattractive bubbles in it and four had little chips all around the base! I'm afraid I'll scratch my table to pieces if I use these! My husband bought these for me as a gift and I don't want to tell him how unhappy I am with these. So I won't be contacting the seller, because it's always such a mess trying to get things replaced and I refuse to pay for return shipping, yet again, on an item I bought in good confidence, only to receive more bad product. So, I guess we'll be drinking out of plastic kid cups and tea cups until I can find a decent replacement. Sooooo disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ritzy glasses!","review":"These glasses are elegant, and even make me thirsty to look at them. They hold a lot and have just a slight tint. You will not be sorry when you hold one of these beauties in your hand. The glass is fine and feel good in your mouth, like a good wine glass does. Great for ice tea, beer and even margaritas and gin and tonic. Makes water look more appetizing. I have not broken any, even though they go in the dishwasher. Love them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glasses!","review":"I personally love the goblet style glasses, and always get compliments from my guests.

It is pretty light, which is vital for long running and walking.Again, I am a bit biased, so take my review for a grain of salt.

The Micro Round still worked, you just had to let it run down. I purchased this one a year ago and it seems just as good as the first (stopping mechanism still working too). This time I did try the large version first but returned it because it is weight activated and lots of things are too light. I don't want to have to get a plate out for weight every time I use it. This one you just wind up and it starts unless you use the stopping feature. I don't even use that feature. I wind my up using the bottom of the microwave to push down against, don't overwind it and usually just let it wind down. You learn how many turns last how many minutes. It's a must have if your microwave dosen't already have a carousel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, plodding, perverse, and poorly made","review":"This black and white film is about on par with _Big Brother_ in its plodding insipidness. The film is hard to follow through the endless still-camera shots of pointless and redundant conversations and the director's obsession with masturbation. The characters aren't just quirky, they're farcical--one even appears to have joke store teeth. Fotopolous casts unengaging actors as characters neither intelligent nor interesting in a story that, really lacking any clarity, appears to be about a woman whose situation forces her into a career as a porn star, which she must to masked after her face is scarred. I think. I'm all for ambiguity as long as your mise-en-sc��ne, camerawork, or editing is interesting, but sitting through this at the Naptown Underground Film Festival, which also had many of Fotopoulos's masturbation-obsessed shorts, was a major chore. If anything, this is more an effort at being offensive than an effort to make art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the part number","review":"I have an R717 camera. I bought the dock too.

The other battery is the L1812B and is identical in every way except its edges are rounded and that makes enough difference to allow it to easily slide out of the camera.

Delightful Book!","review":"My 4-year-old daughter, who is fascinated with ballerinas, has enjoyed every Angelina book I have read to her.

In the story, Angelina finds a large envelope containing two tickets to see Serena Silvertail perform with the Royal Ballet. But each time she asks a friend to attend with her, they have other plans! This cleverly designed book features page-sized envelopes containing actual tickets, letters, and postcards that children can pull out and read. My daughter's favorite is the large pull-out poster of the Cindermouse ballet. The only problem we have had is that my less-than-gentle 2.5-year-old daughter was also eager to enjoy this book. I've repaired a few envelopes with tape and I have to verify the pull-outs are still inside the flaps before reading the story again. Definitely recommended reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revere 2 Qt. Steamer","review":"This is a very useful product. However the brushed finish requires that you avoid using salt on the vegetables to avoid rusting of the interior. Even the rust remover recommended by Revere did not get rid of the rust permanently.

Expecting the problem other Amazon reviews had noted with the over-glued label (which was accurate) I set the new steamer in a pan of hot water when it arrived and soaked it for a few hours. I then scraped off the very resistant label, and cleaned the remaining glue off with Bar Keepers Friend. I like this steamer much more than the previous type. I put the base pot of water on to boil while I prepare what I want to steam. Using this time saving step I do not find this steamer takes any longer to cook vegetables. I also enjoy being able to poor the hot vegetables out of a pot rather than handling an unstable collapsible utensil. I love it. It's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I loved this book.

But still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!","review":"I have only recently started to read Ms. Schone and have enjoyed all of her books.(Own them all now)This book struck a real cord in me. Her telling of Gabriel's story is heart wrenching and touching beyond words. You can feel his pain in many of the scenes. It made me laugh and cry more then once. She made me understand what it would be like to be a man and to have such brutality foced on him. A woman can try to explain the emotion of rape on a woman, but on a man? She did a fabulous job in the emotion that was displayed and his reaction to Victoria's lessons of love. I truely LOVED this book and have read it 3 times because it only gets better. Reader beware it is graphic!But if you have ever read any of her other books then you would already know that. Please enjoy Gabriel's story. It is one that you won't soon forget!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I was a little apprehensive about reading this book after reading the reviews about it being as dark as the Lover. However the character Gabriel drew me to see if he could bury his past and be happy again. This is a wonderful book about the power of compassion, love and friendship. Although it is dark and sinister as the Lover, it provides a positive message. We all need to be touched and loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"There is absolutely no chemistry or heat between these two characters. The hero and heroine spent minimal time together, and I don't think they even kissed more than twice.

The most intense relationship is the one between Gabriel and \\"the second man.\\" There's been mention of homosexual overtones - I think that is a bit overstated...the real story is not between our lovers, but how much hate and fear Gabriel has that needs to be overcome before he can love again. Frankly, there was little heat between the two main characters, I don't think they even kissed before page 200.

Sorry I paid good money for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that erotic at all","review":"This book is deemed an erotic novel right on the cover (making me slightly embarassed while purchasing) but much to my surprise, it really wasn't all that! The author does a nice job of laying out the emotional depth of Gabriel but the sex is mostly very clinical and not much of it at that. Some authors do a poor job of characterization but good eroticism (i.e., Thea Devine, the master of stupid dialogue and baffling characters) and some like Ms. Schone seem to be the opposite. I know her novels are meant to have a dark, hardcore edge but the problem is that she just doesn't do it that well, at least in this book. So not worth the $15 dollars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, what a waste of time.......","review":"I was waiting for a great story and what I discover is another endless collection of plain garbage disguised as a story of dark angels. Phooey. Yes, this is fiction but why have absurd characters doing absurd things?? Why not create interesting people who do believable things??

This is without a doubt one of the best novels of any kind I've ever read in my life. If you're looking for something a level or two spicier than Harlequin, this book is not for you. This book is so much more. Unlike any 'standard' romance, the women in this book, Victoria and Anne, display a level of compassion, honesty, and understanding not common to the genre at all. And the relationship between Gabriel and Michael is the hottest, most compelling, and most intriguing part of the entire novel. You ache for these two by the last chapter.The author skillfully avoids easy stereotypes and categorizing by displaying the entire emotional depth and range of her characters. I love the way this book explores love and desire in all its forms.

Everything he has recorded , so far, has been compelling and easy to listen to (I don't understand Spanish, but I understand what he is passionately singing about. The music and his vocal approach is very promising). It's hard for me to pick a favourite C.D. amongst his non-English speaking albums, but I've written this review with the \\"Vivir\\" album, because I liked his rendition of \\"Solo En Ti\\", which I instantly recognized as the old, U.K. hit by Yazoo (Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet), \\"Only You\\".

I would say the last song, Revolucion, is the worst on the cd for it's senseless lyrics and funky drum rolls in the middle of the phrases.

I understand Spanish, but even if you don't - it makes no difference. Believe me, you will feel it in his voice.My two favorite ballads are Enamorado Por Primera Vez and Tu Vacio.

I decided to take a chance on this one based on the raves of the cover art. BIG MISTAKE. This \\"film\\" is pure garbage. It's totally without merit and incomprehensible. The \\"acting\\" is atrocious and there is no apparent script. This is just a series of graphic sexual encounters between two vacant individuals.

So It really doesn't pick up muchCon: Vents - Due to their location end up blowing stuff around as you try to vacuum it up.Con: Due to width of vacuum, and having no skinny extension arm, you cannot reach small areas such as the ones in your car. The whole point of getting a cordless vac was so that I could vacuum my car. I live in a condo so have no outlet access by my car).Con: Poor sucking powerCon: Battery stopped charging after 5 months. 1st authorized Hoover dealer I contacted would not honor the warranty (they wanted cash up front) and the 2nd authorized Hoover Dealer is about an hour drive from where I live.

Who are these people giving this item multiple stars? Are they crazy? Using this is like vacuuming with a soda straw. This is the most worthless bit of trash I have ever bought. Probably because of the way it is designed. The base of the nozzle--the part that actually touches the floor measures 3 inches by one inch--BUT look again. The actual hole through which things are sucked, measures a tiny one inch by 1/2 an inch! That is less than one square inch of suction.

It was working fine Friday, went to pick up a pile of dust I swept up on Saturday amidst some home remodelling, and {silence} nothing. The button clicked and I smelled smoke. Not good. Honestly, I never loved this unit. You have to depress the button while you vacuum, making it difficult for my children to use and the recepticle is difficult to empty. Prior to this I had the Cone Vacuum, that I LOVED, but after stupidly using it to clean up a damp mess, it died.

It only picked up half, if that much, of the mess I was trying it on, and the mess was all small particles, so the machine was not clogged. When I tried cleaning the carpeted stairs, I could barely even tell that the vacuum was ran over it.Aside from needing more suction power, I think the machine would work better if the tip of the nozzle were a different design, or had small bristles attached, in order to disturb the dirt for easier cleaning. The flat surface surrounding the nozzle makes it rough to glide over messes without spreading them.And, I dislike the fact that I need to constantly hold down the button in order for the vacuum to run.I only used this vacuum once, and will probably not use it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"works better than i thought!","review":"other than the small dirt chamber (expected) this unit is great. well constructed. convenient mounting & charging station. call me crazy but I want to purchase another one so I have one on each floor of my house."},{"rating":"1","title":"... returned right away","review":"The battery hardly lasted 3 minutes at full charge.

I recently found the reason this vacuum wasn't holding a charge. I was told by Hoover Customer Service that I needed a new charging unit that it plugs into. This also was NOT the cause. The holder that it sits in and hangs on the wall was the culprit. The part of the charger that plugs into the vacuum was not going up into the unit far enough to charge it properly. A little alteration to the plastic wall holder did the job. I enlarged the hole that allowed the charger plug to sit higher in the frame and now it charges just fine. Looks like others would have noticed the same reason it was not working like it should. I'm going to call Hoover Customer Service and fill them in. NOW the vacuum works just the way I hoped it would when I purchased it.

Enter the Hoover s1120 Hand Held Vacuum.It has good power, and seems to hold a charge pretty well. Emptying the dust cup is not too difficult once you get the hang of it, and its pretty light and easy to hold while you do stairs.I only gave it four stars because it has three flaws, which I can live with:1) You have to hold down the power button THE ENTIRE TIME you run it, which can cause your finger to get sore when doing a larger cleaning job2) The end where the dirt gets sucked in has only a small opening for the dust, which tends to clog up frequently, especially when cleaning pet hair3) It seems to be kind of loudOther than that I see no problems with this hand vac and would recommend it to anyone who can see past those flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow nozzle, clogs easily","review":"This hand vac has a one-inch opening into a very small tube that clogs easily.

I'm not sure if this is a problem for most cordless vacuums, but I know I'm getting a corded handheld next time.My first complaint is that it takes forever to fully charge (to fully charge it can take several hours or more), and the charge life is extremely low. I noticed it losing power after only 10 minutes of continued use.As many other people have been saying, the suction power is also incredibly weak (and narrow!). I literally have to go over the same spot several times to pick everything up.I wish I was able to return it, but we've had it too long now.In addition, having to hold down the \\"on\\" switch in order to power it is a pain! Imagine having to hold that down while maneuvering it with the same hand. Poor design in my opinion.

I had it mounted behind the fridge (don't ask why) and it was a reach, to say the least. So I'm not sure if it was the design of the charger or the awkward location I put it in, causing the charging problem.

With great effort I managed to pull it apart just to see if I could and then tried using it. The dirt doesn't collect in the cup but goes into the filter which, at least for me, has been almost impossible to remove and clean.

The culprit was a dying battery.I was informed, however, by my friendly vacuum dealer that the replacement battery for this vacuum costs nearly as much as the entire vacuum. So...my vacuum ended up in the recycling bin.Besides the short battery life I experienced, I found this vacuum to have an especially irritating design: it has vents on the side of the motor box that blow air out. If you are trying to pick up pet hair from the floor, this can create a real challenge, if not an impossible task. I would have to sneak up on the hair most times to try to avoid the air flow blowing it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value in a hand vac","review":"I'm very pleased with this hand vac that I use mainly to pick up stray litter (two cats) and crumbs from kitchen floor and counter. Only drawback that I wish I had known is that you must hold the on switch on. You can't just switch it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price, but more power would be better","review":"I own one of these, and also a Black & Decker. The Hoover one is perfectly usable. I use it mainly for cleaning up cat litter, dried cat food, etc. It is pretty good for this task. It does get the stuff up, and it charges enough to do this task to completion, so I'm fairly satisfied. I will say though that I prefer the Black and Decker to this one for two reasons:1. The Black and Decker has more power, thus I spend less time going over and over the spot (since it sucks up more the first time).2. The Black and Decker is easier to clean out. With the Black and Decker, you just pop the top off and pour the sand or whatever into the trash. With the Hoover, it takes a few more steps (usually have to remove the filter).Overall though, This little handivac is a good unit and perfectly usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific wet/dry vacuum","review":"I had this handheld vac for a few years and used it for wet and dry cleanup. It was always excellent. I dropped it and broke it (my fault) and ordered another because nothing else comes close to what it does for the price. I even used this for picking up water when my water heater flooded my dining room. Yes, it worked under those conditions. Of course, it didn't prevent water damage but I used it over and over to vacuum large amounts of water and it kept on working. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for clean up after the kids","review":"This is a great hand vac for cleaning up the crumbs after the kids are done eating. It's easy to clean with it's washable filter and has good suction. My only gripes are that the opening is a little small and a skittle will not fit, but a cheerio will. Putting the unit back together after a cleaning takes a little force."},{"rating":"1","title":"works for 20seconds","review":"I bought this item because there is always a mess to clean up. I was so excited when the delivery came and got to try out my completely new hand held vacuum. I charged the battery for 16 hours. 16 Hours later the vacuum only ran for literally 20 seconds. After 20 seconds, the battery starts to run out, the suction strength decreases. I was very mad! It is true that the vacuum is a convenience in cleaning wet and dry messes, but it is absolutely not a convenience when I have to return something that I expect to work but doesn't at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not perform as promised, design is flawed","review":"I got this because I needed something that could clean up a variety of messes (I have 3 kids). Pretty much all it's good for is vaccuming up PILES of dirt. It does not have strong suction at all. It barely holds a charge.Most annoying of all, the \\"on\\" button has to be held down during use. I vaccuumed a flight of stairs and my wrist was very stiff and painful afterwards from having to push down on the button with my thumb. It is now sitting in my closet, only to be used in place of a dustpan when I sweep arounf the wood stove."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY!","review":"I wanted a small cordless vacuum that I could use to clean out my car and I was very impressed with this small vac right away!

If God wanted to save the animals by a miracle - fine, but that's not what The Bible says. If He wants Noah to save them by building an ark - forget it! They would have to be miniaturized like the people in 'Fantastic Voyage'.What about evidence of a flood? Forget that too!

I could not find an alternate style at that time. I run marathons and lift weights, and let me tell you, the formerly white armband is white no longer. The material is not stretchy enough for weight-lifting either. I have to adjust it a couple of times during weight workouts as my muscles get swollen w/ excess blood flow as I lift. When I wear the armband with the device while running, I have noticed that sweat pools in the little USB receptacle. My Shuffle (w/ which I am also disappointed) became rusty at the USB portion and has had to be replaced twice since March 2005. I tried to get my money back the second time, but to no avail.

It's huge, cumbersome, and uncomfortable. The worst part is that it's not elastic at all - just a hard rubberized canvas strap - so if you actually put it around your arm, it's alternately too loose and too tight as your arm muscle flexes just during a normal range of motion.Plus, locating your Shuffle on your arm for jogging or running is just a bad idea.

(Incidentally, the accent seems to be shifting around again from Purcell' to Pur'cell, to Purcell'.

A TV version, which I taped some time ago, had edited out all of the 1960's angst. So when I got the CD I was very disappointed with these 1960's interruptions. At the time, the description of the CD was lacking this important fact! So I still use the old TV taped version when I want to see this film. You've heard of the \\"who dun it\\" type of film?

The plot limped along thanks to a seemingly endless series of convenient coincidences, constantly painting itself into a corner and suddenly finding a secret trap door. After all that, the ending was a rushed little chapter tacked on without tying up half the loose ends. It was like author Bill Kent just got sick of writing the thing and stopped.

I followed the seasoning instructions that came with the wok to the letter, boiling the water in the pan, scrubbing the whole pan, and seasoning...etc. But I notice the bottom of the pan starts to get uneven, it does not lay flat on my ceramic stove top, so it won't transfer heat evenly. I then tried scramble eggs with my seasoned pan, and because it's my first use, I really just put quite a bit of oil in it, but the scramble eggs still sticks badly, and as I tried to clean off the sticking food on the pan, the previously seasoned layer flakes off from the bottom of the pan. This pan gets uneven bottom after proper seasoning, even with oil, still sticks badly. I have to return this pan, because this is just not a quality pan I have expected with this purchased.

Ms. Davis has played the spoiled rich beautiful young woman before, as in Jezebel, and done it well, but the characters around her were written well also, and the costumes worked well, not so in Mr. Skefington.The story is simply unbelievable. Mr. Skefington, Claude Rains, plays a proud man who came from a poor family, but because of his intellect and ability, became a rich, smart and shrewed business man. From that character, he is turned into a blitering idiot after he meets Bette. He allows her to turn him into a weak and naive man without any strenght of character. Also in this film, Bette's very high pitched voice, which got higher as she got older was nerve wracking. This part was not for Ms. Davis or Mr. Raines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bette Davis","review":"Good movie...makes you really feel for Mr. Skeffington, but Bette Davis' character gets her comeuppance at the end.

The trouble is trying to collect a group of her films. She had so many \\"periods\\" and styles throughout a long career.

More than that, three of the five were made right in a row. Mildred Pierce, Humoresque, and Possessed are three of her best films, but including them all here doesn't help toward giving an overview of her film career. Purchasing Volume Two helps the situation; there are more from her earlier MGM days.

Four of the five films come from Joan's Warner years (including her Oscar-winning material from Mildred Pierce and Oscar-nom for Possessed). Humoresque -- a film mixed with romance, music and tragdey is a masterpiece. The Women -- an all-woman cast blended with cattiness and gossip and one of the first movies Joan plays a b**** in. The Damned Don't Cry -- based on a true story a woman who leaves her sad, dissatified homelife that lands her in the crime world.

Balkan Ghosts enforces the West's belief that mass-murder in the Balkans is a tradition, and that this makes the groups there somehow unique in world history. This is a crock, and incredibly unfair to all sides. It is an increasingly common trend for writers to use the Balkans to flex hithero unseen intellectual muscle by quoting West, Reed, and the Mountain Wreath. Writers now do this to gloss over their lack of understanding of the region. Kaplan does this throughout, and he paints a picture of those in the Balkans as animals. Balkan Ghosts should not be included in any \\"shopping list\\" of scholarly works. Kaplan's other works are worthwhile, but this one is NOT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased Tour de Force","review":"'Balkan Ghosts' is an impressionistic tour de force of the Balkan. It doesn't come near Rebecca West's masterpiece 'Black Lamb and Gray Falcon' - but it is a travelogue in the same tradition. The author, who is acquainted with certain parts of the Balkan, crosses these tortured lands just prior to the Yugoslav wars of secession. His prognoses are accurate, his depiction of ancient ethnic enmities sweeping, his pessimism justified in hindsight. But too many important aspects are neglected or papered over. The responsibility of the West, the interplay of big powers, the ineptitude of international organizations, the forces of democracy and ethnic reconciliation in the region, religious co-existence and much more besides. Though one sided and biased, it is a must read - if only to understand what influenced the American administration of Bill Clinton in the formulation of its Balkan policies.

There are two tracks going from north to south. The western track follows the Adriatic Sea down to Greece while the inland eastern track begins with Hungary and ends with northern Turkey.The Author travels both tracks, spending a bit more time along the eastern track, particularly Rumania and Bulgaria. His contribution to history comes from a ground view of interviews with people along his path. As opposed to the view from 30,000 feet, the Author's ground level travels allows him to record pictures of life as experienced by the people whose homes were in the Balkans.Balkan Ghosts is an interesting book that sheds light on some historic events."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Ghosts Here!!!!!!","review":"A friend sent me a copy of this book, and I eagerly tore into it that night -- I was in the mood for some oldtimey frights, and this collection of historical ghost stories from other planets (or wherever) seemed like just the ticket.

If this Kaplan pseudo-historian only knew how things will evolve in Balkans he would probably be more focused on truth then to the serb myths. And one of the main reasons why one should not waste time on this book is : This so-called writer Kaplan writes a book about Balkan's history without once mentioning the Illyrianswho were the first people in the Balkans. How stupid, and I bet even this serb influenced Kaplan realises that, after all what happened to the Balkan states like Croatia,Bosnia and Kosova.My advice to future historians would be : Stick with the truth if your goal is to be a published writer because if you don't and you get published you'll remain stupid forever. I mean books survive somehow and eventually they get read by someone even after thousands of years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be a scholar of Balkans, but definitely not their son","review":"It is simply bothersome to read something so willfully manipulated through a lens of Western superiority...the book aims to impress, rather than to convey any real historical progression. Unfortunately, many readers' opinions about the Balkans become shaped by sadly misguided pretenders, who will probably remain outsiders, no matter how long they live in a foreign place. The Balkans are quite diverse and the poor writer assumes that extrapolating from their common past under Ottoman rule he can really know them. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Surprised","review":"I loved Mr. Kaplan's work - it was amasing. I was born and raised in Bulgaria, and I've never met a Western who tried his best (and almost succeeded) to understand the rich cultural heritage of the Balkan peoples, the reasons why we fight and hate each other. Mr. Kaplan's style is fabulous...you can see the proud mountains, the dark people, the beautifull churches. I don't agree with his point in presenting Orthodox Christianity as a fanatic religion, or it would be better to say - Orthodox Christians as fanatic followers...But as a whole the book provides the reader with a great deal of true facts, and I must say that Mr. Kaplan succeeded in understanding the passions ruling this place, a frightfull mix-up of races, who live together without mingling.. I would like to thank Mr. Kaplan for doing such a GREAT work in presenting our history and our habits. Thank you.

Kaplan's observations can sometimes be as subjective as his travel plans, but I've read this book twice (the second time after the NATO action in Serbia/Kosovo) and it holds up as a good primer (albeit subjective and incomplete) of Balkan history.

The absence of direct rule by a great power has created trouble spots such as the Middle East, Caucasus, and the Balkans. The book does a pretty good job in providing an insight on the national psychologies of most Balkan nations. After reading the book the impression I got is that the desire for ethnic and religious dominance over others to be the main cause for the regional instability in the Balkans. Serbs vs Croats, Bulgarians vs Serbs, Greeks vs Bulgarians, Romanians vs. Hungarians, Orthdox vs Catholic, Orthodox + Catholic vs Muslims, etc. (you name it)The author is disproportionately focused on the subject of Jews of the Balkans where they have always constituted a very small percent of the population. The Gypsies on the other hand are rarely mentioned.I recommend this book.

Stoker, the 19-th century irish author of Dracula is to him a major source of information about Transylvanian history and for the 20-th century he adds some english lady lost in the Balkans and known for her mellodramaitzed vision of reality. 10000 words do not reach to shead some light in the mess up he makes babout Balkan hisotry. But he is, like Stoker, a master myhtigation and he hepls the unadverted redear confirm his most vile presumtions and prejudice. Like so many reviews of this book confirm it, he will feel proud that a smart writer (and Kaplan is one), confirms what he always supsected and lends arguments to his clean prejudice, helping keep his black and white world in order. DISGUSTING, but EFFICIENT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninformed","review":"Sure, the book is an interesting read. But it should not be labeled as history nor taken seriously by analysts, scholars, or policy-makers. It is completely uninformed and provides no delineation between fact and fiction. And considering how seriously it was taken by the Clinton administration (which Kaplan himself writes about), I feel he should personally be held accountable for the administration's subsequent strategy of non-intervention in Bosnia. Maybe he wasn't expecting Clinton to buy into his ideas whole-heartedly (and we'd expect Clinton to have done his homework better), but Kaplan is at fault for writing such a distorted book.Some of the other reviewers recommended alternative sources of (actual) history - Ramet, Gordy, Wachtel, or Woodward."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book to my students","review":"Mr. Kaplan is entitled to his own opinions. However, as a teacher of history, I am entitled to my own opinion too. I would not recommend this book to my students. It incites prejudice and bias towards a region of the world that actually has a quite different history and culture than the one depicted by the author. I am a US teacher of history and a history buff and I could not accept so much inaccuracy and bias from a book that calls itself \\"A Journey Through History\\". In my opinion, this is not a book of history, not a journalistic account, and not a travel book either, so what is it? I do not know. In my opinion, the book has no value as any type of literature. I returned the book to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on","review":"If this had been published in the 1940s, it could be looked upon as a decently entertaining travelogue and its poor understanding of Balkan history could be excused as a relic of a different time (much like a poor man's Rebecca West). However, as this book was the first to come out in the wake of the Yugoslav wars in English, it had a very unfortunate influence on opinions and policies in the West from 1992-1994. Kaplan lacks the ability to distinguish history from mythology, and this book is riddled with factual inaccuracies and conceptual misinterpretations. Readers looking for a good Balkan-history themed travelogue set at the start of the recent wars would do much better to read Brian Hall's The Impossible Country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbeatable guide","review":"After completing a two month journey through the Balkans, I came to the conclusion that nothing had helped me more to get my feet wet than Robert Kaplan's Balkan Ghosts. His insight into one of the most fascinating parts of the world was the best starting pont to understand it. Not suprisingly, many of the people I talked to in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Kosovo or Croatia, seemd to echo Kaplan's descriptions. I disagree with those who criticize his bias, for overstating the obvious: It is a very subjective book, but it's impossible to come out of the Balkans with an objective impression (perhaps its only sin is to downplay testimonies from Serbian people). The hatred, specially in the former Yugoslavia, is indeed ancient, not just modern inventions to justify a war, and precisely because they are ancient, they remain strong and unwilling to surrender to dialogue and understanding, and that is exactly what gives value to Kaplan's book: it is able to decode the moods in the Balkans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kaplan is a great writer yet has his own prjudice","review":"Many praise Kaplan for \\"revealing the truth\\" about the Balkans, but what he really does is to perpetuate old myths and stereotypes of the Balkans. There are no ancient hatreds, all hatreds are modern creations of the past hundred or so years. Kaplan's mystical presentation of the Balkans only serves to continue long held and inaccurate and pejorative notions of the Balkan people. In the final analysis what Kaplan produces is part and parcel of a long ethnocentric tradition of negative western writting about the Balkans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written but shallow","review":"The quality of his writing style aside, the book promotes the dangerously deceptive notion that the war in the former Yugoslavia was a distinctly \\"Balkan\\" phenomenon. Its romantic and sexy theory of a bloody history that returns to wreck havoc on the region paints people from the Balkans as two dimensional characters who are naturally given to violence. Anyone who has visited the region knows this is not the case. The fact is that what happened in the Balkans can happen anywhere under the right (or wrong) circumstances, and indeed has happened across the world many times before and since. If you buy the book, enjoy the writing, but remain skeptical of his theories and read other words on the subject like Balkan Babel or Love thy Neighbor for a more complete view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating","review":"I recently traveled to the Balkan countries that were part of former Yugoslavia.

It needs to be updated and reissued. I watched this a while back. I may have a VHS copy of the movie but I know I don't have a dvd version of it. Perhaps I rented this movie? Anyway, I am giving this GREAT movie just TWO STARS because I have NEVER seen so many DANGLING MICROPHONES in ANY movie. The only thing I can compare it to is Dark Shadows. In Dark Shadows there is ALWAYS a SHADOW of a MICROPHONE. The microphones in Walking Tall really ruin the EXPERIENCE for me. I would think that with today's digital enhancements that those MICROPHONES could be edited out. I would think also that this is probably one of the BIGGEST reasons that this movie has not yet been reissued. Modern audiences aren't going to be happy seeing all of those dangling microphones.

I do have excuses, though. WALKING TALL was a big hit at the box office in 1973 (18Mos $) and Phil Karlson was not the worst director of that period.Time is very cruel with those movies of the sixties and the seventies which, I don't know exactly why, don't pass the test of the years. Furthermore WALKING TALL is more a TV movie than a motion picture. Actors are bad, the screenplay is filled with clich��s and we see once or twice the micro on the top of the screen.Violence is very graphic in this movie that maybe could have been an average western but that's all.

Buford brings his family back to Tennessee to start a logging business with his dad. He meets up with a friend that takes him to a casino called The Lucky Spot. When he sees that the games are rigged, Buford is badly beaten and sliced up with a knife. He is ignored by the sheriff, so he takes a huge stick to the casino and roughs up the guys who beat him and trashes the place. He soon runs for Sheriff and wins. Pusser wants to clean up the county and stop the corruption in his town. It's not all action, there are some sad scenes that are really depressing.

Kind of gets me mad it needs to charge that long. but it was about 4 o clock when i took it off the charger and i wanted to let it sit and cool because the battery gets very hot. So at about 6 o clock or so i took it outside and started shooting it. First some dry fire then i put it on semi auto for about 15 shots. Worked well from there. Then i put it on auto and after maybe 20 or so shots it stopped firing. I took it inside and checked everything out. I check the battery and it is VERY hot and the battery juice was all over the place inside the battery holder. I think that is a joke... 30 shots and its broken.

The Hoover was light and had great mobility but suction was poor, not much better than a carpet sweeper. Eureka had much better suction and good battery life but could not fit into tight places. Electrolux Pronto has the best of everything with good suction, enough battery life to sweep up one floor of our house. The best feature is the removable hand vac - we can clean up between our couch cusions or along floor trim. We have two kids (3y.o. and 1y.o.) and the Pronto keeps all the crumbs and hair off the floor, we use it at least once per day. We bring out the canister vac for whole-house cleaning but the Electrolux Pronto cordless helps us keep the house neat on a day to day basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"Was a bit disappointed with this purchase and am in the process of returning it. So here's what I thought of it..... PROS, small, light weight, good looking. CONS, don't like where the power button is located, you either have to bend down to click it on or pick the unit up and turn it on, the handle falls over VERY easy, & the dirt cup is SUPER small, you need to empty it after every use & it is not easy to empty. you have to slide this button and turn the cup back to pull it off, then pull the little filter out , empty the cup and put it back together, then put it back on the unit. All in all I think the cons out way the pros. I'm going back to the \\"Shark\\". It may not be as attractive as the slider but it's much more functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Swiffer replacement","review":"I bought this stick vac because with two big dogs and a vinyl-floored kitchen/office/laundry area to clean every day, the Swiffer just couldn't hack it. My kids take turns on floor duty and they didn't like messing with the cloths -flipping them, changing them out - so a lot of griping was going on over a simple chore. I didn't like the cost of the replacement cloths, even when we used both sides. Stick vac to the rescue! You do need to empty the dust cup after every use, just about (we have a large floor), but the kids don't mind that and neither do I. The excess fur and dirt comes up easily, the vac is very manueverable, very light weight, and it's easy to plug in the recharger. It's not much use on carpets, except for crumb clean-up, but I didn't expect that it would be. My seven-year-old likes it so much she took it upstairs and vacuumed the bathrooms - without being asked! It's a winner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"Picks up pet hair, dust, and crumbs like a champ. Doesn't pick up anything bigger. Have to pick up small pieces of cereal myself or step on them to crush them small enough. Must empty frequently as the dirt trap is tiny.

Nice job on my sisal rug too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not buy if you have pet hair on your floors","review":"I purchased this for quick clean ups between our weekly cleaning lady visits. Pet hair will bind up within your first use and cause you to dissassemble the brush head to remove the bound up hair. The second time it happened I could actually smell the belt heating up around the roller. I emailed Hoover and they responded that I should look into an electric broom. I did ....

The dirt container is SO tiny, making it bigger would not have been hard and would have improved the utility of the machine by a lot. Removing and cleaning the container is a bit cumbersome and annoying, and you have to get your hands filthy to frequently clean the strange cone shaped filter, which actually uses up most of the space in the tiny dust container (not sure why). It picks up most things ok, but fills up rapidly and has to be cleaned. Not useful for cat litter on hardwood floor - the grains get squashed flat and have to be scraped up laboriously by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"LUV this product","review":"This Hoover broom is great for quick pick ups on tile and wood floors.

In fact, for those who like Christian Byzantine art, similar to Greek Orthodox icons, this deck will be very appealing. Each angel is assigned a name (drawn from Jewish, Christian, or Gnostic mythology) and an oracular role/meaning, and each stands alone on their respective card, in all their glory. The images have a deliberate, nearly \\"two-dimensional\\" quality about them, as the art style requires. Each combines pastel shades and warm golden glows, as befits these wondrous messengers from another plane of existence.

Very disappointing since this is a Christmas gift. The picture makes it appear as though they all come in what looks like a nice box together. I actually had to go back to this site to make sure I even got the correct videos. What I got looks terrible. Once the plastic wrap gets removed, it will look like I just went to the store and picked random Red Sox videos off the shelf. It won't be any kind of a box set once the plastic peeled away. I should just return it but it took 2 websites and 3 tries to even get it.

Then, this one came out. Congrats to Nevermore for continuing to excel at what they do best: create heavy meoldic music. In my opinion, it's the guitar that keeps me coming back to this band, and this album is no different. Born, Sentient 6, Paslm of Lydia, and This Godless Endeavor are standouts. The Production is top notch. One of my favorite albums to listen to with headphones on, so that I can fully hear all of the layers and dynamics. In the end, if you like the aforementioned albums, or you like Nevermore, pick this up. If you're looking for something new check this out for a great blend of more traditional clean sung metal.

Only because Warren's vocals arean't quit loud enough. The instruments kind of drownd him out a little. Just not as sharp as on dead heart in a dead world. Other than that, that's it.

THIS GODLESS ENDEVOUR is just that exept with a more mature sound.Mr. Loomis shines on this album as well, he can put up a challenge to the greats like hanneman/king and hammet/hetlfieldon his own. The best example on this album is the opening song \\"born\\" that starts of with super heavy riffs and growling vocals and unexpectedly slows down till the chorus. Another Good song on here is \\"Final Product\\"....which features the great solo by jeff, this solo is simple outta this world even better than \\"enimies of reality\\".Donot start judging it by the very first spin, give it time to grow and then you will discover the endless beauty of NEVERMORE."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their best album","review":"This godless endeavor -> super heavy album with very good solos in some parts and some progressive styles also. I have heard all of their album till now and this is their best. What makes the biggest difference is that their are more melodic vocals -> the sound is very rhythmic and marches very good overall. If you start with Nevermore i suggest to start with this album first. I don't know why but Dead Heart in a dead world was their worst album till now and many think that is their best. Anyway this is far better than whatever they have done. 4 stars of course -> No way to give 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum....","review":"I just bought this CD after reading Nevermore was spawned by the band Sanctuary which I used to like a lot.

Support real musik and support da Cincinnati Bengals, who-dey baby!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I am pleased with the new Nevermore cd because it is simply put, a quality record. Fans of the band for sure will be pleased, and if you happen to be someone curious about the band then this album wouldn't be a bad place to start. Basically, this album combines thrash and heavy metal with some other stuff thrown in. It sounds fresh and sharp. It contains elements of Dead Heart in a Dead World, Politics, Dreaming Neon Black. So if you were a fan of those then do not hesitate to pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nevermore continues to go strong!","review":"As usual, this band continues to display great technical skill at playing their instruments while at the same time being catchy, and on top of all that, being at times thrashy, at times heavy, and at times brutal, and coming up with beautifully moving melodies in between all that. They also continue to write strong and meaningful songs that share their perspective on the human and social conditions in America. Also, this album has a cleaner and polished sound, devoid of the sludgier one heard on Enemies Of Reality. I loved Enemies of Reality and did not mind the sludgy sound, but those who did may prefer this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grew on me...","review":"As a new listener to Nevermore, I didn't really have any idea what they sounded like, nor any huge expectations. So, I guess you could say im a non-biast reviewer from that perspective. All I knew going into my first listen was hype I have heard here, and there online.Well I have to say my first couple listens, I wasn't impressed that much. I mean, don't get me wrong, I caught a nice riff here, and a nice drum roll there, but I found the vocals a little opera-ish. I really only enjoyed, maybe 2 or 3 songs on this record. After maybe a couple more listens I still didn't think too much of it. Put it away for a while... then about a week ago I threw it in the old CD player, and it really just clicked. I really enjoy this album overall from start to finish. There are some things I find hard to enjoy, but overall I would say this is worth buying if you enjoy \\"prog=-metal\\". I would say if you like Opeth, Dream Theater, etc. pick it up, you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Yet!","review":"I have been following Nevermore since their early days as Sanctuary. When I first listened to this album, I wasn't too impressed, however after a few times through, it really grew on me. Being a metal musician myself, listening thoroughly to the music - all instrument parts - and their melodic composition and blending, it became apparent that this is indeed their best album yet.For any first-time listeners - a word of advise: listen to the album thoroughly a few times and let the music flow through you. Only then can you truly appreciate what Nevermore has done with this album. If This Godless Endeavor is any indication of their future work, I impatiently await their next release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORDS FAIL!","review":"Yup, It's just as good as everyone says. The band is just as good as everyone says. Untouchable musicianship, overwhelming passion, a representation of all that metal can and should mean!BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Square Writing Method","review":"I love this method of teaching. I have taught 4th grade for the past 2 years. The school I taught at last year used this method. My class loved this method and their writing improved. I moved to a new school this year and loved this method so much I had to buy my own book. I started using it with my class now, and they love it. It makes writing so much easier. My class always wants to know when it is time to write. I recommend this book to anyone who teaches writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great content, horrible narration","review":"I have listened to spiritual and motivational audio books for many years. I think James Allen was a great philosopher and I very much appreciate his teachings. Unfortunately, I found the narration of these books to be completely inappropriate, to the point that I could not listen for more than 5 minutes. In my opinion, the overly dramatic narration distorts what could be a powerful and pure teaching into a cheap fiction. I would suggest looking for other narrations before purchasing this one. For an example of what I would consider an appropriate narration style for the deep messages contained in these books, try any audio books written and read by Eckhart Tolle."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I was very disappointed with whoever sold me this product.

This is jazzy R&B; at it's best. As a follow up from his first album(I just wanna sing) this doesn't fall far from it and keeps up the good work.I recommend this album to people looking for some relaxing R&B...and; I recommend the rap group the Roots on a side not because if you like this album I am pretty sure you will like the new one Phrenology(something like that). Peace out folks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smmooth Banging Joint!!!! \\"Cop\\" THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I haven't stopped listening to this and I have only had it for two days. The CD explores Musiq's depth of skills. This CD shows his growth from Ajuswansang (excuse my spelling). I love how Musiq continues his story in dealing with the shorty in \\"Seventeen\\" from his first disc on Track 3 \\"Caughtup\\" Other joints to check R \\"Halfcrazy\\"(of course), \\"Previouscats\\", \\"Motherfather\\" and \\"Newness\\".This is a must have CD............... PERIOD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just doesn't get much better than this.","review":"With his sophomore effort, Musiq (he's dropped the Soulchild for now) manages to successfully take you back to the days of soulful barbeques, family gatherings, and sweet summer romances. His lighthearted follow-up to \\"Aijuswanaseing\\" is a very refreshing addition to the \\"NeoSoul\\" genre that is creating a new standard for classic music. The debut single for \\"Juslisen\\", \\"Halfcrazy\\" flows gracefully over a sweetly simplistic melody that makes for easy listening. Once again, he enlists the assistance of AAries on the soulful \\"Time\\", \\"Solong\\" and \\"Motherfather\\". One of the best singles on this album is \\"Dontchange\\" which could possibly rival the success of \\"Aijuswanaseing's\\" popular ballad, \\"Love\\". All in all, this is an incredible CD that will have you begging for the good ol' days, when the music was a pure as the love that inspired it. Juslisen; I'm sure you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE HOTTEST!...","review":"This cd is the hottest so far this year.It is the best way to back up his last album.there are so many hott songs i am not going to name them.If you have the first album you need this one.this is the hottest musiq album out.The philly native did it again.And bonus you get the girl next door remix wich is a killer track. So if you don't have this get this now and don't wait.Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"for all musiq fans this is a must have","review":"musiq's alright I'm not a fan but he's doing some cool things here if you feel him this is more your thing than mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musiq to my Ears","review":"Musiq Soulchild's debut album was still a constant staple of my CD diet when this album came out. \\"Aijuswanaseing\\" was a great record with \\"Just Friends (Sunny)\\" being so overly addictive that I used to play it daily! However, Musiq had not moved far away from the core of Neo Soul ideology; D'Angelo. He was often critised for being a little too much like the famed Neo Soulster (who is himself critised for sounding too much like Prince!). By this album, the flavours of Neo Soul are still here, but this is an original and personal slant. The album begins with the great opener \\"Newness\\" (check those lyrics!).The album goes along at a good pace, giving as a taste of many things. Higlights would include \\"Halfcrazy\\", \\"Don't Change\\" and the marvellous remake \\"Something\\". More uptempo as a whole than Aijuswanaseing, but this is truly a worthy album that puts Musiq right up there with D'Angelo and Maxwell as the vanguard of the Neo Soul movement"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best artist.","review":"If you are the type of person that is listening for the sex you up artist then this aint for you. Musiq brings back the morality to music. He expresses his feelings for the woman he sings about, not ashamed to say what he means and feels. This is \\"keepin it real\\". Every song that he sings has meaning and a good vibe to it. I could play this if my grandmother was in the car and she would appreciate his music. Get the CD. I dont care if this review didnt talk about the CD. Just buy it, because you will love it anything he is apart of I try to get it because if he's on it its tight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great CD from Musiq!","review":"Musiq's latest CD, \\"Juslisen\\" is a wonderful mix of incredible songs! Each one has its own very distinct message in it, but that message does not overshadow the beautiful singing by Musiq and the melodies.This is the first CD by Musiq that I've bought although I have listened to and really liked his debut album. Musiq has a true gift and we are all very lucky to be able to listen to his wonderful music!I highly recommend buying this CD!Stand-out track:\\"Half Crazy\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Juslisen? Nah","review":"Well, I don't want to knock Musiq's second effort entirely cause the single, Half Crazy is what made me listen to it. I like the music on that song, not particularly the vocal, but the single did its job to get me to listen.I like the Beatles cover song on the album and a few others, but overall it is the lack of vocal range and ability as well as the weakness in the lyrics that disinterest me most about this album in the end. Musiq sampled a beat that The Notorious B.I.G. used years ago and there was no point resurrecting it to ruin it. I tried to give the album three stars, but I'd give this album only 2 stars and that credit is for about 4 good songs out of 76 minutes of music.In the future, some help with the writing of the lyrics and Musiq maturing in his vocal ability could make a better third album for him, I recommend buying the single, but save your money and watch out for this one. Listen to the audio clips on this site to be sure you want to try it, otherwise play it safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream R&B dressed up with thrift shop clothes","review":"Everyone is \\"neo-soul\\" these days if they aren't in a 3 to 4 member group that dresses alike, dances in unison and doesn't play an instrument. Please, Musiq is no more \\"neo-soul\\" than Ja Rule is. Other artists such Maxwell, D'angelo, and Bilal who are placed under the \\"neo-soul\\" umbrella are much better at it than Musiq is. Don't let some beads, baggy pants and a skull cap fool you. His \\"speak-singing (as another reviewer called it)\\" is irritating as all get out. I hated it the first time around, but I'm a glutton and gave him another chance. Actually, the disc isn't terrible and I might have liked it more, if it had have been marketed differently, trimmed by about 5 songs and less of the \\"speak-singing\\" and more real singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good","review":"Not as powerful as his first album, but nonetheless good. My favorite tracks off of Musiq's sophomore album are \\"Caught Up,\\" \\"Stopplayin,\\" \\"Halfcrazy,\\" \\"Future,\\" \\"Best Friends,\\" \\"Don't Change,\\" and \\"Something.\\" If Musiq comes out with a third album (which I\\"m sure he will), he can definately count on me to cop that joint.P.S. Notice how \\"Love\\" from \\"I just wanna sing\\" and \\"Don't change\\" from \\"Juslissen\\" are the most powerful songs off the whole album and they both got the same theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musiq Soulchild True To His Name...","review":"I rarely buy a CD based on hearing one song, but after listening to the smooth soulfull sounds and moving lyrics of \\"Half Crazy\\", I knew I couldn't go wrong. The entire CD is excellent and even after having it for months it still can't seem to find it's way out of my CD player. I've also decided that Musiq writes some of the most beautiful and romantic lyrics I've ever heard. If you like Alicia Keys, old school Boys II Men, Lauryn Hill, or D'Angelo- You'll LOVE this CD. It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It must be me.","review":"Half crazy is the Only song worth anything to me. I'm sorry forks, but Musiq-music nor his voice sticks out for me. A few songs even sound the same to me. Different stokes for different folks, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened","review":"I have been a huge fan of Musiq ever since he came out and I didn't realize why critics and the mainstream gave him such a hard time about his music. Every thing that I had heard was wonderful. Well that was because I missed his second album. Having loved his first and loved his third even more I thought I was sure to love his second. I however did not. It was like a totally different artist! This is probably a moot point now but I am glad Musiq got his act together for the Soulstar album which is more like the Musiq we've all come to know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"HE MUST BE \\"HALFCRAZY\\"","review":"Musiq is such a phony.Come on,dude comes out on the scene with faux-\\"boho\\" style and tagging alongside The Roots and Erykah Badu all while his music is the same sounding R&B mush that dominates urban radio.Add to that,corny lyrics and bad singing and then you got Musiq!!! \\"Juslisen\\" is 'jusbad\\" if you know what I mean.Musiq needs to go back to Philly and maybe get a 9 to 5 at a cleaners or maybe he can hone his musical skills 'cause it's just not working! Nobody said it and it had to be said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borderline Corny","review":"Musiq is what I would call a one hit wonder. Or maybe he hit the sophomore album slump. Whatever it was he had on his first album is now gone. There's hardly any songs close to the caliber of 'Love', \\"Just Friends\\", 'Seventeen' or '143'. Instead he gives us incredibly corny beats with even worse lyrics. He can still sing but find some better tracks please. I wouldn't go as far as calling the album COMPLETE garbage, it's decent; has some 'solid' songs scattered throughout, it's just not an album I would waste my time on, reviewing individual songs and quoting lyrics and stuff. I also wouldn't recommend it. But hey...thats just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be nice...........","review":"It would be nice to submit a review if I actually recieved the product.

I wasn't finished listening when I did the first review. I am in LOVE with this Musiq! I'm still stuck on #16 \\"Don't Change\\", but I've added his rendition of George Harrison's \\"Something (I Don't Want to Leave Her Now)\\" to my list of favorites along with #s 2, 13, and 17 among others. I love the way he brought us up to date with \\"caught up\\" and \\"If I woulda knew\\". The beats and his rhythmic vocal flow are still tight like the first CD yet seasoned and honed. I strongly encourage you to purchase (please support the artists and BUY their CDs versus downloading them!) this CD, put it in your ride and Juslisen!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The way it should be done...","review":"All it took was onelisen to declare this album a bona fide winner! I could go on forever about how solid and well written this album is, but real fans of R&b/Neosoul/Jazz will understand exactly what I'm trying to say after hearing this wonderful piece. I think it's even better than his first album, which is hard to say, but I really think it is. Classic? I guess that depends on who you ask but it's well worth any price you have to pay to get this awsome collection of music by musiq! Jusbuyit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 2nd try!!!","review":"Musiq's 2nd effort Juslisen is a really good offering. It's quite a feat that he managed to put out so many quality songs on his second CD. \\"Halfcrazy\\" may be the 1st single released from his CD, but it's far from the best. Don't get me wrong, that song is cool, but \\"Future\\" is the best in my opinion. It's kind of an encouraging song. Most of his songs deal with relationships, which I think most people can relate to. Another example of a great song on this CD is \\"Best friend\\". It's a duet with Carol Riddick which has a lot to say about how a man should think about his woman. I think it drops a lot of truth. There are other good songs on here as well. It looks as if Musiq is carving his niche as an artist who has a lot to say about relationships, while avoiding crude and immature songs degrading women and promoting utter silliness. I like it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you thought that this was Dj SASHA you got hosed","review":"To any one who was on line and thought that this was a new DJ SASHA release because they looked on line and bought it.

I have seen the field 45 years later that still show the indention in the grond where it landed. Where did he get the info as the man who live never talked to Mr Gaddo. It was not till after his death did the book come out. That to me is sad as this man lived with this the rest of his life. You might like to know that Some of the men that went up on that last flight were not part of the original crew.I just feel sad that Gaddo has taken part of someones life and called it his book. Shame on you Mr. Don Gaddo.One more thing I would like to know where the \\"Angel\\" really came from ????"},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLing Asleep . . .","review":"As an avid horse show-er myself, I was excited to hear about this book and was told it was an accurate depiction of horse show life. While Maristed does describe the horse show world fairly accurately, I find her writing to be tedious and disjointed. It was difficult to follow her choppy descriptions and one-word sentences sometimes. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the love story aspect of the novel more than the horse scenes--Maristed simply seems unsure of herself when attempting to describe horse show life and uses awkward imagery and short verbage in a poor attempt (I think) to up the suspense factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice Mystery, but disappointing to the industry.","review":"It's getting increasingly harder to find an accurate depiction of the horse world. Far too often these stories come in either romance or mystery novels, and Kai Maristed's novel, \\"Fall,\\" combines both those, and if that wasn't bad enough, she throws in a few stereotypes. The story traces the same characters through a show curcuit, and while breifly touching upon the emotions that surround such events, Maristed seems much more content to examine the stereotypical relationships and types of people who exist in this world. I have personally worked in the horse industry for a number of years, and while the story has good intentions, it is, overall, a satyric romance/drama/mystery that belongs on a soap opear."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the complete 2nd season instead","review":"this makes no sense why they are reissuing this in pieces. just very disappointing because the show is so great but they're screwing up the dvd releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Bible","review":"There are a lot of books on Ninjutsu out there, but none compare to this one in it's authenticity and insight. It's easy to see why considering that practically every word here was spoken by Soke himself at some point and then translated directly by the author Ben Cole (a practitioner of the art for years and not just a journalist or novelist).This book has been hailed by those of the highest level within our art both in Japan and abroad who know Hatsumi sensei personally and can hear his voice speaking to them from these pages. It is definitely a must read for anyone who takes their Budo seriously. It is teeming with knowledge and will keep you wondering for years about Soke's mysterious teachings. Get it, read it, read it again, and again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well organized, informative research tool for speakers","review":"This book is a basic text that would be useful for a public speaking class or training seminar.

The book also includes excellent examples and illustrations. This should be a required book for every public speakers bookshelf"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best versions","review":"Incredible music (the slow movement draws tears every time, and it has been so for about 20 years now, and the energy of the finale is never pure virtuosity), incredible playing (the story these musicians are telling is always on the foreground, and the phrasing, the dynamics, are so subtle!), incredible sound (beautiful instruments, \\"woody tone\\" without too much of the brightness or harshness of \\"modern\\" instruments), perfect recording for chamber music : just a little reverberation, not too closely miked, recorded in a famous swiss theater.My favorite version, with the Alban Berg Quartet's. Too bad none of the best \\"baroque\\" ensembles, such as Hausmusik led by Monica Huggett (they did perfect Mozart's quintets), never recorded this piece. The Quatuor Mosaques, with famous musicians from Harnoncourt's Concentus Musicus, did only a caricature of an interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing insight into the TV Writers world.","review":"As a Writer in the early 90s, I was so glad to be able to read this book and see the mechanics iof how TV Writers worked their craft. The Scripts were clear and well-written, yet I saw where they differed from the actual episodes and how scenes that shone on the screen sometimes lacked that on the page, demonstrating how Directors and Actors can make text come alive. As well, I loved the introductions to the scripts. I sensed a real incestousness in the writers, as they were either the Creators of the shows or sibling/spouses....again an intersting glimpse into how good TV was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have cheated in seminary","review":"(Hand over mouth yawning prodigously) If I had been assigned this book when I was in seminary I probably would have read the first and last paragraph of each chapter. Or maybe I would have written an essay based merely on the chapter headings. You might imagine from this review that I did not finish it. You would be right, for it commits the worst sin of anything theological, namely, it is BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully boring","review":"Being somewhat familiar with Marsden's writing I looked forward with great anticipation to reading this book. Evangelicalism and Fundamentalism are subjects with which I have significant familiarity and very great interest. The book was a disappointment and for me was simply a dreary recitation of facts with nothing to give it life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mounting screw too short","review":"Just as D-Flo stated, the mounting stub is too short. It barely threads into itself without installing on the vehicle. Just the thickness of the sheetmetal (less than a 16th) it too thick for the threads to grab. I had to make my own grommet to make it work. Shouldn't have to modify a product straight out of the package. There is no way this would work unless your are mounting it to a paper thin body (literly!) Wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it really doesn't fit.","review":"I had read the other reviews that folks had left and it sounded like this was a iffy purchase. But I couldn't tell where the problem was. The other reviews mentioned that the screw was too short. Let me try and explain, so you can make an informed decision. The antenna has two parts, the base (it fits below the fender/trunk) and the other part that fits on top. The two part are held together with a 8mm screw. Well the 8mm screw sticks out of the base 5/8 of inch that might seen like it would be long enough but the washer and antenna base is 1/2 inches long. The end results is you have only 1/8 to work with so you can't attach the base and the top together. The two options you have are go buy a longer 8mm bolt and force the bolt out of the base, or return the antenna back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- do not purchase!!","review":"I'm an idiot because I didn't pay attention to earlier reviews talking about how this poorly designed antenna will not fit your car. As others state, the design makes it impossible to thread the antenna base to the antenna because the screw is too short. Shouldn't something this elementary have been corrected a long time ago? I really wish Amazon would drop this item from the product menu. I just threw mine in the trash after several screaming expletives in the garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Threads!","review":"At first sight one would think this is a decent replacement antenna. However, the threads in the antenna that screw into the base are very weak. If one expects a decent seal on this product I can't see a way to tighten this with the slop in the threads. I was expecting to install this in a very easy and flat location and once tightened the threads would slip. Amazon was excellent on the return at least, very much appreciated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I purchased two boxes, thinking they would be great.

Few visitors make it to this neighborhood because it's not even mentioned in most guides. The book also tells you where you can take an excellent small-boat tour of the canals that's completely different from the usual tourist boats, as well as places to get great street food, like hot stroopwafels (crispy caramel-filled cookies) and the best frites (french fries) in town. Enjoy your trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 wheel drive paper cut out vechicles","review":"I like this book. It lets you assemble your own vechicles. I haven't got around to assemble them though. there are 18 diffrent minivans and suvs and other 4wd vechicles. so it was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"American's Trash System","review":"As a former shelter worker and currently a feral rescuer, I know too well of the owner convenience attitude of Americans. This heart-breaking account of pets which no longer fit into Americans' life-style should be an eye-opener to all pet owners. This book is packed with compassion and sensitivity as Mr. Brestrup gives a compelling argument to stop the killing in our shelters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and in depth","review":"I read this book years ago and the concepts still hold up today regarding the real issues involved in the kill vs. no kill debate. Highly recommended for people interested in animal rights issues, specifically regarding companion animals and the overpopulation crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing, yet haphazard","review":"I think Bowes's story is incredible, but it was diluted by the structure of too many flashbacks and flashforwards. The story of a boy growing up with a shadow is not entirely new, and Bowes breathed new life in this by adding the queer element and in his refreshing settings. I found it rather confusing and couldn't always figure out when the events occurred: past, present, recent..?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This book was a complete and utter bore. Nothing exciting AT ALL happened and it draaaaaags ever so much. Save your $25 -- get The Tooth Fairy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, horrible, magnificent","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Bowes is one of the best writers I've encountered in years. He gives us a tour, vividly evoked, of some of the more hideous realities of our time, but solidly in there with the horrors are courage, compassion and redemption. Bowes is a writer's writer. His evocation of a miserable Boston childhood and a horrific coming-of-age in Hell's Kitchen couldn't be more truthful, and nevertheless exhilarate. Through this world angels also walk, and strange illuminations. His hero survives, endures, and keeps the faith against tremendous odds. You won't find sleek and phony gothic figures in Minions of the Moon; there isn't a lie or a word of self-indulgence or hackwork in it. You will find demons in plenty, acute human pain, joy and hope. This book is good for the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Haunting Novel","review":"After I finished this book, I realized just how inventive and unique it really was. The hero Kevin is haunted by his 'shadow' who literally embodies all the bad sides of his character and past. Through solidly constructed chapters (especially a few right in the middle of this book, which are downright brilliant), Kevin both looks back at his past and confronts his shadow again after years.At points the novel has very obviously been stitched together from many separate short works (as author admits in the preface), but once you get into the storyline and the reality as weaved together by the author, you'll let yourself go on a spook tour of Kevin's psyche.Inventive, clever, unique, vivid, pervasive.Someone recently said to me, 'I like books in which as a reader I'm not 100% sure of what's going on.' Me too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three words: This game s**ks","review":"As an RPG, Synnibarr is probably the worst ever created. However, as thick as it is, the core book has many practical, real world applications such as a paperweight, door stopper and at over 400 pages nearly a 6 month supply of toilet paper.Be afraid...be very afraid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very narrow niche, but good at it.","review":"I found the rules to be rather more complicated that I prefer, and the overall rules, layout, and general structure of the game was hard to read, hard to understand, and hard to follow. But buried in the muck were several very intersting gems of ideas for worlds, cultures, and images to use. However, ulitmately I came away with the feeling that the game was designed to be a game to engage in power fantasys, and dreams of godhood. Not my choice for a long campagin, though perhaps as an overnighter, or a game where the theme is anime and cosmic powers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steaming pile of excrement","review":"Mere words can not convey the awfulness of this particular RPG. Digging my eyes out with a plastic spork would be more preferable than ever having to view those soiled pages ever again. Confusing setting, along with incomplete and incoherent rules and numerous typos are the norm for this particular text. Books like this give RPGs, and RPers a bad name. I can only hope that professional therapy will cleanse the dirtiness that I feel from having read this book. If it were possible, I would give this product negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offers insite to the workings of a deranged lunatics mind","review":"I can't begin to explain what is in this unholy tome. I suppose it's one claim to fame is it is the worst, most pretensious and poorly thought out RPG ever produced. The type of thing that could only be considered good by mullet headed, pimple faced pre teen boys wearing Merga Death tees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synnibarr - An awesome game!","review":"I've been playing Synnibarr for 5 years. It is deffinately the best role-playing game I have ever encountered. There are a lot of rules but they're really just there if you want them, they deffinately make the game much more realistic. Another pro is that you only need one book to play. Unlike AD&D or Battle Tech where you have to buy different books for every aspect of the game. With Synnibarr there is only one other book (The Ultimate Adventurer's Guide) and it is optional. I would recommend this game for anyone who is serious about role-playing games."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little deceiving","review":"Just got my \\"spork\\" today and as it turns out, there is just one. Yes, you only get one. Most people would assume by showing a picture of four sporks you would get four of them...nope.

The computers were slow as well.Finally, after returning all 3 V505 computers, we went out and bought a new VGN-S150. We have had no problems with this new computer. We were told by the guy at Circuit City that the V505s were known to have problems in different areas. Our wireless connection with this new computer is great. This shows that the V505s were just not good in this respect. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice machine except for the erratic random keyboard errors","review":"This is a nice package with wireless and nice compact design and long battery life. The memory and disk are very good, and the processor quite OK for most purposes. The keyboard is a little cramped, and the speakers give sound no better than a mobile phone, which is puzzling for a Sony device.I am happy with my choice EXCEPT that the keyboard induces random jumps and characters and unfortunately I have to spend about 30% of my typing time correcting the errors and adjusting the cursor.I searched on the web and found, sadly, that this is a problem experienced by many people with this Sony keyboard. And it appears that trying to get the problem solved is even more frustrating than the problem. So if you need series keying than this machine is quite useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boys will be boys","review":"This book is an escape. An Island in Time is a fascinating story of growing up in an unspoiled time in an unspoiled place. It takes the reader back to a time when children were free to roam on their own, spend an entire day in a boat (before the advent of personal flotation devices) and spend months playing Army under the house.It explains the behavior of little boys, lets us look inside their heads and see the depths of their hearts. Through this author's remarkable recall of each situation and emotion, we see his hopes and dreams through the eyes of a child. It makes us long for such innocence.Those who have ever lived on an island will appreciate the small town, family atmosphere and freedom that this book offers. You'll want to move to an island yourself. Preferrably in Puget Sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macy's Day Parade Uno Cards","review":"Great idea for a different UNO card game!

Every single one stands out, even among the entire Dr. Who series. The 2010 Christmas Carol immediately became both mine and my wife's favorite version of the classic Dickens tale.

And what was really cool, I streamed it through my new Roku and avoided commercials. I love it.

Not only did Matt Smith have me at Fish Sticks and Custard but he has so thoroughly owned this role it's sometimes hard to even remember Mr. Tennant. This special gives us once again a Doctor without his companions and the consequences that can arise while bringing back some old friends.

Pretty darn happy with myself for making such a great decision and saving the two bucks they automatically charged everyone else for the prequel that was free everywhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix it!","review":"Charging for a trailer clip is weak sauce. Fix it before you alienate more Who fans! I am so glad I read the reviews first and noticed that \\"Prequel\\" really meant \\"clip,\\" or I would be very angry right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"not polished....","review":"While the actual clip content was an amusing teaser for the Christmas special, I had to get through 30 seconds of test pattern and 30 seconds of the time vortex episode opener before the clip began. Once the clip started it had an echoing quality that was sort of distracting. The entire clip didn't have the kind of production polish one expects in a paid video. This probably should have been free. I won't ask for my money back though. If the actual full length special is as good as the past episodes, it will be worth it to have the tv pass.The first preview clip was better organized, but I saw it for free elsewhere before it was available on amazon. Still worth it in my book if the full episode is made available soon and has no issues with playback."},{"rating":"1","title":"When do we get to buy the actual episode????","review":"I see that Amazon has finally stopped charging people for the typically free 2 minute prequel to this year's Christmas special. The actual question is WHERE IS THE EPISODE??? Amazon usually puts it up the next day. I was planning to celebrate Boxing Day with a cozy night of Doctor Who Christmas special watching but when I looked for the episode it wasn't here. I don't have BBC America so I didn't get to see it last night and was all set to buy the episode on here. I am so very disappointed it isn't up yet.

VERY UNHAPPY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this prequel!","review":"I've already sent a note to Amazon about this, but haven't heard back - does seem like a mistake to me, but it might also be a heartless, cynical money grab, since they normally don't charge for these but they must know all us fans who don't get the BBC will want to watch it right away.

A friend told me of this Special and I hurriedly ordered it on Amazon Prime. Some characters from episodes in the past are in this show, as is someone else who is new.

Amazon was charging 1.99 for the prequel but they fixed it. Now it's free as two minute prequels have always been, so it's great: a strong beginning to the Christmas special episode. I wrote customer service and they emailed me straight back that it was fixed. I don't know if my email had anything to do with them fixing it or everyone's prior complaints, but maybe writing customer service helps more than giving a low review--customer service may not read the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 minutes!","review":"I almost paid $2 for this thinking it was a full length xmas special.

Maybe a mistake, but also a violation of trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an episode","review":"In the past, prequels and other short content has been free with the TV pass. Now they've decided to charge full episode price for a 90 second clip that has been available various places on the Web for a couple of weeks.

It portrays junk foods as something to desire and steal. Do you want your kids eating chips, drinking soda, watching tv, and stealing? Not me. It wasn't funny; it was just sad. Too much violence; for example the turtle's first encounter over the hedge causes him to be knocked around a lot. Later a dog breaks every fence in the neighborhood while dragging a cart of junk food. I never liked these kinds of cartoons when I was a kid. It's too bad they're still being made and they teach kids to think violence is funny.

A jab here and there would of been ok, but the movie continually hits you over the head with the message, it grew quite tiresome. I have to wonder how many cokes, twinkies, chips, etc were consumed by Dreamworks as they were working on this movie! Will this DVD be filling up landfills in the future?

I thought the cast sounded decent, but the point of seems to complain about suburban consumerism. I'm a pretty liberal guy, but this was really over the top and preachy. And the music sucks. My kid seems to enjoy it, but I'm not trying to brainwash him, you know?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for the feeble minded","review":"Oh gosh, how original and daring...an assault on suburban living, unhealthful fast food, and...what, selfishness? Hoo-hah, wake me when it's over. A hedge! A hedge! So this is really what it's come to in our culture...a hedge between a suburban back yard and countryside as symbol of what is REALLY wrong in this world? How pitiful is that? If you believe in family values, then you live in the woods. Uh huh. Right. Without indoor plumbing, etc., because you're better than that, right? (Can't be a coincidence that the skunk heroine sought out, and found, a mate with no sense of smell). And BTW, if you live excusively on junk food, then you are a loser...and you probably like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"Definately one of my all time favorites. The comparisons and descriptions of humans and food is hilarious! Fun for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"This is the best of the animated films that flooded the box office this summer. Great voice talent, great storyline, and a highly enjoyable time at the movies. The story pokes fun at our society and our excesses when a family of animals invade suburbia. Dreamworks is giving Pixar a run for their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A WONDERFUL WAY TO SPEND THE EVENING!","review":"I am not much into animated movies but this one was top notch.Such wonderful slapstick comedy by a bunch of animals that have run afoul of human neighbors.The whole complete entourage was a wonderful group to place together.Bruce Willis as the troublemaker RJ, the coon who had to run afoul of the bear and his snacks [Nick Nolte].I have to admit that I enjoyed, even more, the extra - describing each character and the personality taking the part.And Thomas Hayden Church as the exterminater - so real and different - I had only seen him in the frontier western.HIGHLY ENTERTAINING - Recommend for all to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIE HARD WITH A SQUIRREL","review":"This entertaining animated romp showcases the vocal talents of a lot of good actors, including Bruce Willis as the conniving racoon who enlists the aid of fellow forest mates to amass a ton of food for a bear that has threatened the coon unless he does so. Of course, the animals think the coon's out to feed them, but we all know that when the garbage clears, the raccoon is going to see the error of his ways.Excellent animation abounds with some choice funny moments and commentary on human's obsessions. Along with Willis, we get Garry Shandling as the turtle, William Shatner as the possum with Avril Lavigne as his daughter, Nick Nolte as the bear, Steve Carrell as the hyper squirrel, Wanda Sykes as the sassy skunk and Thomas Haden Church as the nutso exterminator. It's all in good fun and the whole family should enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the Hedge Review","review":"This is a good movie for children & also for adults who can relate to children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"My family liked it, but of course they show all the best parts in the previews, so there's always the disappointment when you actually see the movie and it doesn't have too many other funny scenes. Over all it was entertaining for adults and children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Clever, A lot of Fun!","review":"Considering I just saw Cars, I wasn't so sure about Over the Hedge. I mean, Cars actually became one of my favorites after I finished it! But I gave this a shot and I'm glad I did. I'll admit, the whole concept of R.J. using the others to repay a debt wasn't very original, but the way it was executed made it very enjoyable. Now I'm debating whether or not I want to buy it. I'd say rent it first, but if you have kids, this is a good one for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Love this movie","review":"My children love it. Amazon had a great price and free shipping. What else can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kids Love this Movie","review":"Our kids just love this movie. It's great fun to watch with them. It's a keeper on the saturday night family night movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I found this film very entertaining! I loved the subtle pokes at suburbia and all the headaches that comes with it. Adults will enjoy the story as well as younsters. It's always fun to hear some of your favorite actors' voices in animated character form. But besides the fun, I feel this film had some good underlying lessons too. When we 'overindulge', we often cause ourselves trouble. One overindulgent racoon gets himself, and his friends, into a pickle by being greedy and self-serving. Will they be able to fix his mess, and more important, will they forgive him?Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why So Short?","review":"I rented this on DVD Tuesday, 10/18/2006 from Blockbuster. Arriving home, I immediately popped it in my Family Room DVD player and started playing it for my son and daughter! My son loved it! It was cute, funny, and full of Chipmunk cheer! I thought CJ was adorable!I would recommend this to anyone with kids.Question? Why so short? It seems like animated features are getting shorter and shorter as each year passes. It kind of reminds me of how television dramas are getting shorter as time passes. Average length of television in the mid to early 80's: 48 minutes; average length in 90's: 45 minutes; current average: 42 - 43 minutes.In the old days, animated features lasted around 90 minutes. Lately, I've noticed them to be around 85 minutes or less. Over the hedge lasted an amazing 73 minutes.

Another dynamic scene is where RJ is trying to do a make over on Sammy to make him look like he has Rabbies, so they can steal girl scout cookies from two girlscouts. Every scene is written incrediabley well to promote roaring laughter.

All this is subtly or not-so-subtly told through jokes and sight gags, some for kids and adults alike. And the characters aren't bad either, from the wiley raccoon (Bruce Willis), to a paranoid \\"just play dead\\" possum (William Shatner) to a scene-stealing, eager to please squirrel (Steve Carrell).Overall, this was one of the most enjoyable animated feature films I've seen since Finding Nemo, with a great mix of humor, smarts, and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little movie","review":"A cute little movie about a bunch of hibernating animals who wake to find a Hedge where there was only forest.

Le Guin, is a marvelous and imaginative story about a cat with wings named Jane. Jane lives on a farm with other winged cats. The elder cats caution her about the danger of being a winged cat and traveling away from the farm. \\"Being different is difficult.\\" Just the same, Jane is young and wants to have adventures so she flies off to the city anyway. Upon arriving in the city Jane meets a nice man who nonetheless wants to profit off of her uniqueness. The man keeps Jane against her will, making her a television sensation. Later, after Jane escapes the man, she finds her mother and takes up permanent residence with a kindly old woman. In the end Jane learns the value of freedom and being unique. Le Guin's writing is simple and beautifully understated. The illustrations by S.D. Schindler are wonderful and evocative. I loved JaneOn her Own and look forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.Preston McClear"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane on her own","review":"This is a charming story. S. D. Schindler's illustrations are fabulous - the cats live and move - and Ursula LeGuin's characterisations are spot on too. Jane, one of the Catwings, gets bored with her quiet life on the farm and decides to have \\"adventures.\\" Unfortunately she falls in with a guy who, while seeming to love her, keeps her locked up and performing tricks for television cameras.This story is a wonderful fantasy for cat lovers of all ages. The moral (if you need a little medicine in your sugar) is that if you really love someone, you'll give them their freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane on her own","review":"In this book, Jane flies away from Harriet, James, Thelma and Roger and finds a man named Poppa.

This book oozes with the sentiment that its writer lives for the Kingdom. Roberts, through his example, issues a bold challenge to the church that we must not miss - the church has always been God's plan for the world. We contract out 'missions' at our own loss, gaining instead a church that is fat, weak and bored. Knowing something of the background of Robert's church, I find this book both challenging and inspiring. Becoming Good News as a vehicle to share the Good News seems pretty Christ-like. Robert's book offers a wake-up call to all church leaders who are bored with the ethos of self-indulgence so prevalent in the North American church.A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than the Bookstore","review":"It was much cheaper than my college bookstore and shipping was free.

Although Dick wasn't part of the band when Louie Louie was recorded, he joined very shortly thereafter, and does a good job of providing the back-story from before he joined. The insights regarding the FBI's investigation of Louie Louie are particularly interesting. And he tells a lot of fun stories along the wayFor those interested in the fascinating history of Louie Louie, this book serves as a nice companion to Dave Marsh's bookLouie Louie: The History and Mythology of the World's Most Famous Rock 'n Roll Song; Including the Full Details of Its Torture and Persecution at the Hands ...

Each of his last few have a few good tunes, but they are not solid overall. Dog in the Sand is an appropriate name for this melodramatic drivel. What happened to the in your face energy that really made Frank Black shine. He has had moments on previous CD's, such as \\"Suffering\\" on the first Catholics album (which is my fave with the Catholics), or \\"Calistan\\" on Teenager of the Year. The Dog album is a total departure from any songs of that nature. I am disappointed, but I will buy the next because I know the great potential within the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of passion and energy","review":"I agree with the reviews that say this album lacks energy. Every time I hear of a new Frank Black album, I rush out to listen to it only to be thoroughly unimpressed with what I hear. And it's not his backing band's fault. Whenever I listen to Frank's voice as he sings, it sounds like he's holding back his power from within... as if he's about to explode with creative lyrical energy at any moment... but he doesn't! <sigh> I've about given up on Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring","review":"I bought two CDs this week. One was Frank's and the other was Linkin Park's. One is loud, full of energy and fun to listen to. The other one has a few catchy tunes but unfortunately it's boring. I hate to say it but Frank's new offering is the bland one. I'm a huge fan of the Pixies and Frank's earlier stuff (Frank Black & Teenager of the year-if you don't have these, buy them). He and the Pixies had such a unique sound. I miss the screaming, heavy guitar distortion, unusual speed changes and quirky lyrics. You'll find none of that stuff here. The band sounded like they were pretty tight but it didn't do anything for me. Frank, get [angry]. Start dating a teenager. Get a drinking problem. Talk to peachy peach about kissy kiss. I know you've still got it in you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the year so far along with Malkmus'album","review":"Thank you Frank Black for this new album: it has it all. The amazing awkward melodies, the incredible true stories (Llano del Rio, St.Francis Dam disaster), and lots of energy. You can feel the pleasure of the musicians as they play, enjoying every note. Do not expect the rawness of his last albums or the refined experimentation of the Pixies. This is something new. A great way to start your day: wake up listening to \\"Blast Off\\" and/or \\"If it takes all night\\". At least it works for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank's Best Since \\"Teenager...\\"","review":"Arguably Frank Black's best solo album in seven years, due in no small part to the return of Eric Drew Feldman, whose keyboards and layered synths helped define the sound of Black's first and best solo recordings. Moreover, Black is going beyond the country-tinged garage rock of the first 2 Catholics albums to create a more diverse and melodic collection of songs, and the numerous extra musicians give the tracks a more produced feel while live setting for the album keeps it fresh and vital. While some fans may be disappointed by the new direction (it's probably the quietest of Black's recordings, and Joey Santiago contributes to only three songs)the album is without filler, and the Catholics have never played better together as a band. It may not be a complete return to form, but Black & Co. finally sound like they're on the way back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relapsed \\"Catholics\\"","review":"Frank Black & The Catholics keep getting tighter with their latest release. Recorded almost entirely live (save for one edit as I've heard) this one is one of the sweetest collection of songs the former Pixies frontman since \\"Surfer Rosa\\". Mr. Black and his bandmates mix it up a lot on this album, evoking the Rolling Stones on some of the arrangements. Hell, the piano-playing alone is worth a listen. If you are a Pixies fan or are just plain sick of what is being crammed down your throat by MTV and its ilk, get this one. Familiar and fresh at the same time, \\"Dog and The Sand\\" is well worth the trip to your local record store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This is another typically solid Frank Black effort, with the highlights being \\"Bullet\\", also \\"St. Francis Dam Disaster\\", and \\"Hermaphrodito\\". Frank Black used a \\"small band\\" on \\"Pistolero\\", and he goes to a \\"big band\\" for \\"Dog In The Sand\\". Frank records his discs live, so there are no overdubs, extra guitar solos, etc... The use of seven or eight people on some songs make this disc sound like a typical studio album for the most part."},{"rating":"2","title":"The third FB & Catholic gem in a row...","review":"Once again live to 2-track, Frank and the gang have crafted more gems of pure rock quirkiness. You can immediately recognize their sound now that they've hit a stride for three solid albums in a row. Add a little more of a country flair and 70's nostalgia to a number of tunes (courtesy of piano, steel guitars, etc...) and you get to hear the boys loosen up to have a heck of a lot of futuristic flashback rock-n-roll fun. I wish more people would be able to experience and appreciate Frank Black for what he is doing now as much as what he did in the late 80's and early 90's. \\"Dog In The Sand\\" pretty much proves just how vital this band is today. In a world of soul-less electronic pop, Frank Black And The Catholics are just the guitar band we need. Here's the best rock-n-roll band you've never heard. Don't keep missing out! Respect the Rock!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story About Brave Young People","review":"I found this story to be very inspiring. The author does a great job of including historic details.

Picard, Riker and (I think!) Data are the three musketeers, Crusher is a pastoral maiden who feeds Barclay grapes, and, best of all, Troi stars as the \\"Goddess of Empathy\\" dressed in Greek robes.

Because of the 5.8GHz frequency, there is no interference from (or to) other RF devices (such as wireless routers, etc.). The ability to program one of the phones and send the learned information to other phones is GREAT. And the intercom feature is also very handy.I'm not a fan of the answering device, though. Here's why:> It doesn't have a counter> Once you've listened to the message, the blinking light stops - so how does my wife know I left one of the messages on the machine for her to listen to?> The time/date announce on the message comes AFTER the message, instead of before.

You should be aware that Panasonic only replaces defective phones with refurbed ones. Good thing I bought from Amazon which will replace them with a new one.

I thought I'd FINALLY found a 4 multi-handset system that had all the features I need, along with the expectation that it would deliver a good audio sound, until I realized this \\"basic\\" feature is missing on \\"apparently\\" all Panasonic cordless phones. I mean, a lighted keypad is standard on all wall phones & even the cheapest, crapiest cell phones. I can tell you from experience that it's no fun fumbling in the dark looking for a light to turn on, just to be able to use the phone. Been there, done that, no more.So the search continues...anything else I've researched all have their serious shortcomings & is going to be a compromise of some sort, especially if your first \\"must have\\" feature is good sound quality because the market is flooded with lousy audio quality phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor reception in an old house","review":"I've had this phone for a few months, purchased it to replace an older model Panasonic that broke down thanks to my small children. I thought that the higher freq would be better b/c I live in an old home and I have a wireless network for my PC's. Of the four phones, one worked only 1/4 of the time from day 1. The other three phones provide spotty reception in several areas of my older home, especially in the 2nd floor and basement. But even walking one or two rooms away from the phone's base made conversations difficult. I never had this problem with other cordless phones; I'm not sure if it's the model per se, the frequency (1st try at this higher freq) or just a lemon. Numerous phone conversations have been peppered with static and dropped words. I've tried everything to fix the problem -- it seems like my only solution will be to toss out this model and buy a new one all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic KX-TGto74B 5.8 GHz Digital cordless system.","review":"I purchased this Panasonic KX-TG6074B 5.8 GHx digital cordless anwswering system with 4 handsets just one month ago. So far, I am very pleased with this selection, although there could be some very minor improvements. The screen is a nice size but could remain lit for just a little longer and there is no lighted number buttons which makes it difficult in the dark. The annoucing voice will only say what appears on the screen and is awkward and sometimes unintelligible with even simple words and names being mispronounced. Overall, the sound quality is excellent, no interference found with a nearby computer set-up. I owned a panasonic before this but that suffered from in and out speaker phone problems as well as voice quality. This one is much, much better.

Purchased another rechargeable battery, and now ANOTHER handset has the same problem. Started out with good clarity, but now all handsets have a lot of static.

This is a very nice feature that should allow the call answerer to page someone else in the household, so as to preclude the \\"holler down the hallway\\" method, etc.Verification would be appreciated!I have obviously not bought anything yet.

Voice echos big time in this phone. Meaning you can hear your own voice echoing back to you while speaking on the handset. It is extremely frustating. I had seen a similar complain but it was only one person making such complain, so I thought it is probably a one off situation. But it is not. Panasonic support has not been able to solve the problem. I will be returning this phone at my own expense and probably will have to pay some restocking fee...not sure. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. There are plenty of other choices.

I got their demo, which is just incredible. It's an almost perfect mix (in my opinion) of old school thrash and the melodic death metal sound. Raw, rebellious, and sometimes downright scary.Having said that, I was not nearly as impressed with this album. To me, the spirit is gone. I don't know if the producer made them record so much that they lost their spark or what. Maybe they said such a high standard on their demo that anything else might seem average.Anyway, see if you can get your hands on the demo... their cover of \\"The Trooper\\" is great, but all of the original stuff is great, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst thing I've ever heard.","review":"Stay away from this.

In addition to a raft of rudimentary errors pointed out by other readers, Baxter also misidentifies the author of Helter Skelter (it's Vincent, not Steven, Bugliosi); refers to the cult film Spider Baby as Spider Boy; confuses Milton Berle with Arthur Godfrey (this incident is so mangled it's impossible to know who Baxter really means) and claims that Mean Streets (released in 1973) got lost in the shuffle because so many other high-profile movies were released that same year--including A Clockwork Orange (1971) and Deliverance (1972). But why go on? A real mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"There are so many examples of gratuitous name dropping in this \\"biography\\" that it is indeed a chore to get through it. As a fan of much of De Niro's work, I also realize he has made some poor role choices but Baxter has little to say that is positive. I learned some details regarding De Niro's early life and training that were somewhat interesting so I give it 2 stars for that but it seems that a better biography with more balance might be a better choice for the general reader. Actually then later chapters seem rushed as if Baxter was more concerned about hitting a deadline than producing a good and balanced book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book.","review":"Not interesting, made De Niro seem like a horrible actor.

I saw it for the first time a few months ago(in a rare screening) and have recently acquired the video and watched it again. Rip Torn is so good as country-western singer Maury Dann. This character is just evil, but evil in the kind of way that one can be fascinated by him. It's a great story in which you spend about a day and half with Maury, his band and his manager. There's lots of enjoyable behind-the-scenes type stuff(some of it is quite disturbing). If your a fan of films that might offend your sensibilities a little and you don't mind characters that aren't necessarily folks you'd want to join up with, you will enjoy this film. I sincerely hope it finds lots of new fans on video-it has all the makings of a cult classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read at Your Own Risk","review":"Let me tell you something that I really can't stand.

I tried to sell this book back and was offered $0.00 for it. So what does that tell you? I eventually threw the book in the trash because that's where it belonged. I couldn't enjoy Brants Native American culture without her mixing her lesbianism into it.

In fact, no matter what ip addresses I tried to ping, the ping times were always the same approximate numbers.

The ending was perfect for the author's point, however, and made the reader respect and admire the character even more.

A few of the inspiration sources were appealing, but honestly, many cited writers or artists who seem unfamiliar, dated, or obscure. The majority of the book features lots of white space with vignettes of travel photographs. I personally didn't get much out of them. None of them are provided as useable, digital resources. The book ends with scans of several letters from the 1980's to another designer (Rick Tharp), who doesn't seem to have any other relationship to the project.

But nothing seems to work to get the pizza to slide off! Maybe if I cooked the dough first, that would work, but that's not what I'd use a peel for!I've now set of the smoke alarms twice in my house because the pizza toppings have fallen off the pizza into the oven, while the pizza just sits on the dumb peel and refuses to move.And it's not like I'm using too many toppings: light sauce, cheese, mushrooms, and onions.Avoid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pizza paddle","review":"I am having a hard time getting the uncooked pizza off the paddle.

Another thing I like about the peel is at some point in making pies and shimming them onto the stone, cheese gets on the stone and we will sometimes get stuck crusts in these places - the wood peels do not work as well as these metal peel with a sharper edge at freeing those spots. One note, if you are moving from a wood peel to a metal one (as I was), I used to use flour on my wood peels to keep my pies from sticking and provide for easy transfer, flour does not do the job on the metal peel I have found. I switched to corn meal and it works great - I also like the taste of a little toasted corn meal on the bottom of my pie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can go in the dishwasher","review":"The handle and the peel can be separated and the peel put in the dishwasher.

DO NOT attempt to use this to slide a pizza into the oven or onto a stone and absolutely do not roll out the pizza dough and top the pizza on this. The dough sticks to the surface and completely ruins the pizza when part of it slides and the rest sticks onto it or folds over. It may work for taking out a pizza, but it's a complete disaster trying to slide pizza into the oven. I've tried it many times, coating it with tons of flour, tons of cornmeal, even olive oil, I stopped short of using WD40. Nothing works on this. I'm buying a wooden peel as soon as I have completely destroyed and bent this abomination out of shape so it can be used no more! A great concept, unfortunately terribly executed.

I like the design and the fact that the handle folds in for easy storage. The problem is that dough sticks like glue to this thing. I had to use 10x as much cornmeal on this than my wood peel. All that extra cornmeal burns and to much stays on the crust.

I thought I would give this a try after moving to a new place and needing a new pizza peel. This pizza peel, regardless of the amount of cornmeal placed on it, holds onto the pizza like an old friend. There is NO WAY you can get a prepared uncooked pizza off that peel and into the oven in one piece. It is an absolute disaster. I am going to buy another good old wooden one right after this review. The one thing this MAY come in handy for is to act as a $30 spatula to take the already cooked pizza off the stone. Otherwise, please don't waste your money. One ruined pizza is one too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aluminum Not Stainless Steel","review":"Advertised as stainless, but it is a low grade sheet aluminum. To Amazon's credit, Amazon immediately issued a prepaid credit return voucher and credited me purchase price plus shipping and my phone request for a refund took all of about five minutes including hold time. Maybe this is a newer version that has superseded the advertised one, and maybe the earlier reviews were of an earlier product that was solid stainless.

I was so nervous about spending this much on a pan, but it is well worth it. The first one we got went back as the \\"cookbook\\" is missing (the second one does not have one either!! So I'd not expect one!), the bottom had a ring of missing coating, and the inside was scratched. It was like it was used and sent back and repackaged to go back out. The new one looks fine (except not any little booklet like promised on the package). It does state to \\"season\\" it before use. I noticed people complaining of the coating coming off, we've not had that happen yet. Use warm, soapy water to wash, with a cloth or sponge, dry immediately and I think you should be good to go.

It strikes a good balance between a mere book of giving skin deep introductory knowledge of game theory, and a book with too much technical stuff (esp. mathematical proof). The author made a good job almost like Stephen Hawking and Richard Feyman to explain difficult thing with an easy and friendly way. What's more, the author included also many varies paradoxes, theroms from many great leaders in the game theory's field. In beginning of each chapter, the author listed some questions for the reader to think about, before moving forward. I must say this is a very good book for those who are not very sophisticated and advance in mathematics, or as a very first entry for anyone who wants to pursuit and learn game theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good introduction,many good examples","review":"My brother and I have both read the book and both of us enjoyed it. I know little about game theory, but I have found it to be one of the most interesting subjects I have read.

I highly recommend learning about the subject and this book is a good beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entry point. Well Written.","review":"The book is very well written, and surprisingly easy to read, considering how dry the subject matter can be at times. Gives a very nice introduction to the topic, and finishes off with a more formal discussion of some advanced topics.If you are a mathematician, this book is probably excruciatingly easy for you, and probably has little academic value. But, if you are a layman, with an interest in systems and games, it really gives you a lot to think about, and a new way to think about it. It introduces a method of determining possible outcomes, as well as giving a nice overview of more sophisticated concepts, should you decide to explore the topic more fully.Each chapter begins with some questions to consider while reading, and detailed answers to help at the back of each chapter. The only real issue I found with the book is that the questions are missing from chapter one, yet the answers are there.

I was not much into the boy band thing, But when I heard the first hit released by them titled \\"Invisable Man\\". I really liked the song, it did not sound like an ordinary boy band song from N'sync,Backstreet Boys,LFO etc. As time went on, they released other great songs such as I Do (Cherish You),The Hardest Thing, My Everything,and my personal favorite \\"True To Your Heart\\". Even though they are currently not together any longer, they did leave there mark. Still in my opinion, they were very underrated compared to N'sync and Backstreet Boys.

This album has all their hits, from \\"Invisible Man\\" to \\"Why\\", and their biggest hit \\"The Hardest Thing\\". Other great songs are \\"Because Of You\\", \\"My Everything\\", \\"Was It Something I Didn't Say\\", and \\"Thank God I Found You (w/ Mariah Carey)\\". However, I found their fast songs not half as good as their ballads...\\"Give Me Just One More Night\\" is quite repetitve, and in the middle of the song, there was a part where a girl is speaking Spanish...I find that quite lame.

It does not star Bruce Lee and is not directed by Robert Clouse, as advertised by amazon.

I lost it at that point and went into heavy skim mode.If men in real life talked like the dialogue of these guys, we gals are in trouble. The silly situations were a real stretch.

Their leader dances at the top of the pole without a rope!

It teaches bad topology, doesn't impart the artistic imortance of appeal in characters, and gives students the impression that this is the norm. The animation section is just as cursory and has the potential for being just as misleading. Understand that this book is just the beginning and does not represent the best of the industry.The rigging section... yeah that's not so bad. The major problem there is that it's not a complete industry standard rig by the current norms. Those being wiring parameters for spline-based control rigs to actually manipulate the characters morphs and digits etc. A large control ring and handles would've been good and if there's a section on knee and elbow directional manipulators, I didn't see it.hope this was helpful :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"More soulless exploitation","review":"The original concept of Robot Wars is further and further lost in merchandizing, as the production companies who think they own the concept of robot battle squeeze every bit of profit they can from the competitors.

It didn't.This is really one of the most poorly-written books I've ever read. I was so sad about it because I really yearn for a realistic character, and normally I can give an author kudos for the attempt, but I really wish this attempt had never been made. There were grammar and spelling errors, and I felt as if it was written by a junior-high kid. Initially I was going to concede that at least Ballard had a knack for building sexual anticipation, but when she stopped just short of the act with some broad reference to \\"and then they had great sex\\" I threw up my hands. I'm so disappointed. I am hopeful that perhaps Pat's skill will increase with time and in a few years I can come back to her.Please, if you're looking for a good full-figured romance novel I suggest you look over some of the other books I've reviewed, this one might just turn you against the genre for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book not usfull any more","review":"The College board has changed the test from Pascel, what this book talks about to C++, which is not covered in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors","review":"I have noticed many errors in this book.

Furthermore, don't bother to buy this book if you've read any of his other books, cause this book is merely a cut and paste version of stuff he's already published in his Rapid Fat Loss Book etc. In a nutshell: Basically all he says in this book is what we already know about dieting. Eat less calories, and be more flexible so we can do this for the long term. Well, I paid $50 for this, so buyer beware.

Throughout the whole film I had no idea what was happening. The acting was terrible. The audio and video quality was bad compared to his other films. The characters are so dull that I had no feelings for them at all. This movie is also VERY boring, most of the movie takes place in a room where almost nothing happens.

The quality of the toy does not feel sturdy as did the other one. I feel we have been ripped off and now that I am trying to contact this seller to return, they will not get back to me. Do yourself a favor, go to the nearest Target, buy one there and not this one! You will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My boys love it","review":"It is ok. The wings don't work so great going in an out of their slots, and the bottom body moves and twists all the way around. My boys being 2 and 3 have a hard time getting him to stand because the bottom goes every which way. They love it though and that is what really counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I bought this toy thinking it was brand new in the box, what I got was a $50 piece of garbage that didn't work, WAS NOT a Disney licensed product, and was damaged from play. It had been taken out of the box and deliberately stuck back in with cut zip-ties. Quite plainly, I got ripped off, and have seriously doubted the quality of items purchased on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look like buzz. Maybe his Latino cousin.","review":"This buzz has dark skin, nothing like the fair skinned rosy cheeked toy in the movie. His eyebrows are too light. His gloves and the middle portion of his suit are gray, not green/purple like in the movie. I've seen better buzz's that aren't made from Disney. Seriously, did they even watch the movie?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a USED toy for retail prices!","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews. It has problems. It is used and repackaged. It doesn't work all that well, but my daughter loves it. I don't have anything against used toys, but I have something against a $40 used toy that I would have paid $4.00 for at a yard sale. It is scratched, loose, doesn't move properly, everything everyone else said. I live overseas on a military base. So returning and re-ordering (not from this guy) would have taken at least a month. She was not letting go of him as soon as she saw him so there you go. I went back and forth w/ Amazon who finally gave me $10 of the $40 back as a refund. So, I think that is the end of it. Still...$30 for a used toy is almost as bad. Amazon has always done right by us, dunno why they are still letting this vendor sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest quality toy","review":"This toy is a piece of crap. My son had it for less than 24 hours and the arm fell off. Of course, it's the arm with the laser! As other reviewers have mentioned, the pop-up wings are sketchy at best. Also, when I tried to slide back Buzz's retractable helmet, one side of it popped out. Unfortunately, we cannot return this broken, poor quality product to the store because my son's grandparents bought it for him, and they threw away the box. I guess they are from a generation when toys lasted. KrazyGlue isn't working, so I suppose it's on to the trusty duct tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buzz","review":"Buzz is big and bulky and is not easy for my son to play with. He does not stand up easily, his arms only rotate from the elbow. The sound effects are nice but other than that, the rest is not impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun but tippy","review":"Overall this is a great toy. It's really Tim Allen saying things like \\"This is an intergalactic emergency\\" and 4 other sayings (I think). The laser button is fun, too.Quibbles:-It is almost impossible to get him to stand up - he tips over very easily- The wings are hard to fold up. You have to push in and down and hear them click.

Cheers to well-designed reasonably priced products."},{"rating":"1","title":"iHate","review":"I just received this as a Christmas present. And it was even on my Christmas Wish List. It was something that sounded great on paper, but not in practice.First of all, you can't attach headphones to this device. This is a very basic feature that I am finding it hard to find anymore on clock radios. It has a Line Out, but that is only for powered speakers. Because apparently someone might want to hook up their clock radio alarm clock to their stereo system???Also, the display is very late 80's. It is a basic LCD display and the lowest light on the display still lights up the bedroom. So I have to turn off the back light and therefore can't see the time during the night!AND, I used it to listen to podcasts on my 80gb iPod. It connected just fine and I could listen to the podcasts just fine, however, when I connected the iPod back to my Mac it told me the iPod was corrupted and I needed to restore the whole iPod!Needless to say, it is going back as soon as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clock that can't keep time","review":"Every month or two I have to manually re-set the time as the clock gains a minute every few weeks.It doesn't really matter how or whether the rest of the functions work if you can't even use it as a clock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for a good ipod alarm clock","review":"The reason I settle on this model were the price and the fact that the backlight can be turned off. I am a light sleeper and the iHome would wake me up. The audio quality is pretty good but not fantastic. Radio reception has a little more static to it than any of my home stereos. The quickness of the alarm to get to the highest level is really startling in the morning but not a deal breaker. The remote with mine only has a range of 3 feet. All in all it was a good purchase for the price. All ipod alarms clocks have quirks or features missing so you basically have to decide which feature mean the most to you. This one is the one for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I've searched long and hard for a good priced iPod dock clock radio. I've tried all the models at target, sears, BB, CC....etc. I've tried the iHome IH5 at my stay in the Mandalay bay hotel in vegas, and the sound is comparable to the iLuv177. The iLuv may sound a bit better in fact. The best sounding iPod clock radio I found was the Philips A300 but it lacked an AM radio which is a necessity for me to listen to news radio.Only problem I have is that the dials on top of the iLuv are extremely hard to turn as there is no grip and it's quite stiff. I sent iLuv (jwin) and email and they promptly responded with an Return authorization. It wasn't a big deal for me since I can control what I needed from the included remote. I did not return the item. iLuv did not skimp on the accessories (all ipod adapters, antenna, a/v plugs, hefty power adapter)or customer service. I would have rated a 5 if it wasn't for the dials being so difficult to turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this product!!!","review":"The picture didnt do justice to this product, it seemed big and powerful from the pictures displayed on Amazon.

Nokia E90 sound is louder and better than what you espect from it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great at keeping the time","review":"I had this item for 2 years before it became completely unreliable. It would spontaneously turn off (often with a loud annoying noise) while I had it on the radio or ipod function, and sometimes it would turn off in the middle of the night and wouldn't turn back on so the alarm wouldn't go off. Not such a great product if you're counting on it to get up on time. I think there's probably better alarm clocks out there for iPods, and I moved on to the \\"iHome\\" now. I'm sad that this piece of electronic equipment didn't last more than 2 years. I had an radio alarm clock in high school that is still going strong 10 years later. The iLuv was also not so great at keeping time. It ran a bit fast, so that if I didn't reset it every couple of days, it was 10 minutes faster than my watch. I did like that it included the chords to plug it into my TV, I watched my movies from my iPod that way a couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great speaker system","review":"I purchased this iLuv iPod Speakers System for Christmas and it has been great for listening to my iPod and iPod nano in the bathroom while getting ready in the morning.

It is also small enough to fit on the counter top without taking up much room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"After doing a lot of research on iPod docks, I decided to go with this one after seeing all of the great reviews.

Great design, great sound, great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Display & Tuning","review":"Pros - solidly built, speakers sound good, has adapters for every size iPod, large numbers on clock display with date and time in 12 or 24 hr format, easy to see in the daytime. It's a good size docking station, so be sure to make note of the dimensions. Cons - difficult to set. With the iPod type spin dials on the top it was difficult to find the right touch to turn them & it wasn't consistent. The display has four settings, off, dim for which there is very little contrast so it's hard to see if you're 45+. Medium & bright were like headlights shining in the room at night. If you weren't using it in a bedroom I'd give it 3-4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not set the clock.","review":"It is hard to review fully this product because I bought it to serve as an alarm clock and I never could set the clock. I returned the defective item for credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"Took a little while for me to get this product, as I'm in Georgia and the distribution center is in Arizona. That was no big deal. The product itself is awesome; the sound quality is very good and I had no problem with my ipod nano hookup. It's really nice to wake up every morning to my favourite music. The light is not overly bright, but you do have the option to turn it all the way off if you want. The only troublesome thing is the snooze button on the remote...you have to fuss with it just a bit to snooze, but even that isn't a big deal. Over all, I'm very happy with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I exptected!","review":"This product has been wonderful. It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.

I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"The sound was inferior--tinny to a degree that was downright irritating. It seemed cheaply built with flimsy materials, and it's silly not to include an adapter cable for using other brands of MP3 players. These cables are very inexpensive and would eliminate the need for another, separate order; I didn't notice that it wasn't included. Fortunately, my son had extra cable and the iLuv worked fine with my Creative Zen Nano. The sound was just too lousy, though, and I returned the product. Amazon refunded my purchase immediately. In my experience, their customer service is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm volume control issues","review":"I purchased this mainly as an alarm but was happy with the multiple features it offered. I was disappointed that the volume of the morning alarm could not be set below \\"10\\" which was, IMHO very loud. There was a sticker added to the manual explaning that the alarm volume could not be set below '10', but if you were just listening to the radio like during the day, you could easily adjust the volume down below ten or up. Since there was this 'sticker' added after the fact in the usage guide, I have to believe it was a manufacturing 'oversight' during product design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what he wanted!","review":"I purchased this for my son for his birthday.

It sounds really good and has some nice features...but a couple things that are lame - the button to forward the time etc is the dumbest design! Who wants to have to twirl a button continually?

Additionally, a friend of mine own's an i-home clock radio (which is similar) and I like this one better. It has two alarms (so you can set a buzzer or radio backup if you forget your ipod or just have two different times a day your alarm goes off!) which is a very nice feature. The remote doesn't seem to work fine enough. Also, it's nicer lookign than the i-home.My only complaint, so far, is that the nano adaptor does not fit my nano.

The docking connector that the ipod connects to is directly attached to the circuit board so you need to be super careful in attaching and removing your ipod.

The dimmer causes some problems at night but overall goes unnoticed. It fully charges both our ipods and we have no problem using the click wheel buttons on the top. The alarm has never caused issues for us as far as it being too loud, but we do not have it directly next to our bed either.

The dual alarms are nice and the display is a good size. I like the remote too.The sound is excellent. I get great FM reception and music from the iPod is superb (if you don't need a lot of bass).Now for the issues. The lowest brightness setting is too bright at night, so I simply turn off the display (easily done by tapping the snooze bar). The volume and setting wheels on top are very cheesy, I have to turn and turn and turn them to get them to change the setting, fortunately once you've set your alarm times, you don't need them anymore as all other functions that use these wheels can be performed on the remote. Finally the shuffle connection works to charge the shuffle, but cannot play music from the shuffle no matter what I tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Stereo has relatively good sound-- it's smaller than I expected but it works perfectly fine.

First of all, it always is behind on the time and I have to fix the time every two weeks or so since it gets off by 5 to 10 minutes. Second, the first one I bought was defective and the buttons didn't work. I should have taken this as a clue because when I got the second one the buttons worked for about 6 months and then went out and now only some work and only half the time. Third, after a year of use, it no longer plays my iPod, which is the main reason I bought it.

The softest volume setting allowed is way too loud.I was also not at all impressed with the AM/FM reception.On the plus side, when connected to my iPod, the unit seems to work and sound pretty well and the remote control is handy.

Unfortunately, after appx. 3 months, the max brightness began \\"flickering\\", and now, max brightness is nothing more than a faint light (and yes, still flickering). ALL the dimmer brightness levels have dropped appx. 80% and seem to continuously get worse.

When the ipods were connected I could use the buttons on the device and the remote to tell the ipods to play and stop. I could also advance and reverse the play list, but there was no sound, nor would either device charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound from iPod and radio.","review":"This i177 has dual alarms and a radio as well as being able to play music from an iPod. The remote control is very small but does it's job. The i177 will charge most iPods but will not (like a lot of devices) charge the iPod touch 2G.The big snooze bar makes it easy to snooze for a few more minutes after the alarm goes off.The round knobs are sometimes difficult to spin since they are flat and smooth. It would be nice if they were textured or if the knobs were replaced by push button digital controls.One big downside is that when you wake with radio from an alarm the volume is very loud. It has a preset level that can't be changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"iLuv i177 Alarm Clock Speaker System for iPod (Black)","review":"I recently purchased this radio alarm clock.

I chose this model after reviewing other models and a popular complaint of the other systems was the brightness of the time display. This model has three brightness settings and an OFF setting for the display so is perfect for those who like total darkenss! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the size. This is much bigger than any traditional alarm clock I have ever owned and takes up a considerable amount of space on my night stand.

The above mentioned glitches I can live with for the sound quality and the price as long as the problem is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wake To\\" Button suddenly died.","review":"Amazon replaced it with a second unit after the first one had issues with the \\"Wake To\\" button. I could not choose between iPod, Radio or Buzzer to wake up to. The second unit arrived and it worked fine for a few days and then the \\"Wake To\\" button stopped working again.

Several problems came up through handling this product. First, about a third of the time I try to use the speakers, it plays nothing until I unplug the iLuv from its power source and plug it back in and press play. Also, the clock always skips ahead 10 minutes just days after I reset it. Overall, it's not a reliable dock for playing music and telling time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"I've owned this for about 3 years and I'm shocked at how badly it has performed.First, the good. The quality is good for what you pay for.Now, the rest. It can't keep time. The clock loses about 10 minutes every 2-3 months and has to be reprogrammed. Can't believe that's an issue in this day and age. Second, the speakers now thump wildly if it is left plugged in. I googled the problem and it seems to occur with car speakers but I don't know how it can be fixed for less than the cost of replacement. The interface is annoying - buttons in strange places and not very responsive. The remote died after two years.I don't understand why this received such a good review on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after two months","review":"I was pleased with my system when I first received it. My iPod worked well with it and the sound quality was enough for me. I was immediately annoyed by how bright the display was in my dark bedroom but I had read about that in the reviews so I couldn't blame the unit. I also had trouble setting the alarm -- not sure if that was user error or a problem with the clock. After about two months the radio stopped working. I sent the unit back to the manufacturer over two weeks ago and I have heard nothing from them. It's difficult to get anyone on the phone. I'm pretty disappointed with what looked like a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality!","review":"I liked it at first despite the fact that the time shone, at its lowest setting so brightly, it lit up the room. I put a clear red film over it to darken it. After a few months, one of the lights went out so that I now have a choice between very dim (with no red film) ~ my fave, STROBE!, or bright-ish. All this is annoying but I can adapt. The dock fitting for my nano didn't fit so I just had to plug it in free standing. Add too that, I just got a Nano, gen 4 and this iLuv doesn't charge it! It charged my old nano but not this one.Now the \\"can't live without\\" feature doesn't work! I used to set the time for 15 minutes of play to put me to sleep and then it shuts off. Now that I can't do that, it has become worthless.I abhor waste and it kills me to have to chuck this after 1 1/2 years. No more iLuvs for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away - Bad design","review":"I purchased a white one of these for the holidays. Less than 6 months later the connector for docking the ipod broke off from the circuit board. Unfixable. Really a bad design and very cheap. Wasted my money with this device. In addition, the clock radio features a gradual volume increase when the radio goes off at the set time. Not a bad idea except you can't turn off the feature and the volume starts loud and gets so loud so quickly that it will wake the entire house up. The worse part is this is the only way for you to use the wake to radio/IPOD feature. Why you can't preset a constant volume when setting the wake time is clearly another bad design. I would not recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work with Shuffle!","review":"Specifically bought this because it said it worked with the I-pod Shuffle.

The music-related features were fine (docking, charging, speaker quality, sleep mode, etc) but its a crappy clock design that doubles as a very bright night light.The numerals are gray on a gray background...difficult to read at night. And yet the background is lit very brightly, even on the dimmest of three settings. My 8yo who sleeps with a very bright night light loved that mom and dad's room was \\"all lit up.\\" Me, not so much. I had to turn the light off completely to sleep and thus you can't see what time it is at all if you wake up in the night. If that's not enough...it also hums periodically and the buzzer tone sounds like a fire alarm, so I can't imagine anyone would want to wake up to that instead of music.It's going back. Bah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a very good product all the way around.

All in all pretty pleased with the purchase. It was well packaged and worked flawlessly with my iPod Mini. There are five additional templates that can be used to dock different models. Panicked at first because they didn't have one for the Mini, but it was already installed on the model. Cons:- Light dimmer has three settings, but even the lowest is too bright. You can turn it off and it can be controlled by the remote.- No ability to set a permanent alarm by day of week. For example 7:00AM Monday to Friday, no alarm on Weekends.- Wake to music starts and accelerates to the preset (by you) volume in something like 7 seconds so it is definitely not gentle.- Sound is great for an alarm clock. Don't think it will compare with a mini stereo or Bose SoundDock.Would buy again at the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Hey! if you dont have money, but you want to buy a Speaker System that really make you feel proud of what you pay, you have to buy this one, you will remember me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Welch Choirs","review":"Great mens' choirs from all over Wales.

The melodrama was tacky, the characters weakly developed, and the storyline lacking any logical sequence. Missing is that smashing cinematography that we see in later films like Face-Off or Hard Boiled, or the strong character development seen in Face-Off, Hard Boiled or The Killer. If you're merely browsing for a good HongKong action flick, skip this baby. If you're interested in seeing how John Woo's cinematographic genius developed and how he came to be where he is today, go to your local Asian video store and rent this movie. If you're die hard John Woo and wanna just buy anything by him, beware...this film isn't what you'd expect it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye, Chinaman","review":"It's Woo's Showgirls, or Hook-take your pick.

Instead, I finished it before my vacation even started! I could not put this book down. As an avid reader of science fiction/fantasy I have read my share of mindless novels. This book is anything but mindless. It recalls to my mind the fantastic Roger Zelazny series that was awarded both the prestiguous Hugo (mystery) and Nebula (science fiction) awards. You will be quickly caught up in the mystery that Mr. Stone carefull unfolds in this first of a series. My only complaint: when does the second one come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!!","review":"Do not bother buying this product.

If you find out it is send it back to the company and demand for a refund. This is truly false advertisement.

Now almost 30 years later, it FINALLY shows up as an overpriced CD from Japan. Personally, I grew tired of waiting for this album to appear on CD, so in 2005, I remastered my mint vinyl album & combined it with the previous classic from 1979 (''What Cha Gonna Do With My Lovin'') to create a 2 on 1 CD (Both albums fit PERFECTLY on a single disc!!). This is what should've been done by the company who's charging over $30.00 for the items here on Amazon. Make no mistake, 'Sweet Sensation' is a classic album, BUT not for this price!!

Where have I been? I only recently discovered this author but boy am I sure glad I did. I kid you not. Ms. St. John is fantastic and Lady of valur is my kind of romance. I don't want to give too much away, but here's the storyline: After coming upon his wretched and very dead comrade on Crusade, Sir Cabal is ordered by King Richard to oversee the dead man's castle, skillfully and independently being run by his beautiful widow. What makes this medieval stand out in my mind are the characters. Cabal and Emmalyn are adults and act like it all the while they must fight their attraction to one another. Their love story begins as a friendship and they both heal one another. The love story is beautiful, poignant and touching. You will enjoy this novel immensely. I cannot wait for her next book.

I admit it, I had some pretty high expectations after St. John's great debut Lord of Vengeance, but Lady of Valor satisfied me on every level. Pair a hardened, lethal warrior with a wounded, yet proud, widow, then mix in some dark secrets and political intrique and you have a winning medieval tale filled with emotion and sensuality!Unlike the previous reader, I actually felt that these two characters were more real and more connected than the ones in the first book. This is a totally different kind of story than Lord of Vengeance and while I probably liked the action of the first better -- it was a more energetic plot -- I liked the depth of character and tender unfolding of Lady. Not to mention the great love scenes! It does have its share of action and excitement too, but it's really a story about two wounded people learning to trust each other and love.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Good Stuff by Lara Adrian","review":"I love Lara's Midnight Breed series; once I finished them, I was hungry for anything she'd written.

A quick read because you don't want to put it down. Both Emmalyn and Cabal are great characters. The only thing I did not like was the ending. I only say that because I do not feel like everything was wrapped up. Sure they took care of Hugh temporarily, but in real life he would still come back with the authorities to take Cabal in custody for the murder charge, and he would then hang. Then Emmalyn would lose Fallonmour when John becomes king, if she did not lose it before then, without Cabal being around. However she just wrapped it up basically as they lived happily ever after and all this just went away. I loved the book. I just thought it would have been better if Hugh would have died instead of living, and that his death would be by some other means than Cabal or Emmalyn killing him. That would have more than likely taken away the murder charge and later possibly losing Fallonmour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful reading","review":"The premise of this book sounds good, brave heroine survives bad marriage, keeps the manor going bravely.

As the book is centered around food, I usually read it while enjoying a grilled cheese sandwich. It's the perfect \\"snack book\\".Even though I'm almost 30, I still find the story to be hilarious and entertaining.

Why? Because it is creative. I bet that the author probably came up with this story as she was making a meal and wondered what happened if she never had to cook, but had someone else do it for her. She then created the tiny town of Chewandswallow, which is supplied its meals by the weather. At first, the town is happy and well supplied. But, ironically, mother nature shows who is boss and turns against the town, forcing the people to have to leave. One page after another is full of inspired creativity (The open roof restaurants, the sanitation department, the way people evacuate the city and so forth). Perfect for all ages. Just don't get crushed by a hamburger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fun fun!","review":"The story begins at breakfastime with a regular family in a regular home.

It's like any other town except that it gets its weather 3 times a day at breakfast, lunch, and dinner.The townspeople carry around their knives, forks, and plates. That's because it never rains rain or snows snow - it rains orange juice and snows mashed potatoes!Then one day the weather takes a turn for the worse and the people of Chewandswallow are not safe anymore!This story is absolutely delightful but the illustrations just bring this book to life. Ron Barrett illustrates the book and his work is so detailed and eye-catching.I love the tomato tornado and the jello mold sunset pictures.

The scope comes with a nice case, the rod and tripod collapse into thirds, and there is a strap to keep the tripod together and carry it with.I was expecting something a little cheap with some corners cut for the price, but as I have been using it to set up some retaining walls and grading over the last few weeks, I have found no faults with the tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I guess my disappointment is mostly my fault, I actually expected to get a decent transit for $150. For clarification to those of you who think the same thing, this is not a transit. It is just a toy scope on a tripod. There are no degree graduations around the base and the plumb bob mentioned in the description did not come with it.

She needs to explore her spirt more in depth.Realise this that our lives and purposes are probably way beyond 10 reasons only, we could go into infinitude and many possibilities.

Basically, if you don't see the words \\"I am Wiccan\\", you're not going to be happy with any book if YOU are Wiccan; so get over it already, and stop wasting your money on non-Wiccan books. There are plenty of books out there for your religion!That said, this book *could* be more complete, as with all of her books. I would personally have preferred that she just compile all of her little booklets into one volume, it would make for a much better read!I enjoy all of Ms. Riva's books; she tells it like it is, instead of putting that sappy, happy-face-on-everything twist that today's Wiccan authors do.

Then I was disappointed by the characters, because they don't act as if they were real. I think they are too simple. Every person has only one target to get to, and that's not enough for a good book , in my opinion.Oliver Russel doesn't look plausible to me, because of his affairs. But I liked Leslie Stewart.

There are a few nuggets in the book worthy of my money (for instance, an easy way to chart home energy usage and references for state and federal incentives) but, for the most part, Ramsey only explores solar power technology to the brink of what one can figure out for himself through common sense. Little detail is given, where detail would be appropriate, even in the context of a \\"Complete Idiot's\\" guide (except, perhaps, the constant reminder that Mr. Ramsey also has another book on the market under the \\"Complete Idiot's\\" series).

It is only for a reader with zero knowledge about solar power who wants to know the very basics. It does not delve deeply into any aspect of solar power, rather it covers most of the subjects at a fourth grade level. The author is more interested in putting forth his environmental viewpoint than in actually educating the reader about the subject. That's fine, except why would you purchase this book if you were not already somewhat environmentally aware? Perhaps more people care about the cost savings. Pretty much the title sums it up. Only a Complete Idiot would buy it. I guess that makes me guilty as charged. In summary, if you know NOTHING about solar energy, buy this book. If you want detail and schematics etc. buy a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple guide to a complex topic","review":"Solar power makes sense. But learning how to put it to work is a little more complex -- until Dan Ramsey's book arrived.

This is my favorite of the middle Mozart concertos -- perhaps the best the composer wrote for that period -- and one of Ashkenazy's best performances in his set of concertos.No. 21 isn't bad either, though there are times when Ashkenazy could have really used someone else on the podium to hold things a little better and bring out more of the subtlties in this score.

The movie takes 87 minutes to tell a story that could have taken ten minutes or less. All of the elements that one would have expected in a film like this (violence, suspense, sex, gothic horror, etc.) are on the cheap side (both in quality and quantity). The sets were only mediocre, consisting of a mixture of the gothic and 70's kitsch. The film's saving grace was the acting and dialog, which for the most part were not too bad. Not deserving of its cult status.

That should serve as a warning. A poorly executed plot (if you can call it that) simply serves as an excuse to show the two stars having sex, sex and more sex. To its credit, the film does have a gothic feel to it with a castle setting and moody lighting. But, unfortunately, you need much more to make a good film.

While the plights of Fran (Marianne Morris) and Miriam (Anulka) are never clearly explained, their onscreen seductions and violence perpetrated on male victims are such that it is hard to imagine anyone sleeping well after upon watching this movie.Not the best of its kind, but certainly worthy of the occasional rewatching with pals on a movie night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I saw this movie in 1974 as a double billing with \\"Black Christmas\\" and both films scared me in a different way.

Fran and Miriam kill their victims with whatever is at arms reach or mouths reach. The music is subtle the house is creepy (same house used in \\"Rocky Horror picture Show\\") Watch in the dark late at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame attempt at a good movie","review":"This could have been so much more. Joseph what were you thinking. If your intent was to make it horrofiying, it wasn't. If your desire was to make it erotic, it fell short of that. If you wanted it to fall somewhere in between, then you missed on that one too. Not enough nudity to be erotic, i.e. more naked Anulka. And not enough terror to make it scary, i.e. only the last few minutes are worth mentioning. All in all if you just shot Anulka naked for 87 minuets that would have been worth the price. What I'm trying to say is it was too slow, set your DVD's to fastforward on this one guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drags because it is foreign","review":"It was not as excellent as I was hoping.

The plot is paper thin (hell, I could have written it!) and poses numerous questions without bothering to answer any of them. Even the film's title is a bit of a misnomer. But, let's face it...the whole point of the film is to set up situations that allow the two female \\"vampyres\\" to disrobe and display their bodies (no complaints here!). Getting to view the two stunning ladies repeatedly in nude scenes is enough to earn this film four stars in my book! Seriously though, this film does have a Hammeresque quality to it and the setting is very atmospheric (nice blend of mid-70's style with a touch of gothic). The acting is pretty good, too. But, the film loses a star due to it's lack of storyline and departure from classic vampire lore. Classic horror? No. Classic erotica? Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Blood Drinking Romp","review":"Beautiful ladies of the night in twighlight zone fashion. Sexy sexy sexy!Seduce men, have sex, drink blood!

The violence is truly shocking and disturbing, and by the end, I was more than a little creeped out and quite glad I'd left the lights on. The actresses really go all out and appear quite unhinged and bloodthirsty, and the director makes so much of his cast and locations that you'd hardly know this was shot on a shoe-string budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no, not again...","review":"Ok, we had the Three (real) Tenors.

Now I am back into fitness and got the DVD based on the previous reviews. When the DVD came, I sat to watch it first and could NOT get past the cheesy chatter, costumes and outdated routine.

It took me 4 weeks to start seeing the definition come back in my arms and legs like I wanted.

Honestly, the acting seemed forced, and there wasn't any sort of play between Robert Forster and Donnie Wahlberg, which seemed to be the main focus of this film. Just a seriously calmed down older guy and a clich�� young guy who wants to have sex with every girl he meets.

Not good enough for nearly $50, looks like someone has made it on their home computer and photocopied the cover - colours very watery. Also came in 3 shrink wrapped DVD cases glued together - no proper box. The Legacy is brilliant, obviously, and I'm thrilled to be able to watch season 2, but the presentation of this set is shocking.

I'm definitely not returning mine until we know what's happening, or I'll just keep it cause it's mostly all there.

The packaging was totally different and to top it off it Listed only Disc 5-8. What happened to 1-11. Please do not use this company again. I have lost a little excitmenet about Amazon.

(And frankly, I never saw the computer as much of a benefit -- but that's hardly my point.)Furthermore, once Allegro had my email address, they sent me spam newsletters every day. I had to un-subscribe to stop them.

Is it possible that your favorite may not be in the book? it's possible. But, that does not make the book a bad book. The book demonstrates that skating existed pre-1990 and has had a history worth holding on to. I feel that older skaters will get more enjoyment from the book, because it brings back memories.

The sound was there and the time was right. Things, simply put, just clicked within the band for this short period of time. All of the songs have redeeming value and they all sound fresh. Now take all of that and cont in that this was a DEBUT album? That is beyond mind blowing. Of course there is a double edged sword there and the immediate fame can most certainly be attributed to the quick demise of the band. Perhaps it was best left this way though as the music remains.

Someone has actually put this very unremarkable middle of the road rock album on the same list as Bellavista Terrace by The Go-Betweens; did you even listen to either of them? Granted, \\"Hibernate\\" is a promising opening track, but it's all downhill from there.When a band is Australian and/or of the \\"indie\\" variety, it's okay to admit that they don't have much of a following for the most obvious of reasons...The 2 stars are for the pretty picture of snow capped mountains on the album sleeve."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful reprint","review":"I'm no calligrapher. That said, I've a deep love and appreciation for penmanship and also for reading and learning about antique script hands. This short work by one of the greatest engravers and calligraphers ever is a wonderful read, a fun way to practice penmanship (as an advanced study)and a rich (if by no means comprehensive) source of samples for persons interested in 18th Century engraving, handwriting and calligraphy.I can't imagine recommending this little book to beginners. For one thing, Copperplate (the writing hand of the 18th Century)is not a hand most people learn in grade school and use as kids. Thankfully, there is a real revival of interest in Copperplate scripts and for those of us who are already trying their hand at Copperplate, and perhaps working with some other calligraphic scripts, this book is quite a good resource -- one of two by Mr. Bickham reproduced by Dover Publications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penmanship Made Easy -- Not!","review":"I have trouble calling this a book.

I highly, highly recommend this product to anyone with FMS or RA. As the years have progressed, so has my RA; as a college student, I cannot begin to explain how much these pens help me as I take notes in a three-hour-long lecture.

I was constantly clearing jams out of this thing, and when it did staple, the staples often wouldn't go all the way through and I'd be forced to bend the staple closed manually. I also had issues with the adjustable paper guide not staying in place and my sheets were often stapled much further down than I wanted.I just spent 30 minutes trying to staple seven sheets of paper and constantly clearing out jams, it is no longer working at all.

It's a good movie, not great, but good. The film is based on a play and is very much a showcase for Anna Neagle who gets to play 2 different characters (mother and daughter), but also as well as to reprise scenes from two of her biggest hit movies playing Nell Gwyn and Queen Victoria in dream sequences. For the Flynn fans, you will find a different Flynn than you are used to, he is a song and dance man here and functions as Anna Neagle's leading man rather than the real star of this picture. David Farrar is also featured and gives a pleasant performance as well. If you are not a fan of Ms. Neagle's, you will not care much for this film. If you are, you will enjoy it but I would strongly recommend you seek out the color versions available rather than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous insight into Clinton presidency","review":"Whether you admired the 42nd President or not, many agree he had fabulous oratorical skills. A person who is partly responsible for that was Michael Waldman, his chief speechwriter and author of POTUS Speaks. Even though he admits having a bias for Clinton, it is clearly non-evident in this book, in comparison to grossly negative statements or outlandish praises about a complex President. If you've ever wanted to know what a Clinton speechfest was really like, this book is for you. It takes you into the last minute motorcade edits and to gaffes by the White House staff (which Clinton masterfully covered up with his brilliant skills). An example is the big NAFTA speech, in which the President doesn't have the correct speech, and instead the \\"sloppy copy\\" with edits and cross outs all over the place.

I did rely more on TokyoQ for restaurant listings because it seemed more up to date.Overall this is a good guide to get a general feel for this insane city.

It's a shame that the manufacturer chose to create a cheap, brittle plastic product. As soon as I opened the shell to insert the batteries, I was disappointed to see that the battery holders had been assembled in such a sloppy fashion that it took about 10 minutes of re-adjusting the clips and springs in order to hold the batteries in place and it is apparent that the thin metal is not going to last very long. Also, changing the batteries is not as easy as it could be if the unit had been designed better. I own many battery powered LED lighting units and this ranks about the lowest in quality of the lot. At $12 it is way overpriced and, truthfully, I wouldn't buy another if it sold for $1.99.

I do find that the advise he gives to women on how to impress men tasteless. A man will never find a woman who openly reveals her underwear sexy, there are a lot more subtle ways to entice a man.

I took the AP Psychology Exam on May 17, 1999. I was enrolled in an AP Psychology course at school and I was only using this book for the tests and essay questions. It was NOTHING like the AP Exam. The multiple choice tests focused on one topic entirely too much and there were hardly any statistical questions on the actual exam. The essays were way to easy and they did not even come close to the type of free response questions on the AP Exam which typically give you a list of items that you should use to answer a question even though they really do not relate to the question. This book, however, made for a good review to quickly and briefly (and I do mean briefly) look over the material, but if you are unaware of a concept you will have to get a text book to look it up to get an understandable answer. Unfortunately there is not another AP Psychology review book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Ambiguous and very dry","review":"The text is very dry and boring.

My hunch was correct, it was one of the first things Miss Baltsa recorded and she sounds wonderful. She is such an exciting singer that you are riveted to your seat. Her coloratura work on this CD is astounding. Francisco Araiza's coloratura work is also excellent, very clean, fast, and with accurate intonation. Thomas Allen also does a great job, even if some of his fast singing is not at the level of Baltsa's and Araiza's. I had to listen to this recording twice right away; I enjoyed it that much. The only negative is that this \\"highlights\\" CD only contains about 59 minutes of music. I kind of wish I'd bought the whole opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrific version of this opera, but a horrific selection.","review":"The editor of this 'highlights' version is an out and out idiot, without knowledge of this opera whatsoever.He/She left out all the major arias except Figaro's opening.The rest of the disc are ensembles. Rossini certainly wrote much more than the duets, trios, scenes for his characters.The Count di Almaviva is the central figure in this Rossini work, despite its title. The Count commands the heaviest role in the entire work, even more so than Rosina, and this version is the 'full' version compassing all the Count's pieces.The Count's oppening serenade and final show piece is sadly missing. The big bass aria of Basilio is similarly missing.Couldn't have been a worse selection.The full opera is luckily being restored in the 2012 Original Jackets Box set of Philips."},{"rating":"1","title":"not available, never received it.","review":"I never received this product, still waiting.

I've never tried it on anything but white paper, as it's white, but if you simply wanted to cover up something on colored paper and didn't care if it showed a little, it would be just as efficient.It completely covers, is easy to use, and doesn't dry out.

The description sounds like the textbook (and even uses the word \\"textbook\\"), BUT the item downloaded is a book of quizzes and exercises designed to help one assimilate the material in the textbook. It is virtually useless without the textbook. I bought it because I am aware of textbooks that have the word, \\"Handbook\\" in them and are books not exercises.

We received it last month, and it has not been accurate. The readings fluctuate even if it is within 5 minutes. We wrote to the company and they did make suggestions for us to try, such as sitting still while taking your blood pressure. My husband tried everything, still not accurate. He went to the doctors finally and had his actual blood pressure taken, and told the doctor about this particular model. The doctor said that this product was not a reliable one, and for the main reason that to get a proper reading, you should get a monitor that does not strap onto the wrist, but on the upper arm, as original blood pressure monitors are. I believe that this company does sell other blood pressure monitors, I would suggest purchasing another type from this company as they seem to be fair and willing to help."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good as it says!","review":"This stuff does exactly what it says your strings sound and feel much newer and if you run some along the back of the neck and wipe in your hand really glides up and down the neck for the price it well worth it. in case you are wonedering like i was no there is no greasy feeling in fact you feel pratically nothing just all feels real smooth and strings sound ligheter and crisper. love it will continue to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I made the purchase","review":"Especially for the price, this is a great buy. The strings on my acoustic were starting to get a bit loud when I would slide up and down the fretboard, and I was noticing quite a bit of lag when sliding too. The only downside is that it would be much easier to apply this directly to the frets without the strings on, but the appeal is to bring life back to strings that aren't shining like they use to. I just had to take a little extra time and care to get as much oil onto the fretboard and then make sure I wiped it in/off as thoroughly as possible, which required folding the provided rag and inserting it between the strings and fretboard and taking my time as I went from fret to fret. Not a big deal though because the result was very pleasing. The ease of sliding was tremendously improved and the strings sound and feel better than ever! Take 10-15 minutes and do you and your guitar a favor..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice stuff","review":"This is useful for keeping the strings clean, as well as oiling the fretboard at the same time.

The level is advertised to be accurate to 1/16 inch over 100 ft, and it may be under laboratory conditions. But I think, practically, it is accurate to 1/16 inch over 30 ft - still pretty good. For the price, it does a very good job. I would rate it 5 stars, except that the first unit I received did not work properly and I had to exchange it. So, it might be pretty delicate, and the boxes that they (both original and replacement) arrived in were badly battered to the point of falling apart.

Mine works fine, but I believe it requires gentle treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective product","review":"Bought mine in June, 2000, but didn't use it on a job until just recently. It was very out of calibration. I followed the simple calibration instructions and could not get it calibrated. I looked inside the calibration hole with an ophthalmoscope to see where the end of the Allen wrench connected and there is no socket visible. When I tilt the unit, I hear a loose screw rolling around. This unit is defective. I like the simplicity of the setup and the beam is very bright, but this one is worthless. I now have to go through the bother of paying to return it and waitng for it to be replaced or repaired. You do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Easy!!!","review":"Bought it anyway even after reading the negative reviews, figured on returning it if not happy, It's a keeper! In one week I have layed out form work for a 22 x 40 addition with no help in 1 day. Have started a 14 x 67 patio cover using massive timbers. No need for the old idiot stick with this product. The general contractor didn't believe this cheap laser was accurate, so he pulled out the old traditional transit... in 67 feet headers and ledger were off a light 1/16th inch. I have the laser set up about 60' from the work area. The dot is large, about 1/4\\" so there is no problem seeing it in very bright sunlight. Overall the laser does feel cheap, I do take extra care not to let this thing get bumped around at all. Considering my friends have paid over $1000 for their rotary's that still need a detector in the sun light I feel that for the money paid and 2 jobs down the Robolaser has allready paid for itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non precision laser","review":"This unit will be ok if you are using it for distances under 15 feet. It is made in China to very low tolerances. Mine went out of calibration a few weeks after receiving it and the calibration adjuster did not have enough range to pull it back in. It remains 1.5 inches out of level at 100 feet but is ok for very short distances. Remember you get what you pay for - and that is especially true for precision instruments. An accurate well made laser level costs about ..., so ... buys you what you might expect. My opinion is that those on a budget would be better served with a water level.

Think back to the old VHS copy protection where the screen and volume would go up and down wildly, and you've nailed it. I was very disappointed that an original DVD chosen for its higher audio quality would act this way. It had to be played from a cheap hardware DVD player, and then the audio sounded a bit funny since I don't have 5.1 stereo. It's probably great if you have a surround-sound setup; otherwise, pass on to the regular CDs. Also, the music has been remastered and in some cases changed more than one might think, sometimes for the better, and equally often for the worse.

Scholars will turn to more elaborate (and more expensive) editions.Unfortunately, any students who are assigned this edition will spend as much time trying to understand the stilted English translation as they will Descartes' philosophy.Fortunately, there are several readily available English versions of the Meditations that are far more readable than this one. Hackett publishes a translation by Donald Cress that is actually five cents cheaper than this one, and there are even free versions on the Internet that surpass this translation in clarity (and occasionally accuracy).Perhaps the only good reason for assigning this edition would be an undying loyalty to Notre Dame. Indeed, for some that will be reason enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose Chadwick!","review":"While I agree that the feat of compressing early Christian history into just under 300 pages is laudable, this book suffers from spelling mistakes (including one on the first page \\"ofen\\" for \\"often\\"), random changes of tense, awkward sentence structure, and outrageously biased opinions such as calling Tertullian a \\"bigot\\" without good cause (see page 69). Admittedly, many of these faults are the editor's, but they all contribute to a sense that the book was assembled hastily and carelessly. Hall's book hangs together much more comprehensively if the reader pretends he or she is at a live lecture, since Hall's prose style lends itself more to an oral presentation than to a written work.

For the price, I would buy a cheap version and replace them more often. The mat seemed to be a bit thinner when I replaced the old one, which would explain the quick cracking.

I'm not sure if it was damaged in transit or if it was used, damaged, and repackaged.

It came with a small crack at the top that I paid no mind to because it was a quarter of an inch at the top, and I didn't see a reason to send it back. I don't think the crack has had any effect on the effectiveness of gauging the rain.Here is my problem with it. It is properly mounted on a fence with no obstruction to the mouth (it's opening is above the fence line). The problem is that every time a light gust of wind in the storms blows the gauge out of the holster. I think it has effectively worked 6 or 7 times in all the storms I have had in my area over the last year. I have even seen it blow off, walked out in the rain set it back up, and returned after the storm to see it back on the ground.

BUT the scale in between each 1/2 inch IS NOT calibrated to each 1/10 of an inch as all other English measure gauges are. There are only 3 lines instead of the 4 there should be to measure tenths between 1/2 inches. That means each line represents 0.125 inches. I bought and put up 2 of these.

We will spend a lot of time in Peru, Chile (north), Ecuador, and Brazil, countries that are NOT covered by this video. (2) Some of the footage looked contrived, and may not be from South America.

Most of the selections are from the Sisters' era of highest fame and recording success (1940-1949). A great value and this is the chance to hear \\"Her Bathing Suit Never Got Wet\\" and a few other rare tracks that are new to CD (and a few with better sound than other collections like \\"Pross Tchai\\").

The Royal Ballet is one of my absolute favorite ballet combanies. Makarova is phenominal. Her Odette is so dramatic and is filled with passion. On the other hand, her Odile is creepy. A perfect Odile in my opinion: wicked and bewitching.I especially loved Makarova's facial expressions during the Adagio in act one. They were so dramatic and filled with passion. It was as if Makarova dedicated herself to her role. Like Fonteyn, she can act as well as dance. I recommend this ballet to anyone who loves ballet and romance. It's a great ballet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outshining Partnership, Outstanding Swan Lake","review":"There have been many performances of Swan Lake by various corps, and this Royal Ballet version is outstanding among them.I didn't realized how much more dancers could shine when they meet the right partner, until I saw this Swan Lake.Makarova and Dowell were truely there for each other. Thanks to their wondeful partnership, the second act was beautiful and the third act was bewitching.I've read some articles describing their excellent partnership in Giselle, and I only wish I could have had a chance to see more of their performances.Well known story, very familiar music, and popular images of swans donned featherlike tutu.. but that's not everything in Swan Lake. And that's why every performance of Swan Lake is unique.In this Royal Ballet version, Makarova and Dowell made unforgettable portraits of Odette/Odile and Siegfried to be remembered and cherished by all Swan Lake lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swan Lake DVD","review":"While the perfomance and music were captivating, the technical quality of the DVD was terrible.

With a good dose of indie-ness and (admittedly) SOME Thom Yorke-esque vocal stylings, this is one you can crank all the way through and get some nice, ripping results. What's really great is that the album has a nice, polished quality that you'd expect from a band with a couple of studio releases under its belt. The genius of the album lies within the band's ability to create a powerful wall of sound while never simply \\"making noise.\\" You gotta dig the guitar heroics. This album is also a decent representation of the band live, although the energy the band plays with is an inspiring sight to see. In my opinion, they're one of the best groups based out of Atlanta. If you dig indie rock and roll, get this album. But if you're within earshot, go hear this band shred. You will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"...

I will admit that I like fluffy romance and I love paranormal romance especially. I am usually able to suspend my disbelief enough for those that don't reach the level of Laurell Hamilton, Anne Rice, and Donna Boyd. Unfortunately, this book doesn't even come close. It is too whimsical, too unbelievable, and I agree with many other reviewers that there is no depth to the characters. I didn't even find Sparkle and Ganymede entertaining in this one. They were just annoying. Perhaps it is solely this work because I read another one of hers and wasn't compelled to write a bad review.

The characters did that only to get to their ends. Heyer seemed to base some of her more ridiculous characterizations on real life. That made her novels all the more absorbing. Lately, I have been wondering at the injustices of the Regency period. The elite were complete snobs and uncaring of those who waited on them. However, Heyer's novels are among my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite Heyer","review":"Instead of a reformed rake, you have a guy, after only one month's acquaintance, wanting to marry a girl who says she doesn't care if he is reformed from his old ways as long as she is included in any future \\"orgies\\". Not my idea of a good love story. Heyer has put out some very enjoyable reads, but this one bombed imo. I love the sweeter love stories. This one had an ick factor for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heyer's most passionate and well-developed book","review":"If you have read many of Heyer's books you'll find that Venetia is different from Heyer's usual heroines. Venetia is more passionate, more in tune with her emotions and the decisions she makes are what any true blue, modern pro-active urbanite would make. A refreshing change from other heroines. Venetia is a must-buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heyer's BEST!","review":"If you are a Georgette Heyer fan, you will LOVE \\"Venetia!\\" I have read almost all of her books and Venetia (and Frederica) are my favorites.Heyer's mix of romance with her wit and humor are incomparable. I found myself laughing out loud so many times. Human nature comes to bear no matter what time period one reads about.I plan on re-reading this book from time to time. It's that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heyer's books","review":"I recommend all of Georgette Heyer's books.

Not just \\"descriptions of every blade of grass\\" to (mis?)quote SE Hinton, but huge pertintent parts of Damerel and Venetia's growing relationship are just left out. The bit at the end where she arrives and tells him she understands that she in ineligible because of her mother and he forcefully rebuts her statements - so lovely, and so missing from this recording along with so many other important stages in their relationship. Really, if one is going to cut out so many romantic and funny bits, why bother to record the other parts of the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Heyer of all!","review":"For those fortunate enough to know Georgette Heyer's work already, you know that she was a brilliant story teller who wrote romances, not SMUT! So if you are looking for sex, try another author. If you enjoy a well written love story, buy Georgette Heyer!I've read almost every book that Georgette Heyer wrote, and this has to be my favorite! I can never read it without being pulled into the story. And even though I can recite parts of it by heart, it never fails to make me laugh and cry. A truely wonderful story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Georgette Heyer Novel","review":"The novel has everything: a beautiful, strong, smart heroine, a bright, quietly heroic, self deprecating rake, a brilliant crippled brother, an inconsiderate brother that marries a shy quiet girl with a horrific mother, a noble but boring suitor, and some great minor characters.Georgette Heyer writes so well that reading her novels is always entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite Heyer book--and Richard Armitage, too!","review":"I first read this novel quite a few years ago (when books on cd were unheard of) and it still stands today as probably my favorite Georgette Heyer book. It is funny, charming, beautifully written and the title character will still resonate with modern women as a woman of a far different time who very definitely has a mind of her own! Although their relationship (can we call it that?) is difficult from the very beginning, who can resist the different paths she and Damerel take to find each other at last?Also--if you have to choose the ideal reader to bring this story to absolute joy, who better than Richard Armitage with his beautiful baritone voice that seems to keep all of the characters living and breathing while injecting even more humor into this already comic tale? Is there nothing this man can't do--superlatively?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glove dogs, dog","review":"I'm only sparring 2-3 times a week, but these leave my gloves smelling like a nice wood chip-ish smell and dry 'em out pretty well. They go all the way down the glove, not to the finger section though. And the glove dogs are also connected together kind of like a lanyard with hooks, so you can disconnect them from each other or leave them attached and hang your gloves up or just keep them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I like these. I don't use my gloves as heavily as some, maybe 10 hours/week, but I always sweat heavily into them. I wipe the insides of my gloves immediately after use, then put the glove dogs in. I also keep a couple of desiccant packs in my gym bag for overall moisture control. The inside of my gloves are always dry by the next use, and after 6+ months of regular use they don't stink yet. Worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glove Dogs...What a great idea!","review":"Wow these things are life savers. I wish I would have had these years ago. I threw out over a dozen gloves until now. They stay fresh and mildew free for a long long time. Just put them in your gloves or shoes and leave them overnight and the next day. Wa la!

I guess I'm out the money I paid for this thing since it would cost as much as the purchase price to return it.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SHIELDED CABLE, LOOK ELSEWHERE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work!","review":"I ordered this cable and it did not work. I replaced it with one of my old ones and everything worked fine. I used it to go from a USB to Serial adapter to a vinyl cutting plotter. It was a frustrating experience using a new cable and trying to figure out why the machine would not respond. As a last resort, I used a cable from another machine and it worked fine. The shipping was really slow. I'm sending it back. It might work for a clothes line, but not as a data cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for an Overview","review":"This book is OK for anyone who want to gain a rough overview of the Network+ Exam topics.However, this book doesn't provide you with in-depth knowledge of the different Networking Technologies.If you want to get a serious, strong exam preparation, there are other Network+ Exam preparation Training Books who perform this task much better.Additionally, this book describes the different technologies in a hard understandable way.

Nearing 13, Callie Anne was stuck at home with her parents during a long, hot summer in rural Indiana. Her father was an angry, bitter man who ran a drive-in but hated it. Her mother hadn't left the house in five years, but had catered to Callie's dad and his moods. When a drifter named Charlie Memphis came to work at the drive-in, both mother and daughter fell for his charms. A disastrous turn of events changed all their lives forever.

So, the center piece sticks out about 1 cm from the two outside wings. I do not know if this is by design or just a manufacturing fault with the one I purchased. But, it looked really odd to me.I also had problems getting my credit cards to insert smoothly into the various card slots. They kept getting caught on something inside the slot.So, I returned it and I ended up going with the Slim Wallet, which was much cheaper, held more, was still slim in form, and looks and feels much more high quality.eBags was awesome with the return - they took care of shipping and the shipping label.

(I didn't count the pages, but certainly more than my previous elec stapler. The package says up to 30 sheets.) I REALLY like the suction cup feet! They hold the stapler steady, and in-place while stapling, yet the unit is eaisly picked up and moved. The red 'out-of-staples' indicator light is up front where you can eaisly see it.The only thing that I didn't like, is that it uses \\"PowerCrown\\" Staples, rather than the regular ones.

Now, if you whack the top of it before you insert the papers to be stapled, it will work fine. Once. If you have more than one set of papers to staple, you must whack it each time. This defeats the purpose of having an electric stapler, if you ask me. Before we had electric staplers, we whacked manual staplers.This is also a very tall and ugly appliance, should that matter to you. When it staples, it makes a very loud noise like a gunshot.

With the clocks setting flat on a night stand the sound of the alarm is so weak it can hardly be heard. Really, it is so anemic I had to hold the clock up to my ear to hear it.In fact, I set my clock to go off this morning as a test. The alarm didn't wake me up. One might think the moron who designed these clocks could have guessed that putting the alarm vent in a spot where it is covered up was not a good idea.I saw some complaints about this problem with a weak alarm sound in the reviews, but thought they might be exaggerated.

I am hopeful this review will help someone make a different choice when purchasing from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping Sucks","review":"Don't buy this thru Amazon unless you get a Fed-X tracking # otherwise the shipper will use the cheapest & slowest carrier.Over 3 weeks and still have not received a 2 lb. clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read the multiple reviews and decided I could deal with the flashing colon and check out the alarm sound for myself. No problem with the colon or alarm, but setting the alarm is difficult. The hours jump ahead which requries setting the wake time over and over again. This is even with very careful manipulation of the buttons. Also, the on-off switch is so tight, I have to turn the clock over to set or turn off the alarm. Perhaps my clock is an anomaly, but I intend to purchase another clock. This one is a pain to use. Also, the time setting was incorrect when first plugged in, but it was easy to correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chaney Instruments Thor Large Display Alarm Clock","review":"I bought this clock for my aging father in July '10.

I would have thought it would have lasted longer than 4 months. A piece of junk!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"This is a nice product, but it only lasted about two years. Many of The LED segments went out, so now the display is in code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shorted out","review":"I bought this clock several months ago and loved it. It was the best thing ever. Then one morning everything I had plugged into the same outlet went out. By smell I finally found that the clock had shorted out and I spent hours fixing everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alarm is useless to me","review":"Clock is as advertised and easy to use, unless you use the alarm. The volume of the alarm makes it useless to me and the on/off switch is very tight and hard to manipulate.Addition:After noticing the word (Kitchen) after the description of the clock I reviewed earlier, I looked at the clock described on the Amazon web page that I originally ordered from and realized that the clock I received was a different model than the one I ordered. The picture on Amazon's web page has the controls on the top of the clock and the alarm indicator light on the top left of the face. The clock I received has the controls on the back of the clock and the alarm indicator light on the bottom-right of the clock face. This might account for the too-soft alarm volume on the clock I received, as a kitchen clock would not need the alarm volume that a bedroom alarm would. I don't know if this is just a design change or a different model but something is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be improved","review":"I am in my sixties and wear both glasses and hearing aids. What sold me on this clock was the 2 inch display. I can see what time it is without my glasses. This is the only positive thing I can say about this clock. The display is bright and in a dark bedroom it's too bright. There is no dimmer switch. When the alarm goes off you have to manually turn it off by flipping a switch to the off position. The switch is on the back of the unit and I need my glasses to see which button it is. And as far as the alarm goes, I can barely hear it without my hearing aids and I don't wear them to bed. As my job requires that I get up before the crack of dawn, I can't afford to sleep through it's oh so tiny beep-beep. If you want to see the time from accross the room, I say go for it. But, if you need the daylight scared into you like I do, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"This clock is so bright and there is no dimmer.

BUT it stopped working in 6 months, went dark and nothing can be done to turn the lights back on. It seems like if I return it I have to pay for shipping both ways. Not sure why if the product is defective i have to pay for shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and works great!","review":"After reading tons of reviews on $30 clocks I opted for this at less than 1/2 the price. No it doesn't have an atomic clock update method but the more I thought about it the more that seemed like a novelty instead of a need. As long as the clock auto updates and keeps time, I could care less how it does it. One of the things I really like about the Acurite is the large numbers without the brightness that I've seen on other clocks this size. Personally, I found the clock brightness to be just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT NIGHT TIME CLOCK!","review":"GREAT!! Bigger than I thought. The DOTS : colon in the MIDDLE does NOT flash. The clock had the correct time when I plugged it in. I love this product. Easy to see at night.

The clock sets itself if there is a power outage and also automatically updates during daylight savings time changes. The clock can be seen from across the room with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy on the Eyes Display","review":"This has a large display and is therefore easy to see even with the unaided eye. I don't need the clock as an alarm so I can't rate that function. Also, I don't know if the DST feature works since no DST date has passed yet. But if you want an easy to use and easy to see clock, this is it. I just ordered two more.A peek at the instructions tells how to set the time manually if you so wish, and also how to change the batteries. Instructions are wonderful things.Since there are two dimensions for the clock on Amazon web page just let me clarify: dimensions are 3 1/4\\"H x 7 1/8\\"W x 2 3/4\\"D. So a pretty small footprint.This is not to be confused with an \\"atomic clock\\". There are no radio signals and the clock operates on house current with battery backup and resets itself after a power interruption.UPDATE 3 MONTHS LATERI did buy two more clocks for a total of three. All kept accurate time and changed day light savings time correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden \\"On-Off\\" switch","review":"Clock automatically sets to correct time. Neat. Also very bright LED.But it is difficult to turn off alarm in the morning. The large snooze button works , so if you are a person that hits the snooze button 4 times at seven minute intervals to turn off an alarm, you will like this product.The small on-off switch is on the back of the clock, in the middle of the other button to set the time. This on-off switch is also hard to move.Acurite Customer service confirmed my observations and complaint. It is hard to believe that any one who designed or engineered this product ever used it.I can't recommend this product as an alarm clock. It would be fine as a large letter, see in the dark, non-alarm clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acuwrong","review":"I've been using this clock for several years. The large display is why I bought it. But the clock is always wrong. If I wanted the approximate time I'd get an hour-class. The time on this thing was originally set at the factory. When it arrived I set it to the correct time-zone and then plugged it in. Sounds simple but the clock isn't accurate. Too bad these guys don't sell a large display atomic clock. That would be worth the money if it worked.I'm going to toss my Accuwrong in the trash. I already bought a replacement for it. Too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big and bright!","review":"I wanted a lighted clock with large numerals so I could see it at night without my glasses and this certainly fills the bill. It's almost too bright and there is no adjustment for brightness! It puts a nice red glow in the bedroom, though, so sort of works as a night light as well as a clock.My only real complaint about this clock is that the on/off button for the alarm is hard to move. If you had it at bedside, you would want to slap the Snooze button first and then fumble with the Off switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not just big, but bright.","review":"From other reviews, it sounds like this was just what a lot of people wanted. I suppose I wasn't prepared for *just* how big the clock is (take a good look at the measurements before ordering). Once I got used to the size though--& it's true, it's easy to read, & it does have a nice design--I was still unprepared for how extremely bright it would be at night. I had purchased it to place on my bedside table--not a good idea! It's sort of like sleeping with a neon sign by your bed. Anyway, this clock is definitely not for bedrooms. (I was surprised that it did not have a dimmer feature, because it seems pretty limited without one.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR THE HEAVY SLEEPER","review":"I bought this product because it came up when I searched for alarm clocks for heavy sleepers, this thing is so quite that it doesn't even began to wake me up. I'm going to return it as soon as possible. The one good thing is that yes you can see the display from a good distance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large display","review":"I wanted to be able to see this clock from across a large room. This one works great. I can read the time from 20 ft. Bright, clear numbers. It's also pretty neat in that somehow it knows what time it is. I just plugged in the clock and without any adjusting, the time was accurate. Even worked with the change in daylight savings time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A CLOCK I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE","review":"This worked fine for a month and then all of a sudden it would not turn on if you plug it in. It was good while it lasted. So if you want a clock only for a month and then throw it away, please buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loses time","review":"In the past several months, it has steadly lost time. I do not like the fact that you cannot reset the time. I have several other automatic (atomic) clocks and they work fine.

I haven't had it long enough to go through a Daylight Savings/Standard time change but I did have a power outage and the clock worked perfectly. By the way, the alarm will wake you up without giving you a heart attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice big numbers, time is a tad off","review":"My eyesight is lousy without my glasses. I wanted a clock that I could read when I'm in bed at night or when I get up, This does the trick. I don't use any of its alarm features so I can't speak to them.I also like the fact that you never need to set it, however I've noticed that its clock is 3-4 minutes off from my Cell phone or Computer clock. It's fast so it's no big deal, but can be annoying if you need every clock in the house to be identical.The other negative is it could really use a dimmer. At night this thing can be pretty bright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bessey D29ASS-BE Offset Snips.","review":"Absolutely the finest snips I have ever used.

The concept obviously works, check out Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\". For some reason it doesn't work here. Maybe it's because of all the clich��s, but this film just fell apart from the get go. There is no suspense, the acting is half-hearted, and that's not just because of the bad script. I actually couldn't even sit through the entire movie. So do yourself a favor, don't waste an hour and a half of your life on this movie. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but a bit gory.","review":"I can't pretend to be surprised at this one, as I knew going in that it was about the birds attacking. But it was a bit gory in comparison to \\"The Birds\\". That was not really a surprise either, but I wished I didn't have to turn my head so much when it got gross. I find it a bit humorous that they supposedly got mad cow disease. But the gore factor makes me not recommend it for younger audiences. Not that this genre is for kids, but the original film would be okay by today's standards, I guess.All in all, it was okay, but I had hoped to see more bird attack with less blood. One other question I have for both films would be, were the birds that powerful? I mean maybe a thousand at once might be, but anything less and I would think a human would be able to fight them off.

Both felt like they were rushed and the entire series seems like there was no goal, unlike is Love Hina were Keitaro wishes to be with Naru but in Ai Yori Aoshi Kouru already has Aoi.

Some terribly annoying ones, and some horrendous overacting by Steve Carell, and some fairly entertaining and touching moments.The overacting by Carell got so bad at one point in the middle of the movie, that I almost turned it off. His sense of humor is better suited to be subdued. He can't pull off a complete off-the-wall comedic sequence like Jim Carrey. No one can, for the most part.

We watched it together and both enjoyed it. I even got her to watch the specials. That is where you find out that the movie was green. The director bought anyone who wanted one a bicycle to ride to the set. He didn't expect to have to buy so many. The materials used to build the ark were donated, they planted 2000 trees, and left no foot prints. The importance of a family working together to accomplish a great act was a wonderful lesson to be learned. The animals were treated with care and dignity. These are lessons we all can learn adults and children alike. There is no reason for us to further deplete or destroy any more of our planet when we can work together to save it. The next time I went shopping needless to say I bought my own copy. I have to say that I have a large collection of movies and TV series.

Both extremely talented, but no chemistry.The story was really slow, and kind of pointless. I just wanted them to finish the damn ark already! Some of the slapstick was overdone, I might add. The animals were a bit much.When you watch a 1/2-hour episode of The Office, or an hourlong episode of Gilmore Girls, it feels like half that. Here, it felt double. I was waiting for it to end.Like the title of my review says, it was a waste of talent. Wanda Sykes, John Goodman, Carell, and Graham are all extremely talented entertainers. I hope they fired their agents after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny","review":"My husband and I loved this movie. All of us can relate to the main character. How often do we ignore the signs God gives us about what he wants us to do? No matter how we run, the signs are there, for us to act on, or ignore.Evan Almighty is about Evan Baxter, a materialistic newly-elected Congressman who is on the fast-track of political wheeling and dealing, at the expense of the enviroment - and his family and his integrity. Morgan Freeman comes to him and tells him to build an ark. Even as the animals start arriving in pairs, Evan is still dodging God, telling himself he is just stressed!The special effects are awe-inspiring and seamless. The bonus features on this DVD are some of the best I have seen. The deleted scenes are so funny, as well as the end credits, in which all the characters dance.A touching as well as hilarious modern look at the Bible story of Noah and the Flood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evan Al...meh","review":"The sole reason I rented this was A.) Steve Carrel is tolerable, and can be hilarious now & again, and B.) to get a free rental.Didn't care for Bruce Almighty, as someone who isn't particularly entertained by bread & butter simple mortality tales, so why I took an hour and a half for this I have no clue, but at least the Gilmore MILF is hot.God this, faith that, stick to your guns this, big corporations are bad that, good, evil, and a dog in the end. \\"ask and you shall receive\\" was the thing that made me laugh the loudest, actually.I can appreciate religious films, but when it's this loaded with cheese, it brings me to the brink of vomiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie with a great message.","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when this movie was not irreverent, as I had expected. It had a great message about integrity and courage in the face of many odds. I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining movie","review":"I really enjoyed very much this movie. Is a comedy that the whole family can watch and at the same time is an uplifting movie. It's a pity that the format is 2.35, I really hate those black bars, the only reason which I didn't buy it. But every time I have a chance to watch it on HBO High Definition I do, it looks gorgeous on my 46 inch TV. I really are not in favor of those that predicate that movies should be seen as they were intended to be seen by the director. This a commercial movie and not an art film where maybe the composition of the frame is what makes the movie a masterpiece. This just a plain movie to enjoy, and not to see it halfscreen instead of widescreen. HBO has the right view, this is more entertainment than art. Wish the directors would choose to film their movies in 1.85 so that at last we could get rid of the black bars. Anyhow this is a very good and entertaining comedy that I highly recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"I am biased I'm sure as I worked on this set, but people panned it as we are so used to big explosions with violence, gore and cussing. It was just a simple comedy that you could watch with the whole family-do you remember those days. Those were also the days when comedians were clean, but funny. So it is a little hokey with evan becoming Noah, but look at the hidden message. Greed, material things and dishonest politicians, and the need to go green to save our planet. And to work together as a family, side by side to make the family work. With an open mind, you will find this an entertaining comedy movie. If nothing else, the kids will like it.

I liked the first movie 'Bruce Almighty', but thought it wasn't as good as it should have been given the premise and the cartoonish Jim Carrey in the lead. This film is really a harmless family film and that is it's strength. When the story tries to rely on site gags it falls flat, but as a story of a busy Congressman who neglects his family, it works. The outrageous situation in itself is funny enough, without having animal \\"doo doo\\" joke every few minutes. It's not great by any stretch, but it kept my interest all the way through, probably because I've been too exausted lately to change the channel!:-) It's a nice little movie with some good message and special FX. Lower your expectations and you just might enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve is better than this!","review":"A friend and I watched this together and almost didn't finish it.

Its about God telling this guy to build an ark in modern day times. Its about his willingness to be faithful and to do what he is called to do even when he doesnt understand and about his family supporting him. It teaches us how to listen and follow God, how His plans are not ours, and combines it with funny humorous moments throughout the movie. I laughed out loud. One scene shows him sitting on the couch with a fish tank behind him and the fish follow him no matter where he sits(because he's the modern Noah), as he trys to shoo them away! So funny, you have to see it.This is the kind of comedy we need, not more sexual, nasty mouthed comedy.

With over 35 years of meal preparation under my belt, I wanted a cookbook to give me unique ideas as well as gourmet-quality recipes. While this cookbook offered interesting combinations, I was extremely disappointed. Yes, there are 300 recipes, but the same preparation and ingredients are used over and over again ad nauseum. Different meat, new recipe name, same ingredients. Very repetitive. It is, however a very good beginners cookbook. As long as you have garlic, green pepper, cilantro, and a few other \\"basics\\" you will enjoy this book; if you're looking for ingredients beyond those you've used for years, look somewhere else, you probably already know how to put these dishes together yourself.

Gary sings all the songs different from the original.2) This is a crappy production. Live footage were shot with a hand held VHS camera from a distance. Audio is just as bad. Certain songs, no live footage...just the audio with still pictures!!3) This is a PAL DVD, not NTSC. So if you do not have an all regions DVD player, do not buy this DVD. Unfortunatey I do, so I had to skip thru this crappy DVD.4) The only good clip was the last section with Gary & the real Union Gap in the '60s doing Lady Willpoweer.

The circuit board is just behind where any fowled up staples will often get ejected to when the unit is triggered but there's no paper to staple into (a symptom you'll likely experience after a while).

Unfortunately my hubby threw out the box that it came in or I would be sending it back. Was so excited to get it as it saves me a lot of time for work.......really frustrated it did not work out.

Tried dampening the noise with dynamat, didn't help at all.Staplers should be easy, not hard. This is simple stuff, I thought this was a premium product to make my office a bit nicer but no.I even tried buying \\"premium\\" staples that cost 5x as much and come in a special little tin, that didn't help.

Nevertheless, Bruce was the right actor for the part it's just that Walter Hill's script and direction can't hold a candle to Kurosawa's original or Leones' great remake (Fistful of Dollars). My suggstion; rent either, or both of those movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot...","review":"This is the second remake of an excellent movie... Yojimbo... It lacks what the original and it's first remake (Fistful of Dollars) have in abundance: HUMOR. An excessive dependence upon narration also suggests that the director, or the studio vastly underestimates the intelligence of the audience.For a real good movie watch Yojimbo... Or even Fistful of Dollars... Or watch them both and marvel at how much Leone takes, almost shot for shot, from Kurosawa's wonderful film.If you want to ruin that double feature, however, watch this dreary attempt as well. It's a shame, really, because Hill and Willis were a good match for the material.EnJoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"One of the silliest pretexts for a movie, ever!

A year before his \\" Fifth Element\\" movie, where he managed to get bigger guns. lol....OK, it , in my opinion, has some genuine film noire to its style, it is a gory flick, and the dvd cover should be a dead giveaway. guns blazing.

You will know it's older because the blue and white sides are opposite each other. Avoid the ones where you can see red, white and blue at the same time like the one pictured here.

This is a bit much, given the only thing they seem to have in common is they are Iranian women. Farah's story is far more compelling and riveting than that of the film maker.

I honestly cannot believe that she would grant this so called \\"filmmaker\\" the pleasure to be in her presence. I found her to be rude, dishonest, disloyal to IRAN and frankly came off very offensive with her LACK of class, LACK of proper attire in the presence of the Queen, and a true LACK of dignity and respect.

I was taught by an amarican dancer, so when I recently read the book, I was surprised how well known the exercises and not less Luigi's philosophy was to me. The book is a perfect way to learn jazz, diff. steps (lots of small photographs) and not to forget his brilliant idea:\\"take the barre with you\\" out on the floor. The most complete jazz system I've ever trained.The book is easy read, easy to follow even for beginners, and not to forget - a perfect way to get strong,long and smooth muscles. I can only recommend the book - a fine supplement to related books and videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"good earpieces","review":"These are way better than PHILLIPS noise cancelling.Have been using these for about a year with no issues.

Judging from the great reviews, we purchased & wondered why we were able to score such a deal. The $8 purchase was definitely worth the little case, superior part of the package, our Sansa Clip tucks away nicely...with the ORIGINAL earbuds. Earthumps produce tinny sound, no bass whatsoever, perhaps for listening to AM talk radio, who knows, ours went directly into a drawer forever, emergency only. This has us pondering whether iPod & other listeners have no quality sound coming from their MP3 units. Sansa Clip & ORIGINAL earbuds are awesome. Best to hit the electronics store & try earbuds out in person. Earthumps? Thumpless...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usable but don't sound right","review":"It is great to listen to songs with lots of bass. Misses most of the treble sounds and if you listen to gentle carols, classicals and soft music with with instruments like chimes, this headphone will not do the job. I am just going to listen to audiobooks in slightly noisy places and this works fine for me. I could not give 3 stars to make this item get an average grade because with lots of songs I possess it's performance is not upto my satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable but poor sound!","review":"The EarThumps are very comfortable headphones that stay in your ear, BUT the sound quality is very poor.

Much better than the ear plugs that came with my ipod or Sandisk mp3 players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound for its price","review":"I bought the Griffin Earthumps mid year last year 2009 - together with aPhilips SA2925R/37 2 GB Flash Audio Video MP3 Player with Month of Rhapsody Music (Black).Sound -- the bass driver of these earbuds are adequate, not mind-blowing, but enough to make you feel the beat. Warm mids and slightly annoying highs if you don't control your EQ right. 9/10 for the sound, it will do a good job on just about any portable mp3 player.Comfort -- the earbuds come with small, medium or large earbuds, so you can test what's more comfy for you. I suck with the medium sized ones, and they fit snug into your ear, and smooth enough that they don't cause irritation for use over long periods of time.For the price that I paid for it, I say I got a great deal with its solid sound, and it comes with a nifty earbud case if you're not using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a two weeks","review":"I bought these due to all the great reviews, but these headphones weren't nearly as good as I thought they would be. All the headphones I have owned (four headphones total) have been earbuds. My biggest problem with these are that the right earbud stopped working after around 2 weeks. I admit that I usually wrap them around my iPod, but that still seems to break too easily.I'm also giving it a low rating because the wiring feels very cheap, unlike my earbuds by Creative. On Amazon, Creatives cost $40 if bought from Amazon, but if you buy from a 3rd party retailer, you can get them for the same price as these (around $13).Finally, I'm also giving a low rating due to the rubber on the ear piece. Although better than some, it's still not as good as my earbuds by Creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it me or the earphones?","review":"My ears must be different than most peoples.

I have never had earphone cables that tangle so easily. The cables feel somewhat elastic, which I think contributes to easy tangling and (as someone else mentioned) the retention of awkward shapes in the line. There are other, better options for earphones that provide both quality sound and better-material cabling. Sound quality is up from standard earbuds, but cable material and use is a decided step down (or several)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ear phones for ipod","review":"Love it. Great fit, shorter cord than regular earphones is easier to handle for the ipod. Tight fit helps keep outside noise out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economical choice","review":"These are not $100 headphones. They are not going to sound like they are. If you understand what you are purchasing you will be much happier from the start.I have found the ipod standard headphones to be unbearably painful. These are much more comfortable. They sound okay, but as other reviewers have pointed out, they overdo the bass. I have found this has at least something to do with how deeply they are inserted in the ear. The deeper they go the more distorted the bass becomes. I pull them out just slightly and it helps. Also, I set the ipod EQ to treble booster and it more or less balances out.For someone that only uses headphones while at work, these are fine. If you are looking for higher quality and have the money to burn, go with something higher end. But if all you need is a comfortable headphones at a decent price, these will serve you well-- provided you are willing to play with them to figure out what feels and sounds best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE these earbuds","review":"These buds offer awesome sound quality. They are comfortable in the ear as they come with 3 different size inserts. Extremely affordable. My only complaint is the wires are somewhat flimsey so I've had to replace them a few times. Not a problem for me because of the low price. I use mine most every day for hours at a time. I HIGHLY recomend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros and Cons","review":"My husband and I have been using these for a couple of years now and we love them. We've gone through several pairs. They have excellent sound quality and they stay in my ears through my many miles of jogging. My only complaint is that one side inevitably shorts out after about 6 months of use. This is been an issue with headphones/earbuds for as long as I've been listening to them. I remember the same thing happening listening to my portable CD player or walkman as a teenager so it's nothing new. I have yet to find a set of headphones whose wires DON'T short out after several months of use. That being said, they're easy to replace at $10 a pop, so I consider it a fairly minor complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for this product","review":"I've been using these for about 2 weeks now; and I use them daily when I exercise. I mainly listen to podcasts with these earbuds, and they work very well. They do supress ambient noise, but not enough so as to be hazardous when you need to listen for cars as you walk on the street, or to cyclists when walking on the trail. The medium size earbuds fit me best and they do not fall out of my ears. Additionally, they are comfortable for extended periods of time. I would definitely recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best deal for an inexpensive option.","review":"These don't sound as good as the $100 earphones but they do sound great and are alot louder than Apple's stock buds.

After transferring to yet another new school, he takes the coaching of a fellow loser, about standing tough from the beginning by taking down another guy on his first day ... and by chance happens to pick a fight with THE toughest guy in the entire school. Now, Namkoong has just eight hours to figure out how to get out of the fight ... or else show up on the roof after school to be killed.

It came highly reccommended from a friend, but in the end, I couldn't get past the tenth episode.The characters became so old, and two dimensional by then, that their every expression and reaction were already old hat. There really wasn't any territory left to explore except for the ladies true origins, and by now, I just don't care anymore.The episode regarding the ex-KGB spy was easy to see through, and had nothing new to offer. And \\"Intocabille\\" was worse. The culture of the Italian Mafia was thrown out in favor of one closer to the Yakuza, and with the multi-flashback scenes, it felt like the two episode story took up the entire series. I actually fell asleep during the first watch and had to go back to see what I missed. Even then, I fought to stay awake.Overall, the series peaked at episode three.

A young girl who was searching for herself and ended up in Amsterdam, and the girl's mother.The tale was quite simple and effective. I particularly enjoyed the view of Amsterdam in a fog, the streets in the night, the boats on the river and the crowds. The old bookstore looks very much like the old bookstores I visited before. Carmen Chaplin was very charming, she is the granddaughter of the great Charles Chaplin.After viewing the movie, I felt warm and sentimental. If you believe in true love, happenstance and serendipity, then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Film doesn't make you care about the characters. Old hippy in Amsterdam? Spoiled, immature brat finding herself? Feh.Julie Christie was okay, but Burt Reynolds was indifferent and \\"Carmen Chaplin\\" was an absolute disgrace.

While the music of many Christian pop groups sounds forced and inauthentic to me, these guys' work is an undiluted look at who they are and what they believe. They also take a lot of time and care to make sure that the music they play is pure, is direct, and holds together. The band's members have some hard experience in the trenches of jazz, classical, blues, latin, R&B, and world music, and it really shows.However, the best experience of their music is a live show."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?!? This is NOT what it used to be.","review":"I first tried this brand/type of shampoo and conditioner YEARS ago when it was in a white (I think?) bottle. At the time I LOVED it, it smelled great, and it was SUPER TINGLY in your hair and scalp, would be very INVIGORATING and WAKE you up with all the pins and needles tingling sensation. So when I saw this on Amazon (even though the bottle now looks different) I was SOOOOO excited to buy some... Anyhow, when I tried it the first time I was DISAPPOINTED. Horrible Horrible Horrible. Almost nonexistent tingle now because I think it is so diluted possibly... Anyway, doesn't work the way it did years ago when I originally used it. I would NOT buy this product again, waste of money... I would pay 2x as much if it was same quality as it was before, now it is just crappy and nothing like it used to be... Sad.

I spent a very long time attempting to get a brush through my hair after emerging from the shower. I finally resorted to some leave in products to finish the job, but it felt like straw the rest of the day. I promptly placed the product in a drawer just in case I can find a guinea pig to try it on their hair for comparison purposes. I buy products based on the user reviews, so I am quite perplexed that it was so horrible, at least on my hair. I have hair that has waves but can be straightened if I have time. It is fine hair, but there is a lot of it. It is also color treated.

Would definately use them again if they openned up their selection a bit more. Oh well.What can I say about the product that is not already been said. It is a well thought out story of a teacher student relationship and how one grows to depend on the other as much as the other parts. How in a society strict on disciplin and honor within its schools, it allows a peek at what it is like to see a person struggle to find work and having to hide their real personna simply to get a job. Something can be said about how society treated the individual and those similar to the teacher, whether in fantasy, fiction, or plain old real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"my keyboard","review":"Replacing my old keyboard to my computer made me surf more on the web..

First and foremost, it is extremely dry and boring to read. I didn't find any part of it interesting on either an intellectual or spiritual level. Secondly, the author lists 50 reasons why Christ sacrificed himself for our sins, but that's all it really is -- a list. Each chapter is about a page and a half long, or at best two pages. The author doesn't go into any great detail, just cites some related Bible verses and offers some basic commentary. Finally, I never did get a sense of the author's tone. I have read some Christian books that are emotionally saccharine and focus on only the \\"loving\\" part of God, and others that are quite the opposite and take a \\"tough love\\" approach, but this one seemed to lack any tone at all. In short, there are far better Christian apologetics books out there.... I'm sorry I cannot list this as one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holding to a form of godliness but denying its power","review":"John Piper is lost when it comes to understanding the power of God.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet","review":"In light of the popularity of Mel Gibson's \\"Passion of the Christ,\\" this is a good theological book with 2-page chapters that can be used as a backdrop showing the necessity of Christ's death (and resurrection). Using scripture left and right, Piper comes up with succinct points that clearly show how and why the horrible crucifixion was necessary. It can be utilized as a devotional, as it's difficult (read: tedious) to put six or seven of these chapters together. Piper made this book available to churches at an extremely low cost and is donating the proceeds, which is quite admirable as well. (In other words, he's not piggybacking on Gibson's movie all the way to the bank.) Overall, I like the read and am glad to recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOK TOWARDS THE CROSS AND BE SAVED","review":"\\"Yet it was the will of the Lord to crush him;he has put him to grief.\\" Isaiah 53:10At this time of year, we Christians normally recall to our hearts and minds the life of our Lord Jesus Christ, as he was about to leave the world in the flesh, and be crucified by Roman soldiers.With sadness we look towards the cross and the more we look we wonder why God had to chose this way of crucifying His Beloved son, and if there could not have been an easier and less painful way to pay for the sins of the world. We trust Our Heavenly Father, and we trust the choice He made to prove His love for us. In the Passion of Jesus Christ, John Piper spells out the fifty reasons why Christ suffered and died.

This book explains the \\"why\\" of the suffering and death of Jesus. It provides the Biblical-theological CONTEXT necessary to understand the passion of Jesus Christ. You may not like and/or agree with what Piper writes, but to argue with the book, you're going to have to argue with the Bible. He's simply exposing what's in the Bible and taking it at face value. The chapters are brief (2 pages), to the point, and well-written. In fact, it's the best brief treatment of the \\"why\\" of Jesus' death ever written. See the movie, then read the book, and it will at least provide and explanatory \\"frame\\" for what you've seen.

This one is probably the worst. It's a ridiculous caper movie trying to masquerade as a serious film. It's starts out fairly decently with the Banderas character, then puts Connelly's in clear focus as the central character. Once it gets to the scene where they are investigating the cave as two professionals, then start doing it on the very uncomfortable cave floor, you know it's a stupid film, and it just goes downhill from there. It turns into maudlin sentimentality after that, with very overplayed scenes of him helping her after being shot down in the street. It wasn't the acting that was bad, though, it was everything else. I was hoping Banderas would just take her on his motorcycle and get Jennifer out of there, because they both deserve a writer/director better than Betty Kaplan."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LOVE ANTONIO, YOU'LL LOVE THIS MOVIE","review":"I FOUND THIS TO BE A VERY INTERESTING MOVIE WITH ONE OF THE TENDEREST LOVE SCENES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

As he befriends her, he tries to steal her from her fianc�� and persuade her to his left-wing idealogy.It is definitely not a film for everyone, but it will appeal to some women, especially those who like Antonio Banderas - the camera is fixated on him, and ignores the beautiful Jennifer Connelly in their love-making scene.

In the 1970's there was a set of perspective charts available that provided comprehensive guidance for three-point perspective drawing throughout the full range of viewpoint possibilities. They were invaluable. . I have lost my set of these early charts and hoped that this was the same product. It is not. There is one three point perspective layout in this new set of charts but it provides only very limited help."},{"rating":"1","title":"curiously uninformative and flacid","review":"Other than some family lore, there isn't much new in this book to anyone familar with the history and culture of the New York Times, and what's new isn't especially interesting. It values density over insight. It's remarkably devoid of journalistic analysis. It is weak on business analysis. As biography, it's a snooze. As journalism, it's a thumb-sucker, like one of those overwrought stories they run on the day after Labor Day, when there's nothing better in the hopper and lots of space to fill. I could put it down, and did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Alex Jones and Susan Tifft","review":"The only positive comment one can make about this sorely disappointing excavation of the Sulzbergers and their newspaper is that it's written in fluid, clear prose. That's it! This is quite surprising given the credentials of these two supposedly fine journalists; they did a wonderful job excavating another newspaper dynasty -- the Binghams. But this time, little insight is offered; instead, the reader is loaded down with gratuitious gossip. Historic and psychological contexts are shabbily rendered. One can't help but wonder if Mr. Jones, who comes from a newspaper dynasty himself, albeit of a much smaller scale, was not dealing -- negatively dealing -- with his own issues in this book. The Sulzbergers, particularly, Arthur jr, a brilliant, progressive, and humane publisher, and deserve better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Establishment Press Protects its Biggest Member","review":"\\"The Trust\\" tells a story most literate Americans almost know by heart. There is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- new here. Yet the reviews have all been misleadingly complimentary so that the myth of the smug, somewhat stupid NYTimes can go on. It is being beat badly these days by any news service on line. Reading the front page of the Times these days is like reading a monthly magazine ten years ago. The paper uncovers nothing new and the stories, offering value added interpretation, are boring.The book does bring to light one aspect: Arthur, Jr., current publisher and pooh bah, is incredibly and dangerously dumb. Looks to the charlatan business expert to give him what he so sorely lacks in brains, experience, and a legitimate education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is outstanding and complex book giving the reader an inside look at what keeps a dynasty together for over 100 years. What this book also accomplished was how the paper has gone from being the best source of news in the world to just another newspaper trying to push its own distorted views of the world. Eventhough this book is 870 pages long, it is so well written that I wanted it to go on. Thank you Ms. Tifft and Mr. Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in the Family","review":"A wonderfully readable account of the family that has owned the New York Times since 1896. While the authors have been justly criticized for focusing too much on the gossip surrounding the Ochs-Sulzberger clan, they have also convincingly succeeded in conveying just how unique this family is, a family whose single-minded mission over four generations has been the care and feeding of one of the great icons of America, the New York Times. In these times of bloated self-enrichment through speculative Internet stocks, the Ochs-Sulzbergers come across as wonderfully retro--a family devoted not to money, but to the New York Times."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the first white wolf mage books, and unfortunately weakest too.","review":"Title tells it all, i am sure that steele dosent write anymore to white wolf.

The quality of built is perfect, never jams without absolutely any problem. I needed a heavy duty stapler for myself and when I saw a 5 star review for this trash, I bought it.To staple 6 spots I used more than twice staples, because half of them didn't go through well and while I tried to bring them out (useing screw driver and pliers), I injured 3 of my fingers very badly. Right away I returned it back and amazon made me to pay $7.99 for shipping back. Next time I won't buy directly from amazon.About the built quality; Only the staple compartment has been made of steel, otherwise every other places is plastic. I really wonder how long it can work before breaking. Don't waste your money on this. It's Chinese and just has the name of Swingline!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raplaced our Bostitch with Swingline","review":"I replaced our Firms Bostitch Heavy Duty staplers because they were not working, I looked at reviews to see if there was a better brand and people had favorable reviews of swingline.

Used it for several months and then the metal plate which opposed the staples as they are driven through the paper cracked in half. That's right the metal cracked. This was with normal use, nothing major, never challenged the 210 supposed capacity. Now I have to buy a new stapler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Stapler base broke after 5 staples. The stapler metal contact on the base broke making it completely useless. Wouldn't buy another one. Cheap metal. I certainly didn't abuse it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is garbage.","review":"I own this stapler and used it less than 50 times. The metal plate that bends the staples is made of cheap metal and the staple pushed out the bottom of it making the stapler useless. Of course the label on the bottom states that it was proudly produced in China. The plate on my basic paper stapler is more robust. I am going to try to return under warranty. The only issue is that I am sure a replacement will fail in the same way given that it is now made from pig metal compared to older model staplers.I reiterate this is JUNK. Buy quality and suffer once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother with this model...","review":"This model (at least the one I purchased!) is a piece of junk. I've never had a stapler jam so frequently and be such a pain to fix once it is jammed. I love Swingline in general, but this particular model in my case was just not a wise purchase. Swingline Ergonomic High Capacity Desk Stapler (S7077701F)is a much better choice. That one has been fault free for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed!","review":"This was the first time I've ever had a bad purchase with Amazon. I was looking specifically for an inexpensive black clock. I received it with several other items I had ordered, and the shipping material was so minimal that the clock face had been scratched by the other items. Back it went, in exchange for another clock. The second arrived in acceptable shape . . . then I noticed the next day that the time was off about 20 minutes or so. When I attempted to correct the time, the minute hand began swinging freely and wouldn't stay in one position! Back it went, with a refund request this time. Aside from Amazon's poor packaging, they were super in promptly acknowledging the exchange and the refund.

On a personal note, Lori, I always knew you had it in you..it was just a matter of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: EXCEPTIONALLY BAD!","review":"I'm an intermediate-advanced salsa dancer, though people at salsa clubs often flatter me with the question \\"Are you an instructor?\\" I've taken individual and group classes in Santiago, New York and D.C. I have also seen a few salsa videos. This video is by far the worst dance instruction video (ANY dance) I've ever seen. How did they get this on the market in the first place??A friend bought it for me for Christmas. I showed him the video and he responded \\"Oh my god! Dude, I'm so sorry, but the reviews said it was good!\\"Save your money! I can't imagine any other salsa video being worse. I won't even waste my time criticizing the specifics. My personal favorite: Razz M'Tazz from NY with on-2 instruction by a professional Puetro Rican Salsa group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginning dancers","review":"If you are an experienced dancer in some other style, especially some form of latin, or maybe even ballroom, I suspect you will find the video lessons from this guy to be somewhat boring and repetitive.If, however, you are are true novice, or maybe coming over from being able to dance nothing but the basic texas two step (that's me), you would most likely find this instruction to be exactly what you need. The instructor starts of with a basic 1-2 1-2 step rythm and progressively shows you how to add to that to get the traditional salsa rythm - and ultimately, to walk on the dance floor and dance.The video is most useful if you have a partner to practice with, though you can go a long way alone. I will warn that the guy gets anoying a few times as he seems to say the same (somewhat silly) phrases a few two many times- and on several occasions, appears to feel the need to talk, when he should just stick to showing us how to move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, well-rounded and hilarious","review":"I can't comment on the historical accuracy, but from what I do know of Beaumarchais I would say they succeeded with flying colours in representing his character, aswell as the atmosphere of the time. While the film is light-hearted and very funny, it doesn't take the easy option of caracaturising him as a cheeky libertine but also explores his serious ideals, which are essential to understanding the plays (and operas). And then of course there's the added bonus of the incredible Fabrice Lucchini who is equally at home creating the twinkle-eyed scoundrel, the passionate idealist, and the ordinary man who nervously awaits the verdicts of censors and public. I'd give it 6 stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beaumarchais the Scoundrel","review":"This is an extremely informative movie with a lot of accurate details from Beaumarchais' life, but at the same time is extremely entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salsa Video","review":"The video does show salsa moves from South and Central America to give you an idea on some of the moves they do there. However, after watching the video I am sure glad I don't dance that badly. The dancers on this tape have no \\"sabor\\". I would not recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst $25 bucks I have ever spent!","review":"Where do I start -My primary language is Spanish, so I am used to listening to folks with heavy accents. I coulnd't even understand half of what this guy was saying. The dancing is sloppy, the music should be classified as \\"noise pollution\\". These \\"wanna be\\" instructors have absolutely no chemistry. The lady lost her step more than I want to remember. I purchased 2 videos (only opened one - thank God) and I am returning the unopened one immediately. I strongly urge anyone interested in learning how to dance Salsa to look elsewhere. Don't do the mistake I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful video","review":"This has to be the worst instructional video I have ever seen.I don't even know where to start this video is so bad.1. The dancing in these videos are horrible.2. The man is hard to understand when he speaks.3. The females look awkward and uncomfortable when they dance.4. The casio keyboard music is really corny.These people have some nerve selling something so horrible.I recommend Juan and Diane's NY videos. Actually I recommend any video more than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parenting Without Pressure","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone with teenagers or pre-teens. My husband and I have implemented the techniques in this book and have seen an improvement in the atmosphere in our home. The book teaches how to start letting go of our children and begin letting them make their own decisions so that they will be ready for the real world. It tells you how to let the natural consequences of their decisions teach them valuable lessons that they cannot argue with. Since beginning to use the suggestion of conducting a weekly family meeting, our household has become more peaceful and we are able to enjoy each other more and fight less. I have recommended this book to several friends and recommend it to you also."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Could Do it Again","review":"Teresa's book would have come in handy as we raised our teenage children. The book is a wealth of practical, tested, non-threatening, workable ideas that restore peace and harmony to a family.

Children will learn responsibility and accountability and parents will learn what a blessing their children can be and that family is something to cherish and nurture. An excellent tool that provides help and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parenting Without Pressure","review":"If I could give this book more stars I would. The best book onparenting I have ever read.

Would buy again. Delivered very quicky with no damage. Pleased with purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I'm not sure I understood the relationship between the coach and Roy. Overall, I liked this movie a lot. The subplot about Tracy Two Dogs and his family, and his relationship with Roy, was a lot more interesting than the main plot, to me. The movie was definitely worth buying though. It's nice to see an accurate depiction of Montana in film for once."},{"rating":"2","title":"wasteland","review":"I bought the DVD because, sadly, I had missed the screenings and couldn't find it for rental anywhere. The Jay Farrar music and the Indians were the reasons for me seeing it. To be a little critical, it came off as Cohen-brothers lite; if you strung together all the slower sequences of Blood Simple and Fargo, you'd have this movie. I did like the fact that nothing followed convention, and the hopelessness of living was conveyed well. I could've done without the scene near the end where a Native drives up in warpaint, hair flowing, on a motorcycle - it's like things turned into a Sherman Alexie story all of the sudden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I only bought this film because I was impressed with Ryan Gosling in Murder By Numbers, and reviews of The Slaughter Rule were interesting. I ONLY kept watching it because I hoped it would get better. The movie did not live up to its hype. Ryan and Morse were good, but the film had no substance. Clea Duvall was dry and the relationship between her and Gosling seemed forced with no chemistry. The film could have stood to show more of Kelly Lynch and Ryan Gosling interacting as mother and son. People claimed the scenes between Gosling and Morse were full of sexual intensity. Well I didn't see any of that. Just one clumsy scene when they end up in a lame shouting/hugging session. Also the football scenes were way too long and predictable. It was obvious that the naughty sex scenes were thrown in to wake people up who had dozed off. Unfortunately most people still dozed. This movie isn't worth your time unless you're a HUGH Ryan Gosling fan. If not you'll be bored to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me back my two hours","review":"A total waste of time. The movie tries to evince some deep metaphor about euthanasia or something, or forgiveness or something, I don't know. It's nothing worth making a movie about, that's all I know.It's also creepy how this movie seeks to portray a high school football coach who is a pediphiliac homosexual in a positive light. Ugh. Utterly, downright creepy. What's creepier are all the positive reviews here. Wow, this collapsing amoral culture is in a lot of trouble.This movie didn't merit my troubling myself to review it with any more specifics that that. I'm sorry I sat through the whole thing.It's utterly bleak and hopeless, as well as perverted. Blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype no show","review":"Well I can't agree with those other folks on this one. The only good thing about this film was the scenery. This is just another movie making us Montana folks look like a bunch of hicks. Oh sure, all Montana teenagers go down to the bar for beers after the game! They could have at least shown us a little more 6 man football. I guess hearing Wylie Gustafson was OK but that just about sums up the good parts for me. The first fifteen minutes I damn near shut this one down. My only regret is that I didn't. Don't waste 4 bucks or 2 hours on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Why did I watch this movie? Why did I KEEP watching this movie?Is loneliness a good reason for making sexual advances on a teenager? Well, maybe it is if your sexual partner is a homeless drunk with diabetes who keeps interrupting you during karaoke night. Heck, as long as the coach takes his high school team out for beers after a football game, he can do whatever he wants. (And if he buys them a box dinner, he can watch them shower together.)It seems some people cried at the character development of this movie. I cried that there are actually people out there posing as coaches for high school sports who use the roster as a way to find who they can add to their list of molestees.Then I cried when I realized I will never get 2 hours of my life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old!!!","review":"I bought this cd for my daughters' basketball team - but luckily played it before giving it to her/them as a present.

I have read her semi-autobiographical work \\"The Bell Jar,\\" and found it to be an easy read. This book \\"Wintering\\" was not an easy read for me. I admit I didn't finish it. I got too irritated with the never-ending, detailed upon detailed descriptive narrative. What I am trying to say is, the author, Kate Moses, went a little too over-board with describing details, surroundings, smells, sights, sensations for my taste. I love good description. I want to have a feel for the surroundings, but this was like eating too much rich cake. Please, no more. I stopped feeling like I was reading a book about Sylvia Plath, and began to feel like I was in an English literature or grammar class reading descriptive narrative for whatever benefit.Maybe I'll go back to this book later and have a whole new perspective. Maybe I'm just not in the mood for this book. If other reviewers loved this book, I respect that.

It is written mostly for old drivers, it's not very well organized, and too wordy. It teaches driving skills from beginning, but when I tried to follow instructions for such a basic skill like turning, I just drowned in details and get confused.The books which I found helpful for learning to drive wereParent-Teen Manual for Learning to DriveandCrash-Proof Your Kids.And about a fear of driving - the more you practice the less anxious you become, but begin slowly. First, practice with helper in empty parking lot. Then, try some short distance driving with helper (local library, local store with ample parking space). Then, when you feel ready try it alone. After mastering one route try another one the same way. Gradually you'll become more confident and comfortable behind the wheel and actually begin to enjoy driving. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved my laptop!","review":"When the keybpad stopped workign for certain keys, my first thought was - I need a new laptop!!!

One reason therefore is certainly the outstanding article by Watts and Strogatz, Collective dynamics of small world networks, Nature, 393:440--442, 1998. Unfortunatelly, this book can not continue the high level of this article. Actually, it does not really provide much more information than the article itself. I would suggest to read the article cited above and either decide for another book or to look directly in the literature and read the origninal articles.To summarize, this book is not terribly weak, but one can clearly sees that it swims on the current 'complex networks' wave without providing enough justification for its existence. Of course, if you do not have access to the original literature and just what to have a general overview of complex networks and what be done with them, you may consider buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but some typos","review":"Mathematical level: Moderate; there's no calculus, and little high level math, but the book is quite mathematical in tone, and some of the arguments may be difficult to follow without a good \\"math sense\\". There are MANY equations and graphs.Good points: Watts covers an area that will interest those who deal with mathematical models of social networks e.g. models of disease-spread, especially HIV. It might, however, cover other things that can spread through networks as well. He presents analysis of graphs (or networks) that are neither random nor highly structured; and begins to examine ways that the degree of structure v. randomness can be measured.Bad points: There are more than the usual number of typos. The models presented are a \\"first step\\", only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pedantic to listen to on CD.","review":"I couldn't make it past the second chapter even though the stories and ideas were engaging. As an audio product, the narrator repeats himself too many times and recaps and re-summarizes again and again. It's hard to listen to. If you're kind of slow, this CD may be just your speed. If you're sharp, you will be bored out of your skin. Perhaps an abridged version would be easier to sit through. It's too watered down and repetitive - at least as an audio version where you can't skim to avoid the redundancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great theme, horrible execution","review":"The idea of an economic analysis of the quotidian bits of life is a great one; and it is easy to understand why Levitt is as highly regarded as he is. Unfortunately, this book is such a complete mismash of stylistic inconsistency, vague writing and studious avoidance of detail that it undermines itself.The book's theme seems to be that the economic toolkit is well suited to assessing (and debunking if appropriate) the conventional wisdom. But instead of actually seeing the economist's toolkit put to use, we are given a list of conclusions.The book is shallow -- and doesn't add much to the profile of Levitt that was in the NY Times Magazine a couple of years ago.Rather than reading this book, go to Levitt's U of Chicago homepage and read the papers that he has posted there."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for the paperback","review":"if you read it at all. Very dissappointing. I do not doubt that Levitt is capable of asking meaningful questions and devising sophisticated analyses, but that does not come through in this book. The theories are largely unsupported by data (at least data that are cogently presented), flaws and shortcomings in the analyses are not adequately described and commented upon, and much of the text is dumbed-down, self-evident gibberish, or idle speculation - take for example the entire chapter devoted to children's names. I certainly hope that this book does not speak for the current art and science of sociological analysis and I wonder if Levitt was not \\"coaxed\\" into participating in this project by an adoring and fawning Dubner, who admittedly has a proclivity for \\"hero worship\\". Is he responsible for the sophomoric tone of the text and its lack of supporting data?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I can't believe an entire book was created about such minutia, nor did I find the process by which they came to some of their conclusions to be so profound. Thank god I only picked this up at the library. After a quick perusal through the book on a train ride home, I decided to return it. I found it tres boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really economics","review":"This is one of the more overrated books on economics out there, first and foremost because most of its content has little to do with economics. It should really just be called \\"what the statistics tell us\\". It really lacks any of the insights into behavior and outcomes that are found when one is really utilizing economic principles. In fact, its focus on statistics reinforces the wrong perception that economics is all about numbers and math - it's not. At it's core, it's about fundamental and basic principles of human psychology, behavior and the difference between intent and desire and result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it True?","review":"It sounds scientific but not sure if all is true in this book. Great reading and a lot to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read but it needs more content","review":"I enjoyed the book and its alternative look at economics applied to less traditional issues. However it read more like a small series of essays or abbreviated research papers. The book touts that it discusses everyday items with economic principles so I expected a wide variety of topics, rather it only touch a just a few ideas. To compensated they used really thick, coarse paper. Enjoyable but light."},{"rating":"2","title":"If human nature is foreign and numbers make sense....","review":"This book is great. It has stylistic and content shortcomings but I haven't seen an extraction of human motivation proof from various data sets quite like this before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read - One of the best I have read in recent months","review":"Understanding how data can be teased to throw up insights is the core idea behind this book. However how Levitt does it makes the book very interesting. Freaky examples, easy reading, simple explanations make this book a must read for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves Much To Be Desired","review":"I had high anticipation and expectations for this book considering the hype surrounding it's release, but was sorely disappointed. After the first chaper I should have stopped reading; the writers had already revealed the most interesting \\"revelations\\" of the book. The following chapters are a mix of redundancy and narcissism. Seriously, the book should be called freakygeeks: the not so hidden ego of the authors. Don't get me wrong, I love the economic lense focused on abscure subjects, but this seemed hastily written to appeal to the lowest common denominator. Those arrogant pricks, I think they purposely left much to be desired so that they could write a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonplussed","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much given the cover banter...by page 43 I was dragging myself through Mssr. Levitt's observations as to whether Sumo wrestling could be rigged. In between each chapter is a paragraph dedicated to the homage of the author. By chapter two I was eager to catch a glimpse of the statistical realities that would explain why I just dropped twenty-five bucks on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal, only for the gullible","review":"There is no need to say much. The book is sometimes fun to read but it is really just more, poorly based, sensationalist journalism than anything else. It's a prime example of the misuse of statistics. Anecdotes are dangerous; the book is filled with them. The speculations are just that: pure speculation. The authors play journalist and cite few if any rigorous studies. They contradict themselves (see sections on capital punishment). It's an OK book to stimulate discussion, but not a source of factual information. It falls in my junk category."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"A vastly overrated book, studies the similarities beween odd situations and why this happen. OR Why the Ku Klux Klan has things in common with Real Estate Agents. Why do drug dealers live with their mother?Whilst it states good theories, the book is too light on evidence to be convincing. The 'new' rear section of Bonus material is almost 100 pages in itself and should juist be called a chapter and be done with it.Not up to the hype, I have read better books with actual facts in them that are more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, but also very biased","review":"Five stars for the quality of writing as far as interest and readability, as well as good awareness of the misuse of statistics. Three stars for bias, and ironically, the misuse of statistics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated state of the stone age economics","review":"This book has been highly overrated. That is the reason i decide to write this review. For someone with decent knowledge about economics there is nothing new to find in this book. No new methods, no new theory, no groundbreaking insights.The only thing the writers succeded in showing is that people are selfish and motivated by economic incentives. This statement is even true for schoolteachers and sumowrestlers (state of the art science if you ask me). This might be entertaining, but is certainly not groundbreaking. The statistical methods the writers use are funny but not groundbreaking either.This book makes good reception conversation and can easily be read on the toilette or in the tube. If you wish to buy it for those purposes I can really recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Topics sound interesting but should be \\"Freakonomics for Dummies\\"","review":"This book is as popular as it is intellectually devoid of any concrete material. The authors have managed to get good topicnames and chapter openings but the content is superficial. If you read the book carefully and think about it, you can summarize the book in 5-10 pages.It is interesting to read because of the correlations but nothing more than that.Levitt and Messrs have used regressions, etc to only make it sound scientific but anyone equipped with economics 101 will know this stuff.Again, this book is at a very preliminary level. The material is inspired from \\"The tipping point\\" and if you have read that book, you can see that the authors have used similar examples. Maybe they just want to ride the success of other popular books.But I must give it to them - they make you think about hidden causalities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, Damn Lies, and Statistics","review":"This authors of this unfortunate book have a penchant for using statistics to attempt to explain their version of major social issues. Unfortunately there is a huge logic gap between the statistics they use and the conclusions they reach. I suspect the authors skipped out on their basic logic classes. Not worth the cheap paper it's written on. Mine went into the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really Statistics 001 - not Economics","review":"Just finished this - had to nudge myself thru it as a good friend said it was great and I wanted to drop it after 30 pages. Lucky thing I borrowed it and didn't have to pay for the agony.I find it facinating that the into says some people may think the examples in the book might be trivial - \\"some\\", \\"may\\", \\"might\\" - let me say I don't know anybody who would not know the examples are inane - way past trivial.This book is a waste of time for everyone who has any time at all for sleeping an extra hour. Sleep and make use use of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"More please...","review":"The book is a fun read, but lacks statistical, technical, detail; perhaps that's understandable; not a lot of surprises. It has long been known that swimming pools are more deadly than hand-guns in terms of over-all child mortality and cars more statistically deadly than airplanes. I applaud the authors for taking on ONE of the long term effects of the Roe V. Wade decision. I had suspected that such a causal correlation between crime and abortion had existed for some time. I only wish they had taken it one step further, and explored more of the \\"counterintuitive\\" effects of Roe V. Wade on our free market capitalist society; such as the causal correlation between the huge influx and greater diffusity of illegal immigrant workers in our society some thirty years hence Roe V. Wade. I think, there too, is a causal connection between the post Roe V. Wade shrinkage of the domestic \\"cheap\\" (poor) labor pool and illegal immigrant labor demand."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating read","review":"This is a really interesting book. Makes you look at things in a totally different way. Obviously, being human and the lives we each live are very complex things, and there are no easy answers, but this book will certainly make you question what you've been taught.I really enjoyed it.On a related note, the movie is also great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"A facinating exposition of the power of economic analysis - enabled by modern computing power - in solving non-traditional problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book a little random","review":"To be fair to the authors they do tell you that.There is no story, no overall connecting theme. It jumps from story to story more like a novel that a business book.It is fun, interesting and well written and you do get some good stories to remember and tell.I guess it depends on your tastes.I've even saw them both talk at a company event and I had the same reaction - highly entertaining, but a little unconnected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read","review":"Pretty interesting book. I enjoyed the way the subject matter was presented i.e why do gang members live with their mothers etc. Some of the stats you might already know, but it doesn't detract from the book. I would recommend the book if you are in the mood for something a little different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozorama","review":"A blurb on the cover of this book says \\"Prepare to be dazzled\\" -- so, being an ex-Boy Scout, I brushed my choppers, took a multivitamin, and hired a sitter for the cat before settling in for the night with a copy of \\"Freakonomics\\". After all, a book that promises to \\"explore the hidden side of everything\\" sounds intriguing as all get out, and I couldn't wait to dig in and \\"be dazzled\\". Unfortunately, after reading this slim volume (Q: Can \\"the hidden side of everything\\" be explored in 256 pages? A: I don't believe so.), I simply wasn't dazzled. Maybe it's just that I didn't find the fact that real estate agents, on average, tend to put more effort into selling their own homes than they do that of their clients; or that rich people are more likely to name their daughter \\"Ava\\" rather than \\"Brittany\\". I'm sorry, but that stuff just isn't dazzling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and off the beaten path","review":"Good book, especially for a minimal price. If you like an odd way to look at economics this book gives a fun portrayal of that very thing. Not a bad read, but if your looking for a story, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting & Thought Provoking","review":"There are the numbers and then the story. Freakonomics is about the story that the numbers tell. The difference here, as the title suggests, is that this is about odd stories that the numbers tell. From the controversial linkage of abortion & crime, to names & economic status.I would have liked to see references to the actual papers in which these theories are postulated, so that I could verify the causality rather than just the correlation stated.The book is well written and very accessible to the layman. Levitt & Dubner avoid technical jargon or convoluted writing common in academia. The chapters are well structured to flow as neatly into each other as non-fiction can, making for a compelling romp through Freakonomics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I almost liked this book as much Gladwell's \\"blink\\" and \\"Tipping point.\\"The book applies a \\"Freakonomic Analysis\\" to various issues that are not really related ranging from crime to Sumo wrestling, hence the absence of a unifying theme. But that is really no big deal since the book managed to be fun to read despite the absence.I think I was able to catch one mistake, where the author's claim that the crack consumption went down by only 30% from 1989 to 2000. To me it looks like this is true in absolute quantity, but when adjusted for population growth, this number would almost double.That being said, I would still give this book five stars. Can not wait for their next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The title is arresting, the cover art cute, and there are a couple of moderately engaging chapters (the relation of Roe v. Wade to crime rates, for example). But are we really surprised to learn that those who sell drugs on street corners are not on the fast track for promotion, that in the days of No Child Left Behind testing teachers will help their students cheat (or cheat for them) so that their schools won't be penalized? By the concluding examination of black and white names and the success rates associated with them, the authors are thrashing about in their data and arriving at conclusions most would find to be pretty banal."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK","review":"Before I read this book, I was told that it was the most thought provoking piece of literature in the last decade. Everyone I talked to raved about it, and said that the way they look at things will be forever changed. This is a slight exaggeration, but not far from my actual experience.After reading this book and being thoroughly disappointed, I have to ask the question - Have you actually ever thought about these issues before? If you had, Levitt's answers would seem pretty obvious... The book isn't bad per say, but it definitely is not worthy of praise. Seriously people, let's think about it. Drownings are more common than accidental gun shots? How many pools are there in America versus hand guns? How much more likely are small children to play at a pool without being supervised? Shocked? Hardly.If you have thought about any of these issues before, the book is not worth your time, energy, or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoker and conversation starter.","review":"The only \\"fun\\" read about economics I have ever read. It has some fun insights but does not present statistical data, which was just fine with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but a bit thin on real substance","review":"One of the disadvantages of reviewing something after 1,000+ other people have already posted their observations is that there's nothing left to say that hasn't already been said numerous times. So I'll keep my comments brief. \\"Freakonomics\\" is not a book of great substance. In it, the authors explore a half-dozen topics, and offer some (perhaps) new insights into various matters. Some of what they say borders on the obvious (e.g. realtors don't really work for their clients' best interests; they work for their own best interests) while others fall into the \\"who cares\\" category (e.g. an overlong exploration of fixed matches in the world of sumo wrestling). Still, the book is a interesting read, and contains just enough new ideas to provide fodder for cocktail party conversations. I give it a low 4 stars overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"Thought provoking, entertaining and intelligently written! Lays bare the hard statistical evidence behind many common assumptions that the 'Spin Doctors' (main stream media and politicians) distort and misrepresent to support their own agendas. The book digs into some highly controversial topics, for example; What's really more dangerous to your family? Owning a gun, or a backyard swimming pool? (The answer is obvious right?) Or, what's the real reason for the decline of crime in the U.S.?Any way, a great book and I plan to read it a second time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good short story; boring book","review":"This is the most over-hyped book I can remember reading. If you've read a magazine or newspaper article about some of the book's insights, then you already know all you need to, as the book jams 30 pages of interesting info into 200 pages. The last 20 pages or so is mainly lists of names to try to make some point that is beaten to death...snore."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!","review":"Great way to challenge how you look at statistics! Thought provoking and entertaining from start to end. Written for anyone to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun beach reading, but no dazzle...","review":"The cover promises \\"Prepare to be dazzled\\" and I expected so much more. This is a very thin book (double spaced & wide margins, 200 pages in total) and can be read in one day at the beach. You can find some interesting statistics, for example which words work best in real estate ads. But by no means should this book be categorized in Popular Economics on Amazon. Save your money and check out this book from your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Simple","review":"An uncommonly simple approach to why things happen without the need to understand statistics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Economics","review":"This book is entertaining with economics being the main driver. This isn't a text book style book and I'm assuming most economics professors might scoff at some of the suggestions. Will this book add any real learning value to the reader? No. But it may just interest them enough to start looking at how certain things can really affect other things...how the world can be quantified and connected.This really is more a book on Social Behavior mixed with Economics and just a really interesting read.If you are not prone to reading business books and they generally bore you with how technical they are, this one isn't so bad.If you enjoy \\"The Tipping Point\\" this one may be right up your alley.The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and all","review":"This is an interesting book but it's by no means an educational or earth shaking.

The book covers incentives - the incentives to pick your child up from daycare to a teacher's incentive to cheat or a criminals incentive to commit crime. Various truths that we hold dear are challenged. Media and so called \\"experts\\" are examined and their theories are studied. Here are some of the questions answered and facts from the book:- Children are more likely to drown in a swimming pool then be killed by a gun- Where do the most popular girl and boy names come from?- Why would a teacher cheat and change her students test scores?- Why did crime decrease in the 1990s?- Does a child's name have any effect on the child's well being or is a indicator of how sucessful they might be in the future?This book is an enjoyable and shocking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written for the \\"out of the box\\" thinkers","review":"Analysis ranging from crack dealer economics to the politics and back room arrangements to keep sumo wrestlers employed, plus the real reason for the decrease in crime in the US (hint: It probably wasn't use of the \\"Broken Windows Theory\\").

But other than that, an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facts are stubborn things","review":"Were it not for the deliberate obscurantism that infects most professionals in the field, economics would be one of the most fascinating subjects on Earth. After all, we all make choices and buy things daily, nearly always handicapped by incomplete information. Thanks to Levitt and his writing partner, layers of cant and superstition are stripped away from some very important questions (why do children succeed in school?) and some merely fascinating ones (why do sumo wrestlers cheat?). Levitt is the economist for the intelligent, interested nonspecialist -- in short, a much needed antidote to the ideology-based spewing or needlessly obscure academic irrevelancy that passes for thought these days. Economics are fun again, like when you set up that lemonade stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freaky alright","review":"Freakonomics was a good magazine article streached into a weak book. In some passages about sensitive topics, the authors clearly were afraid to make their own conclusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"This book is super-disappointing. It is a 5-7 page NYT Magazine article blown up into a 200-page, lots of filler, large print book.Yes, we get it -- Levitt is unorthodox and smart. Unfortunately, if you take out all the sections of back-patting and condescending pseudo-analysis, you're left with little more than interesting theory about abortion and crime rates.With that in mind, the subtitle \\"A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything\\" is laughable. I'm baffled at how this book is a bestseller. I'm embarrassed my boss gave it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really interesting read!","review":"Not entirely what I expected this book to be, but not disappointing. This book really does explore some weird topics, and digs down to reveal some of the true forces and factors influencing behaviors and results. Through lots of data mining, the authors have produced a book that seems to reveal as much about human nature as it does about money and power. Whatever reason you may have for reading it, it will leave you pondering and discussing its myriad topics for some time. Neat book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow it, don't buy it--a waste--Teach an economics lesson","review":"After all the hype, I was rather disappointed with this book. First off, I was done reading this within a few short sessions--such a waste even at $16 here! Second, the \\"Hidden Side of Everything\\"?! It was more like a few magazine articles on a few topics. Moreover, Sumo wrestlers and baby names aren't really the most compelling social tales. There's some fun party talk included here, but the stuff included in this book is more suited for a series of five-minute reads in a weekly column (instead of a whole chapter explaining that crack dealers live at home because only the big-time dealers make money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dangerous Abuse of Statistics","review":"In the beginning of the book, I found the author's use of simple statistics to find new ways of looking at social phenomenon interesting and refreshing. By the end of the book I was outraged when he started \\"proving\\" his theories by statistics. Linear regression is powerful tool in understanding simple systems with one or two variables. Applying it to the complex realm of the social sciences to draw the far reaching conclusions Leavitt draws is irresponsible. If you are going to use science, use it appropriately. If you read this book, PLEASE read a good book on the PROPER use of statistics and know that THIS is not it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking book, challenging conventional wisdom and conclusions","review":"The books seems to have become a must-read, and for good reason. I didn't agree with every conclusion that the authors come to by applying economic and social science to varying social topics; but I did agree with the process and analysis. This kind of analysis, purveyed by thinkers such as these authors and writers such as Malcolm Gladwell, challenges \\"conventional wisdom,\\" and often the status quo by looking deeper at issues and at underlying social influences. The book is written in plain language and is very readable (one plane flight or less). You will come away having learned something important."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fun read...","review":"What do public school teachers and sumo wrestlers have in common?This book was fun to read- engaging, interesting and if not necessarily educational, at least entertaining. The economic threads between seemingly disparate subjects as described here are fascinating...If you are looking for a \\"hard science\\" book on economics, keep looking. But if you are looking for either a fun read, or a fun read built around a bit of economic theory, check this book out. At the very least, it will teach you the difference between correlation and causation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boring topic turned into fascinating book.","review":"In Freakonomics Steven Levitt argue that many seemingly mysterious events of everyday life aren't mysteries at all. The events can be examined and made even more fascinating by asking the right questions and drawing connections. For example, Levitt traces the drop in violent crime rates to a drop in violent criminals. Levitt believes the Roe v. Wade decision preempted the existence of some people who would be born to poverty and hardship. In a section that may scare or relieve worried parents, Levitt argues that most parenting methods don't really matter much and that a backyard swimming pool is much more dangerous than a gun.Freakonomics is an easy quick read. Levitt turns an otherwise boring topic of economics into a fascinating book. I'm looking forward to reading the next book SuperFreakonomics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"These guys are very bright and wrote a very interesting book.

He likes to ask unusual questions about daily facts that would not normally be of interest to someone in his field.These odd questions are usually answered by looking into some data from a clever and unexpected point of view, looking beyond the obvious answers in all of the cases. I particularly enjoyed reading about why drug dealers still live at home with their mothers!This book is relatively short, and was an easy read. The only thing that I thought was missing was some cold, hard data to go along with the ideas that Mr. Levitt is presenting.

For instance, did you know that time spent reading to children does not correlate to improved test scores, but that the number of books in the house does? Did you know that crack-dealing inner-city gangs are run much like corporate America -- except they offer a slightly higher risk of fatality?

It can cause people to belitle economics, particularly with the way Mr. Levitt makes some pretty rash conclusions. A most telling example is his link between abortions and the lower crime rate. Where are the actual figures? The incidence of violent crimes dropped from 1.9 million to 1.4 million between 1991 and 2000 - how does that really relate to the 16 million abortions that took place in that decade?

Its no wonder this book is so well liked by the New York Times. There is too much opinion and not enough evidence in the pages of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely Overhyped!","review":"Nothing new in here, people. Yes, we know everyone hopes to cut corners, lie, cheat and steal. Blah, blah, blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALLACY","review":"This was one of the worst excuses for non-fiction I've ever read. Anyone with a degree in a quantitative discipline should be able to recognize nearly every single conclusion in this book as fallacy and coincidence. The author even goes as far as to dismiss widely held conclusions about some of the issues with no way to back up his dismissals. There's also no methodology described for how he came to his conclusions. The other revelations in this book that deal with statistics (not economics) essentially state that people will do what's in their best interest regardless of their morals. Big shocker there... There is not one shred of logic or reason in here. If you disagree, please look up 'fallacy' in the dictionary, then please take a logic class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe The Hype","review":"This is another case of a book becoming immensely popular due to good editorial reviews and word of mouth. Unfortunately, Freakonomics couldn't match the hype in my opinion. While the concept of giving economics a new platform for analysis was interesting, the book did not come through with enough examples. Would have enjoyed more concise and abundant real world examples of Freakonomics in action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly insightful, original thinking...","review":"I really believe that people who read this book and didn't like it, don't understand the authors' point, and more importantly, their novel approach to analyzing various aspects of the human condition. The anecdotes put forth in the book ultimately lead you to no earth-shattering conclusions. However, you quickly realize it is the alternative viewpoint which challenges the \\"conventional wisdom\\" is earth-shattering all by itself. I kept hoping the authors would apply their perspective to issues more weighty than sumo wrestlers, children's names and Chicago drug gangs...maybe in the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was prepared to be dazzled...","review":"A fairly interesting book and a very easy read. But I was hardly dazzled. I am not an academic and did not pick this book up for insights into economic theory, but it read more like something I would use to liven up cocktail party conversation than as an insightful reference. It seems more like a long puff piece on Steven Levitt than anything else. I love iconoclasts and so am always glad to see someone (in this case, Levitt) poke holes in accepted theory, but otherwise this book, while mildly entertaining, did not live up to its buzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for those who like to look at the outside of the box!","review":"If you like logical thinking, and you like to apply it to things other than math, you will really enjoy this book. It does a great job of objectively reviewing & investigating problems, from names given to low-income children to teachers' cheating on standardized tests. The author is not unsympathetic, but he is unsentimental, which is a refreshing treatment for some of the older problems for which he offers help. It was a breath of fresh air for me, as I am fast becoming a very cynical news watcher. Thanks to the author for being able to set aside prejudice of all kinds and suggest new ways to deal with stale problems!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and 1/2 stars maybe...","review":"Although I am glad I read this book, I have read a lot better books that kept my attention better than this one. There were some really interesting and thought-provoking parts but it really lagged in some parts and was a bit boring in others, as well. An interesting take on things, though, and a very different kind of book...not horrible, not fabulous...somewhere in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, if you read one story at a time","review":"I can't say I agree with much but I will read this book for what it is and not what I want it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finished in 2 days","review":"I couldn't put this book down. Even in between work and school, I finished the book in only 2 sittings! Very thought provoking. A little bit of a stretch at times for some of the ideas presented but overall highly interesting! I'm about halfway through the second book already, and so far it's just as good. I highly suggest buying both."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the hype about?","review":"This book, one can afford to miss. With all of the other exceptional economic reads, many of which put out by the Mises Institute, by such authors as Hayek, Rothbard, Hazlitt, and Von Mises, I'm not entirely sure why this book receives so much praise, while the true reads receive so little. If you are a young economist or someone looking to understand anything about the market, how it works, the big picture in a meaningful way this book really isn't for you. This book does touch briefly on a couple of interesting topics that aren't commonly found in economic literature, such as the finances of a drug dealer. All in all though, I'm not overly impressed, and the authors have a way of presenting information in a more controversial way, when economic theory is controversial enough. Meaning that they have miss-quoted some of their supposed \\"sources\\". If you were my family or friend, I would tell you to, \\"Pick something else, and optimize your time spent reading.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonomics","review":"Excellent. Very readable.

Like other reviewers, I agree - this would have been a good magazine article (or series of magazine articles). This was clearly published to cash-in (not that that's all bad, but after all the hype I was hoping for more).Pros: Easy to read, engaging, interestingCons: I paid full-price, short (~200 pages / $25), doesn't dig-in deep enoughNow, granted, if I want a more in-depth study of Levitt's work, I'm sure there are any number of textbooks available to me, but this \\"seemed\\" like an intellectual book rather than a Readers Digest version padded-out into book form.Plus the hardcover version has uneven page widths (I'm sure there's a word for this) so the leafs resemble an old first edition. It is truly goofy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun to listen to","review":"This was a great book to listen to on my way to work. It is full of interesting statistics and definetly puts a few new spins on data. I have not heard the view expressed by Levitt about abortion and crime before. The book is full of entertaining points. It was interesting to find out how much drug dealers make and what is important in online dating. His funny views of the KKK and the popular names are entertaining. It definetly puts parents at ease about all the little stuff they do for their kids...he pretty much says that everything you could do for them you probably have already done (picked your lifestyle, partner, etc)...but of course all the little extras are nice gestures.He does a good and funny job of explaining how people are influenced by different incentives.Very fun to listen to. The conclusion is that data can help us answer many questions, but there will always be outliers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring style","review":"I am not impressed with the style of these authors. Too many ifs and buts. A waste of time before understanding problems and solutions. The explanations are subjective also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype-onomics","review":"Okay, it's interesting enough, not a bad read, some compelling ideas, but this has got to be the most self-congratulatory book ever. It's about a brilliant \\"noetic butterfly\\" (really, that's the smooch the author gives the economist) who shocks the establlishment, and the brilliant journalist who gains his trust and respect, and then the brilliant journalist quotes his own brilliant articles about the brilliant economist and calls that a book. It's a little insulting how we're supposed to be blown away by these mavericks. I'll give them credit for making science sexy, for making economics and statistics seem like valid tools, but please, fellas, a little humility, a little less marketing, and, if you really need to make out this much, get a room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything is not hidden!","review":"What gall to clam that everything is hidden!

Another famous theory is James Taranto's \\"Roe effect\\". The problem with this one is that Steve Sailer did a total debunking of it. I agree with an earlier post; if you find the earlier Slate archives, it appears no evisceration took place, but Slate left off Sailer's final and devastating response; see Sailer's blog. I can't believe the author included this contention in his book, but it's been said he is proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogus abortion argument casts shadow on rest of book","review":"Though many of the topics covered here are truly fascinating and eye-opening, the ill-conceived argument that abortion reduces crime makes me skeptical about the book as a whole. Levitt bases his argument on some previously debunked assumptions and fails to take into account a number of additional factors. It's the economic equivalent of saying increased ice cream sales lead to increased crime. Fun to mull some of these things over, but c'mon, let's not simplify things to the point where you mislead your uneducated readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"Very interesting while I was reading it.

Oh, and it's very well written, so it's a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonomics","review":"On the whole, the book is great as it is described. But it is better to improve the quality of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring unpopular statistics","review":"This was a pretty cool book. The conclusions that the authors have come to may prove to be unpopular and quite politically incorrect, but the authors stick by their assessments of the data. The book contains some strange looks at social movements and conventions and asks, \\"should we believe everything we have been told?\\" Maybe, you won't agree with their findings, but if you like examining societal practices, this book gives us something to ponder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much substance","review":"I found some of this book fun to read but ultimately it is mostly an empty read. Scant supporting evidence for many of the authors sometimes outrageous and inflammatory claims and assertions. Not to be taken seriously at best, irresponsible blather at worst.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The book encourages us to question the conventional thinking. \\" All it reguires is a novel way of looking, of discerning, of measuring.\\" Well here goes. The book cost about $17 a copy for 204 pages. That is over 8 cents a page. The last chapter contained over 12 pages, two columns per page, of girls and boys names, certainly makes me question how it made the best seller list."},{"rating":"2","title":"a refreshing blast of reason","review":"In political a world dominated by curt \\"truisms,\\" religious dogma, and emotional appeals that fit into 30-second spots, Dubner and Levitt have introduced a rare element of calm, sober reason into many of the most controversial issues of our time. It smells like a breah of fresh air.It's not the most high-brow piece of literature, and anyone with a little background in math or economics will hunger for a bit more substance. In other words, Dubner tends to skip over much of the reasoning behind Levitt's conclusions. Still, it's a worthwhile read for anyone interested in knowing the truth, whether or not it happens to be convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, light reading","review":"This is a great light read. Even though it attempts to use economics to uncover the truth, it is not too technical and is easy to understand. There is no central theme, but if there is ever one, it would be to use your noodles and not just accept conventional wisdom for what it is. After reading this book, it makes me really think about things as I try to see them for what they really are. I also learn or relearn alot of interesting facts as each chapter is focused on an interesting topic. I enjoy reading about the workings of a drug-dealing enterprise and seeing how similar it is to a legal corporation. My favorite is the chapter on parenting and what are the things that are really important in influencing a child's future. This book is so intriguing I could not stop reading it and I was able to finish it in record time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonmics","review":"Great read. This book side steps isses of morality and opinion (how we would like the world to be) and presents us with the data showing us how things really are: forget political correctness.

I bought this book because it was so much in news. I was severely disappointed. The tone of the book is very sophomoric. Nothing in the book sounds serious. The authors have started several chapters with notes in italics and these notes are full of self-aggrandization. The authors acknowledge that the book has no focus (they present this defect as if it is a virtue). They are absolutely right -- the book indeed has no focus.Some reviewers have commneted that this book presents a new way to look at the things. I think this book presents a new way to look at things to only those who have not been looking at the things to begin with. I did not learn anything new about economics from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Steven Levitt does a good job of applying typical economic theories and problems to very atypical subjects, such as drug dealers and the KKK. The result is a unique book that exposes what really motivates some people, among other things. He does not get overly technical, and no, the book has no math in it, so people unfamiliar with economics can enjoy this as well as people who are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Very interesting concepts.

The authors ramble on in tangents, they lose track of the point in which they are trying to prove, and the evidence that they provide is sketchy at best. The authors can not make a provable case for their arguments. Throughout the whole book, they attempt to tie loose facts together. Well anyone could do that. I want knowledge and this book doesn't provide. And lastly, the first chapter about violence in NYC in the 1980's was already proven pretty well by Malcolm Gladwell - - which he made a very strong argument for, whereas in this book, the argument for the violence was because of less baby boomers!?

He shows how teachers cheat on student achievement tests. He goes into excruciating detail about what first names are popular and for how long. The most controversial element is the suggestion that the drop in crime in the early 90s stemmed from Roe v. Wade leading to the abortion of a whole generation of criminals. Unlike the other data-backed trivialities in the book, this bombshell conclusion is based mostly on supposition and opinion, and perhaps wishful thinking, rather than real evidence presented in a compelling way.The book is a cultural phenomenon, but so was the pet rock for awhile.

Dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this a best seller?","review":"The book started of quite ok, but as you go you will notice that the author did not have much stuff to write - more like one of my students who try to fill up pages. Check out from Pg.193 to Pg.203. I wonder what criteria they used to state this as a NY Times bestseller."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to understand it","review":"This book is a lot of fun simply because of it's premise: complex phenomena can be understood if we find the right perspective. It's fun to explore different phenomena from the author's perspective and it really broadens your mind. Lots of fun.If you want to discover how emotions influence your thinking and your path to success, read \\"The Emotional Intelligence Quick Book.\\" It's a fun, inspirational book and it has a free test to measure your own emotional intelligence (EQ) online!"},{"rating":"1","title":"author admits fabrications","review":"The author has admitted, in print, that he has fabricated data and intentionally misrepresented statistics - especially in the abortion chapter. He justifies it by saying his intentions were good. He admitted this in an interview with Gene Epstein in the book \\"Econospinning.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"For Critical Readers Only","review":"I give this book a negative review mostly because of another reviewer's title statement: \\"Smarter for having read it\\"; the book consistently criticizes experts in various media, and then proceeds to engender the deplorable \\"expert\\" mentality in casual readers, like us, who are really not good judges of what's going on. There is so much at stake in their claims, which they hasten through, that to consider yourself more learned after the fact may be only the process of self-blinding. Dubner and Levitt aren't necessarily wrong, but to read them without severe skepticism is to throw your mind into a vast pool of questionable correlations and grossly vague statistics, where some people may never escape their own illusory intelligence and sophistication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I read Freakanomics back when it first came out. I fell for the hype generated by its release and was sorely disappointed. If you want to read it, borrow it from someone. It is certainly not worth your money to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Levitt is interesting, the author is not","review":"I read this book, and the parts that had to do with the actual research and findings of Levitt are very interesting. But the author adds too much of his own gobbaldygoop.The chapter on how well children do in school and the parameters of thier parents is good. It was based on research. But so much of this book is filled with the authors inane opinions, and observations passed off as Levitts. There are many things that are not just illogical, but he contradicts himself at least three time. It really does not do credit to Levitt and his work.And what does this guy have against realitors, I mean we got your point the first time, but he just keeps going for the throat. People may disagree, but I really do think that he compares realitors to the KKK. I could be wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"freakoff","review":"A combo puff piece (25x we're told how great the economist is) filler -- each chapter begins with enough padding to enable anybody to withstand Mike Tyson at his peak - and a bit of a clever idea.This is really a magazine article (in fact, it was) sold expensively. The most brilliant idea was packaging a few insights this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am freaky over Freakonomics","review":"I was very intriqued by this book from the title a Rogue Economist Explores The Hidden Side of Everything. Briefly I saw this book being talked about on the show Scarbourough Country and it really made me wonder how in the world did the legalization of abortion in the 70s cut down the rate of murder in the 90s? Seemed very controvorsial especially in the fact I am a pro-lifer. The book turned out to be very enjoyable as a read and made economics as exciting as the show Desperate Housewives. I recommend this book as a great gift to anyone! This will give you tons to talk aboout at your next social gathering. I know when reading the book I kept bugging my husband saying hey did you know this about realtors and stockbrokers and sumi wrestlers. I think just by reading this book I may never even use a realtor again. Great Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The more I read, the more I got turned off","review":"The whole chapter on speculation that crime went up in the 1990's because women couldn't have abortions and therefore their offspring became criminals?! Then they tried to rationalize it was scientific? Maybe I overreacted but I started doubting every argument they presented. Put the book down half way through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but why the hype","review":"This is an interesting book which uses fairly common statistical and economic methods to address social phenomena. The results of Levitt's studies are interesting and often challenge some common assumptions. Levitt also proposes interesting and bold theories based on the results of his studies (abortion and lower crime). While the book is worth reading and fun, I don't understand why Levitt's work is considered so innovative. Basically he is an economist practicing sociology. The book is similar in many ways to Barry Glasser's book The Culture of Fear-Why Americans Fear the Wrong Things(also recommended) which also uses social science to test and challenge common assumptions about our social world. Perhaps the attention is because he is that rare economist who actually writes well and on topics of interest to non-economists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, But I Don't Agree","review":"All the hype by reviewers about how \\"different\\" and insightful this book was prompted me to buy a copy. I found it totally disappointing as a book on economics or related to economics. It was in fact interesting and amusing in places, but the book is based on a different social science altogether -- Sociology.Many other books have been written about social groups and relationships, and this is just another one. The organizational structure of the drug industry and the popularity of particular names for children are perhaps interesting but not something that need to be included under the umbrella of economics.Sorry, but I wouldn't have bought it if I had skimmed it in my local book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"no numbered notes - hard to validate claims","review":"while the subject matter of the book was interesting -and there are plenty enough reviews here without me adding to/detracting from that- my comment is a fundamental problem with the publishing/printing of the book: there are numbered notes of sources of the various claims made at the back of the book, but the text in the chapters of the book HAS NO REFERENCE NUMBERS. so, basically, you have no way of validating the claims unless you dig around the notes at the end of the book hoping to cross-reference the parts you're currently reading. every other non-fiction book i've read numbers their notes; why doesn't this book? steven d. levitt would ask to think about this, and maybe, just maybe, it's because some of his claims are tenuous at best. or maybe i just got a badly printed/published book. for the record, it was the hardback edition, published 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows your mind","review":"Levitt's ideas are truly revolutionary. Going into this book, I didn't know what to expect. What I got out of it was a new perspective on life that not only spans the topics he discusses, but strethces itself out to the rest of my thoughts. Don't read this book if you like the way your mind works right now just the way it is. Otherwise, you're in for one hell of a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 15 minute read","review":"I'm surprised that this book is found on the best seller list. It has a catchy title and one or two interesting points, but, otherwise, is worth no more than a short scan. Save your money or wait until your friend tosses it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for economists","review":"If you have a BA, BA, or MA/MS in Econ then you will find this a quick and easy read. A table top book if you will.If you are a normal person with a passing interest in a econ and more intrguing way of looking at problems then pick up this book. He shows how stat analysis can overcome stereotypes and bias. It's a good quick read with medium weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great ... Get a better description of Economics in Aiden Rocke's Rogue Threat","review":"I was just disappointed in this book. Having recently read Rogue Threat by Aiden Rocke, I felt that Levitt could have taken this book in the direction Rocke does. Rostow's five stages of economic growth explain, for me anyway, how we got to where we are today. The sixth stage, secular spiritual stagnation, is much of what Levitt talks about. Rocke demonstrates in a fascinating story, Rogue Threat, that a seventh stage, a new enlightenment, is possible. Go to rougethreatonline, you'll learn as much there as you will reading Levitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has made me see things differently","review":"This is not your traditional \\"business book\\". Steve Levitt is brilliant. His thought process and challenging of traditional answers makes one think of their life...both professionally and personally. I can use this book to get my managers, my reps, my peers...to look at things differently and challenge the easy answers.Am having my team of managers read this ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over-hyped","review":"I suppose it was an interesting magazine article, so they added a lot of verbiage and managed to get a book out of it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Hype Sells Books","review":"After reading all the reviews I was excited to receive my copy of Freak-o-nomics, which is afterall, nothing about nothing. Talk about weak science and making something out of nothings. Save your money. It is a thin overhyped book about nothing and you will learn nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"things I thought but could never put into words","review":"It should have been titled \\"What I always suspected but never had the wherewithall to put together and write\\". So far four members of our family have read it...its great dinner conversation. It was a good buy for us.

The book is separated into six chapters each examining a different topic. The first five chapters are terrific both from an informational and enjoyment standpoint, while I found the last to be quite boring and with that \\"So What?\\" feel.Overall I found it very entertaining and have used to info in many, many conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best cocktail party topic books ever","review":"\\"Freakonomics\\" is a gold mine of interesting facts and trivia, including how much money a crack dealer makes, the life cycle of popular baby names, how sumo wrestlers work the system and how the Chicago school system caught teachers cheating on standardized tests.It's not a lot more than that -- the book is openly just an extended magazine article, and not a particularly critical one at that -- but it's a quick and interesting read; I knocked out most of it in a single transcontinental plane flight. And, honestly, when's the last time there was a quick and interesting read about economics?The book could use both more length and depth, but hopefully that will come in the form of a sequel.Recommended for those looking for a fun and interesting quickie read. Not so recommended for those hoping this is a profound work that will somehow change their life."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title was the Best Part","review":"Or maybe the publicity hype was the best part. Yes, the book is readable, and it is unique to find economic principles applied to everyday situations. But too often I found myself saying, \\"Ho,hum. So what? Am I done with this chapter yet?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Freak-o-tistics","review":"This surely is not the Economics that I grew up with. This easy to read book draws some fascinating conclusions, many of which have been discussed in other reviews. However, I'm not sure that this is Economics at all. By my dictionary, Economics is defined as \\"the science of the production, distribution, and consumption of comodities.\\" (Concise American Heritage Dictionary). Other than oblique references as to how to get ahead in a crack ring, this is not touched on at all.This book is about the use of statistics, plain and simple. Statistics can be molded to derive most any conclusion. Levitt makes interesting use of statistics to come up with unusual conclusions. But this is not Economics. All that Levitt is advocating is for us to think outside the box and see beyond our foregone conclusions. This is a valuable lesson, but certainly nothing new.I can see why this is a best seller - it is very simple to read and it is very clever. But that is all. Nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip a frivolous book like this","review":"I am pretty sure that any sensible economist in the future will regard this book as a temporary fever. Perhaps not a few researchers will agree that Levitt lacked seriousness and did economics just to show off his IQ. I am not claiming that he is immoral to infer that abortion is good to prevent crime. Rather, I am just questioning, \\"So what?\\" and I don't understand for what and for whom this geek is doing this sort of research.In a nutshell, any serious intellectuals (I don't care about pedants like Levitt) should skip a frivolous book like this. Do not be deceived by praises from insensible idiots jumping on the bandwagon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Direction to Look!","review":"This book shows you that if you have data, you can answer every possible question with the right algorithm. The difference of the book is Mr.Levitt asks absurd questions and gets very different answers than conventional wisdom. Are his answers correct? I convinced with some of them but not all. The most controversial one is the crime rate vs. abortion. When you read his arguments it looks logical but according to his theory crime rate declined and never will go up again. Because all potential criminals will get abortion. So we can not explain last 2 years crime rate increase with his theory. I think economic conditions plays more important role than he thinks.On the other hand I totally agree on perfect parenting and cheating chapter.We need more people like him asking absurd questions and answers them scientifically, correct or not. As a courios reader, this book one of the essential of your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Good mind opener for things we never thought of. For sure I am not going to have a swimming pool at home nor a gun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth to read","review":"I liked this book. It gives you a lot of new angles on very sensitive topics. What I particularly like is that Levitt steps outside the normal wisdom and shows us that the cause of problems might not be what we think. The thing that I miss in the book is other economists views."},{"rating":"2","title":"My two cents","review":"This collection is the perfect introduction to \\"thinking outside the box\\" that Young Adults so desperately need. Filled with challenging situations that demand to know, \\"why things are the way they are?\\" Sprinkled with just enough statistics to give credibility, (but not to overwhelm), and just enough history to shed light on the bigger picture; it asks the meaningful, fresh questions that will intrigue and interest the most lethargic student. Recommended for thoughtful, mature audiences, this book may appeal to the Young Adult reader, and their parents. Drugs, crime, getting a job - this book covers many of the contemporary issues facing Young Adults today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This book is one of the best I have read in a couple years. They present things in ways that I have never thought of. It's really great to read a book that makes you see things differently. Also, they have well documented citations of their statistics. Great read all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!","review":"Loved this book, I am a conservative, which of course made me assume I would not like this book, because my assumption was the authors were going to be pushing an agenda, they weren't and this book was amazing - READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonomics thoughts","review":"I had been told about the unique content of Freakonomics and was delighted to have listened to the CD version of the book. It is quite thought provoking and well worth the purchase.Amazon again delivered the best price and was true to their projections regarding timely delivery.I remain pleased all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Not Dazzled","review":"So much for Malcolm Gladwell's (Blink) opinion. I didn't notice his blurb on the cover until later. If he likes it, you know that's an omen.For someone in economics, the author(s) don't bother to show much proof. Like we're supposed to believe drug dealers have a board of directors, and a regulated payroll? And abortion caused the crime rate to drop? A \\"well-maintained\\" house is just old? And what was with ALL the names of the babies? Who cares? I didn't even see Velveeta, Asti Spumante (yes, real names!), or the ever popular \\"Shaniqua\\" on the lists.Mostly unsubstantiated conjecture (sociologist they know \\"swears\\" he met the twins LemonJello and OrangeJello in a store), this book just goes all over the place and ends up nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freakonomics","review":"It is a complete mystery how the author of Blink could recommend this (on the cover). Blink had a central unifying theme that was well-presented and provocative,carefully outlined and argued. This book is a hodgepodge of random \\"wisdom\\" that uses a few statistics or economic data and then generalizes in a vague way that seems to imply that the \\"ideas\\" (stretching the term) they present are meaningful or interesting. It seems like trivial pursuit for economics and once again reinforces my low opinion of academic economics. Really an insultingly stupid book. It is discouraging to have such superficial analysis of real social problems get such a popular reaction. Good for non-thinkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"Perhaps the book has been hyped too much. I found the book scattered, and the \\"insights\\" trivial. More like written by a college grad who tries to show off his cleverness, than by a thoughtful economist. I don't think this book discredits Levitt as a serious economist, on the contrary, he maximized his own economic return by appealing to the low common denominator.Hope Levitt made enough money from this book that he can afford to devote the rest of his life to serious scientific inquiries."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Audience is cheated","review":"To me the book was very disappointing. The book is projected as something that explores the hidden side of everything, but it actually just proves to you what you already knew through facts and figures.If you are buying this book to read about some interesting co-relations, you will end up finding stuff that you already knew of. Both a Hollywood aspirant and a Drug Pedlar hope to rule their domain someday. Wow!!! Now did I not know this before?To the intellectual reader I would strongly suggest to refrain from buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting, but not rocket science","review":"Unlike a lot of economics books this book is pretty fair and unbiased. I don't think it is as funny as some readers thought, but the subjects are interesting. The economic theory in the book is common sense. For example, teachers cheat to make their students look smarter on standardized tests and real estate agents won't necessarily being doing everything they can to help you. However, the way he proves these things is pretty interesting. This book really reads a lot like a John's Bathroom reader. It has very interesting stories, but they are not going to make you any smarter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonomics","review":"Interesting reading that opens up much thinking. As interesting as \\"The Tipping Point\\" and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin' Great!","review":"What a great book! This should be required reading in high school and college. It turns conventional wisdom on it's head and makes you think. As a businessman, I truly appreciate the use of facts/figures vs 'conventional wisdom'. I couldn't put it down and can't stop talking to my friends/colleagues about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Opening","review":"There is always \\"cause and effect\\" in everything in life. But most of the time we get it wrong. We are always too easily satisfied with our own shallowness, or blinded by our preconception. Read this book. Dig deeper. Take another persepctive. You will feel the difference. Truth is always there and truht cannot be changed because it maybe \\"politically incorrect\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like The Tipping Point, but...","review":"I read The Tipping Point, Blink and Freakonomics back-to-back. I enjoyed The Tipping Point more than Freakonomics, but I appreciated the fresh insight that Levitt's offered on the same subjects such as public education, crime rates and poverty. Freakonomics is well worth the 15 or so dollars, but I would certainly buy The Tipping Point in addition to this purchase. It was fun to compare both approaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really about economics","review":"I resisted reading this book for awhile because I thought it was more about Economics, which sounded pretty dull. It is actually about applying the tools of Economics to a variety of topics, esp social questions. Did legalized abortion result in a drop in crime 20 years later? Does having an \\"ethnic\\" name result in less success in life? The book is very anecdotal and easy to read. I blasted through it in less than a week and I never read more than a hour at a time. My only complaint is that it really doesn't have much of a theme - just a collection of case studis or examples.Recommend for light reading - lighter than Blink or Tipping Point, for ex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book. Too Short","review":"I'm no economics major, I've never taken an economics class in my life, but this book was a fun read.It's a little short (the hardcover I have is only around 190 pages; but includes bonus info, most of which is just repeats of the book studies.) but was definitely an interesting read. If you want to find out why handguns are less dangerous than swimming pools, and why the legalization of abortion directly affected the nation's crime rate, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful","review":"Levitt and Dubner do a great job of looking at numerous issues from a new perspective. The abortion crime link is really interesting. The book is in stark contrast to Malcolm Gladwell's work which is basically a 3 page article turned into a book. This work seems like a lot of research boiled down into a short book.The NY crime analysis is the best example of this, Gladwell treats the story as a gotcha story which has one simple explanation which was waiting for him to discover (or Rudy Guliani as it were). Levitt and Dubner attempted to look at the issue with real data and thoughtful analysis.The presentation and analysis throughout the book is in depth (if incomprehensible to a novice such as myself) and as transparent as can be in such a short book.The only negative I have is in relation to their follow up, Superfreakanomics. The sequel is everything the original is not and could easily have been the work of Gladwell himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economics in a new and wacky light!","review":"This is definately not your average econ 101 text book. In fact it's a highly entertaining read that can be easily picked and put down. I liked the way that authors applied their research to everyday scenarios and made thought provoking conclusions. The subject matter definately comes in handy when it comes to discussing mortgages, parenting and crime rates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the academics scare you from a good read","review":"I got this book as a gift. Gave over two vacation days to read it. I have an engineering background and can handle the statistics, but I am grateful that the authors spared me. I hope they will keep asking questions and more books like this will follow. Finally, it seems like the book has just as much to do with sociology as it does with economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This book is very fun to read, and i learned a lot by reading it. I would strongly recommend it to all audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"the collective she","review":"The book lived up to the hype, more or less. Some arguments seems to follow the \\"common sense\\" logic and I was expecting more statistics and theory. This may be what other people dislike, but I was expecting to see that the arguments were based in sound economic theory for someone who did not study economics aside from the mandatory microeconomics and macroeconomics courses in college.Also, I found it interesting and somewhat distracting that in some cases the authors used \\"she\\" in the collective form and in other places they used \\"he.\\" The chapter about the teachers refers to the \\"questionable\\" teachers as \\"she\\" - why is that? Did they assume more women are teachers? And in at least one case while describing a more \\"positive\\" situation, they used the collective \\"he.\\" I have not read many books that blatantly changed from the collective he to the collective she based on argument as quickly as this one. I'm not sure what to make of that.All in all, though, an interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This is a great book! The kind that you just don't want to put down, and cant stop talking about once you have finished the last page. Brilliant!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The hidden side is not so different","review":"A nice book, with an original way of looking to \\"settled\\" facts.I read the book in 1 day.Only the chapter about first names was a little less.The lesson learned from this book that people behave much the same, although it may seem different from the outside.Theo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for new water cooler conversation?","review":"Levitt and Dubner turn our world upside down with this unconventional book about life's everyday enigmas. This book shows us that we may not know everything and allows us to look at life differently - which can be hard for a New Yorker like me. In this book, there is no right or wrong, just the idea to keep an open mind, always a great lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do we need evidence based policy making and can these kind of books help?","review":"This book provides a good case of using data analysis to shake common \\"wisdom\\". To put it in other words, like it or not, this is yet another example of hard evidence based analysis which may be considered a panacea against 'expert opinions' (especially about parenting!), empty-headed political speeches, etc. Even though the authors are highly criticized for their next book (and I don't think I'll spend time to read Superfreakonomics) I'll sincerely recommend this book to lots of my friends.PS: No, of course I won't let my child go and play at a house in which the parents have a handgun or a rifle no matter what authors tell about the bigger dangers of swimming pools. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Freakonomics is a whirlwind tour of the unexpected. It definitely changed a few of my preconceived notions of a few things (Drug Dealers especially). As a result, I started seeing things more as a function of economy than people's will. It's a fun read, one caveat may be that the authors skim the concept of correlation vs. causality. They really gloss over it in the Roe v. Wade chapter. All things considered, it was a light read, I really enjoy Malcolm Gladwell books, and this was in the same vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"Lots of fascinating ideas in the book. Not everything in here is 100% convincing, but I highly recommend reading it, especially with a critical mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"AS an economist, this book really changed the way I look at things... I just love it.. If you're not an economist, you'll understand it and enjoy it!! It's simply great!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I read this book about 3 years ago and came across it again when unpacking a box. I decided to re-read the book. This book is very entertaining. If you are looking for a deep content driven book on economics and theories, look elsewhere. There are a lot of non-sequitar fallacies in this book. Example, Bob likes cats and is a Giants fan. Therefore, all people who like cats are Giants fans. The book is more of an entertainment read. The authors are two highly touted, award-winning economists who reach certain theories based on non-traditional thinking and not empirical data. Read with an open mind and you will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overrated","review":"While this book has some interesting bits, it certainly does not explore \\"The Hidden Side of Everything\\". What it does do is compile a number of different, unconnected essays about certain trends in society--some of which are very interesting and some of which are fairly obvious. The essays are split into chapters, each of which is preceeded by a blurb about how great one of the authors (Levitt) is, which is very annoying (it almost seems as though the authors are trying to convince you that the book is great by repeatedly telling you that Levitt is Brilliant). The book is also very, very short. I finished it in about three hours. These essays would be more appropriate in a weekend newspaper series rather than in book form.If you want to read a book about how the world currently works--both in macro and micro form--and where it's going, I suggest The World is Flat. That book is engaging from page one, absolutely fascinating and totally relevant for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-Provoking!","review":"I am a big fan of educating myself on economics. Dubner and Levitt really lay out some hard concepts clearly. I especially liked the part about baby names and correlation with a child's chances of success."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, enterntaining book","review":"With Freakonomics, Levitt and Dubner have given us a new way to look at our world. This is a short book, about 200 pages, and reads very quickly. As each story gleaned from the data unfolds, you'll find yourself surprised, laughing, and reading passages aloud to someone else. It is like a treasure hunt, with little secrets unearthed that were there in plain sight much of the time. The authors have created a book that is both entertaining and educational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly Fascinating","review":"I used to think I was well-informed, but this book has opened my eyes. I also used to think I was a skeptic, but apparently I am not skeptical enough. I wish this book was four times thicker. The big lesson I learned: look at the data! People have all kinds of incentives to make you believe the things they say, but look at the info for yourself.This book is not dry or pendantic even though it is jam-packed with fact and definitely educational. I will read it again, and I am hoping they will write another book soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity to educate the reader.","review":"This book is an attempt to make statistics fun but it misses an opportunity to show us how. Instead the book presents a series of conclusions based upon work which isn't shown. I can understand the need to dumb down the story and present the tittilating conclusions in an effort to sell more books, but golly, did they have to put aside every effort to help educate the reader on how they reached their conclusions? Oddly, the book laments the fact that the general public is illiterate when it comes to statistical analysis and then proceeds to do nothing about it.If you wish to remain illiterate about statistics, but gain trivial information for your next cocktail party, go ahead and buy the book. But if you are a diligent reader of the New York Times, you will be disappointed to realize you paid $30 for a book whose content has already been published over the last 12 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"Excellent book Buy IT! I got this book and I am so entertained that i can not put this book down. Freakonomics is fun lively and honest to god truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonomics Not Just Economics","review":"This is an excellent book that brought out many perspectives on subjects that I thought I had made up my mind about years ago. I have had my eyes opened on many subjects covered in this book, and I have recommended it to all of my e-mail contacts and personal friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who thought an economics book can be a page turner","review":"This is one of the most interesting nonfiction work that I ever read. It looks at the fringe social topics with the clear analytical mind of an economist. It is not afraid to say that the conventional wisdom is overrated, but says it with grace, good humor and enough relevant anecdotes and evidence to keep us interested. It doesn't push any view onto anyone but allow us to explore this quirky and sometimes dangerous world from a safe yet accessible distance.

Based on the reviews, I was hoping to be wowed, and I was. As in \\"Wow, this book stinks\\". It read like the author thought he was unveiling some kind of economic revelation by tying two totally unrelated things together, but in the end I couldn't help thinking \\"Who cares?\\" Reading it was like being stuck at a cocktail party cornered by some know it all drunk.

Can it be true that a persons name determines what social class they belong to? or what contributes to a childs character in the future? Can it be the school he's going to or the friends he has?

Levitt offers some interesting ideas, but nothing ground-shaking and with little real supporting evidence...thus, he and Dubner seem to have padded it with a lot of needless speculation and rumination. Levitt is a smart guy (as the reader or listener is reminded, over and over), but the book is academically lazy.The problem is that the audiobook doesn't allow the listener to skip over the unnecessary bits (like the 30-minute hagiographic intro by Dubner - if you get the audiobook, you can bypass the first five tracks. Spoiler alert: It says Levitt's a genius!)With a bit more effort and a lot more editing, this could have been a splendid book...as it is, it's kind of like the \\"Chicken Soup For The Soul\\" of economics.

Why does this reasoning only work when applied to the U.S. and not other countries in the world? The drop in crime has more to do with distracting would be criminals by focusing them on silly consumer products and television shows.

This book is wrong in every sence of the word; If you believe the non-sence spewing from it's pages you should be ashamed of yourself.

I bought it after reading a very positive review in the Wall Street Journal. I am always interested in anything that explains how things really work as opposed to the conventional wisdom put forth on most topics that is usually nothing more than some pundit's ill-thought out opinion. For anyone with a strong background in analyzing data either in manufacturing, R&D, accounting, etc., and who has had their share of surprises over many years when the \`obvious' answer turned out to be dead wrong, this book will not be much of a revelation. The profanity, although modest in quantity, and presented as quotes, was unnecessary in a work with nominal scholarly aspirations. Unless you are very young or have no background in solving problems by generating and using data, this book is likely not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book had bad odor and was damaged - Seller is VERY misleading!","review":"The seller described the book to be in \\"Very Good\\" condition, but upon receiving the book, there were crayon scribbles on the book.

Yes, it's irrational to be afraid of your child being shot by a gun in your home when you have a swimming pool in the back yard. Yes, it's not comfortable to think that the rise in abortions has caused a lowering of the overall crime rate. But the numbers are not moral - they're just numbers.

Very interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity, of sorts..","review":"all this book is a collections of few examples each unrelated to other and theory by the author which he proves by using statistical methods. Which is not bad except the problems being discussed are social in nature or very subjective. I am not convinced any form of statistical analysis can actually prove such things with certainty. Thought provoking ? not for me as the authors seemed more eager to prove how there theory is so right and how they are so different in there thinking. It does seem more like vanity book than anything. more to it, the bonus material explains in details in full length how \\"different and brilliant\\" one of the author is. That is not the reason i want to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating, fun and interesting take on economics","review":"I always have remembered cringing at even hearing the sound of \\"economics\\", however, this book really opened my eyes that it's not just about money and numbers, it's about concepts.

Easily adaptable to much of the security industry and can be applied to security risk assessments. Sensible yet unique in truly quantifying risk.Behavioral economics should be applied to all risk planning and training as appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obviously Controversial","review":"When this book was published it generated a great deal of controversy, and it is easy to see why right off the bat. The authors begin their study of \\"rogue economics\\" with the assertion that studies prove a correlation between the legalization of abortion in 1973 and the decrease in crime in the 1990s. While this is not the only controversial topic Levett and Dubner discuss, it gives you a flavor of what the aim Freakonomics is. Dubner and Leverett have done an excellent job of taking dense academic studies and turning them into well written stories. Freakonomics has inspired a few imitators since its publication. It is easy to find issues with some of the assertions in the book, but that does not detract from the thought provoking nature of this book. That in itself makes this book well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Fun Contra Thinking","review":"I read this with my 14-year old son, and we both enjoyed it.

Levitt quotes himself (!) as saying, \\"unless maybe Dubner and I could do it together.\\" The result is a strange and ugly collaboration. There are a few interesting ideas (few because it's short and very leisurely paced), but they are not so much argued as revealed, interlarded with comments (by Dubner, one hopes) about how brilliant Levitt is.It's tedious, but more important, it subverts the theme of the book. Over and over they tell us not to believe experts, to think for ourselves, to look at the data. But the presentation is so superficial and the data so thin that no reader could reach the same conclusions thinking for herself. Instead, we just have one more expert telling us the others are wrong. How fresh and radical is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not even interesting","review":"I just finished reading this book last night. I thought it was terrible. If I wanted to read a bunch of cute anecdotes about random things, I could've read an issue of People Magazine--a peice of \\"literature\\" more worthy than this book.I found the only semi-interesting part to be the section about the grad student who lived with the gang. The analysis of the findings are intriguing, but not unexpected or surprising in the least.My main objection is that everything reads like unsubstantiated hearsay. I don't doubt that the economics professor is smart, has an interesting take on things and actually has research to back up his findings, but leaving it up to a journalist to do the writing just dooms a potentially interesting project like this one. In short, the book is dumbed down to an incredible degree. It suffers for that reason because it did not even make me think, \\"hmmm, that's interesting.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"pop economics lacking sound basis","review":"Read the reviews before buying book. Buy book if you like pop economics. The book is full of statistics that support the \\"story line\\" of Levitt in Dubner speak. Every statistic supports the flow. There is attempt to show cross correlation and distinguish between causal effect and correlation. If this book is to be taken seriously more attention needs to be paid to the soundness of the analysis. \\"Similar to TV ads reporting that 4/5 doctors recommend that...\\" Pop, goes the cash register.

Not a serious report but apparently highly lucrative by the number of weeks on the best seller list. Won't stand the test of time.

It contains about 10 pages of interesting information, the rest of it is twaddle. One other nauseating quality, the introduction to each chapter is basically a set of quotes saying what a genius Levitt is. Any rational person will doubt Levitt is a genius based on the garbage in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fascinating","review":"This is a book that I read very quickly as almost every chapter asked interesting questions. The most controversial connection is between abortion and the drop in crime rates. The access to the financials and principal cast of a drug dealing operation was profoundly fascinating.The questions asked are fearless and provocative and use basic economic incentive theory to explain connections.It was engrossing and intelligent.Several people,in their reviews, point out that there is little description of methodology and no comprehensive presentation of detailed results. We are asked to assume that rigorous statistical analysis has been done and that the conclusions are based on sound practices and methods. This is a fair criticism and people looking to pore over the results with a critical eye will be disappointed.The lack of statistical detail, while a little annoying, did not really affect my enjoyment of the book.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cocktail party fodder","review":"As the authors readily admit, there is not much of a theme in this book, except for, perhaps, 'question everything.'So the usefulness of the book is limited to cocktail party fodder. The challenge to commonly held beliefs can make a conversation more lively. The analytic tools Levitt uses are those that serve economists well, but are not accessible to most of us, intellectually or practically. We seldom have access to the kinds of data in the book or the statistical programs required to analyze the data.Fun reading, good conversation are the primary benefits from reading Freakonomics. Practical application either to business or to personal lives is limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluffy trivia","review":"While the book does have some interesting nuggets of information, it seems hastily written and sloppily put together. There seems to be no central thesis, other than \\"Things are not always what you'd expect them to be\\". Somehow, I'm underwhelmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Insight","review":"Levitt sheds light on the unsolved mysteries of the world today in his novel Freakonomics, and finds answers to these mysteries in unexpected places. For example, he attributes the decline in violent crime to Roe v. Wade, claiming that since mothers that could not support or were not ready to have children received abortions, there were less children likely to become criminals. Levitt's novel reveals that Economics is not a dull subject, but one that, with good data, can explain the reality of how the world works, and what drives most people. He offers a new way of thinking which is both stimulating and provocative. Although the topics he explores seem unrelated, they are unified by his main idea that people must find new ways of thinking to understand the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"normally not my cup of tea!","review":"I think of myself as more \\"literary\\" (I was an English major!) but I was curious about this book after reading the excerpt in the New York Times magazine.

(Very light on actual facts and data and data analysis.) Would have been more appropriate for a series of articles in Newsweek or Time (or People).Barely interesting suppositions, sometimes poor analysis, especially on the \\"guns versus swimming pools\\" argument. (His argument, unstated, depends on a false non-multiple guns per home assumption and the assumption that kids visit homes with guns as often as they do homes with pools.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not about economics","review":"The book is interesting, even fun, but most of it has nothing to do with economics. I don't get the title or the supposed connection to economics. It's sort of an interesting, logic-based trivia book.

The authors do a tremendous job in making economic theory accessible and even fascinating. From the unintended benefits of Roe v.Wade to the lack of correlation between a name and success to why your realtor may have far less incentive than you think to try to get you the best price for your home, this book makes you think about everyday life in a brand new way. I hope this economist keeps asking and answering the questions nobody else seems to ask. I wish the book had been longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and thought-provoking","review":"Few books really give you something new to ponder; this one does on almost every page. Only drawback is the cutesy comments by the NY Times guy scattered around the pages; I hope Mr. Levitt will do his next book by himself.

Levitt is original and iconoclastic and not afraid if his data offends the politically correct Left or the religious Right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentally flawed","review":"The 2003 assertion --regurgitated in this new book -- that Roe vs. Wade is behind a drop in *violent* crime. The real reason violent crime dropped is because the overall prison population DOUBLED since Reagan. Largely do to the \\"war on drugs\\" taking even minor offenders off the streets. And also due to Rudy Giuliani-esque crackdown on the \\"broken window\\" syndrome of no tolerance for early crimes, before they fester into more serious crimes.So, just those two or three facts above altogether explain the REAL drop in violent crimes.Roe vs Wade has not reduced the birthrates of poverty-stricken kids. The pseudo-progressive unGreat Society safety net programs instead enabled more poverty, more single mothers, and more poor kids -- but not necessarily more violence.

We can look at much in the world and wonder why, where, and what for. I certainly blows the doors off of several issues and ideas that many folks seemed to take for granted. I found this information and the conclusions drawn in this book very enlightening and useful.

I could not put it down and finished it in a couple of days. Even if one does not necessarily agree with or like the conclusions of the authors, the content is interesting and thought provoking. The text is clear and easy to understand for the lay person and the chapters can be read in no particular order, making it easy to jump in and out of (say for bedside reading or to keep in the car).I also recommend \\"The Tipping Point\\" and \\"Monkeyluv.\\" Yes, \\"Monkeyluv\\" has an odd name but is fascinating as well. it has interesting explanations for why we do what we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awaiting Steven's next book!","review":"I would never read a book on economics........or so I thought! The name and short review attracted me like a magnet.

It could also apply to ordinary aspects of daily life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Based on all the great reviews on amazon my expectations were quite high. Unfortunately having just finished the book, I can only conclude to be very disappointed. I am not going to describe details of the book since plenty of other readers have already done so. On a general level however, I have to say that a lot of the supposably stunning theories are not only rather dull but seem to be quite challengable. Without actually thinking too hard you can find a lot of weaknesses in the way Levitt argues that are not even remotely addressed by the data he provides. Bottom line, in my eyes the book is highly overrated and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dummy downed","review":"Any book that starts out every chapter by profusely praising the writer has to be a little worrisome.Nevertheless, I read it hoping for some new insights. None came. It could have been so much more interesting if I could have learned the methods by which he came to his conclusions, or if the conclusions themselves were not such dumb one-liners.It's obvious that one can make numbers reflect what one wants them to reflect.

Almost all of the questions grabbed me, and compelled me to keep reading, and I found this to be a very refreshing read, with some very controversial, and interesting topics addressed. This is a must read for any avid fan of non-fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprising Interesting Read","review":"I was skeptical when I first started to read Freakonomics - an economics book that is interesting? Much to my surprise, I really enjoyed every page of this book. The author's unique outlook on various issue is very thought provoking.

I have recommended this book to several of my friends and they have all enjoyed it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and Highly Readable","review":"I avoided reading Freakonomics because I thought I had little interest in math or economics. After two family members raved about it I finally decided to give it a shot and it hooked me in the first chapter. Simply put, this book amazed me.

I never knew that statistics and economics could be so exciting. Freakonomics is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"an eye-opener and interesting book","review":"Freakonomics was a very witty and humorous book.

I hope they will read a real book on these topics. I found hype. You have to admire a book where one author begins each chapter with a blurb about how the other is a genius.Sample revelations:\\"Drug dealers live with their mothers because they don't make enough money\\"..actual evidence presented is that bottom (4th) layer doesn't..the top 2 layers make $100 to $500K which is not bad.\\"Sumo wrestlers cheat\\" evidently those who are desperate to win tend to beat those to whom the match is meaningless. What a surprise.\\"Crime dropped due to increase in abortions after Roe v. Wade\\" Wonderfully controversial assertion based on no real evidence. Sold the book though. More police and more jail-time did it.And so on..Second half of the book descends into meandering presentations since they ran out of cutesy stuff.My fear is that this character really is a respected economist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakonomics Rev Ed CD: A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything","review":"Funny and interesting way of looking at economics.

But it actually connected together. What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a great deal of complexity and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and--if the right questions are asked--is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, albeit a short one","review":"Enjoyed the book immensely, one of those few books which opens your eyes to the world around you in a new and refreshing way. Some of the content is controversial to say the least - but when put in such a fashion as it is presented it makes sense in a skewed logical kind of way.My only reservation is the length of the book itself. Just when I was really taken in by the authors cunning use of economical analysis the book came to an abrupt end. I was even somewhat annoyed by finding the epilogue half-way through the book (in physical terms) only for the remainder to be filled with extracts from various other publications commenting on the author and the book itself. Kinda silly me thinks.That being said I am looking forward to Freakonomics 2. I've heard rumours of a documented system of economy amongst monkeys. This will be big!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not So Freaky","review":"As the author promises in the introduction, this is really not a book about economics. It is a stimulating and interesting investigation of root causes of certain human behavior that collectively effects, even creates not only economic but political trends as well. Some of the topics and chapters seem unrelated and there is no clear theme to the book, but that really does not diminish the readability.I was really turned off by the countless excerpts taken from various reviews emphasizing the genius of the author(s), sprinkled all through the book. What was the purpose?True to the prevalent American academic approach to most topics of scholarly interest, the obsessive quantification of any phenomena, the authors take and quantify even the most mundane aspects of human behavior. There are interesting results; few meaningful, some questionable, many redundant, but still makes amusing reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book because of the 'hype' surrounding it.This book has no point, has been dumbed down for the uneducated reader and doesn't spend any time on the details of the economic analysis.It's ironic that a book that advocates questioning conventional wisdom, that I bought because of this very 'wisdom', was so terrible.Serves me right I guess. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Enjoyed most of the book, skipped over the parenting part as I plan to never be a parent and it bored me.

Some arguments were more convincing than others; I wish Levitt and Dubner were more humble in stating the conclusions, or at least surmising the possible existence of other explanations however unlikely they might seem.Statisticians use a \\"so called\\" p-value - in layman's terms: \\"what is the probability that our conclusion is wrong?\\" I wish Levitt and Dubner gave at least an overview of this rudimentary concept instead of redundant reiterations of \\"numbers don't lie.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Code of the non-fiction world","review":"If you have any semblance of a brain, do not read this book (actually, you won't manage to get through it, in all likelihood), and certainly do not purchase it.

At the turn of the 20th Century, such a lapse in thinking was excusable; at the turn of the 21st Century, it is poor science. The authors of this book commit the freakonomic fallacy at every turn: going beyond the data just to make a controversial point (to sell books, one assumes). To borrow from Ghostbusters: \\"Their theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, their methods are sloppy, and their conclusions are highly questionable. They are poor scientists!\\"But I suppose the kids, and the credulous, love them. Read at your own risk.

The Roe v. Wade argument, for example. Might be true, but there isn't much here to back it up.Then there is the swimming-pool vs guns argument, where the author states \\"Meanwhile, there is 1 child killed by a gun for every 1 million-plus guns.\\"This only holds true for accidental deaths. If one includes suicides and homicides amongst the under 20 crowd the numbers change dramatically from less than 200 to over 3000, and one finds that pools are indeed safer to have around than guns.

However, simply tackling a 'controversial' subject (i.e. abortion and crime rates) does not make the conclusions that much more startling, when, in fact, any decent sociologist could take apart these arguments in an academic setting.Most of the book seems to be a testament to the authors' intelligence. After reading the book, I just can't genuflect.They do properly give credit to the researchers who have done interesting work. Its just not either of them.Arrogant"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take your ego out of your writing!","review":"This book could have been better if not for the constant yammering about how much smarter the young author was than everyone else. Every chapter opened with some sort of praise for his intelligence and groundbreaking work.Don't get me wrong, I think it had some interesting correlations and theories, but I also felt like I didn't come away with anything. Every time someone talks about this being an economics book I want to point out you learn nothing about economics. You learn about a bunch of very specific theories (although some have been written about since this book was published like the point about a pool being more dangerous than a gun.)It's clear this book was written to appeal to the largest audience possible.

How disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hype than Content","review":"As an avid reader or economics I thought I was in for a treat with Freakonomics. But it was 10 cents worth of idea blown into $15. The section on names was quite boring and I couldn't wait for it to be over.

Or even a non-intelligent person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what everyone else was talking about","review":"Anyone seen the South Park episode on smug?

This author has no credibility any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meaningless!","review":"This book is chalk full of meaningless information. Let me get this straight, the author actually believes people will deceive you at sometime in your life. WOW! What a revelation. I cannot see how this information is new to anybody. Sure they had a FEW things outside of the normal thought pattern. Yet this book was more on \\"Hey look at how smart I AM and how DUMB everybody else is\\". Not even worth it if somebody gave you the book to read and you had nothing better to do!DUMBEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and fun","review":"This book is a fun and easy read that stays with the reader. That's a nice and rare combination of ingredients. Levitt applies clear-eyed economic theory to social situations--for example, how much difference does good parenting make--with surprising results. He challenges us to ask meaningful questions and to see things not only as we wish they were, but as they really are. As Levitt freely admits, the book is a hodgepodge of different topics without a clear theme. But that's part of what makes it easy to pick up and set down without getting lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too light on the science","review":"I consider myself a layperson interested in science, but I do have a reasonable background in statistics. This book may be interesting to people completely new to that field, but if you have studied anything similar, I'd recommend you skip this book. Here's a simple test: do you know what a regression analysis is? If not, buy; if yes, don't.Many of the ideas presented here are not particularly surprising. There's a huge section claiming that houses with swimming pools are more dangerous to children than houses with guns. That may raise your eyebrows, but it's certainly not a secret that children, left unsupervised, can drown in swimming pools. That's why hotel pools are locked at night, and why during the day, they are often staffed by people called \\"lifeguards\\".I also found it rather bizarre that each chapter is prefaced with an excerpt heaping praise upon one of the authors, including one that describes, heaven help us all, his modesty. TA-cky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forces you to keep an open mind","review":"While much of the data and opinion presented in the book may be upsetting, or as the author sometimes puts it, \\"distasteful,\\" Freakonomics forces the reader to look at many aspects of life in a completely different light. It seperates emotion, opinion, and prejudices from information that cannot be skewed: numbers. Even for those who have little or no background in economics or statistics, the authors use plain english to explain data and scientific reasoning related to the causes and effects of abortion, crime, the economy, and socioeconomic factors of the development of a child, to name a few. Just remember to set your personal opinions and feelings aside as you learn the uncomforting truths about a few of the \\"problems\\" prevalent in contemporary American Society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for all lazy thinkers","review":"Although the book professes to have no theme, the message I came away with was clear - people are very poor at inferring cause and effect, and so-called experts are biased by their own agenda, which leads to \\"common knowledge\\" which is faulty. If you apply good rigour to your critical thinking (along with a strong dose of data) you can become more effective at discovering root causes, and so a more effective decision maker.Not that this is a great insight; I have thought this for years, and have admired other thinkers who are able to escape the gravitational pull of common knowledge. However, the book is stuffed with examples (some good, others not-so-good) that illustrate time and again how we arrive at faulty conclusions, which Levitt methodically cleans up for us.A must read if you want to sharpen your intellect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking teaser!","review":"While I agree with some of the previous reviewers that more detail would have been enjoyable, I take exception to that being the reason for lowering their rating of the book. I mean, c'mon, the book (including bibliography and index) is less than 250 pages long - how much detail did you expect? I believe the authors' intent was to awaken the curiosity of people who accept \\"conventional wisdom\\" as the last word on social issues and I think they did a marvelous job of it. As a \\"question everything\\" advocate, I found the book entertaining and I look forward to tracking down some of the papers and books referenced so that I can make my own determinations. In short, it's a quick, witty and interesting read - go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting read","review":"I never thought I'd read a book about economics and be unable to put it down. This book was very enlightening and put in such a way that I was entertained while the light bulbs were going off over my head.

It has enabled us to think a bit more while shopping (most expensive is not always the best). It is a very interesting read and quite an eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun and Insight into the Machinery of Economics","review":"I really enjoyed this book as a light, enjoyable exercize in seeing how an economist views the world, and aside from the entertaining aspect, frankly, I think it's critical to personal economic security to have some understanding of this type of material. Viewing the world in simple terms of incentives and being able to follow wherever reason leads is really a useful skill, and this book illustrates it wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Brain Candy","review":"Books on economic theories and trends have never been on the top of my \\"to read\\" list because they seemed rather dry and academic. Mr. Leavitt has made me change my mind! Economics can be fascinating, especially when imbued with Mr. Leavitt's non-traditional take on how things work. His seemingly off-the-wall comparisons (who would ever thought to compare teachers and sumo wrestlers to illustrate a point?) really do make sense and they definitely are attention grabbers. Mr. Leavitt's training in academic economics, his research and review of the literature make up the informative core of the book and Mr. Dubner's agility with the written word make this a very reader-friendly look at economic principles that are part of what make our world work. Lots of answers and surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun., thought-provoking read","review":"The book raise some really interesting and intriguing theories (e.g., abortion rate vs crime rate) and makes you think about things differently. Although written by an economist, it's not dry at all, and the frequent stories/examples add to its accessibility.While avoiding detailed description of the methodology used keeps it reader-friendly, I think that's one potential drawback of the book - with minimal back-up as to why certain correlations are statistically valid, trained economists/statisticians may not support his findings.Of course, this book seems more tailored to the general public anyway, so that may not be a concern. In any case, it was a very interesting read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Hyped","review":"Obviously the book has generated enormous buzz, but as other commentators have noted:a) it's a pumped up articleb) it self-admittedly has no central themec) correlation does not equal causationTo point (c), there's a certain amount of \\"epater les conservatives\\" by correlating the decline in crime in the 1990s to the rise in abortions in the 1970s.The disappointment of this book is that the method behind it is very intriguing, and I hope that the authors will produce a substantive book in the future applying his economic model to the serious questions behind crime, urban investment, and other issues that this current piece touches on.Not worth buying, particularly when you can read it at the library in about two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"It was with great expectations that I bought this book -- planning to read it over a long needed vacation. But when I got to the section on Real Estate agents, I was blown away by the author's complete disregard and over generalization of the real estate profession and his total lack of understanding of the complexity real estate business. (Note: I am not a real estate agent, though I have been involved in many real estate tranactions).Given his simplistic analysis on this subject, one has to question the veracity of his research throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the economics profession evaluates the authors","review":"\\"... In some quarters of our profession, the level of discussion has sunk to the level of a New Yorker article: coffee-table articles about \\"cute\\" topics, papers using \\"clever\\" instruments. The authors of these papers are usually unclear about the economic questions they address, the data used to support their conclusions and the econometrics used to justify their estimates. This is a sad development that I hope is a passing fad. Most of this work is without substance, but it makes a short-lived splash and it's easy to do. Many young economists are going for the cute and the clever at the expense of working on hard and important foundational problems.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, uninspiring - better books around","review":"This book is a very-easy-to-read disjointed sequence of some anecdotical commentary based on statistical analysis to prove \\"interesting\\" causes for everyday facts. Although the original idea is compelling, the book drivels on unispiring and uninsightful peripheral discussion.The theme of using the power of statistical analysis to find the probable causes of societal events, like the decrease or increase in murder rate, has been much better explored by authors like John Allen Paulos.To make matters worse, the author attempts to use very basic language to appeal to the mass audience. Although this meakes it easy read, it also trivialises the topic - there is a very strong sense of political correctness throughout as well.Overall, this book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Starting Point for Discussion","review":"Steven D. Levitt's book is worth the read for the discussions it can start if you start quoting it to friends and family. Agree or disagree, it sparks a good argument. I give it four stars for making economic methods interesting, a feat no one thought possible, but won't give it five because Levitt &Co. don't apply them with rigor. Its less than scientific, but very provocative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"A friend bought me this book for graduation, and I wasn't sure of what to expect. I actually cracked open and started reading, and I couldn't put it down. The stories are amazing, the economics are interesting, all of it made sense in perfect english.

Many times while reading this, I thought \\"Man, this book is AWESOME!\\" Pick it up and you won't be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know that","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. The way Levitt uses information to come up with conclusions is a real good example of how we can use data to try to figure out some things in this world. Its not too long and you can finish it in a weekend. If you liked this book I would also recommend The World Is Flat by Thomas Friedman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!!","review":"This book was much easier to read than I expected. One co-author, Stephen Dubner, seems to have a real gift of explaining difficult concepts and describing them so that they seem almost obvious. The subject and other co-author of the book, Steven Levitt, is able to approach, analyze and justify his analyses on very controversial concepts pertaining to abortion and society, racial and cultural effects on an individual, effectiveness of the Head Start program, and cheating patterns in institutions. I was very embarrassed that some of my \\"well reasoned\\" opinions on the causes and effects of some social issues were proven dead wrong by very convincing and well-scrubbed mathematics. I was very impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, Easy Reading","review":"I bought this book on a mere whim, simply seeing that it was a bestseller and that some of the things it talked about comparing were quite interesting (crack gangs in Chicago and McDonalds corporate structure, or the likelihood of cheating between Sumo wrestlers and school teachers). I enjoyed reading it, and was also fortunate enough to meet the authors at a book signing. They also write a monthly column in the NEW YORK MAGAZINE. Also, in a bit of irony, this turns out to be one of the required texts for my Micro-Econ Theory class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cause and effect revisited","review":"Most of science looks at correlation to find relationships between events. This implies but does not prove causation. This has caused many critical mistakes throught history.

Open your mind and enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book explaining weird ecos","review":"It's a great book that explains wacky things happening from economic point of view/reasons. i first thought it would make me sleep reading another economic book, instead i finished it in one go (and gave me major headache the next day from too much reading).

Great for gifts and a must for book lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick read","review":"Well written with the exception of several \\"F\\" bombs. This book gets you to look at things from the angle you don't even realize is there. I can't wait to read \\"Super Freakonomics\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, disappointing.","review":"The content of this book is similar to that of a Malcolm Gladwell book, though Gladwell writes in much more intelligent and thoughtful style. Freakonomics suffers from an excessively dumbed down \\"Gee Whizz\\" style as well as what appears to be a strong streak of ego or vanity on the part of Levitt (or possibly this is due to bad marketing advice from the book editors) in both the tone of the personal asides in the book and the odd self-promoting quotations from the same single NYTimes puff piece about Levitt literally at the front of every chapter.There are some interesting economics insights in the book, but I would really recommend \\"The Undercover Economist\\" by Tim Harford instead if you want to read a book about the economics of everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique but...","review":"I know this won't seem overly helpful, but this book was lacking something. Ok book, wouldn't read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few Freakanomics stories","review":"Some of my favorite stories from this book: \\"If crack dealers are so wealthy, why do they live with their Moms?\\"; \\"Why is your neighbor's swimming pool 100 times more dangerous than his Colt 45.\\"; and \\"Does having a 'black name' make is harder to succeed?\\" (surprisingly, it appears not.)Yes, it's funny, and yes, some of it misuses statistical analysis. But there's also some legitimately interesting research on subjects that most academics consider too mundane for thier taste: the fianncial statements and business plans of an illegal drug cartel (a subject not covered in many academic journals), or the correlation between legalized abortion and crime rate declines.Good book, both for laymen who just want a good read, and for academics who need to remember the real world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popular for a reason","review":"This book takes information you have thought to be fact for years and blows the lid off of it.

Great gift as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open your eyes to a whole new world!","review":"Levitt and Dubner really challenge conventional wisdom.It will open your eyes to how easily people just except things as fact without ever questioning the data behind them.

It's not that it skims the surface, the surface that it skims is not Economics but Sociology, Human Geography, Politics, Statistics, anything other than economic theory.

It stimulates your mind to think and ask questions about how our society is structured, and why people make the decisions that they do. This alone makes the book worth a read, for being stimulated to think by an entertaining read is about the most fun you can have without getting bacon grease everywhere.However, and I do not have the credentials to back this up, it does at times somewhat strain belief. Take that for what you will.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low information content","review":"There is for sure intersting stuff in here. The authors describe in lay words very detailed academic studies and highlight their most controversial conclusions. Without doubt, the studies have been cherry picked by how controversial their conclusions are. But there's sooo much text around it. Does the reader need 20-ish rankings of first names? Does the reader need to read an amazingly boring history of the KKK, or of some gang in Chicago? Or 100 or so real estate stories? I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I won't make any allusions about being a good economics read. I'm not an economist! It was fun and believable. It would be good if they supplied references to their papers so you can view the facts yourself (and be overwhelmed). It was a collection of different \\"rogue\\" essays. All very entertaining and a quick read. I was disappointed that they ran out.

Wade helped reduce the number of unwanted children who typically commit violent crimes, therefore justifying the millions of aborted babies. What?Levitt really lost me when he argued that parenting methods don't really matter much. He fails to see any correlation that the latchkey kids from the go-go 80's recognized they didn't want to repeat that empty materialism lifestyle. He didn't recognize the importance of having two parents that raise the children, especially fathers that stick around for the long haul. These latchkey kids are now creating families with a dad, a stay-at-home mom, and kids.This short book proves anyone can produce hype and a product to sell, I'd skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopefully it makes one think...","review":"...because if you take the statements in this book as truth you will be a victim of liberal bias. This book is a reporter's and professor's way of making a buck, and it should be read with a healthy level of sarcasm.While some of the correlations noted are interesting, there is no mention of the statistical predictive power of the variables being discussed, or of variables that were tossed out because they did not influence the result: was it the legalization of abortion that resulted in a decline in violent crime, as the authors assert, or was it the widespread availability of The Pill and prophylactic contraceptives?It's an interesting book, with many cocktail party tidbits, but the \\"answers\\" are merely uncorroborated correlations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"The author rambled through stories ranging from the Ku Klux Klan to Ted Kisenski without explaining what they had to do with economics.

Anyone with a passing interest in economics will find it mildly interesting at best. With the exception of the causal analysis of crime, the book is a bore.It's too bad. The cover says to be prepared to be dazzled. I was and I wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"We assume we know so much! I was inspired to look at the world a bit differently.","review":"I could relate to the concept of this book, that things are not as they truly seem at times. We assume so much in this world, but our views are often limiting, getting us by just so we can accomplish what needs to be done, but keeping us from the mechanisms at work. If we ask the right questions, maybe we can make things work a whole lot better. If you like to people watch, if you like logic, if you strive to get to the bottom of things to reveal the raw truth, you will probably enjoy this book. I was surprised over and over again as the writers found new ways to look at the data and dig in. I was inspired to look at the world around me a bit differently, for the sake of the truth, efficiency and maybe even greater happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freak and flaw economics","review":"The author is conceited but the book is a blunder.

I quickly realized what I was in for when early in the book when the authors gave their background as Harvard Jews and profiled a guy that infiltrated the KKK for the ADL. The story sounds at least partially made up.It then jumped into predictable white guilt inducing trash and goes into mental contortions using \\"data\\" and sociological explanations for black criminality and low IQ scores. The writers of this book are also obsessively pro-Abortion. The only surprise was they used statistics to show you are much more likely to die from an automobile or a swimming pool than a gun. This book would probably appeal to upper middle class liberals who like to consider themselves clever and politically astute from their isolated armchairs. For me Freakonomics was a big load of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorougly entertaining, yet enlightening","review":"This guy is a card. He brings economics down to a level that makes me want to read about it. Never in a million years would I want to read about economics, however I would buy another book written by him again in a heartbeat. What he talks about makes sense, in a way I would never consider in a million years, but makes me think, \\"why didn't I think of that?\\" A must read for new points of view on everything from real estate agents to the crack industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent & Quick Read","review":"When Freakonomics was recommended to me by a friend, I figured it would be a dry read about the dismal state of today's economy.

Initially I found the technique entertaining. By the end of the article, oops I mean book, the technique wears thin. So thin in fact that in examining the name game the whole thing just sort of peters out. They don't have a clue as to what's behind a parents name choice for their child (that is, an ethnic parent). They try to draw some correlation between the name and future expectations, but of course cannot because they don't know enough about the subject. They are caught up in their own little world looking to unrelated data to find an answer rather than going out and doing the hard investigative grunt work needed to explore the subject.

We had all heard the theories advanced before of improved police etc. Steven Levitt gives us a different rationale that will surprise the reader. The unintended consequences of many actions are explored; such as rewarding higher test scores in education. This book is an easy read with short sections examining various aspects of society/life with a view to what are the real drivers.

Hibernate In Action explains the basic workings of Hibernate with examples, detailed instructions for using it, how to deal with concurrency and transactions, efficiently retrieving objects, caching, and much more.

It leads a reader thro insights on how a persistence layer truly needs to be designed and perform when encountered with a foray of relational databases and the Object-Oriented Java programming language. I have been used to EJBs for many years and Hibernate has been a welcome change. The book explains how easily a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) can be extended to a transactional class. There's clarity, simplicity and ground-up coverage of the persistence layer - Hibernate. I am recommending the use of Hibernate in my work place, and this book has influenced the decision. I am glad Sun Microsystems' EJB 3.0 specification leverages on Hibernate."},{"rating":"1","title":"very good book. title a bit off","review":"This is a really good buy and I would still buy it. So why give it two stars. Because I am anal. I really like to do stuff \\"in action\\" and this book doesn't provide source code that you can just go and execute. They refer you to the caveatemptor application on the web which doesn't have any of the examples that demonstrate bad practices. I pretty much had to do a lot of trial and error setting up my database and then writing the app(that demonstrated a bad practice) from the text in the book to really gain that understanding of the bad practices.This book is great for people who already understand hibernate and probably don't need to try those examples, but this was my first time using any ORM. I would kill for the source code demonstrating every example in this book.Keep in mind I still got alot out of this book. Just required more effort on my part then alot of books that come with source code."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great disappointment","review":"May be this book is good in explaining the concept. But when we want to learn a new technology, first thing the learner is looking for is to run a \\"HELLO WORLD\\" type of program.In order to run my first program I had to go thru hell to run it. My advice it if you want to learn HIBERNATE for the first time this is not the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coverage of the conceptual issues","review":"This book clearly reviews the quite difficult conceptual issues required to build and use Hibernate and ORMs in general. It is not a shallow cook book, but reviews the subtle and important issues that are often overlooked. One of the best computer science books.(Bias Note: I have written the competing SimpleORM.org, which I think is cleaner than Hibernate. So I know and care about the conceptual issues. And I was was flattered to be quoted in their Preface.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concepts, Worthless index, Questionable technology","review":"The authors do a fine job explaining the concepts behind object relational mapping in general and Hibernate in particular. Too bad the book is absolutely crippled by its index. For instance, there is no entry for \\"discriminator\\" (or anything close to that), so to go back to that section where I positively recall reading about this term, I have to browse the whole book. Ridiculous. Furthermore, the following statement by the authors themselves throws this entire technology into question: \\"Retrieving persistent objects from the database is one of the most interesting (and complex) parts of working with Hibernate.\\" If this is so complex, than the Java community has been sold a bill of goods, and its no wonder the exodus to Ruby is gaining momentum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment, they all cheat readers","review":"After having spent on useless Professional Hibernate, I bought this book in greater anticipation, atleast to get clear understanding on Associations, which always have been a big headache in Hibernate.I wonder what these Authors think about readers who look for books that could help them to learn new technologies. Instead of merely coping what is available in hibernate.org, (of course they did change object/class names wonderfully), they should give us WORKING examples.One has to scratch his head just to get things work.Honestly, this book discusses some of best strategies one has to follow while persisting important data. But main topic has been explained in IDIOTIC manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book to start up hibernate","review":"I like it because it is only around 400 pages. It does not blindly copy-and-paste information you can find on the web sites. The introduction chapter summarize the paradigm mismatch of ORM and how hibernate is trying to solve, which is also an interesting start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Good","review":"In an age where many technical books are full of typos if not outright misinformation, Hibernate in Action stands out as very well written. It seems that spell-checking has replaced editing for many technical books. This book is not only informational, but easy to comprehend.The only down side to this book is that it is now somewhat dated in that it does not cover the current release of Hibernate. Nothing on annotations, etc. However, this book is not merely \\"The Professional Learn Framework X Bible in 23 Days\\" API memorization aide. Hibernate in Action provides you with the theory of why to use an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework and how to best leverage this knowledge. This information is not Hibernate specific and does not lose value with the inevitable new release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Hibernate Quickly is a well-written introduction to this O/R tool. The book is an excellent resource for the developer who is getting acquainted with Hibernate. The examples provided in the book help the reader to understand the concepts. I especially like the explanation of mapping, something that can be confusing to someone new to Hibernate. The book also covers using Hibernate with Struts, XDocket, Spring, and Tapestry.

Before getting this case I had spent $3 for a small easel upon which I place the Archos 604. It served me a lot better. I was able to view the moniter at a slant and raised a few inches off the table top. Plus if I had to use the plug to power the unit the space under the easel better accomodated it.

That would include Angels, Devas, Nature spirits, what have you, along with demons and devils. While I would agree that we do indeed, for the most part create our own demons, metaphorically speaking anyway, it is arrogant to essentially say we (that of the physical world) are the only entities in existance, and that there are no other intelligences outside our dense vibration.
