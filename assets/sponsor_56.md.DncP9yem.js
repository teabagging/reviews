It took so long I gave up. I was able to cut faster with my hand saw. I tried two more times with the same result. Even if it did work, I wouldn't have been able to put up with the vibration.I had trouble attaching the blade, so I laid the saw down on a table and shone a flashlight in the opening so I could see what I was doing. I had no trouble attaching the blade after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typcial Homeowner -","review":"I am a typical homeowner that would like to do a few small projects and does not want to own alot of tools. This tool appeared to be a perfect one for me. Based on my research, I truly felt prior to buying this that I would be able to do a greater number of small projects around the house and do them quickly. The tool is a good weight and the blades are extra large. Nice.But... I spent two hours and could not get the blades to attach to the saw. I even took the saw to the Home Depot tool department and they as well could not attach the blades. My rating of one star is because I was not able to use the product due to the blade design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned to manufacturer","review":"The saw does work great, however after inserting the blade into the mechanism effortlessly a couple of times and using it, something must have broke and the blade would no longer lock into place.

Very very poor design, not worth the bother even though the saw cuts great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker Power Handsaw slow cutting.","review":"I purchased the Black and Decker power hand saw to cut up dead limbs and do some light prunning.

Gloves and eye protection and it cut small trees like butter- I am a 120 lb. woman (single mom) and had a blast with it! Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy- but don't get this!

This replaces my ownership of a chainsaw, and it is much LESS maintenance and adjustments than owning a chainsaw. Great for cutting small branches and hedges. If you have an occassional 5-inch branch to cut, it will take longer, but this thing can do it. The blade is lower maintenance and hassle than a chain. You don't sharpen the blade; just change it.

The new updated PHS550B, type 2, has a larger head to mount the saw blade. The old model PHS550, type 1, really work great and will order the head for the old one when they are taken off back order. My wife can use it also, the handle is still a little large for a woman to use, but she likes it better than the old circular saw that was real heavy. It makes a nice cut and there is no saw dust thrown back in your face. The blade makes a clean straight cut even at the end and the blade also can be started in the middle of the board,. it will pierce through plywood in the middle of a long cut so you can go from both direction. Great all around tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"handy little sucker","review":"I read the reviews then decided on this saw. I couldn't be happier!! As soon as I got it, i popped the blade on and went out and trimmed my trees. The saw easily cut through several 5 inch in diameter tree limbs without difficulty, then I used it again to trim all the limbs down. I also used it to cut down some larger brush areas.I read the directions carefully on how to put the saw blade in, and I dont think it explained it well, but when I figured it out, it seemed so easy in retrospect! I did buy the extra saw blades due to others saying they had issues finding them, but truly, I am so pleased with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy","review":"This saw has proven very handy for me.

It does not tip over easily and works well on all types of surfaces. It took my about 5 minutes to assemble. I like these kind of toys because they inspire imaginative play, unlike more commercial toys which only function for a certain age/gender. With this, we play grocery store or shopping and I can teach my 6 year old about money and quiz him on how to make change in a play environment--he gets to learn by playing.I would encourage to also get a cash register to go along with it and your own play food.

I think the open area is dangerous for small children for that reason. It doesn't feel quite as durable as the older model. We plan to return it and buy the old model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shopping Cart tips over way too easy","review":"I bought this item for my grandchild who is 2 and she has mostly enjoyed pushing it around. I have been disappointed with the fact that it tips over so easy. The front part of the basket sticks out way beyond the wheels on the bottom and when she leans over to get something out of the basket, it tips and she falls. I hope that little Tikes will make the changes necessary to make the shopping cart safer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Engineering, Wheel covers will not stay on","review":"Do they not assembly these at the factory and test the tolerances for themselves? I assembled per the instructions and when my two year old gave it a test drive, the blue wheel covers fell off. If the good folks at Little Tikes want to save a little money on manufacturing and not create some sort of tab fasteners and use a friction fit instead, at least get the tolerances right. This was the one part that required just a little engineering and they just blew it. I can't tell you how disappointed the wife and I are at the low quality from such an established brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"I bought the older version of this cart for my 6 year old when she was 2 and my 19 month old has been playing with it since she could toddle behind it. It has held up really well being little tyke. Such a simple toy yet it has been enjoyed by every child who has been around our house. My kids pile everything under the sun in it and have a blast. It has been everything from a stroller to a race car. A wonderful way to spend $25, especially if you know it will be used for several kids or generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute!!","review":"My daughter received this for Christmas from Santa and she loves it.

It is like new five years later. So when my nephew just turned one I figured my son had so much fun playing with it, I would get one fo rher son. He walks around with his stuffed animals in there like babies. It helps him with balance. It gives him a way to pick up toys and take them to his bedroom. I would say the only downfall to it is he flips it on its side and he climbs, but he is a toddler and that's what they do best! Sturdy, durable and fun! When he finishes with it, it can either be passed on to the next sibling, donated or sold, becasue it will still look as good as new!

When we got our cart, we had to assemble it ourselves. No big deal since my husband is a very handy man. The toy wheels come in 2 separate parts and it was impossible putting them together. My husband struggled for so long. These pieces were a bit warped and never fit into each other. None of the four wheels were able to fit together. What a waste of time! There is no need for the manufacturer to make the wheels in 2 parts - one solid wheel would have worked and would have saved the aggravation. We ended up returning the product and will never recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for kids, helpful for parents","review":"This product is fun for my 2 year old.

It's very sturdy and maneuverable, with room for her doll and whatever else she wants to cart around. Yes, it's tricky to put together (terrible instructions) and yes, the wheels are hard to assemble (tip - after you get them on the cart, lay the whole thing down on its side and squeeze each wheel to \\"snap\\" the two pieces together), but once it's put together correctly, it's incredibly durable. I would recommend this toy to anyone with a child who loves push toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great push toy!","review":"My daughter LOVES pushing her dolls around in this toy!

Buyer beware!","review":"My son and daughter absolutely loved this toy, however we were quick to get rid of it when my 2 1/2 year old knocked his front teeth loose after he had climbed into the basket.

I actually requested my mother-in-law purchase this for him as I remembered my younger sister loving it at this age and beyond. He pushes this all around the house, putting things in and out of it, and is entertained for very long stretches...more than any other toy we have. It also seemed to propel him into becoming a very good walker at a very fast pace...the first day he ever walked, he took over 30 steps in a row! He was not walking at his first birthday (or even standing on his own), but by 13 months, he was trying to chase his 7-year-old brother! We love this toy!Update: My son is now 2.5 and still loves this!

I wish I had not made this purchase now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you know.....?","review":"Some of you might have read the review that says the cart turns over easily. Well, most of these carts have a plastic plug on them. All you have to do is remove the plug and put some sand in the base of the cart. My child is in physical therapy 4X each week. This is a toy we use in our sessions. Our therapist shared this little hint with me, so I hope someone finds this helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL toy!!!","review":"I purchased this grocery cart for my 4 year old son and 2 year old daughter and they both LOVE it. I had searched for quite sometime for a sturdy basket and this is it!! It's tall enough for my 45\\" tall son to use comfortably and chunky enough for my 2 year old to push it with ease. Assembling takes a little time but once it was all put together it looked great!! Both kids play with it and often times argue over it. It has a seat for \\"baby\\" and that has been a lot of fun for my little girl. My son likes the open space beneath the basket because he can put \\"soda cans\\" underneath just like we do at a real grocery store. If you are looking for a grocery cart this is a FANTASTIC one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it but right now my son is not very interested maybe soon","review":"I loved playing grocery store but I think my 2 year old son just likes spending time together. It's a very sturdy little cart and will not tip over unless your child is using it for a walker. This cart is the perfect size for 2years and up or depending on your childs height. For a younger or shorter baby there are other carts that will be better and safer. But It's great to have something to play with to break up the day. It also teaches him to use his imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Fun!","review":"My son has enjoyed this toy since he started walking. He is now two.As a little guy, he used it as a walking aid and enjoyed putting things inside it or in the little seat part and pushing them around.Now it lives outside, where he loves to push or pull it around the driveway and patio. I think he might think of it as more of a vehicle, like a car, as he makes driving sounds as he goes.

Instead of laboring the point, Schneider briefly presents information on a topic, then uses examples to explain the details. If you are learner by tutorial, then this book is NOT for you because it is not a lot of hand-holding. But if you can read something, see an example, then grasp the concept, then you will enjoy reading this text and find it very beneficial.My class project was to build a conctacts database, and this book has some great examples of how to build a database application both in the front end (forms and controls) and back end (coding SQL and VB data-handling commands)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the very beginning programmers","review":"When I came to university, we used the 5.0 version of this book for learning VB. I found it way too simple since I already had programming knowledge and would better have seen a book which went more deeply on the topics and covered more of object oriented programming. This book is for a part just click-and-play which might be very useful only for people who starts with programming from scratch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well structured book for beginners","review":"Well, I do think that the comments on the book relies a lot on the reader's background(previous experience). I programmed with several programming languages such as BASIC, FORTRAN and C/C++ before. But I had no experience with Visual Basic at all. So I bought this book to self-study VB. I compared many books on VB, this book is definitely very well structured and easy to follow. It does not go deep into some specific topics such as Data Management with VB, Web Programming with VB, and OOP with VB etc. However, this book does cover the foundamentals. After practicing with VB for a while, I have purchased other more advanced books on VB. However, I still come back to this book often. This book may not be good for those who are experienced with VB, neither those totally new to programming. However, it should be a good book for those who are new to Visual Basic. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduction to Programming with Visual Basic 6.0, An","review":"This is the required text for my college class in VB.

My professor is one of the better ones at my school and we still had a bad time learning VB. Too few examples, the examples are not like the exercises at all.

Yes, this book is full of examples and they are so easy to follow. Wait ! This is only an illusion. You might think you know visual basic pretty well after you read the whole book. However, You can't even write a simple program afterall. Why? because this book is lack of explanations, didnt explain any common programming error, no programming tips.. ....

The positive reviews are spot on. I was a complete beginner before I bought this book and after going through it, I felt confident in my ability to write useful programs. This book goes at the right pace for a beginner, has detailed examples and problems to solve for practice, and explains every concept very thoroughly. Even an experienced user may find this book helpful. There are very few (if any) typos, which seems pretty rare for these intro to programming books. So, if you are a beginner like I was, and you need a detailed step-by-step book that doesn't assume you don't need the details, then buy this book! I can't recommend it enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes learning visual basic easy","review":"If you don't think this book makes learning vb easy, then you probably shouldn't be a programmer.

Unfortunately, we bought the DVD set in a retail store. And looking just at the package it was FAR from clear that \\"Volume 1\\" was not only NOT a \\"Season 1\\" compilation, but that it was a measly 4 episodes!

In this album, Newsboys mixed in all of the cool rock and hard stuff that people like with the slow worship songs, and it is well mexed to where I hadly ever need to change my CD.

I really like Reality, God is Not a Secret, Take Me to Your Leader, Cup O' Tea, It's All Who You Know and Lost the Plot. If you like Rock or the band Newsboys and never heard of this cd, you should get it! All the kids in my youth group love this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Newsboys Best","review":"After 5 major album releases, this one is still the Newsboys' best. All of the songs are memorable and different, with the best being the quick thrash \\"Cup of Tea\\", and the dark and edgy \\"Lost the Plot\\". All of the Newsboys' albums have a distinct flavor and this one has a kind of odd surreal feel to it. Props also go to the great lyrics, as Newsboys are one of the few popular Christian bands that aren't afraid to say the words God or Jesus, instead of simply implying that that is what they are singing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best From Newsboys!","review":"I think this is the best album made by the Newsboys. This was made while Stve Taylor was still writing lyrics for them. And if you know Steve Taylor's style it generally has some sarcasm which makes you think a little while you listen to the great sound of the music. Breakfast is a real classic song which shows off the talent of both Steve and Peter. If you like the way the Newsboys sound then you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"!

The songs meander between 'one night with beer and a box of old records' to a 'day in daddy's garage'. They think they're referencing Mel van Peebles, Yoko etc. but after about 3 minutes...it just feels labored and, well, fake.I don't mean to rag too much on them. It's impressive that they're trying hard to break from their midwestern mold. But at the end of the day, it's a bunch of white boys who heard about the civil rights movement through Tarantino, whose understanding of the Black Panthers is defined through their great cover art.I can't help but feel that the bunch that makes up JWB hides behind a veil of bamboozled faux-homagery. If it were satire, it would be more interesting, but the album lacks that sense of self-deprecation. These guys want to be serious, and that's hard to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bile","review":"The lead vocals on this album have to be the worst that I have ever, ever heard. Musical abortion that sounds about as fake as they come.

Truly scientific weight training means building muscle fiber by maximizing tension with heavy weights and by minimizing ATP losses, lactic acid buildup and injuries using low-rep sets.

My kids (and I) actually liked the Lil Critters, other than the fact that we need a higher count since we were taking four daily. In the review, the customer stated that these were cheaper and tasted better. I thought, \\"You can actually make these taste better? Great!\\" Yes, they are much, much cheaper, but they taste like it, too. Firstly, when I opened the bottle, fine purple powder flew everywhere. It's all over the cotton ball inside, so every time I get tablets out, I have to be careful of where I set the cotton ball down. They taste more like regular vitamins, which my kids and I have NEVER liked (since we use the AMAZING-tasting SmartyPants). The Lil Critters are just higher quality and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"She loves these!","review":"When my daughter was starting solids we began using a probiotic powder that we mixed into soft foods like applesauce. She is now almost 2 and this was getting harder and harder to pull off so I had been searching for a chewable. She absolutely loves these. The grape flavor is pleasant and while they are sweet, which is a treat for her,they do not taste as sweet as candy. I also prefer the convenience of using something that does not have to be refrigerated, if I leave the vitamins out on the counter at night everyone in the family has an easier time remembering to take theirs in the morning.

The same day that she started using it, I noticed a change in her bowel movements. That day she went twice to the bathroom. She used to go every 2 or 3 days, but now she goes every day with no effort from her part.I am very happy with this product. It took a while to research other brands and this one seemed like the best choice due to the ingredients and quality control of the company.

Alexandroff also uses a lot of variation in dynamics and tempo, especially in the 1812. About the only thing I can find to not like is the lack of informative notes, but in the 1812 I'm sure they don't use real bells or cannons. Still the cannon fire and church bells are simulated in ways you can't mistake, so if it's music you want rather than real artillery, it's a great 1812, played with feeling and energy. In case you aren't familiar with some of the other selections, they are all great. None are slow moving, but the waltzes provide a relatively peaceful interlude between the 1812, the polonaise, the Marche Slave (which at times will make you think they skipped back to the 1812, because it repeats the theme which I think it \\"God save the Czar\\") and the finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Bittersweet","review":"London after, in the middle of, and at the beginning of WWII, in that order; I am awed by the beauty of the nonlinear storytelling of The Night Watch. It's a character-driven novel, and it was a breath of fresh air after all the plot-driven fiction I've been reading lately. There is something poignant about the way Waters works backward through time in this novel, the way the characters come intensely to life as they grow younger, as the reader sees who they are, knowing whom they will become. The love stories woven throughout are intense, bittersweet, and oh so close to home. No one paints a character portrait, with all its nuances, quite like Sarah Waters. I absolutely loved this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary novel - didn't grab me","review":"IThe Night WatchI ordered this book for the first meeting of an on line book club. We're all current or retired English teachers living everywhere from CA to MI to NY to SD and Thailand and pretty much no one cared for this book! Takes place in England and the book was as dreary as a British winter. It never grabbed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited interest, originality","review":"Let me start by saying this is an extremely well written book. Ms Waters is a wonderful writer, I have enjoyed her other work tremendously. This book on the other hand has been written hundreds of times by other authors, with very little to recommend it. It fits neatly in the alternative lifestyle before it was acceptable genre. If anyone else had written this, I prob wouldn't have finished it, but Ms Waters is usually so good I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Pick up another of her usually excellent works instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing much happens","review":"While the structure of the book is clever, most of the characters are uninteresting and the moral dilemmas are largely blah. The biggest mystery of all, that of the male protagonist, is not revealed until the very end and, frankly, was not worth waiting for. In addition, scenes are repeated ad nauseam. Take smoking, for example... there seems to be a cigarette scene in every page. And as far as homoerotic love goes, I've read much better tales.I hate to say this because I liked her other books: Leave this one on the shelf unless there's nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl love","review":"It's London during the horrors of the bombing raids of 1941 and the lives of a group of women intertwine inextricably.Four lesbian lovers agonise over exactly WHO they love and why, while another silly, stupid young woman continues her affair with a married soldier who gets her pregnant and then deserts her in her time of greatest need, following a botched abortion. Unbelievably, this lame brain girl continues with the affair for years afterwards, wasting her time on this idiot. As is probably apparent, this book made me angry but it's my own fault for reading a Sarah Waters book as she always writes about lesbian themes and if I hadn't been aware of just how much detail of love making she goes into, I certainly do now. Her descriptions of war torn London and of its inhabitants who were reduced to either zombie like fatalism or to quivering, nervous wrecks, are superbly done, but it's all so unhappy that it left me feeling totally depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little is original","review":"\\"Kay Langrish\\" of \\"The Night Watch\\" is too much like \\"Stephen Gordon\\" of Radclyffe Hall's 1927 novel, \\"The Well of Loneliness.\\" Both women are butch, brave, ambulance drivers, rich, conservative, etc. Coincidence? I don't think so. That's just one example of the lack of originality in \\"The Night Watch.\\" If your knowledge of lesbian literature begins with \\"Rubyfruit Jungle,\\" Sarah Waters' reliance on earlier sapphic novels won't trouble you--you won't notice. But if, like me, you've read (say) Mary Renault's pre-Alexander books, you'll wonder where the footnotes went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh -- from a very disappointed Sarah Waters fan","review":"Having devoured all three of SW's earlier works of brilliant, engrossing historical fiction, I splurged and got The Night Watch in hardcover. And horror of horrors, dear reader, I must confess that I haven't been able to bring myself to finish it! The characters are woefully unsympathetic; the reverse-chronology method of storytelling limps along and feels like a gimmick (and a hard to follow one at that); and SW's famed method of suspense-building is MIA. Perhaps one of you who made it through the entire thing can write and exhort me to finish it (hint: if you tell me you were bored through page 150, too, but it got better, I might believe you), but as of now I wanted to register my sad regrets on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous & Rather Boring - Her Other Books are So Much Better","review":"I have enjoyed all of Sarah Waters books (especially Tipping the Velvet), but was surprised to find Night Watch to be, frankly, quite boring. Too much unnecessary detail. I kept thinking \\"Ok, get to the point\\" in several places. I though some of the characters were quite compelling, but the story wasn't well put together. Starting in 1944 for one third of the book, then reverting back to 1941 didn't seem to make sense to me. Sometimes that works, this time it really didn't. I'd like to pluck the main characters of this novel, sit them down, and have Sarah start fresh with a clean, crisp, well-put-together story. There's a good book hiding in here, but I was just barely able to suffer through the poor construction and overly laborius description of this one. I will, however, continue, to read Sarah's books unless this problem continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her other novels","review":"Let me begin by saying that Sarah Waters is a wonderful writer. She has a way of using words that is absolutely amazing. However The Night Watch is not really up to the standard of her previous novels. The trick of beginning the novel in 1947 and then going back in time to 1944 and 1941 just doesn't seem to work. The characters are too bland and cliched to really engage your interest. Her descriptions of London at war, however, are wonderful and make you remember why you love her books. I would recommend Affinity (which I think is her masterpiece) or Fingersmith and Tipping the Velvet. I hope she returns to form in her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So readable! Great characters, great language, sobering plot.","review":"Engrossing, highly readable, layers upon layers of beautifully crafted narrative gradually open up these characters until they're so real you might see them in the street. The language is unmistakably British to my American ear, and that just made it better. Another incredible book from Sarah Waters -- full of grey areas, bittersweet observations, and no clear happy endings. My love for Sarah Waters shows no sign of fading. This book, and all her titles: highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobel Prize material...","review":"I can't believe that other reviewers here gave this book less than five stars. If I could give it more stars, I would. It's more touching than any anti-war novel I've read; it's right up there with \\"Cry, The Beloved Country,\\" and other books that plumb the depths of sorrow while retaining a dignity that lifts them out of being simply grim. The essence of the writing is precious and heartfelt. There is a light around this book, and I feel it should be considered for the Nobel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read in years","review":"I absolutely loved this book. This was the first Sarah Waters book I have read and I thought the writing was extraordinary and beautiful.

Ms. Waters is a fantastic writer - I have since read 'Fingersmith', which I also loved and will read her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, no plot.","review":"I was very disappointed in The Night Watch. There was no real story, just people going about their business from day to day. I actually found much of this book to be a bit depressing too.

I hope Ms. Waters' next novel will be more like her first novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull, dull, duller","review":"I try to finish all my books to the bitter end, but I had an especially hard time with this one. Waters departs from her Victorian underworld lesbian heroines to explore well, I don't really know, but I'm sure the War has something to do with it. The intertwining stories of Helen, Viv, and Duncan are told backwards (a lot less interesting than one would think) which allows you to get just invested enough in the present day characters that you start to care about where they're going rather than where they've been. Waters writes beautifully, but I can't help but think that this story lets her characters down. All the straight men are morally suspect if not morally weak. The lesbian love triangle is predictable (fyi when your girlfriend introduces you to another woman it's highly likely they were romantically involved). The war is just a pretense here to make things go not very far."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"I chose to read Sarah's The Night Watch after reading, and enjoying, 'Tipping the Velvet' which was sent to me by a friend. However, I can't help but feel slightly disappointed by this story.The characters, although they are well created and written, are too many and their lives too interwoven for me to have felt anything towards them. As soon as I started to enjoy one part of the story, I was torn away from it and thrust into the middle of another.I did, however, enjoy the style of the writing and how Sarah chose to start from the end and build the story back to the start but the book ended so abruptly that I felt a little dissatisfied by it and I wanted to know more.I enjoy reading about the era and I do like Sarah's tone of writing but I'm afraid there were too many characters for me to truly get involved with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely Useless","review":"This offers nothing that you cannot come up with on your own or that your professors or upperclassmen will not provide you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Allll Right","review":"Why is this out of stock?

More delicate than many of Weir's later films (including Dead Poets), Hanging Rock portrays the way a nameless terror can tear apart a group trying to cope with it -- an effect without an identifiable cause. Hanging Rock is not a scary movie, much less a horror film. Instead, Weir concentrates on the atmospherics of the rock, and later, the dynamic between the characters. Watch the movie not to be scared, but to enjoy Weir's subtle direction, the superb photography, and the mannered script.The newly remastered video release is about as pristine and clear as VHS can get. Although it's widescreen, the aspect ratio looks to be only about 1.66:1, so if you can't find the widescreen, the 1.33 (full screen) version won't look *too* different.DVD owners might be interested in the Criterion edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like a dream","review":"I saw this film the first time in the eighties and was impressed.Having it seen again after many years I love the dreamy quality of the story and its interpretation.

Two hours of my life were just sucked through my eyeballs. There is no plot, and the dialogue is hideous. There are hundreds of loose ends besides the main storyline, which wanders off in to the middle distance and evaporates, much like the girls on the rock.

This movie is one of the few unforgettable movies I've ever seen. From the opening to the end, Weir pulled me into this world and made me experience.

Aristotle said it first in his Poetics: a drama must have a beginning, a middle, and an end, all of which must contribute to its essence (I paraphrase). Here there was a good beginning but little middle and no end. This movie had too much of lingering scenic mood shots and too little of dramatic substance.

While it has its positives (evocative photography; haunting atmosphere; rich, overblown sets; some strong performances) it's essentially a tedious exploration of Victorian psycho-sexual dynamics, seen from a very 1970s perspective. The plot is so lightweight it's constantly in danger of floating away. I had to force myself at regular intervals not to turn it off because of shear boredom.The film leads you to believe it's based on a true story, which, frankly, was one of the reasons I stuck with it. But it's not. The story's a total fabrication, which makes the film even more ridiculous in retrospect.Unless you're a devotee of Peter Weir, Australian cinema, or 1970s costume and hair design trying to look \\"Victorian,\\" I suggest you watch The Beguiled instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un film magnifique","review":"Que de po��sie dans ce beau film : l'histoire est orginale, les d��cors splEndides, la photographie somptueuse.Un vrai d��lice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzz.......","review":"A pretentious bore of a movie. Some hot babes with unspoken lesbian tendencies in a repressive Victorian era boarding school spout romantic poetry, go on a picnic, venture up the phallic symbol Hanging Rock (THRUSTING out of the earth as a result of a violent volcanic ERUPTION), take off their shoes and stockings (oooh, naughty!) and, after awakening from a siesta (I took one myself), promptly march in zombie-like fashion up and away and disappear into thin air.

Intelligent, funny and fast paced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Love truly is blind! What a great story with everything you could want in a romance. I loved the wit and the personalities of the main characters, kept me interested fom the beginning. You can't go wrong with this one. Very well written Loretta Chase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scoundrel Indeed :)","review":"The characters were solid and extremely likable. I liked that the hero wasn't some misunderstood rake, but a nefarious man without scruples. When he comes around for the heroine, it's not just by shucking his bachelorly ways, it's embracing a respectable life and finding happiness.A lovely read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I just don't get it. Usually, when a book on Amazon has a great rating I find it to be right on. This book completely missed the mark in my opinion. I couldn't even finish it and that's pretty bad. I can usually finish any book but I just found this book quite dull. This book was missing that extra umph that makes a romance juicy.I didn't care for the heroine or for the hero. I couldn't get passed his big nose for some odd reason.I will give it this though. The dialogue was humorous at times but all in all I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable and addicting","review":"One of the best I've ever read, and I've read a lot. The heroine is clever and sympathetic with much more insight than most, and the hero is completely endearing, because rather than in spite of his evil ways. Not only could I not put it down but it left me happy and satisfied, even after the second reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not finish it!","review":"It took too long to get to the meat of the story. Maybe I missed something that the other reviewers saw in this book. It was a tale of a horribly ugly child, born to a horribly ugly marriage. The unfit wife ran off with another man. The father had no real love for this child either, so he was promptly sent off to a boarding school, naturally to be picked on at first. I quit just as things began to change a little. I just could not see a good storyline in it. Maybe someone else will see more in it than I did & read on further."},{"rating":"1","title":"repellent hero, unbelievable","review":"The \\"hero\\" is totally repellent, vicious, and the heroine's attraction to him is unbelievable. I stuck with the book maybe a third of the way through, and then returned it. Disappointing, because I've read several of the author's other books and liked them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring & not a likable hero...","review":"I stopped around p120. I wanted to like the book. It seemed intriquing being set in Egypt but the writing was just boring. As for the hero, as one other reviewer pointed out, you knew nothing of him except he had a use history of sexual conquests and the heroine was just one other conquest. All his thoughts had to do with undressing her - nothing real deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romance","review":"If you want to know what differentiates a Loretta Chase book from all of the other historical authors, I would have to say it is her ability to weave a mesmerizing and colorful tale. As with all of her books (at least the five or so that I have read), this book has dark moments, funny moments, sexy moments, and even embarrassing moments! Together, they add up to one wonderful romance novel. Lord of Scoundrel is a classic LC book, with an unforgettable dark hero and a heroine with such charm and whit she can go toe-to-toe with him. This is a tightly woven love story that just builds and builds."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to disagree with the general consensus, but...","review":"I won't say that I hated this book, because I didn't. I will say though that this is much more stereotypical romance novel fare than I enjoy. The reformed rake plot is an overdone one and Chase doesn't even make an effort to mix it up at all. The hero was annoying and his constant misunderstandings/misinterpretations were bothersome to say the least. The heroine was likable enough, and overall it was acceptable, I just don't think it merits the glowing reviews it has here. I didn't even buy it, I just borrowed it from a friend because she said I *had* to read it, avid romance novel reader that I am. When I got on here to see how other people felt, I was shocked by how universally liked it is. I just found the plot and the characters (mainly Dain) to be not wholly believable. Skip this book and read some Kleypas. She has good characters, good sex scenes, and good plot. I highly recommend her work, especially her early stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book as other reviewers?","review":"I got this book from the library based on the smashing reviews here. .my copy of the book was so dog-eared and marked I imagined women poring over this again and again.I will admit to liking our hero,dain,although with a sobriquet such as \` lord of scoundrels' you would expect to see at least some of his conquesting and not simply hear about it by reference. At least I felt he was a well fleshed out (no pun intended) character. I couldn't feel the same way about our heroine at any point during this book. Why was she letting her brother manipulate her so badly? She certainly wasn't helping him to grow up out of his childish behaviour. Jessica does score brownie points in her taking dain's son under her wing but then again so does he. All in all I was not thrilled with this beauty & the beast plot,although I do think dain is a well thought out& interesting alpha male character"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent characters, excellent romance, excellent humor","review":"It was very difficult to put this book down once I got started. The characters were fleshed out quite nicely and I really liked Dain and Jessica. I've also read The Last Hellion and it too was good, but this one is superior, because the love and physical attraction between Dain and Jess was more intense. Chase writes really well and the humor is wonderful. The first book in the series is Captives of the Night (at least I think it's the first book) and I cannot believe she was the writer. It was very boring. I actually didn't even get half way through it. I wonder why it takes so long for her books to come out? I have high expectations for her next book. I wish she were more prolific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully I borrowed it from the library...","review":"I honestly don't get it. After reading the positive reviews I thought I would really enjoy this book. The \\"tortured hero\\" theme is one I have always found compelling. Unfortunately, Lord of Scoundrels left me cold. I finally gave up halfway through--I found the characters totally unlikable, the storyline murky and convoluted, and the whole thing a colossal bore. I liked the premise--I wish I could have liked the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! You must read this book!","review":"Wow! This is an amazing story. I could go on and on about it, but everyone else has said everything I could. Let me sum it up in one sentence: Buy it for the glove scene! Wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...What?","review":"I don't understand all the great reviews either. The story was boring, the characters were awful, the plot was not written well.Jessica is so aggressive, and Dain was so immature. I know what it's like to feel ostracized and humiliated for how you look, made fun of when you were a kid, felt ugly your whole life. But I don't remember growing up and being so...childish.Why did she shoot him? I was so blown away at the scene with confusion.Also, I couldn't get over Dain's attitude toward his son near the end. How could you ignore a child who you know will feel as ugly as you did? Why would you ignore their existence, let them live in the same loneliness you did?And these two just couldn't make a more unlikely pair. They didn't belong together.Definitely not one of Chase's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have paid more.. Good book!","review":"Really good story, I was surprised at .99 how very good the story was and so I will review it as if it were a $7.99 read.Full and intrusting characters , a little drama, a intelligent and strong heroine and our hero (my favorite) moody and jaded.The plot was not predictable and the story was told very well, all in all an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy- Kinda entertaining","review":"This was my first \\"Romance- Romance\\" novel and I thought it was cheesy but fun.I saw all the great reviews from Good Reads and Amazon so I gave it a try. I love romance but not this kind of romance. I wont read another one like it. Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT live up to the hype","review":"From reading all of the reviews on Amazon, I was really looking forward to reading this book, hoping that it really was as good as the reviews claim it to be. To be honest, both the heroine and hero were pathetic and completely annoying. There was no true chemistry and longing, which I believe makes for a good romance! Aside from erotic sex scenes, the story doesn't flow well and was not at all touching. I was so irritated that I wasted my time on reading this book. I read it all the way through, but in the end, there was nothing to redeem it. I have read far better books, like the Prince series from Elizabeth Hoyt, ANY Lisa Kleypas book, or Guilty Pleasures by Laura Lee Guhrke. In fact, I believe that Passion from Lisa Valdez is a truly wonderful romance novel with the hottest sex scenes I've read so far. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book is best borrowed or bought used; it is not worth buying at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkling dialogue, witty and unique characters!","review":"This book is a real wonder among romance novels with witty and unique romantic characters that are truly unmatched in other books. The wonderful dialogue is a real tribute to Ms. Chase's abilities as a real author, not the formulaic driven nonsense that the romance publishers so often peddle. I have re-read this book many times, and its always a real pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loretta Chase's \\"Lord of Scoundrels\\"","review":"I'm usually not a fan of historicals, but holy wow was this one different. I love Jessica. Dain is great, too. Lots of backstory and personal emotional angst to work through. Jessica, however, is a force to be reckoned with. Any polite society woman who decides the most sensible course of action to redeem a ruined reputation is to shoot the man who ruined it (in the most harmless location one can be shot, of course), is an interesting character. That she manages to pull it off without looking like a lunatic or a selfish, sociopathic brat is a testament to Chase's skill at character development. Loved the main characters, loved the side characters, even loved Dain's brat. Great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it its a great read","review":"I am so happy to have read this book.trust me,you will love the characters.I love dain and his emotional side,I loved the pace and the characters.Bravo from all the way down here in Africa.Kate from kenya"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste","review":"Jessica was too overbearing and I just couldnt bring myself to like herDain was just too over wrought for words - couldnt get over his own past, abandoned his child, showed no real sense in dealing with anythingAnd then overnight Dain was reformed by the overly capable JessicaAnd what is more the moral of the story seemed to be that women should be tolerant of a man having bastards (the author even quotes examples of some others) but her own character should not have even the hint of being sullied"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...wasn't the best","review":"I bought this book because of the price and trust me, I'm glad I paid no more than a dollar for it. I was barely able to finish it. I'm not a big fan of Loretta Chase as it is, but the book in general was honestly boring. Not my cup of tea, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Very nicely done. Superb dialogue, great heroine, dashingly flawed hero. I couldnt put it down. LOVED the scene near the lamp post in the street and then in the carriage. One of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hyped up","review":"I had to check a few times if I was in fact reading the same Lord of Scoundrels referenced by other reviewers here. Whilst I respect that everyone has their own taste I found it surprising how many people thought this book was the best romance they had ever read.I personally could not finish it. The book started out great, the characters had alot of potential and the conversation was very witty - I even laughed out loud a few times. However from the moment they tie the knot it starts going downhill - fast. The hero who is supposed to be a Lord of Sin type, big ruthless and with a heart of stone quickly degenerates into this needy, insecure, characterless character. The heroine who is meant to be strong, comes off more like a know-it all, patronizing smart-ass. And to top it all off the story line was so boring and uneventful that I didn't care what happened to the characters and I stopped reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"JZW","review":"One of the best love stories I have ever read! WOW the author really nailed it on this one! Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Adorable Book","review":"This book is precisely why some of us keep reading romance novels even though there are probably only 10 readable authors in the entire genre. Ms. Chase has talent and wit, and I'm sorry I just discovered her. I would like to read all her books, but am unwilling to spend ( )for a paperback on the secondary market. Are there any plans to reprint her older novels? Seems to me it would be a smart move by both the publisher and the author.Excellent, Ms. Chase. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic for a reason","review":"Fantastic dialogue and great characters elevate this book to the \\"read again\\" tier. It's witty, quite funny at times, and has an emotional depth that is very rare in the genre. Chase manages to take the stock character of the \\"Rake\\" and really add something special to the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring","review":"This is the 1st romance novel that I have read. I found it to be dull and cheap reading. I didn't expect Dickens but I thought the scenes were predictable and tacky.But after reading this garbage, I will not read another romance novel. By the way, I am a 30 year-old man. Though I can say that this book taught me a new way to manipulate women. Thank you Ms. Chase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read!","review":"This book was excellent from start to finish. I really just didn't want it to end, it would be great to see a second book pick up where this one left off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"With all of the great reviews, i settled in for a really great book, but I can honestly say I was very disappointed. Maybe it was the constant references to the devil and all of the devilish nicknames. But I think it was also because of the redundancy of the the story line, something I am not a fan of. It just seemed to be the same sentances over and over again. Like the story line just chugged along with nothing that interested me. And when the main charactors spend all of their time arguing and trying to outsmart each other-I usually get turned off. I will say the writer has a good sense of humor, but is about the best I can say. I really had to push myself to finish it. I have read loads of romance novels and in my opinion, this one is near the bottom. I just reread some of glowing reviews and I just dont get it. Chalk it up to each person having their own preferences I guess, which is ok!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious psychologically, and wonderfully funny!","review":"This is simply one of the best Regencies I've every read (and that's a LOT of Regencies). I believe that the part I liked best was the humor -- laugh-out-loud funny at many points. I also *deeply* appreciated the author refraining from the 4-chapter misunderstanding. All too often it seems that a bit of honesty (and plain speaking) would clear up much of the \\"conflict\\" in the average romance book. The heroine's depth of understanding (and experience) of boys,whatever their age, made her insights very believable.Do yourself a BIG favor -- even if you're new (or jaded) to the genre: get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminded me of Taming of the Shrew","review":"Writing is pretty elegant with a well thought out plot. Now I want to read more of her novels! I was worried about a cheap read, but it was worth what I didn't pay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"I just want to say how much I love this book. It is by far the most touching beautiful story i'v read so far. In this book the hero, Dane, he has a cynical personality which is a result of his childhood. His father paid him no attention and his mother was self centered and cared little for anything else but her self. When Dane gets older his father sends him away to a school where kids pick on him and bully him. Soon however, Dane manages to gain respect from them and show them whos boss. So later when Dane is all grown up hes tough cares for nothing and no one and does what he wants. Jessica is beautiful, smart, and witty. The conversations between the two are brilliant. At times I found myself weeping and laughing til tears came. This books is amazing and I might say im a bit sad that I read it because when I go to read another book I will be sad to know that know other book will compare to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Story","review":"This story had lots of heat with the tall, dark, handsome, and rich duke, and the beautiful, independent, intelligent lady. Loved it! I've read it more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"New twist on old plot...","review":"Who doesn't love a good \\"rake reformed\\" book? Dain is the rake of all rakes even though he is cast as the ugly duckling...BIG ugly duckling. He has sworn to never involve himself with a lady, and with a terrible upbringing, he believes that all things have a price. Jessica is the rapier tongued lady who can handle and control most things in her life, but the heart wants what the heart wants. No amount of money can change that, and no amount of control can keep the heart from reaching for happiness. When the two get together, sparks fly. Loved this book. Even though you can call the ending (which is pretty typical of historical romance), the journey one takes to get there makes it worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, funny and sexy","review":"I enjoyed this immensely. Funny, sexy, believable characters and storyline. Loved it, I hope other books of Ms. Chase are as good as this one. Not every book makes me chuckle out loud and that is quality writing in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic!","review":"A tense romance about a headstrong female and a tough man with series trust issues. Miss Trent goes with her grandmother to visit her alcoholic-gambling brother in Paris when she meets a man that makes her want to know more. Their romance is filled with mistrust and animosity, both playing games with each other to humiliate each other in the echelon society that they belong to. During their games and tricks they find a solution for a humiliating circumstance that has shunned them from society... but is it temporary or something that will last forever?A cute little romance I immediately liked it I definitely recommend to everyone even if you aren't a romance fan, it's a funny heart- warming story about two people who don't have anything in common and are polar opposites yet find what's important and turn an unfortunate situation into a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, can't even finish it","review":"This book started off so well, Dain's childhood was written in a funny and touching way. Once he meets Jessica it goes downhill. She is a 27 year old lady and virgin (of course) who suddenly feels instant lust for this man. He is not used to \\"ladies\\" and falls instantly for her because she is a lady and beautiful, (of course).It all seemed too pat, I felt very little connection between them, and the storyline just became silly. I have only gotten through it halfway, I have not finished it, and started reading another book instead as I lost any interest in what became of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woman who thinks!","review":"Others have given an outline or synopsis of the plot so I won't waste time with that. What I will say is how much I loved Jess, the heroine. She doesn't just react to things - she thinks them through and tries to see underlying issues. I don't read Regency romances very often as I am tired of a heroine who misunderstands something she sees or hears and runs away or over-reacts. Jess didn't do any of that. She is a strong, intelligent and passionate woman who is not afraid to do what she thinks is right. My only quibble is that it would have been nice to have her background and experiences raising 10 boys fleshed out a little more since that was some of what she drew on in trying to understand Sebastion.Sebastion, Lord of Scoundrels, is a very well defined character who is drawn very true to life given his childhood experiences.I loved this book and am glad to have discovered this author. I will be looking forward to reading more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Wrong-thinking Man...One Right-thinking Woman","review":"Born ugly, called the spawn of satan by his own father...Sebastien sees himself as a self-fulfilling prophecy....one ugly man. How is he to know that time has transformed him into a startling, sexy, man. Bring a practical minded female, Jess is thrown for a loop when this half-italian stallion crosses her path. Suddenly thoughts of lust fill her mind, and, as the story unfolds, frustration, as the man of her dreams turns out to be quite beastly in nature. Through fist fights, a bastard child's rescue, and the love two people accidentally find with each other..This is a book well worth keeping, I, myself, own four copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I don't review unless I really, REALLY enjoy the book so of course I had to review this one! If you love alpha males, strong females, and witty banter you'll adore this book as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY ALL TIME FAVORITE HISTORICAL","review":"I can't add to much others have said.

I really liked the show and that is why I purchased the DVDs and most of those interested in buying this set are probably familar with the show. My rating of one star is a reflection of the picture quality. I have not seen any other set as poor as this. Even remastered 60's and 70's shows are not this grainy. If you have an HDTV this will really be noticable. Even on my 21 inch Sony that I have in my bedroom I can notice the poor quality. At the price they are charging you would think they can do something to improve this. It is hard to believe that shows like Dallas and even Gilligan's Island have extremely superior picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Season","review":"TBAA FYI, for those who are Maya Angelou fans. Season 2 contains the episode \\"Reunion.\\" Personally, it is one of my favorites as I am a Maya Angelou junkie. This episode also guest stars Natalie Cole. Della is joined by Natalie and Maya as they jam on \\"Wade In The Water.\\" A truely memorable TBAA moment. And then there is the poem which Dr. Angelou wrote especially for this episode.Season 2 also includes another standout episode \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" featuring Cindy Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST 'RELIGIOUS' THEMED SHOW EVER!","review":"Touched by an Angel didn't last nine years for no good reason! This series struck a chord with the family viewing audience and God was the one who made it a triumph simply because Martha Williamson, an intelligent producer, did things according to the way she was led to them by HIM!! This second season offering is a perfect example of the why the series took off the way it did! The undeniable chemistry between Roma Downey, Della Reese and John Dye, the incredible writing and the vast array of guest stars added to the great production values including an unforgettable theme song, which sadly, no television shows offer anymore....TBAA was the last in a long line of quality television. There will never be another like it!

To my surprise, the negative comments were understated. The book was poorly written, has enormous gaps in the telecommunications area as related to the practical buildout of an ISP at both the hardware and business level. I returned the book after 10 days of thorough and painful reading. I cannot recommend someone spend money on this book. My apologies to the author but this is an honest response.

Don't forget; if your car goes into water; the engine stops and you can't get your windows to work. Unless you still drive a really old car with manual windows.

As a Trinidadian I eagerly looked forward to seeing a cinematographic presentation of a work by one of our finest writers. I was sorely disappointed. The acting fell far below what I'd expected - with the actors seeming to merely go through the motions. The story dragged and lacked development (what about Ganesh's wife not being able to have a baby!!) and, after all that, the film ended too abruptly. Costuming was unreal, historical facts were distorted (steelpan music on the radio!!), and accents seemed to come and go. I look forward to seeing a cinema showing this part of the world using Caribbean actors. Please do something about making the story move - just because pundit meanders through his life, doesn't mean I want to feel like I'm spending a lifetime meandering through this film.

Looking at the metal that snapped, it was pretty thin. It looks like anyone using it in live rolling would break it sooner rather than later. It's unfortunate, because there were positives if it had sufficient construction. The rubberish foam piece that was in contact with the head was very comfortable, and didn't absorb sweat at all. After working out, I would wipe the sweat off quickly and consider it clean, and it never began to stink. The ear space was large, and rarely moved enough to come in contact with the ear lobe.

Some people seem to think that any film with very little dialog and a dreamy look is \\"artistic\\" and therefore has value. Never mind that the leads cannot act and the plot is as thin as the gauze that must have been placed over the lens. The director is best known as a still photographer; little wonder that the images on the screen might as well be still photography for all the content they have. I am 100 percent regretful I wasted my money on this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic, No Substance","review":"The fact that a high school teacher kissed a student made me cringe. I suppose the author justified it by having Grant feel guilty enough to leave for a while. Shelley allows Grant to kiss all over her but then stops him just when he thinks he's about to get lucky. She does this so many times, he finally stops pursuing her. But then she gets mad because he pays her no attention! At 26 or 27, Shelley was extremely juvenile - case in point, when Grant takes her to dinner, she lashes out at him for no reason whatsoever and says asinine things.The further I got into the story the more I disliked Grant. He started out fine, but he quickly faded into the category of nonmemorable hero. And the way it ended was just as stupid as the rest of the story - with Shelley coming in to wrap everything up with words. God, I was embarrassed for her! It wasn't plausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF MY FAVORITES!","review":"I HAD WISHED TO FIND MAYBE LESS OF AN AGE GAP. PURELY BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE AT THE AGE OF 16.

THE ONLY REASON I BELIEVED THAT HE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER IS BECAUSE HE HAD TRIED TO CONTACT HER A FEW YEAR LATER. MAKING SURE SHE WAS DOING OKAY AND WAS HAPPY.OVERALL THE BOOK JUST MADE ME FEEL DISGUSTED ABOUT THE SITUATION.

Her professor is none other than Grant Chapman, the high school teacher with whom she shared a tantalizing kiss 10 years earlier when he taught civics.Grant left school immediately following that illicit afternoon kiss, and took a job as a congressional aide. He leaves that job due to another potential scandal. He is once again attracted to Shelley, and since she is no longer underage (thus off limits), he asks her out. In order to find happiness the two must overcome many obstacles including former lovers and a dean that is suspicious of Grant's motivations.The story is dated, the conflict nearly non-existent, and the dialog a little trite at times. Recommended reading only for anyone who had a crush on a teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't","review":"I bought this audio book to keep me company on a long car ride.

I have been reading her books for years and have loved all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book easily forgotten","review":"I have recently re-read this book. Not a very memorable one. Literally. I didn't remember anything about it. Grant and Shelley are two lovers that you will forget as soon as you close the book.No matter how you want to put it, I don't like a teenager being kissed by her teacher who is nine years older than her. So if you find that idea disgusting, don't read it.But if you don't mind, this is a romance with some hot sexy scenes. Grant is overbearing, showing from the first moment that he desires Shelley. She is the perfect doormat who says 'I don't want to' but when he insists says 'Well, yes, I do'.And the end in a judge's chambers, well, it's perfectly cheesy and embarrasing. At least for me.So if you are a Sandra Brown fan, yes, read it. Or if you are a teenager with a crush on your teacher. Or fond of 1980s romances. But if you are not, you can skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time!

However, I found this book fairly bland and boring. As others have pointed out, it's rather dated, but I didn't mind that. What I minded was the repetitiveness, for one thing. It seemed like there were endless scenes that were basically the same thing over and over. We can't be together! But we must! But we can't! Passionate lovemaking, rather Harlequin romance-esque, followed by the main character, Shelley, running away and vowing never to see her love again.I won't give away the ending, but I'll just say that to me, it lacked any interesting plot development or anything that could really get me involved in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a sweet story.

This book might be enjoyed by a 15 year old at most. First of all, it is rather sick that a grown man seduces a 16 year old girl. Then, when she is an adult, he acts like nothing more than a hungry, perverted male. The comments he comes out with are enough for almost any woman to want to smack him in the face.This book is poorly written, poorly read on audio and not worthy of any human-beings time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Kiss remembered","review":"What were they thinking to reissue this book? And in hardcover and audio. A Kiss remembered is not just extremely dated it is extremely silly.There must be many wonderful new authors with wonderful books waiting to be printed but the publishers here have chosen to use Sandra Brown's name to trick readers into buying a book that is a grand disappointment. Do they think we can't tell the difference between a good book and a dud? Well, people who paid money to buy this are not likely to take a chance again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexual Predator + Desperate Girl = Classic Love Story?","review":"This story had so much potential. I was hooked on this book from the blurb and had such high hopes for it only to be disappointed. I know that professor/student affairs go on, but I can't imagine them being as creepy as the relationship described in this book. The guy needed to be doused with some pepper spray on several occasions and the girl needed to grow a backbone and stick up for herself when she did not desire his sexual advances. The whole thing was not what I would call romantic, just strange. The entire book was strange. NOT one of Sandra Brown's best pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I almost finished this book. I kept reading because I simply couldn't believe that this apparently very prolific author had managed to write an entire book based on nothing. This is my first and last book by Sandra Brown. There are too many wonderful books that deserve our attention to waste time with a book this puerile that has nothing redeeming in it. I'm assuming this is not an aberration, but a continuation of Sandra Brown's \\"style.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time","review":"Having read one other Sandra Brown book- \\"The Alibi\\"- and enjoying it, I too picked this up at a half price books. I was terribly disappointed. This had to be one of the cheesiest books I have ever read. Now I know why you see it at so many discount bookstores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great weekend read!!!!","review":"This is a typical love story by Sandra Brown. It is fast-paced, filled with juicy love scences, and with characters that make us feel. I love reading Ms. Brown, she has the ability to take the reader away from everyday life and bring us a world filled with happily ever afters. What more can a avid romance reader ask for? This is a great starter for those just getting into this genre. Enjoy...I sure did."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this story.","review":"I just finished this book and I loved it. Sometimes in love there is turmoil and struggle. If you want a book where boy and girl meet and go skipping blissfully down the rosy path, this may not be right for you. If you like a story where there is human emotions and the ups and downs that come with being in love, this is a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Gosh Sakes!","review":"I've been listening to this book on playaway at work and I found it unbearable. All of the tempting of each other, the advance and retreat, leading to eventual climax ~ I kept wanting to say 'For gosh sakes! DO IT, already!'This book reminded me of a 'Modern Romance' magazine story, something I would only read willingly if I were marooned on an island with no other reading material available.There was no plot other than the interplay between the ridiculous wordy Shelley and Grant. I couldn't see anything for them to overcome.When the book spoke of his 'pulsating manhood' or her 'quivering femininity,' I must confess I laughed out loud at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible","review":"I listened to this in the car thankfully...so I could fast forward through all the long drawn out sexual scenes...which is what the bulk of the book is made up of. It bored me to tears....not much of a plot..just some dialouge between 'lusty' scenes. Dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidest book I've read in a long time!","review":"I have enjoyed Sandra Brown books in the past but this one is awful! I wish I could give it 0 stars. The plot is lame, the main character is a limp dishrag, and the dialogue is painful to read. No real life people act the way these characters do. The scenario is so dated--any university instructor who acts like Grant would be up on charges of sexual harrassment and deservedly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dated Harlequin romance re released in a hard cover","review":"I would be so embarrassed to release this old book in hardcover if I were Sandra Brown. Originally published about 20 years ago the author states that this story reflects the \\"trends and attitudes\\" that were popular at that time. (Read-dated!) I've never read any other Sandra Brown books and am not likely to now. I wonder why this supposedly successful author of numerous novels would re-release something this dated and simplistic? It certainly isn't worth the ...cover price. Check it out at the library if you are a huge Sandra Brown fan. If you're not, don't even bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD CONNECTION","review":"I DONT THINK I SHOULD EVEN DO A REVIEW OF THIS BOOK, BUT I WOULD LIKE OTHER READERS TO KNOW HOW I FELT ABOUT THIS BOOK. I WAS SO SURPRISED THAT THIS BOOK EVEN GOT PUBLISHED. I THOUGHT TEACHERS GOT INTO BIG TROUBLE FOR THIS KIND OF STUFF, BUT TO MAKE A LOVE STORY ABOUT IT WAS VERY WRONG. IT MAKES IT SOUND OKAY FOR A TEACHER TO KISS ONE OF HIS STUDENTS AND THEN TO TURN IT AROUND AND HAVE THEM FALL IN LOVE, I JUST DIDN'T APPRECIATE THAT.

This is a \\"high schooler\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Great and Dated","review":"I bought this book despite people saying it was very dated. If nothing else, I love historic romances, so I figured it would not matter. In the end, the story was not that great, the sex was not that hot, and the book was so dated (I assume written in the 70s or possibly 80s) that it really distracts from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"Ok story. True romance novel. No real substance. Not nearly the caliber of current Sandra Brown novels. I'll stick with the current books."},{"rating":"2","title":"intensely fun","review":"This book tells the outrageous adventures of Baron Munchausen from fighting an alligator and a lion singlehandedly to building a gigantic bridge from Africa to England. The book comes in two parts, the first part being generally random shorts, while the second is a more focused account of the Baron's trip to Africa. I like the first part infinitely better than the second, which just got boring to me after a while. Both parts are definitely worth reading, and the book is definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visual paradise, limbo plot.","review":"If a man is impotent, the Kama Sutra is the answer. This is the main theme for this film about what the Kama Sutra means. The art of love Kama Sutra that suggests in the theme is not the concept presented in this video. A man with impotence may be the cause of many reasons, hormonal, physical, psychological, or deviant. The Kama Sutra techniques are not the answer to these problems, as it implies in this film. Moreover, the madam of the mansion or sanctuary, looks as a priestess, owner of the lives of the maidens she maintains below her domains. The couple in this \\"tale\\" does not have the chemistry of lovers; they act like robots in the entire story. In the other side, the photography is a work of art in the film. The only excellent characterization is the Indian maiden. This girl is exceptionally beautiful; she captures the interest of the viewer. The plot is obscure, bored, slow and tiresome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was going to be good...","review":"I expected something completely different.

It if fun and easy to keep up with, nothing too heavy. This time, Jim is asked to do a column on interior design.

I enjoyed this one as much as the first. The cool thing about this book is you have characters you know but in an environment you would never have thought of. Qwilleran doesn't strike me as someone that would be anywhere near interior decorating circles. You get a good mystery, with familiar faces and a peek into the stereotypical interior decorating world. It works though! The description of the various styles of decor were fun. The new characters are interesting as are the settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd book is funnier","review":"I'm new to the Cat Who series. This second book is more humorous than the first. Koko acts like a typically troublesome cat by eating what he shouldn't and attacking at random, but still helps Qwill solve crimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first!","review":"This book was better than the first. Braun lets you guess what the solution to the mystery is, then eliminates the possibility by adding more clues. This is the second book in the series, after The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, for those who want to know. I'm hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Grrrreat!","review":"This is another one of the early Cat Who...books so that means it was written in the 60's. All of Braun's early novels are excellent and so is this one. I love how Braun describes that decor of the apartments and the food and things like that. No other author has got that technique down as well as Braun. This book introduces the third member of the Qwilleran family Yum-Yum. A female feline to keep Qwill and Koko in line. She doesn't have Koko's sleuth powers but she is special none theless."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good for bent knee sports, aka brazilian jiujitsu","review":"Yes, the brace offers very good protection for the knee--as long as your leg is pretty straight. But if you're doing brazilian jiujitsu where you're on your knees a lot, the knees bent, they just aren't any good.First of all, the brace puts a lot of pressure on a bent knee--the internal support \\"pushes back\\" a lot when bent.Then, after using these for a few weeks for jiujitsu, one of them actually split in the back.Another issue I found for jiujitsu is that the brace kept falling off. So on the one hand it was too tight for a bent knee, and on the other, it kept slipping off. I did try a size larger and those came off even quicker.So I have to assume these are more for stand-up wrestlers, or boxers, or baseball players. But for jiu-jitsu, a big \\"no.\\"I do want to commend worldwide sport supply--they are processing my return on these with no problem.

I've tried about a billion different brace and thought that maybe tape was the only thing that was going to work. I was quite pleased with this brace...sturdy and supportive without too much bulk. It is bulkier than some braces...but that is a compromise that you are going to have to deal with to get the extra support. It will slide a bit...but nothing excessive. I usually just reposition it between rounds. For the reviewer who says it interferes with naturally bending the knee, I disagree. I spend most of my time in butterfly guard and so my knees are always bent (maybe the source of my knee issues!)and this brace was able to bend just fine. I did enjoy the extra padding over the knee as well. It provided a nice cushion and stabilizer support. Overall, I would recommend this brace as a very supportive, moderately flexible brace that fits the bill for serious knee support in BJJ."},{"rating":"2","title":"air knee brace","review":"Great knee brace.

Beginning in 1965 and taking the reader through the trails and tribulations of Marine recon teams operating deep in enemy-held country until 1971, Major Norton has accomplished a most difficult task.

But about two-thirds of the way through the book, Porter seems to lose interest, summing up months of time in a paragraph or two. She never regains momentum, and the book lapses into diatribe after diatribe on the need for women to love themselves, the need for mothers to let their children go, and the need for men to see the \\"real\\" woman, not just the perfect makeup.What started out with a bang ended in a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"no book, no response","review":"Seller nirbl1: I placed the book order with this seller 7/27/10.

Set in cyberspace, this book chronicles the dating and sexual experiences of one woman as she would explain it to her closest girlfriend. The author truly understands her characters and their motivations, and I found myself in the role of that girlfriend, alternately laughing or cringing at the stories that were being told. This is truly a remarkable look into the virtual dating trend."},{"rating":"2","title":"great characters and great pace","review":"This novel marks what could be a great series if the author wished. Renquist the vampire is close to Lestat when it coems to great vampires in fiction. The story moves along at a good pace and never lets up. The ending was a little weak but you can't beat the previous 300 pages for sheer vampire fun. If you're into vampire navels this is one to check out, especially reading how they came into exsistence. On a scale of 1-10, this one gets an 8!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the real Mick Farren?","review":"Mick Farren is one of my favorite authors. He's written some really great cyberpunk and sci-fi novels. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. I discovered this book at the library. At first I was very excited, because I hadn't seen any books by him in a long time and thus wasn't expecting to see this one. But when I started reading it, it was sooo bad that I had to start skimming through it trying to find the good parts. What a surprise! There weren't any! Argh!!! So .. if you want to read good vampire fiction, read Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series. And if you want to read excellent Mick Farren fiction, find any or all of the following books: Their Master's War; The Armageddon Crazy; The Long Orbit; The Last Stand of the DNA Cowboys; Mars: The Red Planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just great","review":"I read this book and absolutely can't figure why anyone truly into the vampire genre wouldn't be blown awy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Vampire books I've read.....","review":"I read this book right in the middle of reading Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and it really is a good book. It is filled with a new group of vampres that have more problems then The Vampire Chronicles. It deals with a blood thirst that they must hide from the mortals of New York City, but when a rogue vampire decides to go against the rules the main body of Vampires has to kill him and get out of New York.

That said, there's one deeply disturbing fact about this book : it's manipulating old and recent history to prove a theory, which is that Marian apparitions have had an impact on the course of our world. Just a couple of examples : Marian apparitions shortened the 2nd World War (weather on D Day could have been really bad, you see), prevented France from suffering from a civil war in 1947 (never heard about it before) and accelerated the fall of Communism.

But the bottom line is that most of the songs were good in the first place.The same cannot be said here. Creating instant nostalgia has proven to be an undaunting task for the songwriters. Instead of penning a collection of tunes that sound like they were actually written during the 1980's, the listeners have a soundtrack of cheap knock-offs of the sounds of said decade, which is very demanding for an audience.On the flip side, the performers are quite good, and there seems to be an indication that these numbers need the visuals to accompany them.Otherwise, these songs should have been left to be altered."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's hard to imagine a better screen to stage adaptation.","review":"At first I was disappointed that the musical of the Wedding Singer wouldn't feature the 80s songs that made the movie so much fun, but when I heard the score, I realized that what the writers have done is so much better. The score effortlessly quotes the musical trends and themes from the era, (references range from Joan Jett to New Edition) and pulls of the tricky feat of seeming instantly familiar yet wholly original. The lyrics are often laugh-out -loud hilarious and, when the story calls for it, simple and sincere--often adroitly switching gears mid-line. (\\"Dumpster\\" is a perfect example) The songwriting team walks a tightrope- the soundtrack is an ironic send up of an era and also a musical love story that has you rooting for the characters the whole way. And it's catchy- you'll have \\"It's Your Wedding Day\\" in your head for days- and that's not a bad thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT EXCELLENT CD!!!!!","review":"Easily one of the best musicals I have heard.

The musical is a wannabe \\"Hairspray\\" but it fails in every way possible. It is unoriginal and a regurgitated version of the movie. Stephen Lynch is a great, and funny solo comedian but can't act. He does have a nice voice. Lauren Benanti is no Drew Barrymore. The music and lyrics are pretty bad, and anything but art. This show is a cash cow and that its only purpose.

I also liked a movie I saw him in with The Unknown Comic, so I watched this act.This wasn't that good. It was Dice - but it wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it was as dirty and disgusting as ever, but it was as if he had lost a legal battle and had to start doing 100% politically correct acts if he ever wanted to perform again. He did in fact seem really tired and beaten down in both the performance and some revealing footage before the performance.I'm assuming that's what he meant when he explained that he is \\"over here now\\", and when he said that he was able to move over here because he is a professional. He did not elaborate.Just this one example. Big fat wives are the best kind and their husbands don't treat them right. If a man goes out to play golf when he could be doing his big fat wife, then his big fat wife should be doing every one of his friends. That was about the funniest thing he said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to retire","review":"The only thing worse than this Dice performance is the fact that I had to pay money to watch it. Dice was simply the best circa 1988-1994. He was hilarious and inventive. But there's nothing uglier than a man closing in on his fifties in a black leather jacket spilling out re-hashed dirty joke after re-hasehed dirty joke. While Dice was suitable entertainment when I was 13- 20-years-old, I now find his humor to be ignorantly rude, out of line, and, the bottom line, not funny anymore. His mysoginist act clicked when he had a youthful vibe. But it's time for him to either re-invent his act or get out of comedy. This show was especially sour for my taste after viewing a brilliant Richard Pryor video, \\"Here and Now,\\" the previous weekend."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROLL THE DICE AGAIN","review":"It is time to give it up, all the same jokes and the same shtick, only this time alot less funny.

Honestly, I would not choose this as a potential leisure read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Review","review":"I like the book because it talks about the philosophy and psychology of survival. It isn't a book that says \\"oh, here's a person who is stranded, what will they do--how will they get out of this perdicament?!?!\\" but rather explains the mentality of the survivors, and how that mentality translates into a higher degree of survivability. Really the best thing about the book is the universality of it--it isn't just about surviving the white water rapids, but also about surviving life in general, so it is universally-applicable. Good book. Not necessarily AMAZING, but 4 of 5 stars for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Survival","review":"I was very pleased. The book shipped much faster than promised.

Deep Survival was too shallow and did not have enough information or details to be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was disappointing. It was very disappointing that the author felt it necessary to use extreme coarse language in this book. I understand his justification in doing so to help the reader relate to the type of characters portrayed in the book. Conversely, the coarse language is not necessary to accurately describe the situations presented. I was offended at this language and it only ruined my excitement in reading it. Survival is an exciting subject and I will be looking for other books to read and throwing this one in the garbage. This book had more science about survival than exciting survival stories with survival strategies. The information was interesting, but more like reading a textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose and Redundant","review":"After reading the reviews on the book's back cover, I thought I was in for a real treat.

It would be interesting to know whether he ever did enough to get his father's approval and love. Somehow, I doubt it.In the story about Mt Hood he analyzed why the accident happened but he didn't explain why some people died and some didn't. Maybe he couldn't find a rational explanation.I didn't like the book because I think that the author was more on an ego trip than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Although, there are a few good examples of the concepts the author is trying to explain, his ego and poor writing ability get in the way.

The author seems to be trying so hard to write with a snarky, mega-cool style that he forgets what he's writing about and just jags off to the rhythm of his words. This gets very tedious after a while. If you really want to read about survival, get any book by Jon Krakauer."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Once I started reading it, I really couldn't put it down. I did skim through some (but not most) of the chaos/systems theory sections on my first read-through, and I went back to re-read some of the more dramatic sections, too, to try to picture the events, especially in the mountain-climbing scenario. I've been going on some boy scout outings with my twin sons, and we recently went canoeing in the wilderness for a week. It wasn't exactly an aircraft carrier, but I was making some comparisons as I was reading. (For some people, a camping trip is a survival situation.)

A must read for any adventurer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I bought this book without hesitation; it sounded so interesting! I found after several attempts I just couldn't read it, it was that irritating. A typical page consists of various quotes from other writers (just to show the author knows what he is talking about) and then another reminder (in case we'd missed it the first few hundred times) of what separates \\"survivors\\" from the rest of us. Apparently it's psychology.The author also likes to inject himself straight into the centre of the story. Which can be risky if you aren't particularly likable. Other writers (e.g. Krakauer, who this guy is presumably striving to emulate) know when to stay in the background and let the stories do the talking.Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah","review":"If you are doing a dissertation on the psychology of survival, this is the book for you. Unfortunately, I enjoy how people survive, and would rather get at the story itself, not whether the person has the brain synapses that promote survival. This book has very lengthy, adjective filled paragraphs (ex:\\"If you could see adreneline, then you'd see a great, green, greasy river of it oozing off the beach...\\"), lots of references to where he got his information, that could have been better footnoted, and long explanations of a particular psychological reason for a persons survival or demise. Again, dissertation-read this. Entertainment-pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survival??

Having finished her book \\"Red Sky in Mourning\\" about two months before picking up Gonzalez' book the details were still quite fresh. He points to her actions as a clear example of what not to do to survive, conveniently ignoring that she did survive. His attitude towards her and his hero worship of any man that ever stepped foot in an aircraft made me wonder if there is a male survival experience that is more valuable or noble than a female survival experience?

I do not think the author has ever been in a realsurvival situation.

The author appears to be unqualified and his analysis of each situation is brief and incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improves In Last Half","review":"The survivors' stories make this book worth reading. The author's prose is a bit balky but I think the content justifies the extra effort.

Kind of dry in early parts, gets better toward the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"This book is about more than survival in any element. It has a base theory which I found so interesting. You can apply Gonzales' theory to many parts of your life, not just hiking or crashes. The only problem (if there has to be one) is that it ended. I could have read this book for much longer if he had more stories to tell, which I imagine he does. Anyone can glean some information from this book. Even if you don't do any sports or travel, you will find something that relates to your personal behavior patterns. I love that Gonzales wrote this and am thankful it was recommended to me. Pick it up, read it, let a friend borrow it, read it again. Fantastic stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have to understand survival psychology","review":"I was fascinated by this book. I learned that frequently what separates those who live through tragic accidents and those who parish have different mental states and attitudes.Find out why an experienced firefighter was lost for days in the rugged Colorado mountains, or how a 17 year old girl was the sole survivor in a plane crash in the Amazon jungle...The author quoted a Navy SEAL saying that \\"It's usually the Rambo Types who fail first\\"This book will tell you why. I liked it so much I loaned my copy to a fire fighter friend and bought another copy for my cousin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This was such an interesting book. It is not just for mountaineers, hikers, and daredevils. The tricks for survival are quite interesting for those who never want to set foot inside a tent.

Highly recommended, for those looking for a non fiction read or who just want to learn why some survive when others don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book was a waste of money","review":"this book sounds promising, but was very disappointing. it has some stories that for the most part had a very narrow scope (more survival than just mountain climbing??). the author tries to back up his theories with science, but the reasoning is weak and the logic flawed. overall, i'm truly sorry that i purchased and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldnt get passed the first several chapters...","review":"I was hoping for a great book about stories of survival, what they did, lessons learned and who died, and why - Like the title says.

The book's focus seems to be placed on mental preparation and mindset to the exclusion of other skills, such as how to stay alive in the wilderness or to plan ahead in case of trouble - a big omission to my way of thinking. So, what are the big buck secrets of Deep Survival? This is the sum total of what I learned from it: Stay calm, don't take risks without measuring possible risk/benefit, and don't be macho when your life is on the line. That's it. I didn't really need a whole book to learn that, but your experience may be better than mine. Me, I think Stephen King's character Red said it a lot more succinctly: 'Get busy livin', or get busy dyin..'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense explained with maddening repetitiveness.","review":"This book is poorly written to put it lightly. It's organization is chaotic and it seems to be written by a high school student who is just mirroring the writing styles he finds in the literature he is assigned to read. There is no epiphany contained in this book about why people die while others survive. It's really just common sense explained in academic language and the very common academic repetitiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much jargon","review":"This book is full of interesting information and tales of survival. Unfortunately, the author's ego keeps getting in the way of making it a good book. He includes an irrelevant chapter about motorcycle riding in Baja to tell us that he hangs out with celebrities. And the fascinating stories of survival involving aeronautics, mountaineering and rafting are so filled with jargon that if you don't participate in those activities yourself, you won't have a clue what he is describing. The Survivors' Club is a much better book about the same topic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Survival","review":"Excellent book, different from the beaten path. I could not put it down.I could relate from the experiences of panicking and letting your emotions out of control, it is deadly because in a survival situation you spend all your energy that way.

It is helpful in all walks of life -not just adventure. I heard it originally as a book on tape - twice - and have given it as gifts which have always been enjoyed. My son-in-law in the Air Froce said it would make a great presentation. Everyone should read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Reading","review":"If you enjoy stream-of-conciousness style of writing, then this book is for you. If you are looking for information organized in a logical format, don't bother. I found it irritating that the valuable 2 or 3 sentences of information were imbedded in lots of convoluted horn tooting of all his and his family's accomplishments. The only thing that forced me to keep reading was waiting for the author to get to the point about mind mapping, which he never did! I gladly passed this book on; it's not one that I would want to keep in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently I am in the minority","review":"I thought this book was VERY poorly written and primarily a pontification of the author\\"s very boring, \\"oh and then I survived again aren't I amazing and wonderful, this little humble miracle that I am\\" *accomplishments*. Personal perspective is certainly valid, but not to the degree that he took it. I would have prefered to have heard other people's stories. I am a RN, EMT, trained as a wilderness first responder,climber, skier, trekker,runner, horsewoman, former river guide and I do not underestimate the value of his information and the importance of sharing it, but his style of writing and his boasting just turned me off.

But ultimately, it disappoints. The title is quite deceptive as this book is not \\"Deep\\" at all. It is at best a self-absorbed and scattered summary of some of the more popular recent survival tales interspersed with self-absorbed reflections and plenty of non-scientific doggerel about \\"who lives, who dies, and why.\\" I found it to be poorly written, and most readers will be hard pressed to come away with any answers about \\"who lives, who dies and why\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Outstanding book! I give this book a 5 out of 5 recommendation. This just might be the best book I have read in all of 2010. While this book is about survival, it has implications in all aspects of life.I picked up/was reminded of a few key life points:1. Positive Mental Attitude - The #1 key difference maker for those that survive versus those that do not.2. Be Here Now - be ever mindful of living in the moment and being full engaged in the now.3. Here is not the same as There - Don't compare. Relish in the uniqueness of where you are now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp nonfiction","review":"This book is an easy, fast, enticing read, but ultimately unsatisfying, and even irritating at times. It's not clear if the goal was to write a thriller or an educational book couched in case studies, but the style is pedantic and repetetive. Maybe those two genres (thriller and educational) aren't mutually exclusive, and Gonzalez is bridging the gap, but I laughed quite a lot while reading because of the author's gotta-prove-something and I'm-so-extreme style. The book is a bit like an extended magazine article."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Survival","review":"The book details numerous survival events and circumstances and details the common thread of the actions the survivors took. I bought copies for my three college age kids to read. This is a book that may litterly save your live. What you do in the first minute of a survival event may very well determine if you live or die. I especially appreciate the the rule of threes. You can go three minutes without air, three days without water and three weeks without food. Knowing which problem to solve first is what is important. Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 50 pages.","review":"I wanted to like this book. I love adventure/survival books. The author, instead of telling a captivating story, mixed a bunch of physiological B.S into the mix which took away from the stories he was trying to tell. Want to read a compelling survival book? Go with \\"Into This Air\\" or \\"The history of the Whaleship Essex\\" or Endurance- Shackletons Journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Survival: consistent with experience","review":"Having survived a pretty serious mountaineering accident myself a few years ago, I found the book absolutely fascinating and very consistent with my own experience both as a climber and member of a volunteer mountain rescue organization. I was familiar with many of the survival stories profiled in the book as an avid reader of mountaineering, exploration, and rescue literature. However, this book really helped answer a number of lingering questions I have had about survival, particularly those related to my own accident--about how/why I reacted the way I did and how it led to my own survival.I think the book (particularly the last chapter) will be a very useful addition to the mountaineering and rescue training literature. I will certainly be using portions of this book in upcoming climbing and rescue training that I help design and conduct.Bill RombergAlaska Mountain Rescue Group"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Survival","review":"Fascinating and thought provoking.Came promptly and in good shape for used..

Offering some Zen insights, and a few badly narrated but intriguing case studies, the author's voice kept intervening in strange and ultimately annoying ways, which is perhaps why I didn't really like the book: I found the author's voice annoying. Deep Survival is really more about Gonzales' father than surviving, per se, and he seems to have used the trope of survival to offer a meditation on his Dad's spectacular survival in WW2, which is fine is you want a father memoir, or a WW2 experience, but rather less so if you are more interested in case studies than Pater Gonzales or the author's own masculinist excesses, which were often annoying and badly narrated. In the end, this is memoir-cum-vanity autobiography. I was expecting something more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected - Disappointed","review":"This is one of those rare cases when the average rating on Amazon truly let me down.

Unfortunately the authors ego hamstrings his own ability to bring it to fruition. A good editor coulda/shoulda done it for him. 60% of the book is the author's attempt to review the latest neuro- and other science explaining how our brains work when under extreme stress. 20% of the book is devoted to the completely superfluous stories of his own brushes with danger and palling around with famous buddies like Lyle Lovett and Lyle's Dad. That leaves 20% of book left for the meat - the real stories of real people in extreme situations. The science is interesting, but his attempts to synthesize wildly diverse fields is rambling, repetitious and often just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Survival = Shallow Survival Book","review":"There's nothing here that warrants reading: a bunch of anecdotes about 'survivors' (many of which come from common stories that we all know about) peppered with the author's ridiculous monday-morning quarterbacking.

There is no coherent theory of what 'deep survival' is; just a bunch of illogical ramblings.Keywords for this book: junk-science, name-dropping, bragging, preaching, rambling, boasting, non-sensical.One last thing to mention is that there are way way too many quotations, like a bad 8th grade essay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very excited when I first started reading this book because the concept is so promising. I was expecting story after story of outdoor adventures gone bad along with an analysis of why the people did (or didn't) survive. Whatever this book is, it definitely isn't that.I gave up on this book after four chapters, so maybe it gets better later on, but the parts I read were very haphazardly put together. Accounts from real life survival stories are intermixed with the author's philosophy on survival physiology.

Hmm. Not quite the same spirit of exploring a wide world. The whole gambit thing is overkill for this game. FFIII on DS Lite was better in terms of game play.Graphics- cutscenes are beautiful, in-game characters are laughable.The wait for FF13 on PS3 is simply too long. Before then, I will save my bucks for the FFVII Crisis Core on PSP, where the games are slightly more catered towards teens, not what feels like age 5 and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The game sucks.","review":"This was going to be a scathing review, but the store let me return this for full price - so I'm a lot less angry now.Let me say that I'm a fan of the Final Fantasy series, my favorite being Final Fantasy Advance Tactics for the GBA. I wasn't crazy about any of the Crystal Chronicles. That said, this game sucks. And I mean badly.First of all, the gameplay is painfully frustrating. You have to use the stylus to encircle and attack enemies that are often off-screen. It takes so much dragging and swiping to get the screen to move, and when it finally moves, you and your foes are never on screen at the same time. On top of that, the camera view moves so slowly that by the time you and your enemies are meeting, everybody in your team is already half dead.Then the characters are way too small to see. Break out you bifocal reading glasses.This game looks and plays like it should cost 9.99 retail. It's very cheap looking and poorly done. Worst game ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Expectations","review":"After purchasing and beating Final Fantasy III, I was excited to finally buy this one. I figured the storyline would be along the same line as Final Fantasy III, but it was confusing and totally different. They constantly introduced new parts of the story, and even at the end of chapter 9, I have no idea why I'm still battling. The graphics are crap compared to Final Fantasy III. Square Enix should stick to designing the characters as 3-d chibis, not pixeley squares designed to look like characters. Also, the controls are whacked and the things ment to help you don't make sense at all. Overall, super research the next final fantasy game you plan on buying, because you never know what you're gonna get."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the?","review":"I'm not the final fantasy fan that plays every single one. I tend to take my time and I was ready to play another final fantasy game. So I went and got this and I'm not really happy with it at all. I don't like the whole battling point and click then walk like a snail while I tell the other dudes to walk like snails and then die thing. I tried though but it still didn't do it for me. I rather go to the DMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be \\"Final Fantasy Tactics XII\\"","review":"I thought that since the game only had the words \\"Final Fantasy\\" that it would be a traditional RPG from SquareEnix. Boy, was I wrong! Once again, SquareEnix strays from the traditional RPG path and creates something new that makes this game feel more like Final Fantasy Tactics. The cutscenes are amazing, but that's about it. If you want an action-oriented game that relies more on click-and-point instead of the traditional RPG style, then this game is for you. If not, you should look at another Final Fantasy title offered for the Nintendo DS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the game.","review":"My wife hated this type of game, with all of the killing. She played it for about 3 hours and then I sold it on eBay."},{"rating":"2","title":"FFXII: FUN","review":"I didn't expect a strategy RPG like this, but as my first strategy RPG I love it! It took a short while for me to get used to using the stylus almost entirely to control the group, but after I got the hang of it it felt like second nature to me. I would really like to play more games like this. It is a very engaging method of playing and I haven't felt this \\"in to\\" a game since I played FF: 3 & Chrono Trigger on the SNES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz...","review":"After three weeks of deep immersion in FF XII (the PS2 game), my expectations were probably too high for Revenant Wings. I suspended disbelief willingly at first, then with some effort, and finally not at all -- RW gets worse, over time. Like FF Tactics, this is a battle rattle for RTS boys, with a glut of sophomoric Japanese idealistic fantasizing about teamwork, plus a few cloyingly sweet short movies for FF's other demographic, infantile girls. But seriously folks, I have a real beef with the creators of this game: The gratuitous gory details about viera outcasts were peurile and underdramatized, to quote Wednesday Adams. With all the possibilities in that backstory, to just chop it off undeveloped was sad and very rude. It would have been better not to mention it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozefest","review":"I am a devout Final Fantasy fan, and I loved XII, so this games was a HUGE disappointment for me. The plot and character motivations are flimsy, so I'm not really sure why I'm fighting in the first place. But even worse, the combat style is terribly boring! You spend lots of time and energy putting together your own personal army of summoned creatures, but if you think you'll be able to keep them alive, think again. The battles become these big lumps of chaos, and it's difficult to precisely target characters, so healing is a pain. Even your main characters are almost impossible to keep alive for long. And everyone moves soooo slooooowlyyyyyy. This game put me to sleep. Square Enix, you can do better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"divine comedy","review":"I have read this book and reviewed its contents with many of my peers who have read this book as a class subject.

In light of this, I, having read many, many books on the topic, would have to rate this as quite possibly the best. Though many other books have been written in an \\"encyclopedia\\" form concerning the Intelligence community and spying, THE ULTIMATE SPY BOOK is very concise, informative, and generally provided me with what I was looking for. Kudos to H. Keith Melton on asuperb book."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"H. Keith Melton's account is amazing! Explains how they recruit spy, the types of undercover agents,famous spying operations,the gear, and a section on training. The gear is amazing, and half of it requires a permit. Silenced weapons, gas guns and all kinds of bugs ( listening devices). Recommended for anyone with the slightest intrest in special operations. Has 2 high-profile forwards, by a former CIA head and a former KGB head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource on Cold War tools of the trade!","review":"H. Keith Melton has literally produced \\"The Ultimate Spy Book!\\" This book is very informative on not only a large collection of tools of the trade, but chock-full of short write-ups on famous spies and missions performed during the days of spy and counterspy. Everything from silenced weapons to entry devices to sabotage devices. Almost every item listed is accompanied by color photos and a description of the item's application in wartime operations. No matter what your interest in the clandestine world of the Cold War is, this book is a must-have resource!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent graphics, but ...","review":"Anyone who reads this book will be amazed by the unlimited imagination of man. The ways spies find to conceal and miniaturize their equipment are unbelievable. After reading this book, you'll never laugh at James Bond's gadgets. Those films don't show a fraction of it. I must say that this book's highest point is the graphic and design: the book is big, good for a coffe table, has a sleeve cover, the paper is of the finest possible, the pictures are clear, everything following the Dorling-Kindersley tradition. The introductory texts and the history of espionage I thought that were a little confuse and vague, so be warned: the book is remarkable by the equipment part (the longest section, more than half of it, I think), but if you want an insight look at history and info of espionage look out for another book. All in all, a good job by this Melton guy, he really got into the work of finding the stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I am fascinated with past and modern day espionage.

The amount of knowledge in this book is amazing and I can not wait for his new book \\"Ultimate Spy\\" to come out. If you like real spy stories or real James Bond style gadgets, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly History","review":"I found this book to be well organized and informative. It reads a lot like an encyclopedia, but without being in alphabetical order. There is quite a bit of duplication from one section to another, but it is all due to what I will call cross-referencing. Each subject is covered in two pages, which means a lot of graphics for short subjects. Longer ones end up with parts II and sometimes III. Always arranging subjects with these space limitations made we wonder what might be left out. My one real complaint is that it read more like a history, rather than an ultimate source. I realize that current information is only available in small amounts, if that, but it still would have been nice to have a section that discussed the topic as well as it could be. If my review sounds a little negative, I did give it four stars and enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PSP Tribal Flames Skin","review":"I bought this skin for my girlfriend psp that i got her for Valentines Day, 1st of all the skin is stiff and the sticker is thick so it won't bend to your psp curves.

No matter how much i push it back down it keeps coming back up and peeling. This is only after less then 24 hours of being put on the psp. So i would stay away from this skin, it's junk and shouldn't be put on your trash can let alone your psp system.

You'll need to hide it if you want to keep from having to read it numerous times daily. Mine wore out after nearly 3 years of use, and I have been unable to replace it.

First, the general discussion of pressure cooking isn't that detailed, but most of all, the title of the book is misleading - I thought that I was getting a book with \\"general\\" recipes - but the book is limited to just mediterranean recipes. The book cover does not reveal that the recipes are limited to such recipes, and I think that it should.

For what I paid, I have definitely gotten my money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Everyone","review":"This book was extremely disappointing. I was looking for my first book on pressure cooking, and this one had nothing that my family would have wanted to eat.

Some of the other books that I had tried to read on the endgame just seemed too darn difficult for beginners. The difficulty was that there was just so much information to memorize. Pandolfini's book made the memorization of the themes much easier by giving each technique a catchy name. Then, you are led step by step to more complicated techniques by successively building upon the ones you have just learned. This is good pedagogy. I would recommend this to any beginner to get a good understanding of what you need to know to play the endgame."},{"rating":"1","title":"End Your Game...","review":"I just can't deal with typos, maybe thats just me. Well let us just say this book has its share. There are better endgame books on the market. Maybe this would confuse more than help a novice cuz of the errors. If your used to rushed out books with what lumps some positions as common. Jacks in a few lines that have errors and are not even checked sometimes. Then you would just love this book to death. The price is not so bad for the book, so least that is something. So if you wanna get a thrifty book over a good one, go for this one. You can get a bunch of books from this black hole. Most smart people just avoid books from this author. So to anyone that does not know better, be very weary getting books from this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Gotta Start Somewhere","review":"This book is a good place to start learning about endgames. It progresses from the most basic positions to more detailed. The explanations are easy for a beginner to understand. The author, a well known chess teacher, emphasizes basic concepts.Most endgame books are boring beyond belief and can be very discouraging for the less experienced player. It was really nice to learn in a visual way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advanced Beginner - Intermediate","review":"This book gradually evolves from the simple/obvious mating combinations to the more subtle strategies of endgames involving pawns and minor pieces. Working through the later examples changed the way I approach my endgame.For me, the \\"best\\" part of the book was the approach the author took with achieving either stalemate when you are down material or in avoiding stalemate when you are even/up material. This was incredibly enlightening.The only reason I would remove a star is that some additional detail would be helpful in the advanced strategies. For example, in the efforts to promote pawns, there is a discussion of critical squares for the King but not the formula for that determination. While I believe I understand the concept, more information would have been useful.Other reviews discuss \\"misprints\\" of the chess boards in Pandolfini's books -- but this one had much fewer than the Traps & Zaps book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"I'm a Life-Master. I currently teach chess full-time to make my living. All the endings you need to know are in here, maybe a few you don't. Most players do not want to take the time and trouble to study endings, its just too much work. But if you really want to get better, there is no way around it. I could offer many criticisms of this book, but I won't. They are mostly VERY minor. Bottom line? If you are under 2100, or if you have ever blown an ending, this book belongs on your chess bookshelf. Or better yet, don't buy it. Don't study it. Then put a sign on your back. I'll bribe someone to play you at the next tournament. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up","review":"On this surface, the pandolfini book looks good, but once you dig down, you discover all is not as it seems. The main problem, as I see it, is that it's a book of winning positions with titles like mate in 2 or mate in 3. Unfortunately, *that* is the easiest part of the endgame, and getting your opponent to that position is basically not covered.What it TRIES to do (and i think it fails here) is give you small pieces of the endgame puzzle as individual positions, and then piece them together. I just don't think this is effective, and would recommend something along the lines of Winning Chess Endings instead, which seems to take a more robust approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Endgame Strategy Book","review":"Pandolfini writes in a way that is clear, logical, and just plain easy to understand. Any of his books are \\"must haves\\" for a solid chess library. His Endgame book covers an area that I belive is often overlooked in favor of the latest opening. This book is just what it says, a \\"course on endgame concepts\\" that would benefit any chess player."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Pandolfini's finest works","review":"No Hype!

Covering the Macross Saga, this core rulebook allows players to be human or Zentraedi characters with a choice of 9 character classes and over 100 skill selections. All Earth and alien mecha are included, as well as convential equipment and vehicles. Although not perfect in execution or design, The Robotech RPG is still a fun and easy book to pick up and play."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Game for those who like Rifts","review":"The only reason why I'm writing this is because of a particularly biased review that I happened to come across, one that disturbed me greatly. (It may or may not be there, but you might notice it.) Well anyway, this book is actually quite good for any GM or player who's interested in a futuristic campangne setting, more-so if you happen to like Robotech (Macross). Also, this was the first RPG that I actually really got to play and I found the rules to be easy to understand yet in-depth enougth to keep me playing it with my friends several years later. Also, most of the information in the book is pretty much accurate there are a few mistakes but there all small, insignificant ones. It's a shame that Palladium Books didn't renew the licence this past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Good!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is a really good way to start with the Robotech RPG series, but it really needs two other books with it to make it good. Add in Book 3: Zentreadi and Book 2: RDF Manual, and you're set. Along with the Robotech ATP (acellerated training program), it will provide hours of fun with you and your friends.

Written in poor english and full of grammatical, technical, and historical inaccuracies, this book not only mocks everything that is Robotech, but also does it while never presenting anything nearing a fully functional role-playing system. The rules are half-done quick jobs, and trying to play the game proves my point, demonstrating how nearly impossibly unworkable the system is. Its only even nearly useful purpose would potentially be as a reference manual, but then again half the information inside the book is incorrect anyway.Oh, and Mr. Siembieda, HWR stands for Heavy War Robot, just like MBR is Main Battle Robot. *tch* Howitzer...

However, casual readers should be aware that this work is first and foremost an academic analysis of transportation economics, and completely free of the glossy nostalgia characteristic of most railroad lore. His descriptions of individual railroads and the narrow-gauge phenomenon in general focus on economics (I now have a newfound respect for the word \\"receivership\\"), rather than the equipment and the frontier atmosphere that attract many railroad enthusiasts. Nevertheless, the hard work pays off in the end: I now understand why common-carrier narrow gauge railroads were largely doomed to failure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why failure was inevitable","review":"As one would expect of a university press book, this is a scholarly monograph. It sets out to answer the question of why American narrow gauge railroads failed. Along the way the author presents a very readable story of these railroads, along with maps and many photographs. The last third of the book lists all the railroads by name and gives a short history. Very useful to historians, railfans, and model builders.

As a past youth worker (20+ years) it would be laughable (or cry-able) if you were to show this to teens, saved or unsaved. My step daughter is not very close to God and she watched it with us Christmas night. Now, it may be near impossible to get her to watch any other Christian movie. And there are some very good ones out there. Fireproof. To Save a Life. Far beyond the quality of this and using church members and friends as actors. Dont waste your money.

I'm all for feminism, but after watching my GF who speaks English as a second language (Korean as her first), the large number of ridiculous and very hard to understand descriptions using pointless grammar ruin the book. If the author had truly cared about informing the reader about feminism and less about trying to seem like a super genius with her 25 pounds over overly complicated descriptions in a 5 pound description bag, she would have likely succeeded.This book was a disappointment and frustrating read, there are much better books out there on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to pass opinion as fact","review":"Bell Hook's book is a poor attempt to try and pass her opinion as fact. She tries to make the case that feminism is for everyone by stating broad generalities that are not backed up by any form of statistics or research. Also, there are many typo errors throughout the book that is just unprofessional. Her book is more of a gripe against white men, her current view of feminism, and the glorification of the working class rather than actually explaining what feminism is about. I would not recomend her book to anyone because she poorly attempts to pass her opinion as fact. Ms. Hooks should seriously reconsider how she deveolps her arguments and doing some research on her broad generalizing statements before she publishes her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move to this","review":"Bell hooks's book is an excellent introduction to the study of feminist politics. With clear and concise language, she revisits the beginnings of the movement, and tells us where it is now. She also succintly explains why feminism is not anti-male, anti-sex, or anti-family, but rather feminism is the struggle against rigid sexism in patriarchal cultures. Despite its plague of editorial errors, the book is highly recommended for the non-academic language and for the encouraging message hooks offers us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarity on the Feminist Movement and where it can go next","review":"Bell Hooks is an articulate and inspired writer. This book is a great primer to give to friends and family to inform them about the feminist movement...since many people hear only what the mainstream media has to say...this book takes into account the perspectives of black and white women/men.A free-thinker leverages the brilliance of others to enable him/her in developing and testing his/her own ideas...this is one author which will certainly help you in testing and developing your own ideas on feminism and patriarchy.It is concise, easy reading. It also clearly reflects many of the same historical points which I recently saw on the PBS special \\"Not For Ourselves Alone\\"...a program about the early suffrage movement pioneers, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn how to use commas!","review":"This isn't a full review rather just a comment on the readability of the text. I don't know if this book was unedited or what, but it is very difficult to read. Perhaps there is a thumb tack on Bell Hook's comma key, as she is very reluctant to use it. Example:\\"Despite the economic gains of individual feminist women, many women who have amassed wealth or the contribution of wealthy males, who are our allies in struggle we have created no schools founded on feminist principles for girls and boys, for men and women.\\"This is just one out of hundreds of hard to comprehend sentences throughout \\"Feminism is for Everyone.\\" There are also run on sentences, sentences that start with \\"And\\" and a large amount of incomplete sentences. Perhaps Bell Hooks thinks that proper English writing rules were made up by men and that she is expressing individuality by flouting them. Whatever the reason, it makes the grammar nazi inside me die a little every time I open the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminism Is For Everybody except.........","review":"As a life long feminist, I have always espoused that feminism is about inclusion. This book opposes that belief. The title would lead one to beleive that Ms. Hooks feels the movement of feminism should include people from all walks of life.That is not what you will discover. She refers to our feminist pioneers as \\"priveledged, educated white woman\\", and feels fit to use the term \\"housewives\\" throughout her book to describe woman(mothers) who do not work outside of the home.I haven't heard anyone use that term seriously for a couple of decades. Apparently these two categories of women are not fit to wear the \\"feminist\\" label.The background she provides for the early days of the feminist movement is educational for someone new to the movement. But, when all is said and done, she is a fringe feminist and one needs to understand that before reading this book. I found it somewhat difficult getting through this book with the numerous editorial errors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For beginners","review":"I think bell hooks attempts, in all of her books to make sure that anyone, regardless of class or location can read her book and understand it. Too often, the books that are more \\"complex\\" tend to be geared at the small number of people who can spend their time reading every little thing about an issue--i.e. those who are college educated. However, those people who work all day, have families to care for, and needs that most college students don't have to worry about, can pick up this book and feel involved in the quest for gender equality. It is empowering and informational and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Condition","review":"I was uneasy about buying things used on Amazon, but this book was in very good condition, and it came faster than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ","review":"LOVE this book! It's a great introduction to feminism and how sexism affects various aspects of daily life. I recommend and share this book with anyone who asks me about feminism. It's a pretty quick, informative read, without using academic jargon, anyone can relate. Anything by bell hooks is great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Close To Useless As Could Be","review":"Awful. Just awful. I know the book is inexpensive, but I literally would not have paid more than 25 cents for it if I had seen it before purchase. Very little information about few types of shakers. Spend a little more for the excellent Gene Florence book."},{"rating":"2","title":"anyone in the education field should read this!","review":"A diary account of the day by day occurances in a Montessori classroom. What is truely fascinating is the way this teacher closely observes the children and know when (and when not) to help and give assistance. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is confused about how the Montessori classroom operates. It is very informative and gives you an insider's viewpoint on the Montessori method of education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one word needed : Inspirational !","review":"Having taught for a number of years in a Montessori environment, this book was like a breath of fresh air. From the first page I was hooked, understanding all. The book gave my staff and I may wonderful ideas for our classrooms, and made us really focus in on the importance of the Montessori method again. The best book to give to new staff members, Directresses or assistants; parents. So inspirational at a time when we were in a rut. Thank-you Paula for writing such a vailable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great teaching guide","review":"I bought this product for my girlfriend. She is an early childhood education major in college, and has taken a great interest in the Montessori teaching style. So far she has throughly enjoyed the book and simply been unable to set it down. I guess it must be a great read for those interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"all new and perfect","review":"I ordered it new and it arrived on time and the package is perfect. i'm really satisfied with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Montessori in the Classroom: A Teacher's Account of How Children Really Learn","review":"This is a must read for every teacher of young children!

I was instantly absorbed, engrossed in the story and driven to read until the wee small hours to see what happened to Bron Haltern and his mysterious foes. It was the first time I'd ever done that and I still (after nearly 30 years!) remember the excitement.I've re-read it many times and, yes, it does have some major plot holes but I'd still count it as 'intelligent space opera'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best space opera I ever read.","review":"I have read this excellent book about ten years ago. Since that time I read it regularly at least once a month.In my opinion it is the best book ever written.Great, splendit, excellent, brilliant and so on...I am grateful that Collin Kapp had written \\"The patterns of chaos\\".Thanks, Collin. Take care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Hard Sci-Fi.","review":"A Hard Sci-fi book, Yet it was a good story, kapp was able to keep you interested despite the deep predictive chaos theory. The story is about aliens that are attacking our worlds through the science of chaos theory which is like predicting results. They know all the moves we will make... A man named Bron is a wild card, he makes the most illogical choices that throw a monkey wrench into their fool proof plans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"A collection of unequal short stories. I enjoyed Guardian and Werewolf. As for the other stories, only expectations that the next story would be better kept me reading them. That collection is a disappointment to me because the death concern generally is an inspiring theme. Not so this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great by any means.","review":"I'll grudgingly give this book 2 stars. This whole \\"on-the-edge\\", \\"experimental\\" story format has GOT to go. It may have been cool when he was doing it way back when, but now it just seems like he's aping himself. Come back Harlan, I know you're in there somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master working at the peak of his powers","review":"\\"Angry Candy\\" is possibly Ellison's strongest collection of stories to date. Virtually every entry in the table of contents is a gem. For myself, highlights include \\"Paladin Of The Lost Hour\\" (a beautiful tale of friendship, time lost, and time found), \\"Laugh Track\\" (an uproarious parody of the television industry), \\"With Virgil Oddum At The East Pole\\" (a meditation on art and redemption) and Eidolons (a series of related koan-like vignettes which will require very thoughtful reading). The whole book resounds with Ellison's characteristic mix of horror and beauty, humor, anger, and wonder, along with a generous dash of spleen. Whether he makes you laugh, or weep, or just pisses you off (or all three!), you will not remain unmoved."},{"rating":"2","title":"A handbook for grief recovery","review":"I ready Angry Candy soon after my Father's death, and I'm sure the strength of my reaction to it was heavily influenced by that. But this book meant a tremendous amount to me in dealing with my grief. My Dad died well, he had time to make sure that there was nothing left unsaid. Perhaps that is why Angry Candy was such a great outlet for my rage that had no outlet and no real cause.Rage will turn to despair and finally to peace; only the love of friends (and I consider Angry Candy a very close friend indeed) will speed and ease the process.I strongly recommend Lou Reed's \\"Magic and Loss\\" as background music for Angry Candy. The medium is different but the emotion is the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbearable","review":"I couldn't get through much of this garbage, and I recommend anyone thinking of reading it do some browsing of the pages at a library or even via Amazon's nifty feature that lets you read a few pages, before you make a terrible mistake. This overblown windbag (Ellison) is so full of himself that his masturbatory writing style oozes filthy wetness right off the page. I had to look this guy up after reading some stuff, and it turns out he's a real jerk in person too, which explains a lot actually. I recommend doing some research on the author even more than even his books. You will be sickened by the thought of reading anything puked up from that mind. Just remember, you're reading a book written by someone who thinks he's better than you and wants everyone to know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We purchased this item based on the reputation Nautica has for producing high quality products. The material on the top of the comforter is very flimsy & tears easily. In the first week the comforter tore while simply making the bed. It has since torn twice more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Buy","review":"I bought this comforter for my son, and I immediately returned it! It looks so cute in the picture, but the comforter is horrible quality. The fabric is knit-like, so the batting underneath comes through the fabric so the comforter never looks clean. The material under the fabric (batting) is pillow-like, not something you would expect in a comforter. I could see it not wearing well with active kids. Do not buy this comforter, way too much money for the quality. For the same price you could go to Pottery Barn Kids and get a high quality quilt!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for preschool transition!","review":"This book was a great help to my daughter when we were getting her ready for preschool the first time. She was almost 3 years old and had never been away from her mom or dad before. She is also rather shy. She loved the book and kept it with her all the time. We read it at night and any other time during the day she wanted to hear it. I have recommended this book to many people to help the transition. The transition to preschool went really well since she knew what to expect and she asks to go to school all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"really helped my girl","review":"My daughter was very apprehensive about starting pre-school at age 3 1/2. This book helped to explain what school is like and what to expect. She didn't want to go and this book helped to convince her to try it. Now in month 2 she really loves school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for parents!","review":"I just bought this book for my 2.5-year-old daughter who is going to start preschool in a few weeks. I was amazed at how it held her attention and how the illustrations caught her eye. She asked many questions. Perhaps more importantly, though, the book answered many of MY questions as a parent. Preschool wasn't very popular when I was younger, and so this is an experience that I never had. The book addresses many of the details of preschool and incited excitement and curiosity for both the grown-up and the toddler reader ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too analytical for a preschooler","review":"I bought this book to read to my 2.5 year old who was about to start preschool. I was hoping it would help her transition but the book was terrible. Every page has several paragraphs of \\"what to expect\\" information that goes right over my preschooler's head. She doesn't like the book at all, not even the pictures. I wish I would have returned it but didn't want to pay the shipping when the book was so inexpensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too wordy","review":"I got this book for my 2yo who starts preschool in the fall. There are many first time school books but most of them are all \\"I'm nervous about school\\" or \\"I'm worried about school\\" or \\"why school isn't scary.\\" I didn't want to introduce school with such negativity. However, this book is way way way too wordy. No way he sits through it. It was $3.99 so I don't think I'll waste postage sending it back, but I'd skip this one. I also bought \\"Hooray Hooray Preschool Day\\" which is much more age appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wordy For Kids","review":"My son loves listening to me read, and can sit still for long books. But this book was over the top, I am not sure that any young child would be interested in listening to this book. My son lost interest on the very first page.However, I went through the book again and used my own words to go with the pictures and he enjoyed it.Overall, I wish I had not ordered this book. I should have listened to the other reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"too wordy for a preschooler","review":"I bought this book for my reluctant preschooler and it's far too wordy to keep his attention. I would buy \\"I love school\\" before buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"story\\"","review":"This book is not a \\"story\\" about preschool, it is more of a question and answer... providing definitions. For example, what is a teacher? Not something my son was interested in.... he much prefers stories about going to preschool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Model makes great scale models","review":"I started collecting scale prebuilt WWll \\"warbirds\\" some time ago. Most are all metal replicas by several manufactuers costing 30 to 70 dollars. It's hard to find the exact markings if you're looking for a specific squadron. Easy Model has one of the best selections of planes and helicopters you can find. Each of their models has several different, authentic marking schemes.They are all plastic but look as good as my much more expensive metal models.A highly recommended line of scale models for a collector (they are not play toys)from a WWll, Vietnam era collector who now has over 40 planes, choppers ships and even a few tanks....in several scales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plink...plonk...kerrrrannnggg!","review":"The above title sums up much of this release from the usually interesting Schleiermacher. Most of the pieces are beyond dissonant, messy, pointless and meandering. To make things worse, toy pianos are used on several tracks alongside a somewhat misplaced notion of what music actually is. Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against the avant-garde and/or experimental, but really, come now...Recommended for therapists and the vengeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice case, but do not purchase for use with the armband","review":"pros: The case is very nice, fits ipod well and the wheel still works nicely.cons: Has a a clip on the back of the case that allows it to lock into the belt clip, so ipod won't lay flat in case. Is meant to be clipped on the armband with a belt clip. This is a complete joke, as ipod flops all around during exercise and could easily fall off the armband. I can not reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolverine Bobblehead Rocks!","review":"I bought this Wolverine bobblehead for my wife--an Ozalot (a fan of Hugh Jackman in the Broadway show \\"The Boy From Oz\\")--and she loves it. I was amazed at the high quality of the craftsmanship and artistry involved. The oversized head is a spitting image of Mr. Jackman as Wolverine. It's a lot of fun. My only concern is that the head is so big and heavy that it might not be durable if one plays with it too much, but it's quite a sight to see. I would highly recommend it as a gift for any Jackman or X-Men fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but Not better than the first","review":"Its an interesting movie. I watched this before I even watched the first one. Couldn't find the first one anywhere until I subsribed to prime. Its a very intriguing movie. The relationship between charles and giselda is interesting, when he met her he was in his early 20s, she was in her 50s and fell in love. This story depicts how cold giselda was and left a fearful and lasting impression of her. Jorge Rivi makes the documnetary imo, being giselda right hand man, he had much more personal and interesting stories to tell rather than charles who was at the tail end of her cocaine run.The first one is the best one, it was more at depth, They spoke with former defense lawyers of giselda,rivi, fellow police offers, drug traffickers(people paid to smuggle drugs in the country), the in depth look at the hit squad of the columbia. intricate operations, miami in the 70s and 80s etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the original Cocaine Cowboys","review":"CC2 really has nothing to do with Cocaine Cowboys except that Griselda Blanco is mentioned. CC2 is the glamorization of Charles Cosby's (who?) successful life of crime and his thug cronies. It's hardly a documentary and shouldn't be a sequel to CC1. If your looking for a follow up to the captivating, well written, well edited, and well produced CC1, this is not it. If you want a hour and a half long rap video to go along with your Scarface collection, have at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEEP!","review":"This time we got to know the \\"godmother\\" up close and personal, if hollywood slept on the first installment i guranntee they'll jump on this one(if the bootleggers dont beat'um to the punch) But solid story line front to back. I must say \\"godmother\\" was indeed a very complex individual"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Griselda Blanco story!","review":"This is the CHARLES COSBY story. Cosby was the lover of Blanco during and after her stay in prison, and nearly all of the story is told by him. VERY dubious credibility, and just plain dull. Cop \\"The Godmother\\" by Richard Smitten and skip this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The first movie was entertaining. Don't waste your time watching the second one. It's about a dude that's so full of himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Griselda is serious","review":"This is a awesome look into the life of the \\"Cocaine Madam\\". It find this story to be very truthful and edgy. It is great movie but you definitely should watch \\"Cocaine Cowboys I\\" if you want a more intricate look at the industry as this movie is more so based on Griselda than it is on the business itself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping + Animation re-enactments make it more visually understandable = LIFE is STRANGER than FICTION.","review":"It contains a lot of strange and riveting revelations. For example, it showed how the actions of the two secretaries helped Charles Cosby escape prosecution for drug trafficking. It's like the stuff from a Best Selling Novel. I could never have thought of it!There must be some exaggeration of course. It's because most of the movie was based on interviews with drug dealers. There's no way to verify most of their claims. However, that does not reduce the entertaining value of the film.This is the first documentation I watched that used animation for scenes that are difficult to be re-enacted. That helped tremendously.No wonder some people want to sell drugs. They can become millionaire in a very short time. LIFE is indeed STRANGER than FICTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it.. CC1 is better.","review":"Cocaine Cowboys 2 has nothing to do with CC1, Only some dude who was grossly involved and romantic with this monster,too urban, tries to make it look \\"cool\\" but there is nothing cool about Drugs. stay away from the movie, CC1 is better. I hope there is no more of this Filth that has been way-overdone. Hopefully by watching this and similar films you would get the idea that no matter how much you vow to change and give back, this is NO Life to lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lame, embellished rap video....","review":"This movie fails in many ways but here are main ones1)Its not Cocaine Cowboys. Its tries soooo hard to be like the first movie that it falls flat on its face.2)Charles Cosby. Charles who? you may ask. the main character is unlikable and quite frankly not believable.3)The story itself. I am sure there are parts that are real but I would venture to say alot of this junk is made up.One the whole: unlike the first captivating movie this \\"sequel\\" is just a badly made rap video. There alot of segues that are blantant ripoffs of other movies-like the part Charles tells us the \\"art\\" of making crack--Cmon that almost right out of Menace to Society."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!

My nails are fairly soft and most files are to abrasive to do a good job on them.

It is good enough to stand as an acceptable book on its own merits. Well-written and enjoyable. The story involves a trio trucking beer across Africa. Sort of a comedic Wages of Fear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real thing.","review":"I don't expect anything wonderful from a movie product. Plastic is to be expected. But this was a repackaged 'Executioner's Axe' with the tag still left on. It looks nothing like Gimli's axe, makes no pretense even to look like Gimli's. It's not official merchandise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pedal Overall","review":"Overall this is a great pedal board. The board itself is built quite well and seems sturdy. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the power supply setup could be better. I'd prefer it if a standard computer power cable (think and tough) plugged into that back of the board instead. The current cable seems a little flimsy and easy to tear/break. Due to that it might not be the best choice for gigging."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid... but heavy","review":"I've owned and gigged one for about a year now.

The padding is thick enough, and the zippers seem pretty sturdy. Have not tried the power supply yet, but there are many connector options included. My only complaint is it's pretty heavy even without pedals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad. Not good either.","review":"This is actually 2 books in one. The synopsis is listed elsewhere, I'll skip that.The first book is complete and fairly interesting.The second book is a cliff hanger and you will need to get the next book (the stars at war II) to know the end of the story.Honor Harrington series is much better. If you are a video game / space opera fan, you may like this book. If not, I'd recommend passing. If you can't get enough of the fleet action sequences in Honor Harrington, then you may like this book.For a First Contact book with much less (but enough!) combat sequences, I HIGHLY recommend \\"Enders Game\\" instead.Ender's Game (The Ender Saga)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I find it amazing what publishers will do to sell books! I bought this book believing it was another addition in the series, but I find out that it is a combination of two previous novels (Crusade & In Death Ground) in the series! I originally believed the series was very enjoyable, but after the last fiasco I believe it will strongly leave a doubt in my mind on continuing reading the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always disappointed with Baen books","review":"I have several authors I like in the Baen stable. Lois McMaster Bujold, Elizabeth Moon, David Drake and David Weber are a few. During the Honor Harrington series, Baen kept delaying and extending the period between hardcover and paperback publication by as much as a year and a half. I keep what I like and have no room for hard covers, which complicates reading a series because of Baen's business practices. Now they are compiling previous books under new titles. I haven't purchased a new Baen book in 3 years as a result of Baens greedy and questionable practices. If I have to wait, I'll wait long enough to pick it up in a used book store and by then I'll know if Baen is pulling another one.By the way, all the books republished in this renamed series were excellent. I would strongly recommend them if they are ever published by a different publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless - a waste of time and money","review":"Like the first reviewer, I pre-ordered this book thinking it was a NEW work by the authors. I am a fan of both, but I already have both Crusade and In Death Ground. If you haven't read the two books included therein, this would be a good purchase. Otherwise, save your money. Baen books and Amazon should have disclosed that the book is a reprint, but I guess to do so would hurt their sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a NEW work!","review":"It is not a new book, it is a combination. If I had not picked it up in a brick/mortar Barnes & Noble (and put it back even faster!) I would have bought it at full retail.

I would prefer In Death Ground be combined with The Shiva Option, honestly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Art Gem","review":"Informative reading and interesting to look at, The small format restrict some of the details of Bruegel's intricate artwork.

And it wasn't believeable. Is it a cliche to say the characters were 2 dimensional? Well they were. I didn't get past 15 pages. Sorry Edith Felber. I don't know who Mary Jo Putney is (except for the glowing review your book cover boasts) but she has terrible taste in writers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I've searched high and low for exactly this information. Instead of tons of details that you don't really need to know, you get a step-by-step process telling you exactly what to do to promote your music from the ground up - information that nobody seems to want to tell you. This book is a ready made business plan for those who want to play and promote their music without depending on major labels. It has totally motivated me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable learning tool","review":"This book can really help do-it-yourselfers. I got some badly needed knowledge from this book. However keep in mind that HIS game plan doesn't have to be the ONLY way to go about releasing a CD. Some of his ideas were overkill. Example: Getting a reseller's licence (to save $160) was way too much of a pain in the butt for me. Wait until your next bigger batch of CD 's. Other game plans of his weren't right for my project. Example: It worked better for me to promote to radio FIRST (before finding distribution). I will also note that Mr. Sweeney NEVER replied to the \\"Free Evaluation\\" cut-out that I sent in to him. Still a good book though. Better than Kashif's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, Concise, and Comprehensive","review":"Sweeney provides all the inside information you need for successfully producing an indie record, and his concise writing style allows you to avoid wasting your valuable time. I generally followed his advice in producing my political parody CD (\\"Bill Clinton -- Vast Bubba Cons\\"), and now my record is getting airplay and quickly moving up the Amazon sales rankings. I noticed that the people who are critical of this book refuse to provide their names and email addresses, which suggests to me that they may be affiliated with his less successful competitors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought!","review":"I looked at the other reviews before buying this book. I even talked to other musicians I knew to see if they knew about it. While some of the reviews are negative, all the musicians I knew who read the book had gotten something out of it.Just by following the information in the book, I decided to start my own indie label at the beginning of this year. I am now selling almost 1,000 CDs at shows and in stores becuase of the info in the book. I used college radio promotion companies before and got little sales even though my music charted. Now I know why.I thought $24.95 was high priced but after Sweeney answered the phone number in the book and answered my questions plus the book's free consulting review, it is a good investment at $24.95. I even gave copies to other musicians who haven't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat helpful, but OVERPRICED and poorly made","review":"This book is severely overpriced for what it contains. It is riddled with misspellings and typos. The information it contains is useful, but it can all be gathered from Simple Machine's Guide to putting out records, CD's and tapes, free over the internet, or about $5 from them. Save yourself the money and aggravation and find other sources- Moses Avalon's Confessions of a Record Producer, or other, cheaper, more informative guides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Essential","review":"Having purchased and read this book AFTER my last band unsuccessfully self-released a CD, I can only hope that others will read this before attempting a self-release.Over the past 3-4 years I have read almost every title I could track down on releasing an independent recording, but NONE come close to Sweeny's book.

I didn't know this book would be romanized. Could you imagine a native Korean speaker trying to learn English without knowing the Roman alphabet?

I went ahead and checked it out thinking I could make some use of it. Yeah, right! The fact that it is romanized is bad enough, but the romanization used is the most arcane and abstruse versions out there. I've studied Korean for two years and at first glance can't read any of it. I might try and convince my wife to translate it into hangul, but she would have to stop laughing first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adquate If you ONLY wish to speak not read Hangul!","review":"I did not know when ordering this book it was ROMANIZED or I would have never purchased it!

The book was written in 1988."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is problematic","review":"Like the other reviewer, I was disappointed by the lack of Hangul characters.

Like it was said before, hangeul (Korean alphabet) is very easy to learn, I learned it in three days. A version of this book in hangeul would be excellent, but as it is, it's mediocre. A good concept, but poor execution. I went to Yonpoong and Kyobo bookstores in Seoul to find a good book on Korean verbs but couldn't find anything in English.

It ought to help you pick winners. But at the tail end of the book, they list 4 sectors to invest in. Leaving out the grandfather gorillas (Microsoft, Cisco, Intel: do you really need a book to tell you they are good investments) and Internet browsers (yet another excuse to buy Microsoft), they list two areas for investment: Supply Chain Management and Security. In the 18 months since they wrote that chart, the best of the Supply Chain companies is +32%. The best of the security companies is -35%.

The one thing that sticks out in my mind is the book telling us Apple was not a good stock and was not worth buying. Apple went from $14 per share back in 2004 all the way up to over $500 per share in 2012. The best investment book you can buy is William O'Neil's \\"How to make money in stocks\\".

I don't need to- as an animal rights advocate I deal with this crap on a daily basis.Soooo, in the interests of full disclosure: according to SourceWatch, author Patti Strand is the national director and primary spokesperson for an organization called the National Animal Interest Alliance, which is a front group and industry funded lobbying group for animal commerce and agriculture, whose agenda supports hunting, animal agri-business, animal testing, commercial breeding, animal entertainment (circuses, rodeos, etc.), horse slaughter, fur ranching...well you get the picture. Clearly this book is simply industry rhetoric designed to undermine efforts of activists and organizations that are in support of the humane treatment of animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre, and unintentionally humourous","review":"Although written in a more educated style than many other anti-animal rights books published by small presses, The Hijacking of the Humane Movement shares a bizarre distortion on the goals and practices of animal rights activists.Among the tiresome anti-animal rights myths promoted are: animal rightists want to eliminate all contact between humans and other animals,animal rightists are in it for the money, and Nazism is representative of the \\"true\\" animal rights philosophy (Chapter 3 is entitled \\"Nazi Germany: A Distortion of the Movement\\"). If anything in this book is frightening, it is that the authors and their friends actually believe this nonsense. If you want to learn about animal rights, go to the animal rights groups and animal rights philosophers and judge for yourself. On the other hand, if you want to learn what kinds of lies (delusions?) are promoted by animal exploiters then read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hijacking of the Humane Movement: Animal Extremism","review":"If you're looking for lessons in paranoia, then this book is for you. The authors of the book must live in some nether world where imaginary enemies lurk behind every bush. The entire content is an exercise in neurotic thinking. The teaching of fear and distrust is as dangerous as what the authors claim the animal rights movement is doing.

But I had to, just so I didnt have to hear myself halfheartedly guffaw a third time while trying to extract some joy from this tepid, unfunny, fantastic-in-the-bad-sense film. Its not a Woody Allen film per se-someone else wrote it, thank goodness...stars galore populate the screen, and not one of them really does anything funny or quirky at all...Allen's cynical mutterings are stale, and they let Eddie Griffin talk, and not Andy Dick? Watch the interviews with the cast to see them try and say something good about what they just excreted...that's funnier than than the film itself! Bad, bad, unequivocally awful movie no matter what the ravers say, if you have any intelligence or taste at all, heed my admonition, you will waste money on this!Why don't you see Sleeper instead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody at his worst","review":"This was just a very bad film.

Woody is way out of his element in New Mexico where this idiotic film is supposed to take place.There is no question in my mind as to why this film never made it into theaters. It would have bombed in a big way. Even though there is a great cast, they don't have a good script to work with so the film falls right on its' face.Don't waste a second watching this huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so bad","review":"Before I watched this movie, I read very negative critics about it, but I decided to check it anyway,mainly because of Woody Allen.This movie was not made to be taken serious. It's a crazy comedy, with lots of surreal elements and an absurd plot. It's a story about a butcher who kills his wife, picking her to pieces. Accidentaly, he looses her hand, which is later found by a mexican bind woman, who believes she's cured by a miracle. Then, the news are spread, and the whole city of El Nino believes in the power of this hand.It may seem stupid, but it is actually a critic to fanatic people, who start believing in everything they see. The cast was well chosen. David Schwimmer plays a priest who is in love with a whore (shocking, isn't it?), proving that he can do more than Ross (Friends). Woody is funny and neurotic as always,and it makes the movie worth your money.Of course, this is not the best film you'll ever see, but it is funny in a certain way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter stupidity","review":"One could easily bear the fact that this movie seems to fullfill the whole range of mexican-related stereotypes, after all it has happened before in Hollywood, but casting Woody Allen, Cheech Marin, Maria Grazia Cuccinota, David Schwimmer, Lou Diamond Philips for delivering these superficial caracthers in the context of an absolutely stupid story is sacrilege.I am glad this movie never made it to the big screen.I hope that Woody never gets to see it, or he'll need another 50 years of therapy.We see jokes failing helplessly one after another.As the pythons would put it: a complete waste of time!! If you want to see some real Mexican point of view, I reccomend Amores Perros.A little darker, perhaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone Says They Hated It","review":"I can't remotely understand why Mr. Allen decided to participate in this awful movie. \\"Picking Up the Pieces\\" is everything except funny.

Picking Up the Pieces ends withone of the worst.The execution of Kiefer Sutherland's character is unbearable to watch.He is made a human pinata and beaten to death by men, women,and children. There's no humor in it, vindication, carnal satisfaction.Nothing. Alfonso Arau slipped so badly it's hard to believe thesame guy directed Like Water for Chocolate. I guess we all havemissteps.

I can't find any credits for him as writer in the synopsis and he didn't direct it.The best that could be said for him in his defense is that it wasn't his idea.I guess this is some auteur's distorted idea of a \\"madcap macabre\\" comedy, but it doesn't work.It IS frenetic, but not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality.

A GREAT disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bourne Legacy a disgrace to the Ludlum legacy","review":"Within the first 35 pages, Lustbader gets rid of the 3 most intriguing (non-title) characters in the book, Marie, Conklin and Dr. Panov. Part of what made Ludlum brilliant was the fact that his novels were character studies with a touch of spy novel/thriller. Lustbader, on the other hand, writes a cheesy, predictable soap opera about long-lost children.Lustbader's handling of Marie, especially, indicates that he didn't even read the Ludlum novels. Anyone who has knows that Marie would not have responded, \\"HOURGLASS,\\" and then not be heard from till the last 30 pages of the book. Also, in the Bourne Ultimatum, Webb is a tired, aging former spy and you get no hint of that in Lustbader's work, despite the fact that it takes place afterwards.Fans of the movies, good in their own right, might appreciate this book. However, anyone expecting a Ludlum-esque continuation of the Bourne novels will be incredibly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not expect too much","review":"This book, while a good read, was seriously lacking the thought and finesse that Ludlum had for the Bourne novels. The way that Jason Bourne is portrayed in this book is not consistent with the previous books. The timeline, that is where this book is starting off from is hard to determine, is it after the Bourne Ultimatum, or between that and the Supremacy?Also, I thought that bringing back Bourne's dead son Joshua did not add anything to the book at all. The author could have just made him another villain that Bourne killed in the end and it would have made for a much better story.It is this readers hope that if the author writes another novel based on the Bourne character that he will be more faithful to Ludlum's style and portrayal of the Bourne character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Finishing","review":"Originally excited to be reading a new Bourne novel, I was quickly disappointed in the way Mr. Van Lustbader handled this character created by Robert Ludlum. In fact, I only managed to get half-way through the book before having to put it away. I got increasinlgy tired of the bland characterization of the main people, and the stereotypes of the supporting characters (such as the chauvanistic Director of the CIA). And, sadly, the true identity of Bourne's assassin was very easy to determine. There were too many instances in which, as a reader, I had to suspend my disbelief. I fully enjoy this genre of fiction, and I know it may not always qualify as \\"good literature,\\" but I expect a little more than this.Since I didn't finish the entire novel, I don't know how it ends, but as I wasn't enjoying the story, I'm not that upset. I'll just go back and read the original Ludlum Bourne novels, where I actually cared about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what happened.","review":"If you have read the first 3 books then you know that their are differences in those plots compared to the movie.

We no longer need to worry about whether Jason Bourne can be killed, he'd likely hang himself if he ever reads this book.The prose is grating, apparently written with the aid of \\"The Histrionic's Thesaurus.\\" No cliche is left unused, and the writer apparently tries to use the most overwrought descriptions and word choice whenever possible.I really wanted to know how the book ended, but at the halfway point I finally gave up; no need pouring good time after bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"Spoiler alert!!This book was a waste of my time and my money. The only redeeming value it has is that it is atleast a quick read so it didn't waste too much of my time. Bad dialogue is everywhere in this book, and the story is ridiculous. Webb's son comes back from the dead to hunt him down and kill him? And ofcourse he just happens to be trained to kill on top of that. One of the above reviews likened it to Guiding Light, and I'd almost agree if I didn't dislike this book so much. That's right, I'd appreciate Guiding Light more than this book. If Amazon would allow me to give it 0 stars I would. I keep the book around so people will ask me about it and I can do them the favor of driving them away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eric Van Lustbader Missed The Boat","review":"Eric Van Lustbader completely missed the boat in his attempt to create a fourth Jason Bourne book. There are two stars to Ludlum's own books, David Web and Marie St. Jacques. The keys to those books are that Marie is as smart and decisive as David and that he is nothing without her. Instead, Van Lustbader not only cuts her out of the novel (and incidentally kills off two of the other major characters of the first three books so that he doesn't have to deal with them), but writes a sexist novel that bears no relationship whatever to anything that Ludlum ever wrote.It's a sad thing that the editors either didn't catch these things or didn't care!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farcical","review":"What a load of crap!It reads OK, but the story is so incredibly full of improbable impossibilities that it defies believability completely.Skip it.

Tortured, deadly, capable of making those responsible for a bad day pay and pay and pay. Lustbader takes this incredible character and plops him smack into an episode of \\"Guiding Light\\".

Very BAD","review":"Totall ripoff.Completely agree with one of the previous reviews, this is NOT a Jason Bourne character, this is just someone carrying on his name. and for no apparent purpose.Can't say I'm a huge fan of Ludlum, but at least with first 3 books you could see an artist at work, creating plot lines, character intricasies.This however was a work of a FAR inferior writer who I think browsed through the first 3 books. I couldnt put th other 3 down, especially the ultimatum, this one I put down veery quickly.If you're looking for a good continuation to the saga, don't bother, it's a waste of time and $.To put it bluntly, I can't comprehend how a true Jason Bourne fan could enjoy this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason Who(?)","review":"This might have been a good yarn if the author had not tried to make it a continuation of the Jason Bourne trilogy. The hero is not Jason Bourne. No matter how a reader tries to forget it, a comparison to Ludlum's Bourne is always being made. Van Lustbader's Bourne isn't.If this is the first of a new series, it is a serious mistake. The context has nothing but a few names in common with the Ludlum trilogy. None of the characters (that are left alive) resemble Ludlum's characters in the least.A good concept of a master, retired spy meeting up with a son thought dead, poorly tied to a successful series weakens the \\"new\\" concept. I hope this is the last of the Bourne/Kahn series. If it is to be continued, I would like a name change now.

However Lustbader apparently only skimmed the first book \\"Bourne Identity\\" before he sat down to write \\"Legacy\\" as there are numerous factual errors in the Bourne character of his book that clash with the original series. There were so many that it was actually hard for me to finish Legacy. Maybe \\"Legacy\\" occurs in a parallel universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Martin's Paperbacks must have been smoking crack!","review":"Don't bother buying this book.

I finally picked it up and now that I have, I truly wish that I had not. The experience is similar to the feeling of savoring the taste of your favorite dessert all the the way through only to find, oh, let just say a roach at the end. Crass? Yes, but that's how it feels. Somewhere between the comic book style of writing and the random, lengthy history lesson on Crete in chapter 16 (WTF) where I found myself skipping forward, Jason Bourne died for me.I absolutely loved this series. It is hard to see it go down like this. More important than a good story, is a great story teller. The voice behind a story is what makes that book live. I don't know Van Lustbader but he should stop feeding off of carrion, have a little integrity, and find his own kill. Yes, I am calling him a vulture. Let Bourne rest in peace.I miss Ludlum's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bourne Loser","review":"Who wants to read a re-invented Jason Bourne? Every character in this book is a tortured hero, struggling with their motives. The characters view their emotions like strange and curious dinner guests. In past stories, Jason Bourne was always in control even when he was cast clueless into any chaotic situation. This Bourne gives the impression of stumbling about, being lead along by various foes. He comes off as the 3rd - 4th strongest agent in the book (a sacriledge). Save your time, read something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bourne Legacy","review":"Surprised me and its as good as the last spy thriller I loved Sovereign Rule. The Bourne Identity started it all with the introduction to Jason Bourne. The movie of the same name was good but not as good as the book. The Bourne Supremacy, the second installment is okay and the Bourne Ultimatum is back to 5 stars.

However, having read ALL of the Bourne series from the original 3 written by Ludlum to the additional 5 I think it is now by Lustbader it is all good fun. If you like the Bourne character, the genre, and the general storyline then you will like all of them. I read for entertainment and for something to help me escape reality when I am frequently stuck in \\"cattle class\\" on a US air carrier, on a plane that is loaded to the gills, surrounded by screaming kids, and a beer will cost me $6.

And while I've been mildly annoyed at the strange editing issues that seem to plague some series (Vince Flynn's books come to mind, where a perfectly good passage will suddenly be marred by a random series of incomplete sentences apparently intended to represent some sort of thought), this book was virtually unreadable. It read like a children's book, with the author violating the basic rule of \\"show, don't tell\\" that every *good* author adheres to. The opening of the book was good in and of itself, but as it went along the story itself was subsumed under the load of horrible writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a screenplay, not a novel.","review":"Reading the book, I had the feeling that Lustbader is already dreaming about the money he'll make from selling the movie rights.As many tired old Hollywood clich��s that were packed into this book, there can be only one choice to play the role of Jason Bourne: Nicolas Cage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne Legacy","review":"Another great Bourne book form Ludlum.

Trouble is, nearly all the bad guys are such unbelievably stupid, paper-thin caricatures, and all the escapes from what, in the real world, would have been certain doom are likewise so lacking in believability and imagination, that I found myself hating myself for continuing to read the book. Because I liked the Bourne character and was thinking Ludlum to be a shameless laugh-all-the-way-to-the-bank cynic to have approved of the use of his creation just to make some more money I was greatly relieved when I read a review in amazon.com to learn that Robert Ludlum had passed away, by which I mean that hopefully it's not his fault, that hopefully he had no part in allowing this novel to be published.

A lot of the book is set some what late in Bourne's life making him seem old and a step too slow. I bought this on CD to listen to on my ride across the Pennsylvania Turnpike and it was a huge mistake. This was my first foray into reading a book written by an author who did not create the character he was writing about. Never again will I make this mistake.

In the other books Marie was right there every step of the way.Bourne has also become younger in this book somehow... not mentioning his age once or how he's not what he once was.

The book isn't suspenseful and doesn't grip you like it should. On top of that, the book doesn't pick up where the 3rd movie left off. Characters are now alive that were already dead and the author has no idea how to write a spy novel or anything about weaponry, tactics, hand-to-hand combat or anything of the sort.

The plot dragged and read like a soap opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Even if you can get it cheap, I found halfway through that I just wanted it to be over. I didn't engage with the characters at all. There were problems with believability, not just with super-human feats but with other things (e.g. trained agents using personal credit cards or cell phones while on the run). Lots of problems.If this were a stepping-stone to other, better sequels it could possibly be worth it, otherwise I'd recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"Probably would have been OK, had I not had such high expectations.

The Bourne Legacy is somewhat interesting but seemed to mock the character that was built in the other books. It read like a spoof of the story. The constant failure of Jason Bourne to be 'prepared' for anything was uncharacteristic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed it...","review":"I am sorry, but Mr. Van Lustbader missed the mark trying to pick up the gauntlet of telling a tale involving Jason Bourne. The book is disjointed, coming back to characters in later chapters that you have almost completely forgotten about, mainly because they were not richly layered and revealed in any depth in the first place. And Jason Bourne himself, as a world-class spy and assassin we all know and love, comes off as a bumbling inept who seems to dodge certain death only by the even greater ineptitude of the adversaries he encounters. Lustbader's Bourne relies heavily upon people he has only just met, and knows much too little about, and spends almost the entire book being used as a pawn by others. The story has none of the heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat excitement we expect, and so many holes in it as to be almost unreadable. Nice try, but it missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked hard to finish it.","review":"It's pretty obvious that this will not be made into the 4th Bourne movie.

That being said i was extreemly excited when i spotted this book on the shelf.Much to my chagrin, this is one of the most disjointed, poorly written, un-edited, unbelievable pieces of fiction I have ever read. The plot twists are juvenile, and in many cases, completely impossible.

Eric Van Lustbader provides these same talents to the assasin, Khan. It is unbelievabe that Khan can read the upcoming paragraphs in the book to determine where Jason will be, and what he is going to do. Khan is much more accomplished in martial arts than Jason will ever be under Van Lustbader. Why the Robert Ludlum estate ever allowed this \\"Ludlum Wanabe\\" to pen this novel is a mystery in itself.I read 150 novels a year, I kept telling myself, this novel has got to get better, it never did!

But as reluctant as I am to criticize a fellow author, I must say that this book is a disappointment. This portrayal of Jason Bourne, even if he's now retired from the CIA, is inconsistent with the dynamic, conflicted, intelligent, quick thinking Bourne we all know and love. I don't think I would ever write someone else's character - you live with the characters you create day and night, know their every thought and nuance and they develop from the depths of your own soul and understanding of them like a family member - that's tough to replicate and Lustbader definitely falls short. Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little much","review":"The sexual innuendos in this story really got to be too much, one after the other after the other, they just weren't funny anymore. My feeling is that the author had a so so story to tell so she had to fill in the balnks with something, she chose more sex, more innuendos, very boring.

I love it when the female character in a book doesn't fall into predictable patterns of either being too soft and needy, or being over-the-top fiery and rebellious and putting up walls between herself and the man the author is trying to get to love her. Eve is a very lovable character. She believes in herself, and she knows what she wants. I like Charlie too. He is responsible, cares for his family, but he also has a big dream he wants to chase. I thought the sex scenes between them were funny and sexy at the same time. I agree the mystery plot was not all that involving (we all know from the beginning who is after the hovercraft) but the real mystery is how will Eve and Charlie both get their dreams, and each other. You really want to see them be happy together, which made it a very fast read for me.

So how the police seem to be portrayed as dumb (as usual by Hollywood writers), in not believing a woman who says she escaped from a killer who placed her in a large hole dug in a forested area adjacent to a large city and where several other women were killed and the police perform no forensics such as examining dirt and other organic material; use search dogs or look for a pattern of missing women. They continue to be portrayed as dumb as she escapes multiple times from them pursuing her. It's not as if she's some \\"Kick-Ass\\" super person! So what gives? Really fragmented writing with little or no background on anyone from the killer, to the prey, to the newly hired detective who not coincidentally is portrayed as a jerk. Nothing creative in the story - same old victim escapes; is not credible to others; killer wants to finish the job; she finishes him.

It's a race to the finish line by rolling a die and playing different mini-games. The mini-games are unique in each world.

So yeah, everything until Tag Team Racing is good, and Tag Team Racing is decent. But then there's this... Crash Boom Bang. Why in the world did they even come up with this game? The mini-games are incredibly difficult and there is hardly any explanation on how to play each mini-game, there aren't even that many mini-games to begin with! The story is... Awful. The character selection should have been a lot bigger. The new character (and I suppose villain?) sucks. I have this game, and I play it from time to time, but really only because I am a die-hard Crash fan. If you are not a Crash fan, then avoid this game. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mario Party, Crash Bandicoot Style","review":"This game is exactly like Mario Party, but in Crash Bandicoot's world. The gist of the game is you're on a map (looks likes a board game) with 3 other players, you take turns rolling the dice,and playing mini games until you've found all the secret items hidden on the map. You can play with the computers, or play with a friend who owns the game.The mini games, which use the stylus, are not thoroughly explained. The degree of difficulty for them varies greatly, which makes the game sometimes frustrating and unfun.For die-hard Crash Bandicoot fans, especially of the older games, I wouldnt bother picking this up, you'll only be disappointed. Kids who enjoy stylus games, as well as the \\"board game/map\\" adventures might enjoy this. (My 11 year old brother gives a thumbs up for this game)This game is a nice try, but needs work before it can fully be on the same level as Mario Party.

I based my decision to buy on the price and the reviews, but this camera is not suitable for anything more than a child.

I had this camera for long enough and I tried every thing possible to create nice photos and it never did me any good. Outside photos are a little better but still sometimes blurry. I hated the thing and I am so glad I bought my Lumix :). The only plus was how long it lasted considering I have a 3 and 1 year old. Lake water is what did the thing in..Pros:Basically indestructiblequite a bit of memoryCons:Terrible inside photosHeavy!Horrible video quality (grainy and orange)Little optionsTakes a long time to take a pictureOver all this camera really sucks!

This Canon is simple to use, takes great pictures and has nice features. It's a good value, especially for a young or casual person to use. The shooting mode selection wheel is somewhat poorly made. It would be nicer if it clicked into place more solidly. Otherwise, we're happy with it, like the other Canon cameras we've owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Camera!!!","review":"This is a great camera for its price! It has tons of features that are fun and easy to use. It also has multiple size settings for photos, which is helpful if you wish to save space on your memory card. The smallest setting is all that is needed if you are not intending to print your pictures (i.e. if you're putting them on the web) and even at the highest quality setting for these you can still take about 55 (that's using the small memory card included)! For people printing a majority of their pictures, I would suggest purchasing a larger memory card. Batteries seem to last a decent amount of time during usage of the camera. The coloring and quality of the images seems great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY HAPPY","review":"I bought this camera to replace an older cannon 2.0MP I bought years ago.

It can handle up to a 2gig SD card, so she has lots of room for the cruise her grandma is taking her on this summer. If we had to do it again, we would probably move up a notch, to get better video.

Broken from factory, 2 repairs, and still have not taken a picture that does not have defects. I called Canon to get a remedy and I will apparently be just sending it back in and hoping the third attempt at repair will work while the other attempts did not.

Its very simple to set up and use, so even the people who just bought their first digital camera can use it with ease. It also allows you to \\"mess around\\" with the settings if your a more advanced user. The flash works great. A great feature that this camera has is the option to change the type of picture you want. You can change the settings so you can take still portrait shots, kid & pets shots for moving targets, foliage, beach shots in bright sunlight, take great pics of fireworks, and more. This is a great camera if your a amatuer photographer that just takes pictures at special events for some memories, or if your an advanced photographer looking to take some killer pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Camera!","review":"I am so happy with my new Canon PowerShot A460 5MP. The picture quality is what you expect from cannon, exceptional. It was easy to learn to use. It does not have automatic stabilization, but don't let that detour you from buying this camera. You can easily select the custom stabilizer that works best for your environment. I use my camera mostly for live music events and ALL of my pictures come out great. No fuzzy, grainy or indistinct pictures. Also very impressive is the video quality. I have a digital video recorder and I chose to use my Canon PowerShot over the old Video recorder.

There are adults in her stories, and with this story, some are good and some are NOT, but it is the kids who save the day. This story is interesting because it is a fantasy based on real creatures....the white cows.

There was a poor mix of normality and 'Barkerism'; it seemed to me that Barker was confused as to whether he wanted to write a regular story or whether he wanted to divulge into his realm of fantasy/horror as only he can do. The characters were wonderful, however. Barker has a gift of making the reader become the characters, seeing the story through their eyes.

Definitely one for the fireplace. Unfortunately, his next one, \\"Galilee\\" is of similar un-Barker-esque pointlessness.

I highly recommend this story to anyone who loves a writer who has a great imagination but who doesn't waste a lot of time explaining every little thing happening, but with very few words can make you cringe or smile.

However I found the plot a bit boring and not very grippihng, though after reading the reviews here I might go back and finish it. I would also like to comment on some of the reviewers who found the story good but were put off because the main character was gay. Well now you know how us gay folk feel when we read a main stream novel for the story but find it riddled with heterosexuality. Like the guy below me, I find myself tuning out the love scenes in main stream books because they simply bore me. I live for the day when all books will appeal to all readers. I thank Barker, Anne, Rice and others who write with open minds and include a diverse range of characters not carbon copies; if only most writers would write like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly inconsistent in plotting and tone","review":"This Clive Barker effort begins promisingly, but fails to deliver substantial incentive to reward the reader. Will Rabjohns, photographer and British expatriate, suffers a coma which leads him to re-explore the pains of his extraordinary early life. The childhood flashbacks are easily the strongest points of the novel. Though haunting and bleak, this subplot is full of magical wonder, drawing the reader into the finely-rendered boyhood psyche of young Will. However, these childhood flashbacks are marred by the eventual introduction of gratuitous sexuality, though I admit this is my subjective reaction. Despite other reviewers' objections, the homosexual subtext is truly inoffensive, but what is offensive is the mundane storytelling of the adult Will's daily routine after awaking from the coma. The remainder of the novel is written without much soul. Had Barker reimagined Sacrament as a childhood story, it surely would have been a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Clive Barker book","review":"The story is decent in some spots but if you are expecting something rich and stylized like \\"Weaveworld\\" or \\"The Great and Secret Show\\" then you are going to be disappointed. Reading it is a long, frustrating and laborious process. The story is boring and the most interesting characters aren't used enough. The ending is anit-climatic and you find yourself wishing that something truly terrible would happen to the main character just to make the story interesting.It would have been ok if it had been written by a different writer, but my expectations for Clive Barker are high (and probably unreasonable)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Done","review":"This book was writen well enough to get me interested. I usually don't get into any sort of 'sci-fi' type of book...but this was done so artistically and it was so discriptive. The artist and poet in me latched onto that. It also makes you think! I read it a few years ago and it still has me thinking. Bare in mind it can be confusing so keep alert as you read it! I still can't believe I fell for this sort of book. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, dark fantasy","review":"Clive Barker is unlike any other author I read. In this one he branches out to touch on some contemporary issues.

It does not alter the fact that he is still a good writer. Sacrament, unlike his other two novels I read, (Weaveworld and The Damnation Game) is a far more credible tale, and more enjoyable. I was hoping that Sacrament would redeem Barker of his flop with The Damnation Game, and it did.

The eclectic classification of \\"Classically oriented New Age Music\\" only begins to describe depth of Marc Torgeson's aural and spiritual majic. Through atmospheric textures, ambient washes and orchestral sonorities, Torgeson creates a soundscape both richly earthy and etheral. The depth of Mark's music in this recording can only be surpassed by his live perfomances."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sorry I Got this CD","review":"The other reviewer (as of May 2010) that offered the 5 star rating must of been on magic mushrooms when listening to this.

As Piano/Vocal editions go, this one is great, usually the piano part will have the vocal part in with the piano writing, but in this book they are kept seperate.The only thing missing are the guitar solos, which are virtually nonexistant except in Shine On You Crazy Diamond (which even then loses a few instrumental parts)but it's a very good book to use to make your own arrangements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I Believe in Me: A Book of AffirmationsThe simplicity of this book is what makes it powerful.

I read this book everyday to my child (really!) since she has been born. There are so many lessons in this book. The pictures are simple but are full of things to talk about (what animal is this, how does she feel). The affirmations are short, simple, easy to remember, and spot on. My daughter, now 2, can repeat some of them or respond to them. For example, when I say \\"Laughter and joy fill my heart\\", my daughter will start to laugh (my wife too!). It is a good reminder for us adults too. I can't get enough of this book. I think this is an asset for any family's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true treasure","review":"I highly recommend this songbook, not only for the 100 wonderful songs, but also for the introduction to each song.

I wanted a book like this as I'm just learning to play the guitar - I liked that it has the chord fingerings right in the song. My one complaint is minor - hopefully soon I'll be a better guitar player and this won't matter, but a lot of songs are in the key of F which I find a tricky chord still. I had to transpose lots of the songs into D or G or something else I could handle better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical gem","review":"We loved this book--it has the old favorites with lots of verses and each song comes with a history.

The reader is taken step by step, thought by thought, along the way to appreciating the beauty, skill, and effects of the practice of magic.The writer's style takes the simplest observations and gradually builds them until, before you know it, you are quickly doing things of startling sophistication and skill!This handbook not only informs and instructs, it enriches. The author converses with the reader, and this comfort in reading inspires confidence in doing.This book is an invaluable addition to any magician's library...it is one of the three best I have read in thirty-five years of studying magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many have learned from this . . .","review":"Henry Hay (pen name for June Barrows Mussey, who was a journalist and translator as well as magician) was probably the best magical writer that ever lived. Several professional magicians have learned from his clear prose, including Johnny Ace Palmer, Gary Oulette (producer of the WORLD'S GREATEST MAGIC specials), and David Copperfield. If it was good enough for those guys, it's good enough for anybody. It was certainly good enough for me. I still refer back to it at times, and I've been into magic since I was twelve.

Count yourself very lucky if you can find a good copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amateur Magician's Handbook (AMH) by Henry Hay","review":"This one book will open the doors of magic for you. The first two chapters are essential for the reader to understand how to create magic in the minds of the spectators. Mr. Hay is an excellent teacher and motivator. Although his passion was coin magic (T. Nelson Downs was his boyhood hero), he teaches classic sleights for cards, coins, thimbles, balls, silks, etc. He gives wise counsel on buying apparatus, how to stage a magic show, performing for children, how to practice, and more. Although the AMH was originally written in 1950, the books listed in his bibliography are still recommended reading today. I had the rare opportunity to meet Mr. Hay in Germany and he was cordial and still proficient in his hobby. Do you want to learn magic? Buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panic on the streets of New York","review":"This book makes me think I wouldn't like Jay Mohr very much if I knew him. He comes off as a vain, desperately whining and immature crybaby who finds disgusting things funny. Though he is at least refreshingly honest about his own shortcomings,and does have some telling observations about the SNL schedule.But I couldn't shake the feeling that this book was born because Mohr heard about the Live From New York project and rather than cooperating with its authors decided to try to cash in on his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but whiny","review":"There are a lot of really interesting, behind the scenes parts to this book but more often than not, Jay Mohr comes across as a whiny, complaning adolescent. I like Jay Mohr for the most part but this book is slightly ruined by his incessant complaining. It's an interesting look into the world of SNL and for that alone it's worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Scoop on SNL - Great book","review":"If you want a candid, funny inside look on Saturday Night Live, this is THE book! Jay has such a funny way of describing his life at SNL. It was a real ordeal for him at times and he gives the inside story of some of the idols on SNL. A real \\"tell-all\\" of his desperate stint at SNL, trying to jockey for position among some real cutthroats. A \\"coming of age\\" story -- painful and loveable. Loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light Read. Funny! Mohr is great!","review":"This was my first \\"Kindle\\" read. It was very funny and super interesting. I never knew what all goes into one episode of SNL! The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I thought the end of the book just dwindled away. It never really wrapped up. The rest of the book was funny and fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wry slice of SNL","review":"Jay Mohr's \\"Gasping for Airtime, Two Years in the Trenches of Saturday Night Live\\" was not at all what I expected. I expected another tell all tome, full of excess and raw humor. I was pulled into Mohr's account of his bewildering adustment to the show's traditions, cliques, speech and hours. Full of snippets featuring some of the musical guests from those two years, Charles Barkley's merciless pummeling of a stunt Barney , and Chris Farley's unabashed attempts to make fellow cast members laugh on air it is a window on the Saturday Night Live we see today. Jay Mohr is likeable, and I found myself worrying along with him as his body and psyche attempted to fit into the wildly energetic SNL workplace. Some stories made me wince, then laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it were longer","review":"An insider's view of working in the trenches of \\"Saturday Night Live\\". This book is not meant to be a tell-all book nor a production diary. Some other reviewers have bemoaned the dearth of juicy gossip tidbits in the text. But Mohr's account is open and honest and rightfully one-sided. \\"SNL\\" has long been a fascinating cultural phenomenon, and Mohr gives you a peek behind the curtain. He speaks as a lower-rung writer/performer, and is certainly unjaded by the whirlwind success that other \\"SNL\\" alums achieved, mostly because he never achieved it himself.He fawns over a musical guest or two, and has nothing but loving things to say about Chris Farley, but the rest is basically a week-for-week, show-for-show account of how the show's inhumane production schedule brought out both the best and worst in him (and everybody else)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow but amusing","review":"Extremely fast read and it kept me hooked. The inner workings of how SNL functions on a weekly basis are fascinating; however, after a while Mohr's stories felt more like random celebrity name-droppings than meaningful content. Mohr's short two-year stint on the show wasn't nearly enough time for an in-depth perspective on the show's meaning and changing casts. Entertaining nonetheless, and provides some good cocktail party anecdotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to sell out the memory of Chris Farley.","review":"The author tells an incredibly unflattering anecdote about his late friend Chris Farley, who can neither defend himself nor refute its authenticity. Whether it's true or not, it is a horribly offensive and humiliating story that ultimately reflects badly on Jay Mohr for telling it. This betrayal of a man he claimed to care about renders the book unconscionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-what book from a so-what comic","review":"Sure, you'll get a little \\"dirt\\" on some SNL cast members and guests from the 1993-95 era. But mostly you'll get whining from a guy who barely made it on the air during those two years. Mohr has enjoyed a little success in the last few years, but after reading this, I give Lorne Michaels credit: he certainly has an eye and ear for \\"funny,\\" or he wouldn't have lasted this long. And apparently he didn't think Mohr was very funny. Turns out he was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"speaking for the audio version","review":"not as interesting as I thought it would be but I purchased the audio version, I saw later that there were segments in the book not on the cd I received. There was no mention of Farley on the cd, so can't speak for the book , maybe it was better. There were some interesting parts about the behind the scenes stuff from SNL, but the story is told very much from just the one man's point of view so you don't get an overall feel of the show (at least I didn't) Like Jay Mohr's act just not the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"I appreciate Saturday nights much more thanks to Jay Mohr!","review":"I saw this book, bought it, and read it all in one day. I was absorbed and couldn't do anything else during that period. For several straight hours I sat there laughing with (or at) Jay Mohr.He spills his guts and it's nice to hear one guy not saying \\"Oh yeah, Saturday Night Live is easy, and perfect.\\" I know a lot more about Saturday Night Live than I used to, so I appreciate the show more. Even Jay admits that most of the time athletes are bad hosts.Although the book seemed whiney at times, I guess it was realistic. The ending is excellent, and well fit. It's almost painful to hear some of these things about one of America's most long lasting and trademark shows.Now I can watch Jay Mohr on Last Comic Standing knowing what he's been through, and knowing how far he's come. I respect him much more now.5 Broken Legs out of 5. (Read the book, figure it out.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"The book was a quick, simple read, good for a couple hours on the beach. I would like to read another couple of points of view before I draw any conclusions about SNL."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick and Enjoyable Read for the SNL Fan...","review":"I bought this book not because I am particularly a fan of Mohr's, but because I love SNL. While Live From New York was certainly a more comprehensive, informative book on the show, this book has it's own advantages. It was very interesting to get one man's personal experiences from the show, however anguishing and difficult as they were. In telling his story, Mohr also gives us a lot of insight into the actual grueling, day-to-day process of putting this great show together. I now watch the show with a new sense of awe--how does all that chaos end up in such a great final product?

He played a back-stabbing agent who double crosses the hero in the movie. I thought he played that rather well. Based on his book, it's because he is that guy.I didn't find Jay Mohr to be a \\"warm fella\\". His writing is matter-of-fact and well...cool. There is no emotion to his writing nor does he remember anyone fondly with the exception of Farley, but only highlights his \\"manic\\" stages.On one hand, I can't blame the guy. He was at a rough period (a decade or so) where the show had lost its steam. Mohr was coming in the SNL train as young guys like him: Sandler, Farley and Spade were getting noticed with the best sketches and that must have been tough.But he wussed out. He was in the same school as newcomers Molly Shannon, Norm Macdonald (who Jay discloses too much detail on his bout with food poisoning), Rob Scheidner (who Jay hates), and didn't graduate from the SNL Academy with honors.His revenge: this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Australian scenery, horses, Fahey scenery, what more could you want?","review":"A young Jeff Fahey is in the movie that is so well reviewed below.

It combines history with interesting narrative. It tells of the heartbreaking saga of the relationship between Jews and Germans for the 200 years preceding WW II. It spoke of histories of people and how devoted they were to the Fatherland....especially sad were the thousands of conversions, forced and voluntary, which in the end did the Jews no good. It is an enlightening read and not very flattering about the Germans and their anti semetic history of thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aptly Titled","review":"I found that this book very much lives up to its name. The author chronicles the rapid socioeconomic ascent of Jews within Germany. In doing so, he discusses several famous examples, and uses them as an illustration of somewhat general trends. This suggests that German Jews would be the first Jewish community within Europe to be fully integrated into the nation-at-large.

The book is powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"must read for all thinking people","review":"To truly cover the German-Jewish Epoch, 1743-1933 would probably take ten volumes,but this is a very good overview for a layman. You get an idea of how the Holocost happened, but I will never understand the why. We might take a lesson from it for today. Beware the powerful (politicians, generals, princes, ceo's) who tell you what you want to hear and play up to your hatreds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"The author provides all the essentials to understand the plight of Jews in Germany from 1743 to 1933. The perspective is point-of-view from correspondence and observations of Jews and Gentiles alive and writing during this period. As a personal perspective the book is well written. Although there are modest digressions from the very personal viewpoint which provides some historical context, for my purposes I would have liked a less personal and more historical viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and engaging","review":"I am surprised to be the first reviewer of this book. Although the title may suggest that the book is narrow and scholarly, nothing could be further from the truth. By focusing on Germany in the Enlightment and modern periods, Elon has written a microcosm of the history of anti-Semitism and of Europe. Using well-known German Jews, like Heine, and lesser-known figures, Elon brings these 200 years of history to life. He is historically scrupulous, but writes with the ease of a novelist. It's a good read that's good for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad purchase","review":"The quality of this faucet is awful.

Here we pick up where the first part NEVER left off in America what with it's cancelation and what not. Anyways, Naruto after a couple of years of training comes back to the Leaf Village, to the suprise of all his freinds, but not before getting punked by Sasuke.....again. Meanwhile, Garra (Now the Kazekage) falls under attack by Akatsuki member Deidara, who is after the beast that lies inside of him. This battle lasts abruptly about six episodes, so it doesn't end on this disc. The dub is overall pretty good to me, I really don't see what other people complain about the dub for, it's the same voice actors from before, just trying to sound older. The diolougue hasn't changed much either, and its overall a pretty good series. Which is why I give Naruto Shippuden Vol 1 DVD, a 4/5. Welcome home Naruto....Welcome home."},{"rating":"2","title":"naruto grew up","review":"I agree with most of the reviews, Naruto is king of the cliff-hanger, we've watched some of these with english subtitles(since cartoon network has stopped showing them and we couldn't wait for these releases).

It was interesting to get to know some of the backgrounds of women (with famous husbands) who haven't been thought of or heard of - ever. These women had grit! The book (as it was intended) was a strong reminder of the important role women have been playing in history...some of these women we've hardly known of until Ms. Roberts introduces them to us in Founding Mothers (great title, by the way).

Ben Franklin's common-law wife ran his print shop and her Sundry shop while he played politics. Pamphlets were the delivery system of the colonial era and it was Mercy Otis Warren, the wife and sister of revolutionaries, who bravely published pamphlets against the British government._Founding Mothers_ is a fascinating read/listen.

This book is so easy for the novice, or the experienced to pick up, read, and put into practice immediately.

Also, if you're looking for recipes, you'll find them, as long as her company doesn't make a similar product.

I did feel like it was one big advertisement for her products and very few recipes. There is some info on each of the oils, but nothing in great depth. Furthermore, I tried to find her website that features all these wonderful products and had no luck! It must have been taken down since this book was published.

How could she have been sleeping with him for two years if they had no such feelings for each other? It calls to question their morality as a couple and irresponsibilty on the part of the heroine. The very act of making love is at the same time a silent plea to be permitted to bring a child into the world, which is why sometimes our efforts at preventing it (contraception) fails woefully. The Heroine was being extremely selfish and silly and I found her antics made the book quite boring. The hero was a steady guy and stayed true to himself to the end quite the opposite of what one would have expected.

When I added the C batteries I had an extremely hard time getting them in and wound up using a tool to cram them in.

The characters all seem to be marching towards their graves. All but one of the characters feel that they've mispent their lives. It was quite depressing. I had to force myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"idealism, love, friendship, & the 80's","review":"I've just finished re-reading this book and had to put my two-cents in. The four voices Cunningham uses to tell his story are facinating, well-drawn and unique characters. I've read some reviews of this book criticizing Cunningham's \\"lack of voice\\" in differentiating character, but nothing can be further from the truth. While reading, pay attention to, say, the difference between Bobby's \\"inner monologues\\" and his tone, word choice, etc. in conversations. The difference between the two is intentional, and paints a very real and empathetic picture of Bobby and how he feels about life and about himself. Blah blah blah. Sorry, but I really adore this book. It's a wonderful look at idealism, love, friendship, and the 80's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but claustrophobic","review":"Take three extremely self-absorbed people. Throw in a few parents, one lover. Speaking from the interior voices of the four main characters gives a wonderful look at how these people perceive and process the world. But even though they live in a working-class Latino neighborhood in New York, you never ever get a sense of place or that other people exist, which made me lose patience for the lost opportunity and richness. And well I guess I know a few too many people who lead the same kinds of insular lives. I stopped caring about these characters after awhile.I also found the characterization of Bobby lame--his words in conversation with the others didn't ring right.Michael Cunningham has great gifts with his prose--I'd be jolted by a description of someone's \\"moth-colored pajamas.\\" I'm now reading The Hours and am pleased to see that he's been able to make his characters' world much less insular. This book hints at the genius of the Hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfying Read","review":"'At Home' is not exactly how I'd call the moment when the book concludes, but the process we are invted to participate in these compelling 300 plus pages, is at home, as interiorised as we could expect from literature. I haven't read a lot of Cunningham. Only his Specimen Days which feels more contrived than this earlier work, more arty, if you like. If you've shared a healthy dose of the period in which the novel evokes you'll sympathise with the brilliance of the author's meticulous descriptions. Cunningham lists the soundtrack of the era, the Doors, the Van Morrisons whatever to help us along the trajectory. The very reservations and acceptances of the generational attitudes to homosexual couplings is unparalled, so far as my reading has taken me. And the triangulated thing takes me into unexplored territory. The inter-generational manouverings are poignant though I was less convinced, less involved when the final Woodstock setting arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book - Loved it!","review":"I got this book from a friend who saw the movie and heard the book was awesome, so I picked it up and two days later I didnt know what had happened! I lived, breathed, and slept this book for those two days!I'm not sure what it was that I loved about this book most: the switching of point view between characters, the complicated relationships amongst the characters, or the tough subject matter being approached in such a poetic way.I enjoyed it all, and while I was slightly sad at the end, I was happy that it didn't end like all other stories about love and forgiveness in our modern day - it ended in a way that made sense for everyone involved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"A friend recommended this book to me, and I am so grateful that he did. The story is beautifully written, the characters fully realized. I found this story very moving - the characters' growth, limitations and realizations are very touching and incredibly real. I'd recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to stop reading!","review":"I cannot say how much I dislike this book! I hated all the chracters, especially Clare who was never anything other than self-centered. Her \\"relationship\\" with Bobby was nothing short of rape, not to mention the betrayal this selfish woman committed by molesting someone her best friend was in love with.The connections between the characters were not believable in the slightest and there was nothing to like about any of them. Jonathan is the sort of ineffectual, pathetic gay man that we all wish to NOT become. A main character in a book who is never happy, never driven, never willing to say what he wants or feels is pathetic.It was dismal from the beginning and I couldn't make it past the beginning of section 3. Read something good! Not this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, unlikely, and mostly uninteresting story","review":"What Michael Cunningham does best in this book is the little things. Similes and metaphors and various details are almost always right on. The story itself, told in alternating first persons, spends most of its time telling us about the characters, especially toward the end. It seems we have four psychologists who do very little other than analyze themselves and the others. First, people don't analyze themselves or others nearly to this degree. Second, the characters actually do very little when not analyzing.Two other issues are the improbable three-way love affair and Bobby's indefinable sexual orientation.The worst problem of all is that this is a character-driven novel and I just didn't care about what happed to any of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synopsis","review":"Jon was born a storyteller. His Mom lost a baby she didn't really want. Bobby lost a brother in a freak accident. They meet in Junior High. They discover each others' honkers. Jon's Mom discovers them discovering each others' honkers. Jon moves to New York City, becomes roommates with an older straight woman Clare and has a ambivalent relationship with a guy named Eric. Bobby moves in with Jon's family and learns how to cook. Bobby later moves in with Jon and Clare, then knocks up Clare in his first heterosexual affair. Jon feels left out and moves out. Jon's Dad dies in Arizona so Bobby and Clare go out there to console him. They drive back, decide they all love each other and wind up getting an old dilapidated house in the country in New York state. Eric comes to visit and has aids. Jon finds the meaning of life.Seemed overly long. Jaklak sez check it out if you're into this kind of thing. If not, keep walking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and beautiful","review":"This story follows two boys and their relationships with each other and outsiders as they move from childhood into adolescence and eventually into adulthood. The story is told in alternating first person(s) through a variety of characters. While I am not generally crazy about that method of story telling, and it may not add much to the narrative in this case, the technique works reasonably well.One of the chapters (ch.3, I believe) appeared in the New Yorker some years back as a short story entitled \\"White Angel.\\" For this chapter alone the book is worth the cover price. It is as moving as any short story I have read in years. Sadly, the book doesn't get quite that good again, but remains quite wonderfully written and entertaining (albeit quite depressing as well).Few contemporary authors write more artfully, more beautifully than Cunningham, but this cat is depressing. You wouldn't find me reading multiple works of his in succession--they're just too much to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with The Hours","review":"I must disagree with the reviewer who recommended this book if one liked the \\"macabre\\" aspects of The Hours. I can hardly believe the same man wrote both books. What I think is most apparent is that he runs the same theories of the human condition in all of his books. Example: the housewife wanting to make the \\"perfect\\" cake, and all people just trying to get through hours. By the time he wrote The Hours, he perfected his thoughts on the human condition and as a result created a masterpiece. Granted, he writes self involved people very well, but this book lacks any kind of story. For a book that was hailed as \\"character driven\\", I can't say I cared about any of the people involved. The Hours moved me deeply, A Home at the End of the World left me cold and wanting to just get the the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully captures our vulnerabilities and life's ugliness","review":"Don't waste your time watching the movie. After reading the novel, I watched the movie and wish I could erase it from my memory. I didn't love the novel throughout, but I loved it enough to give it four stars. Cunningham so accurately conveys the most painful, open-ended dilemmas life presents us and how we try to achieve at least some sense of peace with them. How he crafts the boys' families and thier internal workings is mangnificent. I found both families realistically flawed. Definitely a worthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"I also hated this book, stopped reading, and then gave it away.I found the writing style in which the author switches back and forth between the different characters' points of view tiring, trite, and contrived. Unfortunately this writing style in novels has become trendy and is rarely ever effective.The characters came across as unbelievable and contrived. Cunningham's pathetic attempt to capture the voice of a woman and mother in Alice is what put me over the edge.It seems I am of the minority here in that most readers loved this book. Then again, lots of people love romance novels and also consider that genre \\"literature\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I saw the movie when it first came out and I loved it. I read many great reviews on the novel, so I decided to give it a read so I can see the similarities and differences between the book and the movie. I got half way through the novel and I couldn't stand reading it anymore. The book was too dramatic and slow-paced for my taste. The movie was great, but the book was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning","review":"I don't know if it was just me but everything I had heard and read about this book lead me to expect a much different story. The book is not about a non-traditional family. Its about very different, somewhat disturbed people dealing with their neurosis and never really winning. I've come to find Cunningham's work pretty stark, brutal, and somewhat dark and this is by far the best example of that. If you liked the darker, macabre aspects of The Hours this is for you.In a positive note though and the reason this gets 2 stars from me - Michael is a STELLAR writer. I'm sure his shopping list is a touching piece of literature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful family novel written with astonishing grace.","review":"The second chapter of this book, which was excerpted in the New Yorker, is about the best coming-of-age story I've ever read. So wise, haunting and glaringly beautiful that it sets an impressive stage for a deep and rewarding novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wistful and wonderful","review":"A novel as beautifully written and emotionally resonant as I expected it to be. Thoroughly satisfying although not perfect. Imperfections consisted of 4 narrative voices that were indistinguishable one from the other and, for such an emotionally honest novel, a motivationally unjustified ending, one that was untrue to the characters as previously written. But by that point, Cunningham has you so in the grip of his storytelling, you are willing to forgive him anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"stylish hat","review":"this is a great product one of my favorite anime's and manga's and great style also matching with many of my outfits comfortable and would recommend to anime and just main stylish wearers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious change of pace","review":"A welcomed change of pace comic.

At one part in the movie this doctor puts a blind person in a swiming pool and these rubber snakes come over with plastic teeth and kill her, you can see the strings pulling the snakes over to the girl.At another point in the movie this one girl who is on a wheelchair gets pushed in a room and gets locked in their and then you see all of these little plastic spiders and other things that are attached to a string get pulled over her and then she dies.So what I am basically saying is that this movie has horrible special effects and really bad acting, so whatever you do, don't bother watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Depression!","review":"It can be hard to pray when you are bitter and angry towards others or even God; but this is when you need God's help most!

Problems start right from the training missions. Did the designers even consult a pilot? They kept telling me I \\"left the flight path,\\" yet never once was any flight path laid out or shown. It finally dawned on me that what they meant was that my plane was leaving the teeny tiny flight area of the teeny tiny map - not hard to do at all - as opposed a flight path, which is a specific vector - a straight line from point A to point B. So here I am, trying to learn how to fly this crummy plane, which has the worst flight physics I've ever encountered, and all the game designers give me is microscopic area to fly in - all the while I've got some corny \\"voice actor\\" screaming insults at me. Yeah, great fun. Unbelievably, the game actually goes down hill from here. Don't even waste your money renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll look pretty...crashing into the ocean!","review":"Okay, I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I play for fun not to be challenged. I have a day job and no longer live with my parents. So, that being said, I love the graphics and general concept behind this game but it was just too frustrating to keep at it. Let's just put it this way...it took me a week just to get through all the training missions/tutorial. Once you learn to actually fly and not crash into things, then you have to complete insanley difficult missions against enemies and all the while...manage not to crash yourself in the process. Rent it and set on \\"rookie\\" and if you do okay, may be worth plunking down the cash. It's a good balance between a purist flight sim and a bullet spewing arcade shooter style game. Regadless, too much invenstement of time/energy and not enough payout/sucess for me personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great game","review":"This is the WW2 flying game I've been waiting for.

Davidson, an Englishman and an Israeli, sets his story in Israel, as his protagonists collaborate with an Israeli officer in trying to locate a rare species of gazelle that they are not sure even still exists. It is hard to convey what makes this book such a delight.

I have one of this author's other books on my shelf but this is my first time reading Mr.Pete and boy did he throw down it was beautiful to see it written from a woman's perspective. Deja and Isrie are best friends that take us off from the first page with a 911 call that Isrie is making because she is in serious trouble from there the book takes off and does not stop.

Eric Pete captures the reality of careers, friendship, and love as these two women interact in their daily lives. It is truly amazing to a read a novel written by a man from a woman's point of view. Just like his other novels it was a great piece of work and brought sex, love, drama, deception, and friendship to another level.

But, for Orb fans, it's great to have all this stuff, so no complaints from me, and I hope they release more volumes! I agree with a previous reviewer that liner notes might have been helpful in order to identify where and when the material was composed and recorded, but as the other reviewer also said, you can sort of tell by listening what 'period' of Orb the track came from.

Nicols misses no opportunity to endow his characters with bad breath, crusty nostrils, dirty teeth and any other repulsive characteristic imaginable, all of it described in loving detail.

Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vastly inferior Blood Meridian","review":"You know what this comes across as? It's as if Mr. Nicol read Cormac McCarthy's tremendous work and thought it was the coolest thing in the world, and set out to rewrite it in a new setting. His scenes, language and style seem lifted straight from McCarthy's pages, but he can't even come close to capturing the essence of regeneration through violence. That's not to say that such was Nicol's goal, because a goal is not apparent. This is a work of drivel that proceeds in jerks and spasms, and offers nothing to the literary world. Well, there is ONE good thing about it, and that is its length. Even at 200 pages, though, it's hard to get through.

Call me stupid or dull, but I just did not \\"get\\" half of what the author was attempting???? I always hate to give a low rating to any book, because I know what effort goes into writing anything, and even with the really bad ones, I sort of feel sorry for the author, but in this case, it was almost as if the author went out of his way to be vague, gross, etc. Perhaps the author made too much of an effort to the Artsie.

The book is well written and to me fascinating in its unrelenting portrayal of an amoral world, a type of setting almost never used in literature of any genre. If violence and unpleasantness are going to keep you up at night, don't read it.Is \\"regeneration through violence\\" Cormac McCarthy's purpose? I always read his work as pure Nihilism, such an unpopular point of view (especially in the U.S.) that it's not surprising people try to stamp it with more or different meaning. Horseman is comparable to McCarthy's dark stuff. No, his writing isn't as good as McCarthy's, but whose is exactly?

This is understandable, you don't want the ends popping out when you are using the driver but when you have a oily hand, you're going to have to use a cloth or something to get it out, so this is not a tool to use for quick change outs. The second reason is the case to hold them is a little bulky.

The presentation is unbelievable ridiculous. The book is pretty much filled with the lengthy code of the indicators for eSignal. The author has no respect for the reader. Instead of presenting what he has to say, if any, he just wrote a book to steal the customer from his money. Probably much needed as his personal trading systems may fail desperately. Plus the author asks $90 for a CD containing the code!My experience is that a Slow Stochastics (14,3,3) is all you need along with a couple moving averages.My biggest disappointment from reading trading books is that 99% of them are snake oil salesmanship.

Any problems that are sent to vibes, receive a form letter that never addresses the problem, nor take into account the seriousness of the problemThe game involves spending hours and hours of clicking a mouse buton to load/unload ships from bases, minerals from bases. I would estimate in a 4 hour play session, you will be clicking the mouse button 6000-10000 times.And while the company touts 100,000 accounts, 80% are only demo accounts that players use as mules, non paid accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The $$ at All","review":"MK is a waste of time and money.

I was greatly dissapointed to see that you had to mine materials forever just to be able to build basic buildings. Combat on this game is a joke because everytime you get a certain # of ships in the same system the lag is unbelievable. Thats not even mentioning the endless disconnects during battle. The many remaining bugs would cause me to classify this as a BETA rather than a finished product. Vibes idea of technical support is a joke also, if you have any problems with this game, tough luck !! In whole, you should buy this game if you enjoy bad gameplay,a bug ridden environment, constant server closures, a community that always figures out how to cheat, non-existent tech support,making millions of mouse clicks per hour, or banging you head over and over into a brick wall till your brains fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for fun? look eslewhere then","review":"I dont think this game needs more than one word to describe...but which? useless? boring? disappointing?

The problem is that the good part of the game is having trouble escaping it's troubles. I've been playing for a while (> 1 year), and while I sort of enjoy it, it is a constant struggle. I'd say give it 3-4 months; It should be a little better by then"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mankind - Always down for updates","review":"Mankind IS a pretty good game, when it is up and running. This unfortunately is not often enough. The company who runs the game, called Vibes, seems to be full of poor programmers and has a generally lousy technical support staff. The game involves a lot of clicking of the mouse and is constantly being patched which causes the servers to be up and down for weeks at a time. For all my negativve comments here though, I will admit I am addicted. Not sure if I will stay this way, as they have just released a new version of the game which has TOTALLY changed the entire game. The new version has been out a week, unfortunately, the servers have been down so I cannot say if it is any good. What I can say is that they reduced my credits from 2 Billion to 20 million (took me a year to earn 2 Billion) and now my cities are dying because I have 10 and the new limit is 5 and I can't get on long enough to destroy the spare ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up in the air","review":"A great game idea.

Also I thought since it weighed so much more than all the others of this type and size level that it would be strong, well, I was wrong, you had better be careful with it cause it bends so easy because it was not properly engineered or designed.

His book focuses on the peculiarities and eccentricities of Italian life in a blatant attempt to make the Italians look like a nation of fools. Hoffman fails to balance descriptions with the other side of Italian life... that beautiful, colorful, lively and loving side that so many other cultures are lacking! Instead Hoffman describes ad nauseum some of the foibles of Italian life in an attempt to make the reader snicker. Hoffmann's book is ethnocentrism and cultural elitism at its worst. If the reader wants a honest look at Italian Life try Tim Park's \\"Italian Neighbors\\" instead. Parks is able to relate the ups and downs of Italian life as a non-Italian living in Italy. You will learn what it is about Italy that made Parks decide to stay in Italy and raise his children there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spent too much time in the newsroom","review":"Perhaps Paul Hoffman has spent too much time in newsrooms... After all, newscasters' job is to unearth the seedy, the awful, the criminal, the negative. And that's precisely what you'll read in this book. Hoffman offers a mind-numbing slew of negative stereotypes (as thoroughly researched as they may be, one could also provide dozens of anecdotes to support prejudices against the Irish, Jewish peoples, Africans, Swedes...). In this book, Hoffman tries to explain EVERY reason for EVERY problem Italy has EVER experienced--from littering and crotch-scratching to poor governmental structure to tax evasion.

But this shouldn't discourage the hopeless Italo-phile, of which I count myself among. Indeed, the many layers of cultural complexity is what makes this alluring society so irresistible. Sure, \\"La Dolce Vita\\" exists. But so do 1,000 other versions of Italy, both of breathtaking beauty and heartbreaking tragedy.This book by Mr. Hoffman tells it like it really is: the good, the bad, and the ugly (to borrow from a Spaghetti Western).

I kept wanting to throw it against the wall, but waiting for it to turn around. It never did. It is a rant about everything \\"wrong\\" with Italy. In the very last few pages, he acknowledges that Italians say they would never want to live anywhere else. But does he explore why? No. I even had my sister read it--married to an Italian, and had lived there for years. She had the same reaction. It's not like what he narrates is entirely wrong (though some is); it's just not anywhere near a complete picture. It's as if you started to look at your beautiful beloved to find all the flaws--they're there, but do not constitute the overwhelming experience. The title and introduction seem pasted on.

This book contradicts the info I gathered from my other sources (other sources made more sense), the format wasn't organized well, even if I did want to try Woods' methods, where would I start? I do not believe that a failing child needs to be sat down for a whole hour each day and be made to suffer through more instruction and homework at home! And out of nowhere, there is a paragraph on punishment...right after saying that praise is key, she says you may need to use punishment. For what, not being able to read? I didn't have the strength to muster on, this book was not a good resource, and boring to slog through.

Maybe it's my imagination?? I dunno. But also,The bottle I bought @ dept store says \\" Vera wang\\" and the address in NY where is was made on the bottom of the bottle, and this one did not. Which is what got me suspicious. Been meaning to go to the store to see if they ALL have it on the bottom, if so, then that would answer my question.

I'm not sure why previous reviewers said it smells swampy, but maybe it was a bad batch? One spray is strong enough to get a wisp of it on your clothes, but not too strong and stifling as a lot of other perfumes are like. The perfume is supposed to act with the warmth of your skin to give it an even more pleasant smell. I'm constantly looking for new perfumes as I like to try new things, but no other perfume smells quite as good as vera wang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, do not waste your money!","review":"I've got it very fast and was very dissappointed.It's not authentic... and it's defenetely not a smell as Vera Wang parfume.Please, do not think that Vera Wang can smell so bad.... as this liquid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: This perfume is fake","review":"Ordered this perfume because I was about to run out of my old bottle of Vera Wang.

This one is weak and predictable. I forced myself to finish the book but read several others between. I find the less someone knows about a topic the weaker the read. I am so annoyed with the reviews. I go by them when I purchase most everything on Amazon and I don't understand how anyone could have rated it so high. I will not be purchasing the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Irish story","review":"you can tell Nora loves Ireland.

Where as a good read such as a David Balducci will keep me up for hours reading.I don't think I've read a more boring, badly written book in a very long time. It even makes Danielle Steel's rubbish look good. Go ahead and read it if you're 10 and impressionable. Pass this one up if you're an adult and like a well written thought out plot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read the first four chapters","review":"I purchased this book at the Airport. For the first ten pages or so, my fellow travellers noticed [to my embarrassment], that I couldn't take the smile off my face. Such humour was written into the opening paragraphs - the author must have been writing about any one of us, male or female. Right up until Aidan and Gallagher's came into the picture this promised to be a work of art, encompassing the beauty of Ireland, it's folk lore, rich and wonderful people and the history of ghosties and goblins. Unfortunately after Aidan came into the story, it became nothing but pages and pages of two people thinking about becoming intimate - no more than a basic Love Story.....which could have been written on a rainy afternoon - just to fill in the time. The two stars are for the opening pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"After finishing this book, I wanted to jump on a plane straight to Ireland. Nora Roberts has managed to capture all of the wonderful magic surrounding Ireland and wrap it up in a romantic package. She describes this small village in detail where everyone knows one another, and they all believe in fairy tales. You will love this one. I can't wait to read the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Irish Trilogy","review":"Just loved reading this book could not put it down, cannot wait to read the next two books in the series"},{"rating":"2","title":"she just keeps getting better!","review":"Nora Roberts, I can easily say, is my all time favorite author. This is the start of yet another Irish tritogy, and I almost didn't buy it. What a HUGE mistake that would have been! I don't know where she gets her inspiration, but every one of her books are wonderful. You know its a good one, when your six year old daughter catches you laughing out loud and all your doing is reading. Nora also has a wonderful sense of family in her books, since I'm from a very close family, that in itself keeps me coming back for more. It's truly one of those books where you'll laugh and cry. I can't wait for the next one in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"NORA JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER","review":"I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I CAN ADD SINCE ITS BEEN SAID IN SO MANY REVIEWS, BUT THIS BOOK IS EXCELLANT!

When will that be released?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel of the sun","review":"I tried to read the book slowly, not wanting it to end. This proved to be difficult, and I finished it in three days. Jude and Aidan were magnificant together. The Irish overtones brought tears on more than one occasion. Ireland is the land of my roots, this book makes me want to visit there even more. Nora, please hurry with Tears of the Moon. There are a lot of anxious people waiting to finish the trilogy. Personally, I can't wait to see what trouble Darcy will get into!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding!","review":"This book is the first of three incredible stories. There's just enough fantasy for those of us who believe, but also plenty of real life relationship stuff to keep everyone entertained. I think many of us can relate to the desire to run away to another country and get caught up in a romantic fantasy. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of a good series","review":"Starting off brilliantly, this book does manage to get bogged down in typical romantic stereotypes. However, it is well written, moves at an easy pace, and is enjoyable to the end. Up there with Nora's best attempts, and easily recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story that had me hooked from the start","review":"When I first started reading this book I knew I had to have the other two also. I couldn't put it down after I got it. The storyline is beautiful not only because its very discriptive, but most of all because it taught me alot about learning to love yourself before being able to love anyone else. Jude is one of those people who start out insecure with themselfes.As the book goes on she slowly learns more about who she is and what she wants out of life. This tale truly touched my heart unlike any other story I've ever read before. The other books are equally as wonderful. Each book adds to the others another piece to the puzzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was O.K. I would give it a C-.","review":"I have read practically every Nora Roberts out there. I usually am enchanted with her work. oops, for a while there I thought I was reading \\"Enchanted\\". Same book, different setting. To much detail and not enough focus on Jude and Aidans relationship. The character of Jude is virtually identical to that of Rowan in Enchanted, which I just finished reading. The secondary characters were great. I am looking forward to Shawn and Darcy's stories. The last scene in the bar was disturbing to me. Violence in the name of what? It is still violence. Not a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!","review":"This is probably the worst writing I have ever read. The first few paragraphs are nothing but description and narrative. I know romance novels don't exactly have the best writing out there, but even for a romance novel this writing is terrible. The heroine, Jude, is unbelievable, pathetic, and silly. The hero is unreal as well and shallow and dumb. I couldn't get into the story because there wasn't much of one, and the book would stop for ramblings of conversations that didn't move the story along at all and would stall into page after page of blah blah blah. Then some more static description, then more stalls of blah blah blah. Repeat that throughout the book.I don't know how this book even got published. The entire simple story could have been told in a few pages, and still would have been terrible. Awful. I feel sorry for the trees that gave their lives for this waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewels of the Sun on cd","review":"I ordered it believing it was unabridged, but it was abridged. I was very disappointed when I received it. I had asked for unabridged. The abridged was only 3 disks."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Trilogy!","review":"I loved all three of these books, it's amazing how close you can feel to people that don't even exist. This book has it all, great relationships, great setting, great story, great food, great music..............I really can't say enough positive things about this trilogy. I wanted to go to Ireland, find Gallaghers, sit down, and have Darcy serve me a pint and whatever the lunch special was for the day. When I was done with the last book I wanted more, more, more! I even started drinking Irish tea and made some Irish meals. The Irish trilogy books will make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, nothing really bad happens in this story..........it's all good. If you want to read a little more about the Gallaghers go to Nora's webite and check out the short story she wrote on Christmas in Ardomore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nora Roberts at her very best!","review":"I've loved the McGregor books, but this one is even better! I felt that I was right there in Ireland living with Jude. The book is so descriptive, you really feel a part of the action. You ache for poor Gwen and rejoice for Jude and Aiden when they finally figure out what needs to be said. I can't wait for the next books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Characters in a Fairy Tale Setting","review":"An enchanting setting and a passionate fairy tale provide the charming background to this contemporary story that explores the complexity, independence and passion of two people from different worlds. The characters feel so real that you expect them to walk out of the pages and start breathing. A very fun and satisfying romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewels of the Sun","review":"This is the second book I have read by Nora Roberts where the setting is in Ireland. It makes me want to put my life on hold and go visit there for a half a year! I thought the book had a slow start but as I kept reading it picked up speed. I could identify with Jude in the fact that she was divorced and trying to find herself again. She went on a trip to decompress and when you are not looking for it love it always hits you. I loved the back and forth between her and Aiden. Jude was able to open herself up to a new set of friends and fall in love with a hardworking and prideful man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I have always loved Ms. Roberts books but I have to agree that this is one I could have missed. I found myself skimming through pages - something I have never done with her others. Too much scenic detail and not enough interaction between the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight disappointment","review":"My major gripe with this book from my favorite author was the main character, Jude. She was such a contrast to the usually strong, admirable-even-though-flawed women in Roberts' books. I became annoyed with her insecurities and she wore them out for everyone to see like a badge. Bring back those women characters who can stand up to any man! I've missed them in her last few books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this book","review":"I thougght after reading some other of her books I would give the irish trilogy a try. I really wanted to like this book I thought it was going to be very intersting but I just could get the entire way through it. I only read halfway through the book and I thought it was rather dry and boriong. Skip this trilogy and read the 3 sisters island trilogy IT WAS GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"I'd read several stories by Nora Roberts before I came across this book and considering the amount of good reviews it had gotten I was expecting something amazing. But my goodness was I mistaken. I couldn't finish it and finally gave up around chapter 15.I pushed myself to read as much of it as I could but I couldn't take it seriously. It was just one irish cliche after another and I wouldn't be surprised to hear if a few leprechauns popped up later in the story . There seemed to be endless paragraphs describing the misty green hills and the red haired freckled faced women of the village. And don't get me started on the dialogue. It was so corny that I would cringe when I'd read it.I didn't enjoy Roberts' take on life in Ireland and I'll be staying well clear of any other books set in the Emerald Isle !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ireland, here I come!","review":"Thanks to this book, I'm now in love with Ireland. Ireland is beautiful and glorious and the skies are blue and strangers open their doors wide for me.But frankly, this story is snoozesville. The heroine is your typical sappy no-confidence no-clue woman who realizes, \\"Gee! I don't love my ex!\\" while having tea with a Wise Woman in a scenic inn. The hero is your typical see-her-want-her tepid sort of guy. What's to stop them from snogging at first sight? Well, there's always the heroine's contrived no-confidence plot angle.This book is pretty, scenic, well-written, but it is also slow-moving and nothing actually happens. All that's missing is the \\"Sound Of Music\\" soundtrack when Jude walks around Ye Irish Countryside.File this under \\"Favorites Of The Irish Tourism Board\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put it back on the shelf","review":"This is so bad it's scary. Do people really want to read this stuff? It has no substance, no plot, no dimension, no reality, no sense, no strong women, and throws women back in the dark ages. The main woman character has no thoughts in her head other than, wow what a cute big strong Irish guy, I hope he falls in love with me or little helpless me will fall apart. Her other challenging thought is - oh there isn't a microwave in this cottage in Ireland - help I am on my own - oh look a stove - I might have to cook -ooh I can't handle it. Come on, we need a little more substance here. Women are now allowed to have IQ's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irish?

I've been disappointed by many of the new romances I've read this year, but not by this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish Romance","review":"As a Nora Roberts fan, I enjoy the romances as much as the mysteries. But everytime Nora writes about Ireland, my heart can't help but follow. Her descriptions take me away.

I'm ready for more romance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Irish Myth and Magic Storytelling","review":"Another Wonderful book from Ms. Roberts. Loved all the Irish magic and Ireland setting for this modern day story. Adian and Jude are wonderful, strong, and fun people who fall in love despite their stubborn nature, one or both, and you can't help but fall in love yourself. A must read.

What a Charming Family and all they will do, and not do, for this thing we call love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a cup of tea and have a seat, It's a wonderful tale!","review":"I have to say that Jewels of the Sun is a warm, touching, funny, feel good story that could warm your heart on the coldest of days. It leaves you day dreaming of Irelands tranquility and excellent hospitality of your neighbors. It's a story of a woman named Jude, who lived stressed out in a big city, and found \\"home\\" in her family's cottage on an enchanted hill in a quaint town in Ireland. Love were her neighbors in each direction. And peace of mind she found in it's hills. Although almost 30, her life was now only beginning. A romance finds her, for the first time she has true friends, and most importantly, she finds herself.This wonderful story must be read. Thank You Nora Roberts for bringing joy into my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Want to Visit Ardmore!","review":"This was only the 2nd Nora Roberts book I had ever read and it definitely will not be my last!! This is the best Romance novel I have ever read. I too flew through this book in about 2 days and fell in love with Ireland and Aidan! I felt like I could really relate to Jude. If only there were more men like Aidan in real life. I bought Tears of the Moon the first day it came out. Though it was also a good read, I didn't think it lived up to the first. I thought Jude and Aidan were much more interesting characters than Sean and Brenna. However, I can hardly wait for the 3rd installment with Darcy and the rich businessman from America. Seems like just her cup of tea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewels of the Sun","review":"What a wonderfully romantic book! The sequal Tears of the Moon was even better if that was at all possible.

I followed up with Tears of the moon and I can't wait for her 3rd book. I highly recommend these books to everyone who enjoys romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me away.....","review":"I haven't found a book written by Nora Roberts - or J.D.Robb, that hasn't held my interest from the very beginning. Her descriptions of the characters & the places make you feel that not only do you know these people, but that you want to go & find romance yourself. After finishing a book, I always hope that there will be a sequel with the same characters at a different time in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish Lore","review":"A charming tale. A cottage built on a fairy hill, tucked down a lane surrounded with flowers in jewel-like clusters. The cottage comes with it's own ghosts, a pair of lovers that had a mars/venus misunderstanding, and have waited 300 years for another romance to be fulfilled that will break the spell.

Can not wait for Shawn and Darcy's stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewels of the Sun-review","review":"I just finished reading this book and I must say, I could not put it down.

I can't wait for the second book of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at her best","review":"I know that most people who read this book and the others that followed really enjoyed the series but I just couldn't get into it....I read about half of this book and had to stop and pick up something else.....I really enjoyed Adian and his character but I just couldn't get into Jude...And the fairie story that underlined everything was just too out there for me....I love Nora Roberts don't get me wrong and the idea of this story....Jude who placed her life on hold to go to Ireland and live in the house where her grandmother lived was a great background to this story but from there it wasn't a good read.....sorry Nora!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Swept up in the beauty of the scenery.","review":"You couldn't help but root for Aidan to win over Jude. The story makes you want to move to Ireland and find people just like you read about. The imagery was beautiful and made you visualize the countryside, flowers, the charachters. A recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trilogy","review":"I am reading the trilogy for the second time. I wish that I knew more about faeries and Irish folklore, as it seems so captivating. I feel as though I have been to Ireland, with the way that Nora Roberts writes.As with pretty much all romance novels, one of the characters fights the relationship. Usually the leading lady is cast as either the Stubborn Feisty Independent type, or the Helpless and Needy type. This book goes with the former. I roll my eyes at some of the love scenes... but isn't that why we read these anyway!? :)By the way, the second and third in the trilogy are just as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Lyrical Book","review":"Nora Roberts has quite a talent for lyrical writing. Her descriptions of Ireland and the village of Ardmore are so enchanting that you feel as though you have been there. The touching romance and genuine attraction between the main characters makes the storyline fly along. Somewhere along the way, you begin to believe in fairy tales and fairy princes.Definitely, a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid reader","review":"Love this trilogy; kept me involved through all 3 books .

I was immediately ready for the second, Tears of the Moon. I was so pulled into this story, I had to find the second of the trilogy immediately (and we were on vacation). Mystical, Fairies,the Irish folklore, tears, Irish tempers, just makes you want to pack your bags and travel to Ireland to experience the people and places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this","review":"This book is silly. Faeries and the like, oh baby yeah that's really romantic. Yeah right. I'm a Roberts fan, but i think her little \\"fun and harmless\\" books are getting to be pretty...fruity. Stick with longer books, where she's able to develope and be oh i don't know... slightly realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked","review":"This valve leaked before I could complete the renovation of my bathroom. Unfortunately, it was after cultured marble walls were Installed. Not what I expected from a Kohler product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to do","review":"I purchased two of these during the past year for two bathroom updates. I had existing builder grade Kohler valve trim and wanted to update to newer valve trim/ faucets. I did not replace the entire valve with these units, only removing the cartridge in the front and plastic trim and extensions that were included. This helped so that the new Kohler trim could be attached easily. It was actually more cost effective to purchase new valves on Amazon than trying to purchase only parts of the valves, excluding the metal portion where the pipes attach, not wanting to replace what was already there and functioning unless there was no other way. I looked up my older Kohler faucet model to see what valve may have been in there already and this was the one that might fit, and thankfully, it did and easily. It wasn't the same for other valves in my remodel.The replacements work well in both bathrooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value - cheaper than individual parts","review":"I installed a valve like this about 8 years ago during a bath remodel - due to the less-than-optimum design (documented on many forums) it's going to start leaking in 7-10 years unless you have ultra-soft water.You can either remove the plastic part, disassemble, and replace the O-rings (be very careful not to break any of the plastic guts - with all the hard water calcification I was unable to avoid breaking the plastic guts), or you can buy this piece, remove the entire plastic valve assembly and place it in the old brass assembly that is in your bathroom wall (after turning off the water supply, of course).Easy enough for a moderately talented DIY type to do, and the price for the whole assembly is less than the price for the plastic valve and the necessary O-rings. Recycle the brass, or save it for the next project!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"My contractor just informed me that no matter what he does, the valve won't stop leaking. He went out and paid $50 for a new cartridge and it still leaks. Not only do I have to go out and buy a new valve, but we're going to have to tear down our brand new tile to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and helpful during a tough time.","review":"Anita is an excellent writer and relates Jewish custom in an understanding way, always acknowledging that different types of Jews chose to celebrate/mourn differently. She is never condescending and does not Judge. This is extremely informative and I would highly recommend it to anyone. I personally have been comforted by the book as it has explained my role during the death of a loved one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice","review":"The book is well written, but is neither the most thorough treatment of the topic, nor the most authentic treatment.

I see no fun in walking thru a swamp beating up enemies. I prefer the old format better where there was a home world, you collect gems, beat up enemies, collect eggs or free dragons, and have access to other levels. Bottom line, this game is boring unless you like dark games or fighting games.

There was a neat intro in artistic detail, but if anything they should have put one of the other Dragons from Spyro in this cause the story doesn't fit Spyro. The game played more like a fighting game with leveling up like in an RPG. I have all the Spyro games, I like RPG, I like fighting games. I don't like spending over $20 on a game that lasts 4 hours. I'm not even that good at action, platform, or fighting games. If you like RPG, the only thing it has in common with them is leveling up- nothing else. The fighting moves are not good enough to make this worth it. Like everyone says- the game only relates to the Spyro series in that is has the graphic images of Spyro and somewhat Sparx. The boss battles are long, but don't require a lot of strategy- just hits and saving energy. This is a side-scroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had ptential","review":"this game had so much potential. excellent graphics, good sound, decent level environments, easy controls, new moves, interesting 'breaths'. but it was very short and very repetitive: the main enemies were one character throughout the entire game, they just changed costumes in each level [only about 6 levels, no portals], these main characters also made the same sounds throughout [a few different rivals are added due to the level you are in].there are constant film sequences interrupting game play, some in which you can not skip.and there is little to no reply value like the first 3 games in the series [for Playstation] and the level where you learn your new powers can not be passed by, this would be nice to skip if you have already beaten the game once.>> note: no more portals here. if you want classic Spyro, your looking in the wrong place. this game was disappointing. fun for the first run through.

However, that's all that I liked about this Spyro.You spend a good portion of the game in training, with no choice of continuing the game without finishing it. The worlds seem to be less '3-D' due to the fact that you are forced down one path and one path only.Finally, it took only a couple of days to finish the whole game - I want something that lasts longer.It was very unsatisfying and I hope that if they come out with another version they go back to their Spyro roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spyro A New Ending!","review":"I'm sorry, but where is the old Spyro where you collect gems?

I have played all of this games predecessors more times than I can count so obviously I was waiting for the new edition anxiously. Letdown of epic proportions. It is obvious VERY LITTLE time and effort went into the development of this game. You will die of boredom just waiting to get into gameplay and then it doesn't even begin to resemble the style of the old games. It is repetitive and short. Unless you only get your kicks from graphics and do not consider actually being challenged as part of the game experience - save the cash and get something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Letdown but Pretty to Look At","review":"It's interesting that this game depicts Spyro's beginnings because with THESE beginnings you'd expect Sypro to have been some kind of Jedi Knight by the time he made it to A Hero's Tale (or perhaps in therapy). In \\"Legend\\" Spyro is more like a ninja than the cool, sassy fun dragon whose biggest enemies are Gnorks and an Evil Neptune in drag. I gave up on the game after the second round of training for moves that would make the most dexterously agile 12 year old need AsperCream for his thumbs. Anyway, this is a really neat idea with beautiful graphics, but the whimsy-with-challenge charm that Spyro has previously had (super early games excepted because I haven't played them, so I don't know) is lost to a very dark and somewhat violent game that is dominated by the player being under basically constant and copious attack. It's really too bad, because it had a lot of promise, and I enjoyed the start of it the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!

I did no research because I was basing my Spyro \\"wants\\" on previous games but I wish I had now. I beat this game in less than 7 hours and it was the same thing over and over. There was too many dragons talking, too many movie clips (which you can't get out of) and was just plain boring. I kept playing in the hopes that it would get better and more difficult, but was very disappointed when I beat Cynder the first time I tried. I wish it was like the first Spyro's in that there were many worlds (not 5) and there were other side activities to play. This one was the same all the way through. Beat the bad guys, collect NO gems or dragonflies, and once in a while get a new breath which you had training for."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel burned","review":"As a dracophile, I want to be able to give this game a higher rating. The reason I can't is because its replay value, while more than 0, is less than 1. I could do without the whole \\"mash the same buttons to do the same move with a different breath in an unskippable scene\\" bit too.Because of this game, I've figured out what it is that bothers me about the \\"artist's shortcut\\" of band-scales/scale plates in dragon art: often the scale plates start on the dragon's chest rather than the bottom of the lower jaw, and that is exactly what we see on the dragons here. My philosophy on that is: either draw all of the scales, or none of them. Plus Spyro's horns look more like they're glued to his head rather than growing out of it, and his nostrils look like an afterthought.It was fun the first time, and until I had all the breaths powered up the second.

There are tons of cool fight scenes. Lots of good villains and heroes. The voice acting is good and the animation is also pretty good. There is really good character development and some emotional scenes. This series also has lots of action to keep you interested.I can't think of anything bad to say about Guyver.

He'll take the time to explain some simple, and not too relevant, item (e.g.;definition of an isotope) and then launch into a very complex principle of cosmology at breakneck speed as if he were talking to a colleague.

Sharp looking device with good potential but not as simple as the name indicates. It has a slow CPU and is limited to 10/100 Mbps network (1000 Mbps is standard on most other NAS servers). The SimpleShare worked for a total of 15 mins after which it showed consistent permission errors. The drive failed to attach (or publish) itself to the Windows network. Having networked offices nationwide, I'm fairly familiar with the diagnostic routines. After two days however, I gave in and called SimpleTech support. Over the course of two additional days (and long hold times), I spoke to 3 different people, neither of whom could help me solve the problem.

Based on the recommendation of some of the readers I bought this book only to find it superficial. The stories are cluttered and unorganised. The entire book nearly consists of stories of how other people feel and just a short analysis of the author's opinion. I found this book to lack depth of analysis and boring.

It tells us what we know and gives us a word to use against those who still think the twenties are roaring.BUT it does not offer solutions. Neither does the sequel. I wanted this book to be better than it is.Instead, I would go for a book that offers a range of solutions--in a funny, practical way. 'Get It Together: Surviving your Quarterlife Crisis' by Damian Barr does just what it promises to. Helps you get through your quarterlife crisis. It looks at property, money, relationships and work. We hear from lots of different people--some smart, some not-so-smart. All interesting.

And don't weep."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless waste of time","review":"this book is a complete waste of time. the entire message of the book is that people in their early twenties either don't know what they want to do with their lives or don't have enough money to do what they really want. if you are or have ever been in your 20s you surely already know this and thus don't need to waste your time reading abou it. the authors offer no insight or advice, life changing or otherwise. the book simply collects the comments of a group of mostly over-privilaged twentysomethings whining about having to deal with the real world.not only is the content of the book disappointing, it is also poorly written. it seems to be written at about a 7th grade level. it wouldn't have taken more than a few hours to read the entire book, yet i found myself skipping large sections due to the book's repetitiveness and the dumbed-down writing style.don't buy it. don't borrow it. don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you are in your twenties","review":"I had to read this book for a class. Overall, it felt like the kind of book a person will enjoy and find interesting if he or she is just out of college and going through the \\"quarterlife crisis.\\" Otherwise, it seems too intent in demonstrating the existence and the characteristics of such a crisis. The book is composed mostly by excerpts from the interviewees, with few comments from the authors.

I got the book, very excited to see what others had to say and hopefully find some suggestions. The book provides some, but when in the situation of a quarter-life crisis, this book was more depressing and was like rubbing salt in the wound, rather than uplifting. It was interesting to see others' stories, but that didn't really make me feel better about my situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant, class-biased whine","review":"Nowhere in this book (not the introduction, not the back cover, nowhere) do the authors state that their analysis will be limited exclusively to college graduates. Throughout the book they only interview college graduates. Less than *thirty percent* of Americans aged 20-29 have a bachelor's degree (look for yourself on the Census Bureau's website) yet the authors routinely discuss their analysis as though it applies to all \\"twentysomethings.\\"Other twentysomethings have problems of a much different nature: feeding their children, dodging bullets in the military, working while attending school.

But man, was this one boring. Slow moving. Repetitive. You get the picture. I couldn't even finish it. Of course, for a book airing the views of twentysomethings, I guess I shouldn't have been expecting dazzling insights or anything. As an age group, judging from this book, it appears we don't really have much to say for ourselves, sigh. The sorority one and the Yale secret society one were much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good premise - Poor execution","review":"Ms. Robbins and Ms. Wilner do an excellent job identifying the problem. They prove, beyond a doubt, that recent college graduates face more pressures and have a difficult time adapting to life beyond the campus. I bought this book because as a recent graduate myself, I see myself and many of my friends unhappy and unfulfilled in their first, second and third jobs after school. I found the topic fascinating and the authors do an incredibly thorough job identifying the problem.My problem with the book is that the authors do too thorough a job. The multitude of interviews becomes just that, a compilation of interviews with no in-depth exploration. After a hundred, one page interview explanations, the book becomes repetitive and boring.The topic drives this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't even bother","review":"This has got to be the worst book I've read in a long time. As someone in their 20s, I decided to read the book as, as the authors do point out, not many books and movies cater directly to young adults who are past college but not yet parents.That being said, this book is a complete disappointment. The book is nothing more than ramblings of college graduates who complain that secretary work is \\"demeaning\\" and that they're upset that people \\"stupider\\" than them have better jobs. This book caters only to middle-class/upper-middle class readers. The book is ultimately all that is wrong with America.No mention is made of poorer young adults, and even well-off young adults who choose not to go to college. The book ultimately is gossipy and filled with shallow complaints. Also, very little is offered to help a young person deal with problems.The only way I'd use this book again is if the heat is turned off in my apartment. Then I'd burn it for heat and fuel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"What bothered me about this book was that none of the 20-somethings seemed to have any real responsibilities. Not all recent grads had their education and expenses paid for them. How many college grads can just quit the job they don't like and go live abroad? That's what it seems everyone in this book did. Didn't they have student loans or ANYTHING that they had to pay for? The truth is that most people have actual bills, in addition to rent and cannot just take off on a whim and move to Australia and Iceland to \\"find themselves\\". I was really hoping for a better book that actually related to real peoples' problems. It had so much potential. I just wish they interviewed people who weren't spoiled brats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quarterlife Crisis with no answers...","review":"While its wonderful to know that others go through the same trials and tribulations, this is a work that, for me, went no where. No suggestions are made on how to improve a situtation. Rather, the book shows that others are facing many of the same challenges. Some are resolved, others are left wide open with no sense of closure. This book is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"This book tries to sell itself as a sef-help book for twenty-somethings. It is really just a collection of brief descriptions of other people's problems. These little tidbits aren't even interesting.

Anyway, I prefered the Go-Girl Guide, save its tremendously less sophisticated title, because the author has actually SURVIVED her 20's and lived to talk about it.

If you're in your twenties, or want to understand your children, friends, or employees who are, this is a good book to pick up.It covers all of the major challenges twentysomethings face in our increasingly complicated and competitive world: loneliness, anxiety, career challenges, etc. Many young people will recognize themselves in these stories, and will realize they are not alone.The book is almost exclusively a collection of interviews and quotes. If you're looking for hard data on how young people are now different (and the reasons behind these changes), you'll want a book like _Generation Me_ instead. Another good book on the topic is _Emerging Adulthood_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"This is the most depressing book I have ever read. It is so replete with tales of miserable college grads, it strips away all hopeful thoughts of life after the undergrad experience.For a certain type of reader I imagine it could be helpful, but chapter after chapter of commiseration is not helpful for me.Never before and never since reading this book have I returned a book to the vendor insisting upon a full refund due to the content, but I did not want any of my resources going to support such a totally dismal and pointless read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could she know?","review":"I have another book, The Go-Girl Guide to Surviving Her 20's, that I have really enjoyed; so the advertisements about this being a new idea are just inaccurate.

The quarterlife crisis is not discussed here at all. It is simply attempting to give one permission to whine about such things as a decreased social life after joining the workforce. Welcome to the real world. The book declares that you're not alone if you're feeling lost and uncertain after college. That's fine, but simply declaring it doesn't make it feel any better. The authors had good intentions, but their presentation is lacking severely."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONQUERING YOUR QUARTERLIFE CRISIS IS BETTER","review":"This book didn't do anything for me. There weren't any solutions. Conquering Your Quarterlife Crisis is the sequel which had solutions that were helpful so I would recommend that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modestly interesting and even less useful","review":"Having just turned 25 and needing some advice on what the hell to do about it, I picked up this cleverly-titled paperback. Long before the end, though, I realized Quarterlife Crisis coasts by more on its inherently interesting subject matter than anything the authors have to say about it. Throughout all 198 pages it has this anecdotal, unstructured, almost gossipy feel. A recurring theme is for the authors to make a point (usually an obvious one), then spend the next 20 pages circumventing the subject instead of expanding or analyzing, much less providing a solution. There are pockets of insight here and there, but most of the comfort of reading this book ended where it started: knowing my concerns affected others.Consider this a book written for ditzes, by ditzes. Anyone with brains or ambitions in life would need a stronger dose of logic and insight to be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go talk to your friends instead...","review":"Yawn.

After reading 3 chapters I was bored! Everything I got out of it I could have gotten from friends going through the same thing! I felt like the authors were going around in a circle and stating the same things over and over again.

It's normal, and all you need to do is talk with people that are, or have been through the same thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool DVD","review":"My son loved this DVD.

The story just seem to run out of steam, rather than wrap up the plot lines started in When the Devil Dances. The ending is very rushed and you get the feeling Ringo was more concerned about meeting a publisher deadline (which is also the reason he gives for this really being the end of WTDD, what I don't understand is why not push the pub date back and put out the book you really meant to write?) than really providing enough closure to the series to satisfy readers until he returns to the series.Maybe one day we will get to return to the world and enjoy the characters again when Mr. Ringo decides to give it another shot, but the story and universe he created with the first three books deserved a much more fitting break and/or ending point than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"It's too bad the series had to end this lamely.

Not even remotely funny.It's insulting for the author to offer a product that he obviously knows is inferior, then apologize for it in the afterword. I don't care about his problems finishing the book. He's competing in the marketplace for my dollars (someone as gung-ho for American ideals as Ringo must know this), but I won't buy any of his future books.

The one aspect that makes this book superior to the previous tomes is that it is significantly shorter (hence the two stars). Ringo writes passable battle narrative, but the complete lack of realistic and interesting characters makes the outcomes irrelevant. When you don't care about the characters, you don't care if they live or die.I had hope for the series after the first book, but instead of the author developping as a writer, he has been pumping out formula stories that have gotten worse, not better with each release.This is one franchise that is dead and should have been buried long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never hear music like this on TV again","review":"This is exceptional music from an exceptional era in Dr. Who, Season 18. The most unusual stories, the best sets, the most spectacuar special fx(for Dr. Who), Tom Baker, the most original and unusual Dr. Who, and Romana, the most intelligent of compaignions to boot. And of course the futuristic music from this CD. Meglos is much like Leisure Hive(see reveiw), Futuristic. Full Circle has a more mysterious feel, much like State of Decay and Warrior's Gate(Hopefully will be released also!) With haunting and sometimes sinister melodies. like 'Mistfall' or 'The Giants Leave the Swamp' or 'Spiders 1&2'. 'Adric finds the TARDIS' is also very haunting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take this book. Please.","review":"Well, it's a good guide for people who are absolutely clueless to the RPG world, or who are having a really hard time with FFT. However, this book is anything but \\"ultimate\\".

Save your money and look for FAQs and Walkthrus on the Internet, or buy to official guide put out by Prima, which is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing offer","review":"Murder Suicide continues the series and continues the sensitivity. Ablow deals with his various characters, and he makes his readers deal with them too. Does Frank inspire his son, appall his son, or intrigue his son? Has the doctor killed himself or been killed? Has the mentally ill lady been the part of an elaborate scheme or been the murderer herself? Mr. Ablow continues to intrigue his readers with his flawed and human characters and with his unique story-lines. You move with the characters to watch what they do, and wonder what will happen next. You cry with them, beg them to shape up, and form compassionate bonds with them. Mr. Ablow has an ability to draw his reader into the story to almost become a part of the plot itself. At the same time, he asks his reader to observe and stand back to experience the pleasure of his depth of understanding--as to why each one acts as he does. Is it murder or is it suicide, and in the end is one really any different from the other?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainstream Fails--------A Thriller It's Not","review":"I've all the author's books in this series and until I read this one I really enjoyed every one. This one read like the author decided to write a mainstream mystery novel and to make the protagonist your normal psychiatrist. The cutting edge writing that made the other books great is totally absent. Here's hoping Dr. Ablow will abandon this approach and return to writing truly exciting psychological thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this after reading Child or Pelecanos","review":"Apparently I'm in a minority but, yawn, it was so tedious. I found the descriptions of where 'we were' to be sparse, almost nonexistent. Maybe they're in other novels. Boston is a helluva city. Read Spenser. Boston is like a fifth character, another subplot. You're there, man.One reviewer commented that Clevenger appeared to be on the phone all the time. That was my read as well.I recognize that Kellerman and White have made the forensic psychiatric murder milieu a virtual cottage industry. Maybe that's my problem. I don't get into it. Seems too unbelivable. All those patients. All those murders. Whatever.So my take was it was tedious, I didn't \\"feel\\" the environment, and I found the tricking of guilty people to be, incredible.

This album proves it. 20 Flight Rock is so incredible, it must be heard to be believed. Somethin' Else just jams, I Fought The Law is almost better than the original, Be Bop A Lula, surpasses the orginal, Let It Rock is everything you expect it to be and Train Kept A Rollin' will keep you rollin' and wanting more.

Just like those two bands' albums, there are some stunningly gorgeous songs and others that are more mediocre. Overall, this album is very strong and depending on the listener's mood, one song may stand out at any given time. It starts out with \\"Say Something New\\", which feels like one of those songs I will still love listening to decades from now. There are several other standouts, \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" and \\"Foreign Country\\" come to mind, that make this an album to listen to in its entirety. This is not a Top 40 single and filler album like most of the garbage out there, this is a complete album. Listen to it and enjoy. (Check out any Mazzy Star's \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\" or Bettie Serveert's \\"Dust Bunnies\\" if you like this.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd be better off listening to actual concrete","review":"The problem with this band is their style is really boring. Too mellow, just a bunch of drums and soft whiny lyrics without any real pizzazz. The singer is annoying also, but more annoying on this CD than she is on the newest release \\"In Colour\\", which isn't quite as bad; it's a step forward if nothing else.

Dr. Via admits the scriptures consistently condemn homosexual practice. The core of his argument is: \\"I maintain, however, that the absolute prohibition can be overridden regardless of how many times it is stated, for there are good reasons to override it\\" (p. 94).Dr. Gagnon contends that there are no good reasons to override the clear teaching of scripture. He says, \\"It is hard, when one sees another struggling with temptations, not to alleviate the struggle by permitting what Scripture deems sinful\\" (p. 92). He argues against declassifying homosexuality as a sin regardless of societal pressure to do so.I was unconvinced by Via's reasons to override the scriptures, but I found his arguments useful in understanding those who take his stand.I would recommend this book as an introduction to a scriptural view of homosexuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Place to Begin","review":"In the heated rhetoric of denominational debates over the Bible, ordination and homosexuality, this book helpfully provides a basic yet adequate introduction to the primary interpretative conclusions on the main biblical texts with two major alternative viewpoints where the authors present their arguments and then interact with each other's position. Robert Gagnon has written a much more thorough study of pertinent Biblical and historical materials elsewhere, but this book provides a simple summary of his conclusions for those beginning to study these somewhat complex arguments. Via helpfully summarizes some of the arguments and conclusions of those seeking change in the way in which Christians have traditionally interpreted and applied the biblical texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh","review":"I personally love this show, but I purchased this item on the 1st of April and it is now the 14th of May and have yet to recieve this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work just fine!","review":"Saw this battery, and my original Canon battery is on it's way out, so ordered it, and it seems to work just fine in my old Canon XT.

His masterful exposition of rudimentary and not-so-rudimentary algebra is extraordinarily clear and notably readable. The problems that Euler designed are both profoundly elegant and in-depth. A percentage of each of his problem sets is relatively straightforward while other problems require some attentive thought. If one is interested in becoming a proficient algebraist in the classical sense, then Euler's work will greatly facilitate this objective. If one simply desires to 'read' mathematics for the sheer pleasure of it, this book will fulfill that aim.By the way, the other reviewer's one-star rating has to do with a softcover and edited edition of this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme Abridgment of Euler's Work","review":"This book is NOT a reprint of Euler's book as the publisher claims. Point one..is has significantly fewer than 300 pages and the Hewlett reprint requires close to 600 pages. Furthermore, Euler, a genius in mathematics, is corrupted by a new organizing of its contents as if this new editor had the genius to select and reorder the contents. Important footnotes have been removed under the pretense that they just took up space..etc. These include the famous Lagrange notes. Part II of the Algebra is completely left out.

After starting the P90X fitness program I was looking for something that would help to reduce the next day soreness. I couldn't bring myself to spend the exorbitant amount for actual P90X recovery drink and instead found this from a couple of forums. From day one this product has been a life saver. My next day soreness is almost nonexistent now and I can easily perform my best for all the routines. The flavor of the drink is similar to Tang and goes down easily after a rough workout. I first tried mixing this in a cup and it seemed fairly grainy, but using a blender bottle eliminated this. This is just my two cents as an average guy. If you're not used to working out and don't want to bother trying to put together your own blend of drinks, then go for this.

For me, it keeps the calf muscle cramps at bay and diminishes my post run fatigue after a 2 hour or so trail run. I'd recommend buying sample sizes of several flavors before purchasing a large container. The flavors are truly a matter of personal taste: I like the vanilla and fruit punch flavors and not the orange or chocolate. Also, some flavors agree with my stomach better as post race beverages (the vanilla), while others I can take in a sports bottle during the run (the fruit punch). The lemon lime in the Accelerade version also suits my stomach, as a chllled post race drink. All are better with cold water, in my opinion.On a side note, the vanilla mixed with a bit of powdered milk makes a good coffee creamer for backpacking. I'm not sure if the heat of the coffee kills the effectiveness of the R4 ingredients. Maybe Endurox will come out with a Coffee Latte flavor? :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reduces soreness well, tastes alright","review":"This was my first time using a recovery drink and I used this product on a 10 day bike tour averaging 75 miles per day. I definitely saw a reduction of soreness compared to how I feel after a couple of consecutive training days. The container recommends mixing it in cold water - definitely better than warm water (I didn't have a choice most days). Regardless, it mixes well. I'm not sure if I would buy again or just stick to a milkshake after my rides. Over the course of a trip however, it did its job and worked well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, and doesn't taste bad!","review":"I saw this Endurox product in a bike shop, and thought I'd try it out.

This powder actually tastes good, and I do think it helps a lot more than just having a protein shake after a long day.Alternatively, you can also drink chocolate milk if you don't want to pay for the powder.

Unfortunately, there are other bands that do folk rock a whole lot better, my favorites being Rilo Kiley and Aimee Mann.

(I HATE the new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles). I just hope it doesn't become one of those things like pokemon, where it's popular, and then it becomes so overrated that nobody likes it anymore.

I live in Nevada and think that one state screws things up for all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better options available","review":"This book is okay. It does contain a lot of information, but the line drawings are tough to interpret and the selection of mammal bones shown is limited. There are three much better options available. All three use pictures, which are much easier to interpret and cover a much wider variety of mammals. Animal Skulls by Mark Elbroch is limited to skulls, but a very wide range of skulls is covered in incredible detail, a masterpiece, but limited to skulls. Comparative Osteology by Adams & Crabtree shows photos on a black background with somewhat difficult to read scales, and covers the major bones for a select group of mammals. My favorite is Mammalian Osteology by B. Miles Gilbert with photos of bones against a white background, with all major bones for a wide range of mammals shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong?","review":"The first season had a great story, characters and the lead heroine is an example of excellent role model.

The strong point of this book in my opinion was that it integrated viewpoints of a large number of troops in that battle along with alternative viewpoints of some Iraqi military members and some of the American soldiers' family members back home. I felt the author did a pretty good job not bogging the reader down or confusing them despite the mixture of these different viewpoints. I also enjoyed the moments when the author dabbled into some of the soldier's thoughts on killing. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about the thunder runs themselves or anyone with an interest in tanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thunder Run","review":"one among the three books, you have to read to understand how the push to Baghdad has been done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hawk Down in Baghdhad","review":"It's fitting that the author of Black Hawk Down wrote the foreward to this book, as it reads with the pulse-pounding excitement of Bowden's classic book of urban warfare. Think of this book as Black Hawk Down with tanks. Excellent examination of the flexibility of armor in an urban environment, and although it won't give you the broad view of a more comprehensive work like \\"COBRA II\\" it is an excellent detailed examination of the strikes that led to the fall of Baghdad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read From Beginning To End","review":"This was a hard fought battle and an excellent read. The news reports on this battle didn't do it justice. A page burner.One criticism, while this is mostly about an armored assault, I wished Bowden would have given the line troops holding positions in Baghdad, more of their personal stories. This is personal, and it doesn't take away from the 'overall' of this book.It is worth a Five Star review as it stands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"You will not be able to put this book down until you finish. The actions described in the book were completely neglected by all of the media outlets. I had no idea of the intensity or severity of the battles that had taken place. The book is well written and never drags or bogs down in excessive terminology and unit descriptions as some other books of this nature tend to do. You will have an even more profound appreciation for our soldiers after reading this book. This is the best first hand account of a battle since Black Hawk Down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book of modern war since Black Hawk Down","review":"This book has you hooked from beginning to end. It really pulls no punches in the descriptions of the violence that these Soldiers were subjected to. David Zucchino also keeps the book very well paced.

As the owner of my own culinary website Italian Food Forever, and someone who collects cookbooks as a hobby, I enjoy reading about the regional specialties found in Italy, and found this book a real treasure. The recipes I tried were easy to follow, and for the most part called for easy to find ingredients. My only disappointment lay in the fact there were no food photos.

Reminds me of eating suntan lotion. However, if you are a coconut person, you might love them.I'll continue to work my way through the Betty Lou flavors until I find a favorite.

It plods, is only an average Beck song and it is in no way similar or as good as 'Nicotine and Gravy', 'Pressure Zone' or the equally slow 'Beautiful Way'.The track Zatyricon is the worst thing I have heard Beck put his name to.Which leaves the video - a cut and paste, animation affair that actually detracts from the great track it accompanies."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost wonderful","review":"These overnight underwear are the best I have found so far.

This was my first Archer novel and certainly not my last- I would not be surprised if I returned to it again (of course, once I get through that huge pile of to-be-reads from AMAZON.com!). I trusted the reviews of the other readers listed below and am only too happy to add my accolades."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow read","review":"After reading the book description and some of the reviews I expected much more from this book.

In my opinion, this is Jeffrey Archer's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality, rigid headband & microphone","review":"One of the worst headsets I have ever endured. I had it 2 days before returning it. I could scarcely hear the people at the other end due to static and hissing, while in comparison the new Jensen headsetJensen JTH940 Telephone HeadsetI purchased the same day had none on the same calls. Also, although the product packaging claimed for the headset to have an adjustable boom microphone, it clearly did not. The arm of the microphone was made of hard plastic that would've broken if I'd attempted to bend it. The headband was by default WAY too small in curvature, meaning when I spread the sides to fit over my head there was a threatening creak/snap of strained plastic-scarey!The Jensen serves its purpose very well and I am happy with it. This brand will not be considered for purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I use this headset anywhere between 2 and 8 hours per day in my home office. It plugs into the remote handset of my 6-year-old vtech phone. Although the first one I bought died after about a year, I feel like I got a reasonable amount of use out of it. I was glad to see it still available, and at such a great price (about $13). I paid much more for the first one at CC's going out of business sale.Here are some specific reasons I like this headset:1. It's lightweight comfortable. It weighs almost nothing, fits well, and doesn't squeeze my ear or my head at all.2. The sound is clear.3. With only one earpiece, I can still hear my surroundings, as well as hear myself talking. With 2-earpiece headsets, I feel like I can barely hear myself talk.4. The mic has high and low settings; feedback from people I talk to indicates that they can hear me very well at the low setting, and not pick up background noise.5. Adjustable volume.6. Convenient mute switch.7. Works with an older phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for our vtech phone","review":"Even though the jack size is correct for our vtech phone, the sound was garbled and faint -- I had to return it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks every 3 months","review":"I had this headset twice now and it broke twice after 3 monthts.

It functions well with my Panasonic wireless phone and is fairly comfortable. I like that the speaker is not a foam cover like many headsets, this will make it easier to keep clean and should keep clarity.The headband is very basic and not sturdy. It's cheap though, that's what I expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"The headset feels comfortable and the ear piece is nicely cusioned. The cord is just the right length for a work at home business where you are at the computer daily. The only problem I have with this product is that the sound volume doesn't get very high so if the person on the other end isn't talking very loud, it may be hard to hear them. Mute button and mic adjustment is in a great spot and easily assesable. I would recommend this to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super for the price","review":"Great head set for the money, worked great out of the package,comfortable easy to use a little eacho but not bad at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"so far, really annoyed and frustrated","review":"it doesn't work, the volume control is a nice button, but it doesn't raise volume enough for me- volume is fuzzy-and so far, my attempt to return it for a working replacement, and/or a refund has, so far, led to tap dancing from seller rather than prompt and acceptable action--- annoyed,very annoyed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume Too Low","review":"Volume is too low, microphone touches my face unless I pull the headphone forward from my ear, flimsy cord, no instructions on what the function of the 2 switches is, one is apparently Mute.

Picked up this headset to use with an Xbox 360 controller. It started off pretty solid, but before long it stopped picking up my voice. In order to use it I pretty much have to scream into it. This could be an issue with the controller over the headset, but I haven't had issues with other headsets.Otherwise the inline mute/volume functions were great, clear sound in the earpiece, and it was an incredibly comfortable headset. If I didn't have the mic issue it'd still be my daily driver."},{"rating":"1","title":"the one i received was not a good one","review":"I dont know if i got a defective one or what but i work from home and none of my customers could here me.

I did some research, and found these. They are the same thing but better. It is a more solid build. It has a leather ear cushion, and the boom mic is much clearer (So my friends say). I'm very happy with this. It's less expensive than the default Xbox mic, and its better quality. I love it. I've already shown 3 friends, and they have ordered it already. Its perfect for Xbox Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Headset.","review":"I'd give this headset 5 stars except that the cord is thin, and doesn't last as long as I would like.

Just wish cord was a bit stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's O.K. but get a real readset.","review":"I am a little heard of hearing and I thought this would improve the quality of the sound from my speaker phone.

The sound is clear, volume is good and even between TX/RX, and the mic boom is flexible and bendable rubber.The second one purchased is the one I'm reviewing here. The materials and quality are very different than from the first one I purchased. The earpiece sound is quiet yet the mic is extremely loud. While speaking with someone, I sound twice as loud as they do and you can hear the mic reaching it's limit and clipping. The mic boom is also hard, sharply curved, and totally nonadjustable. This means the mic is a fraction of an inch from my cheek and often bumps my cheek while moving around. If the mic boom were longer or straighter, this wouldn't be a problem. But the way it's designed and curved, it pokes right into the side of my cheek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics M214C Headset","review":"This particular product did not work well with either my cordless or regular p-hone. It is difficult to hear the person talking and difficult for someone listening to me. It was suggested that I buy a \\"booster\\" to enhance both the listening and talking aspects. Also there were no instructions with the unit. It would be helpful if Plantronics spelled out the potential difficulties and included instructions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointed","review":"I had previously purchased Plantronics headsets and thought they were great.

The first work just wore out through several years of hard use. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I bought this because I needed a hands-free headset. I have to say for the price, this was a very good value. The cord is only a few feet long but for sitting or standing at a desk it makes things much easier.

Again, for the price you're paying, it is a good value and I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy Low Price","review":"I bought it for my wife for her part time job over the computer.

I would advise you look elsewhere for a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad batch?","review":"I've just returned my replacement headset. The first one was defective and so was the second one. Turned to the highest setting, the volume is lower than that of a whisper. Frankly, it's insulting to find such crap being marketed. It's a waste of my time to have to package it up and return it. It's a waste of the resources used to manufacture it. And, it's a waste of carbon-based fueled used to ship it here from China. Poor quality and waste like this make me furious!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF JUNK","review":"If you can get it to work, don't be surprised if your dog hides under the bed.

Would not recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iphone Users Beware - Not 3.5mm","review":"Plantronics has missed the boat with regard to the iPhone and new phones using a 3.5mm jack.This headset requires an adapter and there is your problem.There are different types of adapters (mono, stereo) that are very cheaply made that break or are not wired appropriately for mono headsets. Those that are properly configured, such as Headset Buddy (look for the red ones), are overly expensive and are often counterfeited being made with inferior components.Cellet, available on Amazon, is offering a 3.5mm plug on its headset that does not require an adapter. \\"Cellet 3.5mm Headset with Microphone Boom\\". Check it out before you buy this.It has a stereo plug (4 metal bands, 3 insulating rings) for plugging into a stereo jack such as the iphone and converting it to a mono headset. Cellet I think has this wired correctly to avoid shorting right and left channels together. Thus, it may make a better electrical connection than an adapter and provide a more reliable sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked one enough to buy two more","review":"I bought one of the headsets at an office supply store, replacing an older Sony model. This one, for a few dollars more, was much higher quality.

If you need a basic and inexpensive headset, i recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd broken one in as many months","review":"Bought a similar model three years ago and loved it. Worked great. Eventually it broke - somehow the wire connection becomes unstable.So for $15 bought a new one. It broke in a matter of weeks - same issue - the plug/wire wouldn't reliably work. Tried again with a replacement of the same model and the same problem again within a matter of weeks.Clearly - poor engineering. Plantronics cutting corners. If there was a higher quality higher-priced headset I'd gladly buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. Does not work in the car.","review":"I bought this based on all the positive reviews. I have been looking for a backup wired headset that has noise cancelling. My car generates a lot of road noise and I wanted a headset that would serve as a backup when my regular bluetooth headset runs out of battery. Unfortunately this headset is terrible. My dad complained of a buzzing and synthetic sounds being generated. Back in the box you go.Does anyone know of a superb wired headset for mobile phones that works well in cars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this Plantronics headset","review":"I guess you could call me a Plantronics fan. I've used various of their headsets over the years and have always been satisfied - until now.I've been using their M210 headsets with our cordless phones for years.With a new Panasonic 2-line cordless phone system, which is a disappointment itself, I thought the in-line volume control might be helpful,It isn't. The mute control on my unit appears to be defective and doesn't operate. The control box adds just enough weight to make the cord swing unpredictably whewn you pick the unit up, increasing the odds of getting tangled or caught on something.Audio quality in the earpiece is, putting it bluntly, awful. Transmitted voice quality is also poor.Fit is comfortable and construction is adequate.Maybe I just got a defective unit in terms of the sound quality. But the in-line control box is enough of a pain to convince me to return this unit and stick with the Plantronics M210 units.Jerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality construction","review":"I have bought two of these headsets in less than a year and both broke in less than three months in the same spot.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok sound, but mic sometimes gets loud feedback to ear speaker","review":"I'm rating this just 2 because when I talk, it will sometimes put what I am speaking to the ear speaker (like a feedback) and it's really loud to where it astonishes me during conversation with my customers, and thus I loose track of what I was saying. I asked some of my customers though if my voice went really loud sometimes, and they said no, and that it was constant.

Yes, it does say it has a 2.5mm jack. But the advertisement also says that it works with most phones. I even bought an adapter, but the adapter works only for stereo phones. This Plantronics headset is mono. Sheesh. Think I'll return it. Make sure your phone has a 2.5mm mono jack before you buy this one.

The unit was comfortable to wear, but apparently there was a loose connection in the headset. I tried it on all four of my cordless telephones, and you had to hold the plug into the phone to hear anything. If you didn't hold it, the unit would cut in and out, and when it did work, there was a terrible echo in it. Might have just not been compatible with the phone I was using. I tried it with my cell phone also, and had same problem. Just sent it back a week ago, and was notified today that the refund would be credited to my account.

Sound quality is muffled, dead, sometimes so bad I have to remove 'em."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume is too low!","review":"It is a nice headset but my main issue is that the volume is just too low. I have tested it with 4 cordless handsets, three from Panasonic and one from Uniden. Even with the volume turned up all the way on all handsets, it is pretty diffcult to hear the other person. The only time it is OK is when the other person is a pretty loud talker.Hence IMHO this headset is not useable.Comfortwise it is OK, pretty light. The mic boom needs to be a little more adjustable, I have had the problem of it touching my face [as the other reviewers have reported here]Also there is no real need for the volume control and the mic mute switch. Both these features are already there on almost all cordless handsets I have used. That little box gets annoying pretty fast. The cord is pretty flimsy. I have a headset at work [from the same brand] its build quality is MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read good reviews, but the feedback was so bad I couldn't use it","review":"I have a plantronics I use for my landline and that works great, but the first time I tried using this set on my cell phone, the feedback was so bad I couldn't use it.

This is hands down the worst headset I have EVER purchased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy & Cheap","review":"I wear an XL sized motorcycle helmet and this headset has to stretch a little to fit on my head. It was not particularly comfortable for me to wear. At best, in a quiet room, the audio has been described as making me sound like I'm on a speakerphone. That defeats the purpose of a headset if you ask me. I recommend putting the money you'd waste on this headset towards something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microphone doesn't rotate all the way down","review":"The headset works fine, but the microphone only rotates about 270 degrees total. That means that it won't go down all the way to my mouth/chin, but rather sits about even with my nose, making my breathing come through loud and clear to my ears (not sure if the person on the other end of the phone hears it, but I do!).

If it hadbeen a $100+ purchase. I would have returned it out of principal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for the price","review":"This headset works great for the price. I bought it to use with my Uniden cordless phone (not a cell phone). I work from home occasionally and need to be hands-free on calls that can last hours. This headset is fairly comfortable, sound quality is good (definitely better than cell phone + bluetooth), and the Mute feature is a must-have. Some headsets have mute features that work with your phone's mute feature, but my Uniden phone doesn't have a mute feature. The Mute on this headset works regardless of whether your phone has a mute feature.I didn't give this 5 stars because:- headset slips off my ear occasionally and needs to be re-adjusted- volume seems a bit low, but that could be related to my phone. I find I need to turn volume on phone and headset all the way up to hear clearly.Overall, I recommend this for anyone who needs a cheap solution for hands-free with good sound quality. Note - you do not look cool when wearing this, not for use in public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics customer service is GREAT!","review":"I have been using this headset for almost a year. The first one I bought worked really well, then about 8 months of constant use, the wire broke, right underneath the volume control.I immediately called Plantronics customer service and they sent another one right out to me. This one has been working great. I use it with a Radio Shack 900 MHz cordless phone.I did try to use it once with a VTech and I could hardly hear the person that I was talking with. The person I was talking to said she could hardly hear me as well. So I think it has a lot to do with the type of phone you are using it with. I haven't had a chance to use it with a big variety of phones, but I know that it works great with the Radio Shack brand.If you found this review helpful, please click yes. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful product!!","review":"Use this daily for online conferences and many phone calls. Great quality hearing and speaking, even for those with harder hearing.

The headset gets the job done and is priced just right. So far all of the telephone calls received have been clear on the headset. I do not hear any static or any type of distortion. The only issue I have had is with the volume. Some of the calls received had lower caller volume than other calls. I am not certain that the issue was with the headset or with the caller. Still looking into the issue as minor as it is. Also, the headset feels comfortable and is lightweight. I would buy another product from Plantronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value Headset","review":"For a $15 headset, this one is a winner. Some reviewers didn't find it very comfortable but I wear it for hours ever day without any problems at all. The sound is clear, sufficiently loud, and crisp. While it's not audiophile quality sound, for a telephone it works just fine.This is my 3rd headset of this model. If the model has a weakness it's in the cord, where the cord meets the in-line volume and mute control. If you aren't careful, eventually you'll bend the cord at that juncture one too many times and it will simply break. It took about a year and a half of heavy usage (4-8 hours a day) for this to happen, which is not bad. My second headset was eaten by kittens; I don't think any headset is immune to the unbridled ferocity of a kitten attack :) .Highly recommended headset, I'll be back to pick up another one if misfortune or heavy use eventually wears this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with my phones","review":"I bought this at a local office supply store. I've had good luck with Plantronics products in the past, but not this one.I attached it to a Uniden PowerMax cordless phone. The only headset control that worked was the earpiece volume control. The microphone volume control was inoperable, as was the mute switch.I tested it on my LG cell phone to see if it might be a problem with the Uniden. When used with the cell, the mute switch worked fine, but the microphone volume control was again inop.I also don't like the design of the boom mike. It needs to be adjustable away from the face. As it is, it only rotates up and down, which puts it in a position to rub my face (making microphone noise as my face moves when I talk).I'll try to return it tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"I bought this to use with our office Panasonic cordless phones after the cheap headset that came with them died.

I could not find ANYTHING that states the jack size except a statement that it works on mobile phones and most cell phones. This device has a 3 ring 2.5mm jack as cell phones of 10 years ago but mobile phones and smart phones of today need a 3.5mm jack.

Anyway, while on the phone with a friend, we 'tested' the old one against the sound with the new one. She said it was MUCH better; more clear. And that's with the old one still sounding good. So, I would definitely recommend this product. Also, this headset was not as heavy as my other one.

I used the first one daily for about five years before it stopped working. I liked it enough that I bought the exact same model again.I use it with my cordless home phone (which has a belt clip) to allow me to go \\"hands free\\" around the house. The headset has an in-line volume control and mic gain switch. It also has a mute SWITCH (not a button!), which is unbelievably handy. Sound quality is surprisingly good for such an inexpensive unit and it is very lightweight and comfortable.My only criticism of the unit is that the mic boom curves inward slightly and is made of hard plastic, meaning it is NOT flexible, and naturally tends to want to set too close to the face. It does adjust up and down, but not in and out. This adjustment only can be accomplished by adjusting the angle at which you place the headset on your head. This likely will be an issue for people with larger heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"volume is very low.","review":"This product might work ok for some applications, but it is a complete waste of money if you are planning to make short recordings for You Tube or pod cast.

The levels max out and it sounds distorted all of the time. The volume is also too low, even at the highest setting. The mouth piece only swings up and down, but does not bend like the Panasonic. I shoved this in the closet and taped up my Panasonic to get it working again. If you're undecided, get the Panasonic KX-TCA60. It's even $4 cheaper!

It's not a controversial book, I just didn't care for it - I think the cartoon on the cover led me to believe it was appropriate for young children. My daughter never wants to read it and frankly, neither do I."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful introduction","review":"This is an excellent resource to explain to children of 8 to 10 on how babies are conceived and born. My son, especially, found this useful when he was too young for full-fledged biological details, but big enough to learn the basics.The drawings are not suggestive, or threatening. But kids learn about eggs and sperm, that they must join to form an embryo, how a baby grows in utero, and how it's born.We've had a few other children's books on this topic, and while this one includes one or two errors, it is factual--and gentle--enough to serve as a good introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Preschoolers (as listed)","review":"I started reading this book to my (then) 4-yr-old. I think we got through 4 pages. We haven't opened it since. It's just not put in a format that would keep a preschoolers attention.

To the reader it is abundantly clear he is making an enormous difference. A must read for anyone in or considering the teaching profession."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly clever comedy; a movie hasn't made me laugh this much and this loud in a long time.","review":"I saw this film on the festival circuit this year and found myself laughing more and louder than I can recall doing in a movie theatre recently; this film and Seth MacFarlane's \\"Ted\\" are far and away the two funniest films I've seen all year. The screenplay deliriously twists and turns in ways you never see coming, and that only enhance the comedy. The performances are spot-on across the board, and I was stunned to learn after the screening that this was the director's first feature, given that the filmmaking was so assured, and with a very specific tone and voice that felt like it had been cultivated over time. I look forward to seeing more from him. Give yourself a fun night and check out \\"Searching for Sonny\\". I just ordered the blu-ray and am looking forward to seeing it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was terrible.","review":"Dislike. It was horrible. I didn't like it at all.

It was different than I thought it would be, as it was quirky and not serious. Although you probably need an oddball sense of humor to like it--I enjoyed it and so did the family. Jason delivered in his acting, and showed he can do comedy as well as serious acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush and Lovely","review":"Finding this four-cut CD, deep in the dark of winter, was a delight - a wonderful surprise. The music is classic, lyrical Richard Marx and the UK presentation unique and evocative of all that's compelling about the work of this masterful singer/songwriter/poet. His lush & lovely acoustic interpretation of a song by G. Weiss & H. Peretti (I Can't Help Falling in Love with You) gave it rich, new life - and the 4th cut, Wild Life, was a collaboration with Rick Springfield - a credit to both talented musicians. This CD was released as Part 1 of a 2-part set; unfortunately, there seems to be no record of Part 2 - a pity. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arnold Extreme WLX-195 Pro Grade Trimmer Line","review":"This is the best string trimmer line I have found...the right combination of brittle, which cuts better but tends to break off at the reel--a real pain, and tough--cuts a bit less but wears out evenly from the ends and doesn't break off at the reel. I live in the mountains of Southern California, and have to do some major weedwhacking every spring. The weeds here are thick and tough! I have tried many kinds of trimmer line, and this is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"seven wasted hours of the soul","review":"I can't say enough about how poor this game is, especially after having finished a *real* game (grim fandango: buy it now). Typos, bugs and poor dubs are bad enough, but to have to endure the inane plot, the senseless \\"puzzles\\" and the utterly frustrating lack of continuity is too much (not to mention the poor attemps at ripping off myst/riven).It's strange, though. There is some out-of-place attention to detail in odd areas. My guess is there was an above average art director, an ok story teller, some run-of-the-mill programmers, a UI person that had no clue, and someone in charge that had a \\"QA-be-damned\\" attitude that only cared about getting the thing out and didn't care about playability. I can't imagine *anyone* getting by without a guide book. It is just too obscure, annoying, and just plain idiotic to play. There, you've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Game in Years","review":"It has been a long time since I was so obsessed with a game. This one has everything. You are Faust, the old keeper of an abandoned amusement park that looks like it was created by the Myst team - gorgeous. There are seven episodes in which you will collect clues and evidence. Will you save your soul in the end? Navigation is easy and the story will keep you engrossed for days. The music is the best of any game on the market. Everything about this game is great, from an easy load to the gameplay which is smooth in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give this game 0 stars","review":"I don't like being manipulated by computer games.I won't give any specifics away, but let's just say the goal stated in the instructions and in the game's introduction isn't the real goal. And you don't find out what the real goal is until the final scene. That's disappointing, because the stated premise of the game is intriguing, but it never comes to fruition.Also, the puzzles are tough - anyone who says they did all of the puzzles without a walkthrough is either a liar or a genius.The game looks and sounds OK, but the fact that there is norisk factor to your character leaves the story flat and boring. Plus, the character development was choppy and incomplete - you don't know what ends up happening to most of the characters.I definitely do not recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning","review":"My nephew loves the game, becuse it is different then the other spyro games.

We shared this book with her teacher and her best friend, they too had no idea that this was how she felt. My daughter is 8 years old and this book was maybe a bit on the young side for her.

I personally do not enjoy the smell (it smells like coconuts) but the results amazing. I have very thin fragile hair, which breaks very easily. I have the hardest time doing anything with it other than throwing it up into a ponytail. With the this conditioner and its partner shampoo, it restores strength back to my hair and I can actually style it. It becomes stronger and is less likely to break. I recommend this to anyone who has weak or damaged hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"This product is fake. The company distributing this item is not the actual company, Joico. I have had trouble finding this product recently, since even salons can't seem to get the real product. The REAL K-pak is thick, luxurious and smells like bananas. It's an incredible product which works better on my hair than anything else I've tried (my hair is very long, thick, and wavy). The product contained in these bottles is fairly runny with an odd chunky texture, a different scent, and does not produce the same results. I am disappointed because my mom ordered this same item and received the real product, while I ordered it several months later and received this cheap fake stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Softens and Shines","review":"This is one of the best conditioners for dry damaged winter hair. It softens and is better than the reconstructor because you can use it every day. It also smells amazing! It seems to melt into your hair and detangles mine. The only thing I would say is wrong with it is that I dont use it when I want to wear my hair curly because it takes out the natural curl of my wavy hair. otherwise this is great if you straighten your hair a lot or have really tangly hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the $$$$","review":"I love this product. I have very fine hair and not a lot of it! My hair is stringy and tangles easily. Other shampoos and conditioners weigh my hair down and make it look greasy.

This is it!Thank you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"This is the only conditioner that I have found that will not weigh my hair down. I have thin, fine hair that is very hard to hold a curl and very hard to work with at times. It is also damaged on the ends and needed something, but all the conditioners I had tried were too heavy and made my fine hair even flatter. I had a sample of this that had just been sitting on the bathtub and decided to give it a try. I was really amazed that it didn't feel heavy and make my hair flat. I love the smell and how easy it is to comb out my wet hair after using this. Hopefully, when I need more it will still be at the same great price of $5.99.

I've never had an issue with my hair tangling, but after a few weeks of using this stuff, I started to get this enormous rat's nest in my hair and my hair felt like straw and lost its shine. As soon as I went back to my old shampoo/conditioner, I did not have the problem again. Unfortunately they don't make my old shampoo anymore so I have to experiment again.

It was the first of my son's lego birthday presents that he assembled. He treasures this toy and takes great pains to make sure it doesn't get destroyed or broken or mixed up in the general lego bin. But even if it were to get mixed in, the bright yellow color should make it easier to find the needed pieces if my son ever wished to rebuild it.The starfighter is pretty durable too. It has been dropped several times and it is either undamaged or breaks in an easily fixable way - no shattered lego pieces strewn across the floor.It also comes with R2D2, a couple of people (I think one is Anakin), and a smaller fighter ship, so the set provides enough extras for lots of imaginative play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lego Product","review":"Got this for my son for X-Mas and he loves it, over a period of time he put it together and finally finished with it.

I am honestly surprised that somebody produced this album.There is little that distinguishes Desaparecidos from your local bar band.

Yes, sometimes I thought MTM should be called the Ted Baxter show, because unlike so many others who loved him, he got on my nerves mainly because there was way too much of him. The repeats in the writing for him were pretty boring, and often I fast forwarded it. But all in all, with the exception of too much of Ted and his goofy girl friend, I liked the show a lot, especially Lou Grant, Mary, Rhoda and Phyllis.

His uncle is the priest of the title, a complicated man, viscious, mean sprited, oppressed by his chastity - not your average priest. Basically the gist of the story is that the young boy is taught by his Oncle l'Abbe Jules....and that's it really - you have to read it yourself - which is a joyous task. The language Mirbeau uses is the purest poetry in parts, even if he does get carried away at times. This isn't a very good review.Read Abbe Jules, I urge you i urge you i urge you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"The title leads you to believe you are buying a collection as does the hefty price but you are only buying one piece of music and although it is the title song of an album and well written, it is hardly worth $17.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible tour guides","review":"This was like an old home video of a man and his wife touring Kenya with no knowledge of the country or its rich culture.

Worse, it's neither a very convincing or interesting set of revelations. A bad idea, with mediocre execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible, incomprehensible novel","review":"As I picked this book up off the shelf without prior knowledge to whatever fiction universe it belongs to, I must base my review solely on this book. In other words, other books in the \\"Known Space\\" series may very well be better, but I couldn't stand \\"A Darker Geometry\\".The first three or four chapters are intriguing, and kept me reading. I must say I enjoyed the way life in space and the kzinti perspective were handled -- you really got into the minds of the characters for a while. However, incomprehensible nonsense such as the conversations between the \\"Outsiders\\" added absolutely nothing to the book, and probably took a lot away. Physics and philosophy bogged the story down rather than giving it flight. I barely made it through the book. The ending was also poor.All in all, I think the only people I could recommend this book to are fans of the Known Space novels, or people with lots of free time to try and figure out the philosophical aspects of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very Very poor viewing quality.

Very elegant look, great fit - not too small or too large for my wrist. The only minor problem with this watch was that the clasp to open the watch band was a bit difficult to open. I had to center my finger nail right into the open/close clasp and pull back with my nail (very hard) to get it open. I think by its being difficult to open/close makes the band secure and totally prevents the band from opening and falling off a person's wrist. The color of this watch is a more 'yellowee' color in appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I had this watch for a little more than 3 months and the band broke in a very awkward place. The Seiko name used to mean quality watches but no reputable watch company would sell a watch with a band that breaks in less than 6 months. I have always loved Seiko watches and was very satisfied with their quality. Last year, the band on a Seiko watch that I had for years broke, I chalked that up to old age.

The Seiko I had prior to this one lasted 25 years until the band broke and you can't get a replacement because Seiko no longer makes them. After about 2 years, of owning the new watch I noticed pitting on the watch case! One year later the pitting on the case is SO BAD, it looks like a piece ofcheap junk. The pitting is not on the stainless steel case,(back part of the watch you remove to change the battery) but on the REST of the metal case, i.e. - the sides, around the watch face, and extends into that part of the case that connects to the metal strap, including the first and second links of the metal strap.This is supposedly water-resistant?

When I first bought it I had to return it because of random clicking noises on playback. The tempo control is fine although the buttons are miniscule. It is unnecesarily light and small resulting in a pathetic, mono, on-board speaker requiring remote speakers via the headphone socket which is prone to buzzing. The power supply is DC - Why??? with a flimsy connection and the power on button has a slide action and often requires 2 or 3 heart stopping attempts before it switches on. The digital display is hard to read. The skip forward works fine but skip back is rather random. I know Superscope have done better than this in the past and have missed a real opportunity to create a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre At Best","review":"Paavo Jarvi's reading of Stravinsky's \\"Rite of Spring\\" is too soft-edged and not vicious enough. This performance makes me think of Michael Tilson Thomas, because it's just way too easy-going and doesn't have enough bite. That said there are obviously better recordings than this one: Seiji Ozawa/BSO on RCA, Bernstein/NYPO on Sony, Levi/ASO on Telarc, and Stravinsky's own reading on Sony.The reading of Nielsen's 5th is also pretty weak. Jarvi fails to capture the Nordic essence of the symphony. Herbert Blomstedt's reading on Decca is, in my opinion, the benchmark. Jarvi fails to bring the kind of excitement this symphony needs to make it convincing.All of this said, the audio quality is excellent and the playing from the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra is excellent, but these two factors cannot save this recording from the dismal conducting of Jarvi. Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immortals Review","review":"The book is quite interesting!

It's fun to look at an just to have as a random hip-hop 90s source of inspiration if you want that. I sorta wish it had more pictures, but overall cool coffee table book.Like another reviewer stated- the bios for the artist were sub par. And the quotes and text entries for certain pages seem to be for looks only, not for actually reading. Which is cool and not cool at the same time... because since its a book I want to be able to read any relevant content.. now if it was a cd cover or something then I'd understand.I gave it four stars because it does serve its overall purpose as a photobook, but I wish there was more quality content to read about each person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I downloaded this eBook with the hopes of getting my money's worth.

This entire file could have been compressed down into about 10 or 15 pages, rather than 52.The information provided inside this book was lackluster to say the least. I am a very proficient computer user, with Windows XP Professional running on my pc. The \\"tips\\" provided are so basic that they are almost laughable. I just wish I could have previewed the eBook to know what I was wasting my money on.The only redeeming quality is that even though I did waste my money, it was only $[amount] down the drain.

Although the book dates from the 1960's, when Franco was in power, the most important insights of the book are still helpful. I haven't seen a better description.Feibleman is the kind of fellow that you'd wish to have over for dinner just to listen to his experiences. An actor and writer, he seems to have been a vivacious traveler: he mixed with people, watching them cook and trying everything.The book is a journey through Spain and Portugal, describing each region's people, landscape, agriculture, cooking, food and wine. Good pictures and recipes. Although the recipes themselves have been slightly adapted for the 1960's American kitchen's electric ovens and appliances, his narrative always details the authentic preparations and methods.If you own this book, you will probably read every page (and stain many of them with olive oil)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phone for the price!","review":"Very quality phone with many features.

I just received the shipment and the quality is excellent. A friend said that he saw a knock-off for less money but the quality wasn't as good. For me, it's worth the $40 extra for a high-quality rack that will probably last longer than my body :-p And as a bonus, it matches my maple cabinets. I just wish I would have bought one years ago. My only criticism is that the bottles are exposed to light. From what I've read, light and heat reduce the shelf life of herbs. This is why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars. Two solutions would be to use darker glass bottles or to mount stained glass panels in the open sections to cut down on light transmission. If the latter solution was employed, the manufacturer could offer different colored stained glass options. I'll probably add some stained glass panels myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Purchase","review":"Let me start by saying I don't hate the item but having to try and get a replacement cap for one that arrived broken was a nightmare.

I asked Amazon if they would assist in contacting the manufacturer for a replacement part. They said they could not but said the manufacturers are expected to deal with such issues if they sell thru Amazon by agreement. When I contacted the manufacturer J.K. Adams directly they asked me to pay for the broken cap on a newly purchased very expensive 48 jar spice carousel.

What I find most annoying about this novel is that, having been the same age as the protagonist in 1983 when the book was written, I can safely say that no teenagers spoke in the language that her protogonist and his friends speak in. It's as though they were transported from a 1941 and are forced to use words like \\"mightn't,\\" \\"stocking feet,\\" \\"Why are you so down-in-the-dumps\\" that only a woman of Highsmith's age would use. This is especially troubling because I love the plot and the religious conflict she creates (so far), but the teenagers' personalities seem false and contrived for 1983. Even the party scenes seem less MTV/Friday Night Videos and more like leftovers from the 40s MGM musical \\"Good News.\\" The teens even hang out in what seems to be the equivalent of a malt shoppe.

And not for the usual reason. (I'll leave it there so that, even though another reviewer has told you who the killer is, the novel hasn't been completely blown for you.)\\"People Who Knock on the Door\\" is still a very readable novel, since the differences don't really detract from the reading - it has the same storytelling style of other Highsmith novels, and is not a labor to read for it.If you're looking for a \\"Deep Water\\"/\\"This Sweet Sickness\\"-esque suburban psychopath tale, you may find it slow and ultimately disappointing.But if you aren't, read on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"shipping rip off","review":"Yes the lowest price, also the highest shipping.

I have always enjoyed their version of Gregg Allman's Dreams (even though it isn't as good as some of the Allman Brothers versions). The Creeper has always been a favorite.The last 5 songs are from later in the group's life and are just tired and stale.

No more. 5.0 for Windows can't print the daily notes (tries to print hundreds of pages if the notes exceed 1/2 page). No margin control. No font size control in printing of notes in other tabs, everything prints in six-point type with no margin control. I paid for the software and a new planner, and after 3 months threw the whole thing in the garbage. On top of that, it isn't stable in XP or Vista.

There was also a special place in my heart for Nona and what she went through with her husband. She was really a strong woman to have put up with him for sooo long.

Second, the cover is of a piece of fancy typing paper, nothing more.

The various jokes and humor of the book combined with the action and the sizzling partners in fighting crime made the book very well rounded. The way these two meet and the way the book ended makes it one of my favorites to date. So buy it and find out for yourself what you think.

But the video is just awful, amateurish and overall disappointing. It turned out to be a really boring film, mostly with still pictures, about really uninteresting, superficial, shallow personal detais (for example, their eating a meal at McDonalds, or how they met their Moldovan host family in Alaska, etc) that could be of interest only for their own friends and family. The first 15 minutes of the film do not even mention Moldova; it is simply a pastiche of this couple and their life in Alaska, Hawaii, and New York. Very little film, few pictures, or information about Moldova itself. I would really like to get a refund. This DVD is a complete waste of time and money. This is the worst documentary we have ever seen.

I read lots of science books, and it's often hard to find something that I find both new and interesting enough to mention to a non-science junkie. Not here. Thumbs, Toes and Tears has all sorts of fascinating little tidbits mixed in among a very well written narrative. It pulls together all sorts of seemingly unrelated materials in order to tell an important story. It reminded me a bit of the old PBS series called \\"Connections' with James Burke, although without some of the strained connections that sometimes appeared on that show. Finally, the size of the book was good. It was long enough to tell the story in detail, but short and light enough that you could lie in bed and read it without injuring yourself if you dropped it by accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I don't quite understand all the positive reviews of this album. Their first self titled CD was great- a nice mix of C-Clamp and Braid. This however, wants so badly to sound like Shiner it ruins the whole thing. The songs aren't as well written as the first album and the singer has clearly spent weeks in the studio tracking his vocals again and again in order to sound like Allen Epley. Trouble is, he's not as good a singer and whilst he manages to pull it off on some tracks, others like 'The Halo Befriends Me' are practically unlistenable. The guitars lumpen and vocals never quite hitting the right note. That said, there are some good tracks but the whole thing is so patchy it doesn't stand up to repeated listens. A shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and roomy shelter","review":"Put this up before winter set in and use it to store my boat and other items in it. It was relatively easy to erect and had my two younger sons help me out. However, the directions were not very clear, so I had to use some common sense to figure it out. After some initial confusion, we finally got it and it erected quite quickly. Make sure the \\"L\\"-shaped feet (4 of them)point toward the inside of the shelter and not to the outside. I gambled on that one, and got it right, whew! Start with three sections, and then add one section at a time until the end. Make sure that the width at the base is exactly the stated width of your unit or the cover will not fit properly. Other than the poor set-up instructions, this unit is great! It is good quality material and structure. I think the additional roof support with the cross-pipes is much better than other shelters. Just be sure to pull the cover snugly and evenly on both sides.

This is inexcusable and lazy, and one of my chief problems with compilations: the producers often are lazy and place edited versions of the artist's most important singles on the compilation, and use the saved time to add filler material. This practice is particularly egregious here because (a) there is no notice to the consumer on the packaging, and (b) in this case, the full version of \\"Disco Nights\\" was on the album (instead of being a specially commissioned 12\\" single remix).

It doesn't deserve the hushed and reverent treatment it receives here.For those who don't fully appreciate the revolution in lyrics wrought by \\"Earth Angel\\" and \\"Book of Love,\\" dig (or, better yet, bury) the following sample, from the fourth track: \\"The leaves began to fade, like promises we made.

I was highly disappointed. I beat the game in about 6 hours of actual playing time. There were no special levels, no puzzles, no anything except unchallenging combat.The developers spent more time on cut scenes than anything else. While the dialog was entertaining, I don't buy games to watch mini movies. I buy games to PLAY. I think I spent more time watching cut scenes than playing the game, actually.This game is likely a lovely starter game for children, since you never truly die and get as many do-overs as you can stand. If you're over 5 or 6, it's a waste of your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"by far the best I've tried","review":"I bought many (MANY!) brands for my grandmother and these are the best. 4 stars only because they are not completely leak-proof (not sure this is even possible though?).

Had I read this book first I'm certain I would have made good on those intentions. \\"Unchained\\" was certainly a perfect title. Mac Gober gets his message across that No-One is beyond God's reach, and that God is not mad at a sinner. I am very thankful that this book fell into my hands. I plan to buy more copies of this book, one for myself and at least one to pass around to friends. When you find something worth reading such as this book you just want to share with others.

It was very touching to hear how an individual is prepared to risk life and health simply to stand on the top of the world. The music I enjoyed but then being composed by a person who loved mountains it made good sense. It isn't really a film score as such - more snippets from here and there from the massive amount of works from a prodigious composer. Hovhaness is a composer who managed to blend East and West in a creative way and his score perfectly compliments Westerners in the East attempting a very demanding and testing struggle to the top. I enjoyed the balance between musical accompaniment and silence (well the sounds of the mountain and the men).

The instructions show an example of the remote with the temperature but this only displays the time and never the running temp. If you want the temperature, you'll need to go check the base unit -- pretty much defeating the purpose of having a remote.

I have to say we were severly disappointed. They took out all the best parts to spyro. First off it is not really a platformer type game anymore and the puzzles are almost non existant and what few there are you are given instructions on how to make it work. Then there are the waves and waves of endless enemies. almost non stop. Gone as well are the distinctive races for each world. Spyro is no longer a fun family game. What you Now have is a liner fighting game. They even added in wu fighting moves and slowmo when doing certain combos. All in all the charm of the orginal is missing. I highly doubt our family will be buying anymore spyro titles. if you want a good kids game go for spyro enter the dragonfly or A heros tale both were fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed spyro fan","review":"I have played all the other spyro games and enjoyed them greatly. this one is terrible!!

Booth captures the essence of the 17-year-old youth in love in this fictional account of a group of 17-year-old boys mooning over the neighborhood girl. He's got the emotions, the irascibility and the hormones all in one story. This book is a stitch as well -- humor similar to The Little Rascals is also included that had me chuckling from time to time. In addition, it gives the reader a view of what dating was back in that era. Attitudes, liberties and customs have certainly changed... Easy to read, light-hearted, and fun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect story -- for at least two reasons","review":"I have had the pleasure of being many of the male characters in \\"Seventeen.\\" My 17th year seems ages ago but while reading this book, I WAS 17. I am currently the father of teenagers--one of them is 17--and enjoyed the story from that point of view as well. Tarkington caught the essence of what \\"Dion and the Belmonts\\" would sing about 55 years later. (\\"Why Must I be a Teen-ager in Love?\\")In my opinion that would be enough to make this a classic. But, as the book has stood still and Time has not, it has also now become a sort of time machine to the way we were in the early 1900's. Whether we have lost or gained something in almost 100 years is up to the reader to decide. But, whether the reader would want to stay 1n 1905 or not, I can almost guarantee a wonderful visit to that time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for the time period, interesting read.","review":"This was a funny parody of the tumult in a teenager's life. As an adult, it gives you a quick reminder at how silly and ridiculously serious teenagers are when it comes to situations they consider to be \\"life or death.\\" There are some gender and racial biases from the early 20th century present in the book, but they don't detract from the story or the wit the author offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"just one flaw","review":"In this novel, Tarkington probes the minds of almost all the characters except the object of hero's affections. What would cause a girl to manipulate boys to compete for her attention and to show no concern whatsoever over the effect which this is creating? And what would cause a novelist to write about such a girl and give no hint of explanation for her behavior?Is there anything in Tarkington's biography which would suggest that he hated women, or that he had reason for hating women?If you happen to know, please write back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality of most Tracie Peterson books","review":"Maybe her other books had me spoiled, but this one never did hold my interest...ever.Rainy Gordon and her twin brother are tour guides in the Southwest.

She meets a man with similar loves and just when she thinks she has found the man God has picked out for her, she learns he has been paid to spy on her.

If you're someone who already knows the material, you don't need to re-read it..but if you're someone studying, trying to learn technical information that must be exact, what is the sense when you can't be confident the material you're studying is even correct. It's true, the Exam Crams used to be great, awesome, my only study guides and I always did well, but unfortunately I can't say that know. Not only are they filled with errors, but the books now totally miss the mark when it comes to teaching you what you need to know to pass exams. These books seem to say tell you \\"you'll need to know this\\" and \\"you'll want to study this,\\" rather than actually include useful information. Well Cisco tells everybody what you will be tested on, you don't need an Exam Cram to tell you that. Buy the books from Cisco, assuming they're recent or Todd L's stuff instead, you'll pass with confidence.

Otherwise the book is an absolute piece of s___, There were so many errors that I got the point where I doubted half the answers to the prep questions. The diagrams and command line examples were wrong and in some places mislabeled. I was originally highlighting and correcting the mistakes in the hope of sending them to the publisher, but there are so many its not even worth it. Oh and I could not find any sort of corrections or errata page at examcram.com or quepublishing.com.Overall, there were so many mistakes I ended up buying Odom's and Lammle's book so that I could doublecheck all the information I was reading. Whats the point of buying a technical book if you only have to buy another book to confirm the information? It's sad because the examcram series used to be so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have to echo the previous reviewers. I made it about half way through this study guide and had noticed some occasional typos, but didn't think much of it. There were some end of chapter questions along the way that didn't make sense to me, but I assumed that I was just not thinking them through properly. When I got to the questions at the end of Chapter 8, it became evident that there were some big problems. As one of the other reviewers said, now I don't know what info is good and what is not.

Possibly because they are more focused on the business side of the industry. Not so with this book. A labor of love by a fan who actually speaks and reads the language in which Japanese video games are created, he takes us on a journey from the beginnings of Nintendo in the late 1800's to the modern era without missing a beat along the way. The author also examines aspects of the industry that have gone unexamined in other texts, such as game music and Akihabara. It also includes a number of interviews with leading members of of various aspects of the Japanese gaming world. All in all, it's a wonderful example of what these inds of books can be, and I truly hope to see moreon this subject, both from this author and others, in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading, but touches only the mainstream games","review":"This is a good book about japanese videogames and their impact in the western world. The problem, and I agree with the other reviewers, is that the focus deals only with the mainstream and most popular games like Mario, Zelda, Final Fantasy. Sure it talks about Dragon Quest(relatively unknown in America until recently) and ICO, but still left many open holes.But if you forget this flaw, it's really a great and satisfying reading, and the author constructs the text very well. Worth your time. It's a four star book, but I'll give four and half stars (five in Amazon) because it's a good and very little explored theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Serious Look At Games.","review":"This is the most intelligent book on any aspect of the video game industry, that I have yet had the pleasure of reading. This is written by someone who knows, who cares, and who enjoys what he does. The aspect of gaming covered in this particular book is, the role of Japan in the history of gaming. It starts at the early days like, stuff you would never even guess at, and progresses through the years, to this generation. This book is from 2004 so, it doesn't cover how the tsunami impacted the Japanese people but, it has everything else you could want to know and that's a promise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whata Hell Is This?","review":"Ok first of all the graphics suck, 2nd of all why is it called hostage rescue if you cant even rescue a hostage?Oh and I forgot to mention how realistic this game is, you can carry a sniper and a machine gun together. Now isnt that realistic. The terrorists are realy dumb, not only they just stand there but you always know where they are because you hear them talking to themselfs. Now the hostages are even more dumb, sometimes the dont even move, sometimes they get stuck in mid air, and most of the times they dont even follow you. Sometimes a hostage decides to go hes own way so he climbs up to the roof, and then doesnt even come down! And belive it or not you got a timelimit, yes a 5 min timelimit to comvince the dumb hostages to follow you. To get to my point this game is terrible and avoid it at all cost, you wont even pass the first level.

Apparently silk is not as smooth as I was lead to believe. Don't misunderstand me, however. When I was able to get into a game I enjoyed it very much. Usually I was booted within five minutes by the hosts of the game for high latency. Normal ping was around 300-400 on the smaller servers. Trying to play on the larger servers with 100-150 players is impossible on dial-up.If you have broadband, which most people do, you won't experience these problems.

Deaths without knowing where it came from, or whom it game from are the norm.If you are the rambo bunny hopping death match kiddie type do me and everyone else a favor and stay away.Players that move in groups and work together rule this game, loner rambos die quickly and often.The best analogy I can come up with is Joint Operations is a more \\"action\\" orientied Operation Flashpoint. With modern updated graphics.Joint Operations does not have the extensive list of weapons and vehicles that Operation Flashpoint has and is class based so you choices of firepower are limited by what class you choose. All classes are useful, even the medic. But Joint Operations definately feels a little more \\"action\\" oriented, in the game play.The expansion pack \\"Escalation\\" will add more vehicles, maps and weapons, so it will more like Operation Flashpoint in november."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game!!!","review":"This game is very addicting once you get started.

This game has it all!! BUT, you'll find yourself respawning countless times in fustrating, after fustrating attempts to get on the battlefield with those weapons and rides. Soon after getting the hang of things you'll find lag and more experienced players kniving and shooting you back to respawn time and time again. I've played far cry and countless other war games and this one is for the very very very patient. Team play, yes, this game has that too However, no one actually uses the controls to \\"team play\\" and you end up one for all and all for one throwing as much firepower, grenades, and missles as you can just to stay alive for 2 seconds.If you don't mind respawning 100 times a match, enjoy semi-teamplay (I use the term very loosely), and firing up to date weapons, then this game is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real review","review":"I swear, Novalogic has hired a slew of undercover marketers to spam sites with \\"this game is great\\" nonsense. I have played for about twenty hours, and no matter how much better I get at this game, I still find it incredibly boring and limited.A handful of vehicles and a major lack of terrain diversity don't help the slow gameplay which consists of running here and there, then hoping lying in the tall grass will hide you from your enemues. It rarely does, but you won't be able to see anything past the tall grass you're lying in, so the enemy can see and kill you with no problem. Then you have to wait around to be healed or you can respawn, then trek all the way back to the front. Almost the entire time is spent waitng, hiding, traveling in this game. There are many other problems in this game, too many to mention here."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are still waiting for the game to be sent to the house.","review":"This is taking so long just to get to our house it's not funny I will never buy anything from this company again.

But it's a piece of junk, IMHO. I know it's not from the high end of Kohler lines, but we bought it because we liked how it looked. I would have gladly paid more to avoid this hassle.Price notwithstanding, I expected much better quality from a Kohler faucet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kohler K-15160 fails after a few years.","review":"Our Kohler K-15160 is about three years old. The faucet was fine for that time but a few weeks ago we began to have a problem. The water flow began to slow down to a trickle after a few moments of running the water. So I found the proper replacement cartridge and purchased a new one. After installing the new cartridge the problem actually became worse. I could not find any information on Kohler's website and the web is getting to be useless for consumer help as every website wants you to \\"Join\\" and give up your personal information to see the results of what others have posted. Most times the result is not the answer even close to what you're looking for.I hope by posting this on Amazon, that someone with a similar problem would read this an post an answer.Perhaps the replacement cartridge was defective, but I am reluctant to keep buying replacement parts if the product has a systemic common problem!Thanks,Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality but flow not as specified","review":"This was easy to install and adjust. The spray and stream button works fine. But the flow is in now way the 2.5 gallon/min as it states. This faucet replaced a Grohe that had plenty of flow so I know it is not due to our water pressure. I have no kinks or any restrictions in my lines so it is certainly due to the faucet. I would not have purchased had I known the flow was a problem. Who wants to wait around while it fills pots or watering cans?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Replaced a more expensive mohen faucet that rusted b/c water leaked in where the sprayer connects to fixture. Very easy install. I have noticed a decrease in water pressure in stream mode vs spray mode. Consequently would not recommend to anyone with current low pressure. Not so artsy as other brands but I am pleased with this faucet after a couple of months use- would purchase again."},{"rating":"2","title":"good faucet","review":"I installed the faucet about three weeks ago.

The hot and cold lines are designed in a way that they are easy to kink when installing. Gently(!) put an extra plier on the metal end of the hot/cold hose when turning the nut. BTW, for those that are commenting on the flow rate, I got a 2.2 pgm one. I'd say adequate, but not impressive. It's hard to find something in white anymore, let alone decent craftsmanship and not pay $300+.Pros: 120 degree swing, ergonomic \\"lever\\" handle (15160-L is the longer \\"loop\\" handle)Cons: fragile supply lines (non-servicable), watch out for low flow version (1.5 gpm max at 60psi)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost great -- but flow is slow","review":"I just finished installing the Coralais. It's a nice unit, more solid-feeling than most inexpensive units. Installing was pretty straightforward, operation is smooth, and it looks nice. The one issue is that it's got FAR less flow than we had with our previous faucet. There is a quick disconnect in-line on on the pull-out hose, which has a very small orifice on the female side. I think that's where the restriction is. No obvious way to remove it. I'm hoping my wife will get used to it -- her first reaction was less than positive. I'll give it a couple of weeks, at which point I might return it and shop for something else... Upside is it will save some water!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality but diminished flow a problem","review":"Just received my new Black Kohler Coralais. It matched the Black Kohler sink perfectly. It is a nice look faucet but like others who have reviewed this item there is a noticeable reduction in the flow rate.

Overall though, everything considered I like the faucet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kohler Rocks","review":"After installing this faucet myself I was having difficulty getting the same flow I got from my old faucet. I inspected my installation and performed my own troubleshooting for many hours to no avail. I reluctantly called the support line not expecting much help and fully expected to go through the whole repackage, warranty return, wait, pay shipping and wait dance.The representative walked me through about 5 minutes of troubleshooting. We were unable to resolve the problem. She asked for the model number, my name and shipping address. In three days replacement parts arrived. I installed one of the parts and the faucet worked wonderfully. Minimal wait on the shipping, excellent support, no hassle and extra spare parts. Well done Kohler.

I installed it three years ago in our new home and last week the handle just fell off of the hose. Upon further inspection, I found black mold/mildew stains on roughly 2/3 of the crack surface, meaning it was cracking & weakening for some time and water was coming in contact with that mildew.

Who knew the hardest part was removing the old faucet. You just need a long handled phillips screwdriver and a small channel lock wrench (OK plumbers putty and teflon tape too). This was a breeze to install (1 hr). The finish and fit are great. I rate it 4 stars because the handle although not flimsy is lightweight. Also, the hot and cold water lines are a tad short.

We replaced a similar design non-Kohler faucet that provided adequate pressure. With this Kohler faucet, we get little more than a trickle on hot OR cold, despite all valves being fully open under the sink. The faucet was installed by a plumber who replaced the values and fully tested the system. He showed me the swivel point in the design of the hose on the faucet that greatly restricts water pressure.Our faucet also arrived with a small blemish on the tip of the handle where the cream finish is missing. We couldn't wait for another unit though as our old faucet was broken.

A great combination of practical comfort and froth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another, less satisfactory compilation","review":"Not that far removed from their last best-of, their American label decided to release another package. The problem with this one is that, rather than picking hits, seems to have grabbed a bunch of album tracks at random, and sprinkled a few hits among them. True, this has Fahrenheit 303 - previously only available on the UK version of the first album - but if you were looking for this track, why not just get the UK version of the first album to start with? It has several other hard-to-get tracks. Frenetic and Halcyon appear on the other greatest hits album, so that's not really a selling point for this one either. Yes, all the songs here are good (it's Orbital after all), but this is a blatant cash-in, and not even a good one. Don't blame Orbital for this one; it wasn't their fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible selection","review":"I thought that their Work collection was bad...but honestly it's much better than this. This one features the same sloppy edits as the former release, but at least that one had a good track selection. This release misses A LOT.

I don't believe a band/artist's \\"hits\\" define their worth in the business. The Orbital duo deserve much, much higher accolades than a \\"budget-friendly\\" compilation of their well-known tracks.Orbital is an entity whose magic lies in the whole rather than the sum of its parts. Albums like \\"Snivilisation\\" and \\"InSides\\" are perfect examples of how an idea can be spread across a handful of tracks to make one hell of an album. How you feel after listening to \\"Snivilisation\\" versus \\"InSides\\" or the \\"Brown Album\\" can be starkly different. Different albums, different feel, etc.To mix and match tracks from their entire catalog and throw them together would be a sin. I didn't care for \\"Works\\" and I certainly don't care for this \\"Platinum Collection\\" either. Albums will always trump \\"best of\\" compliations. ESPECIALLY when the band or artist in question has made some of the most beautiful albums in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me why...","review":"Tell me why we should buy that collection?I think the first collection: \\"Orbital Work\\" is quite good because has a lot of songs, some difficult-to-find versions, a good selection and an unreleased track.A collection like \\"Work\\" is also bought by people who have all Orbital's ablums (like me) and it's a good start for orbital newcomers... but this one is absolutly useless.My suggestion is to start buying \\"The Middle of Nowhere\\" (imo the best Orbital album), or \\"The Altogether\\".

Neither of us thought it was very good. She said she couldn't relate to most of the situations. Some relationships were ridiculously overdone. The movie takes place over one night that seemed endlessly long. There are a few funny places. But, most of the humor was beaten into the viewer too much. Considering I'm in my 50s I thought I was just too old to relate. But my 26 yr old daughter liked it less than I did.

This is clearly a case where the funniest parts of the movie are all put in the trailer. The characters were all really boring and stereotypical and I kept waiting for something to happen and this movie just never turned the corner.

The film goes from boring bad to uncomfortably stupid. The conversations were real life boring. What we learn is that chicks like guys who can sing or break dance. They dislike obnoxious drunks and ex-girlfriends.We have a cross section of mostly white, fit, largely pretentious crowd get together. The former class bully who kept apologizing to everyone made the movie extremely stupid. I paused the film in the middle to wash my hair...and I am bald. Not worth paying a rental price.

Using the lessons in this book, I tried to help him find his way back to the house (while I was 1500 miles away). Almost a month to the day from when he started his beach adventure, my mom found him walking toward her house from the bushes across the street. Ever since then, whenever I visit, the cat that was nothing but aloof and skittish around me, cuddles with me whenever he can.I've had other experiences with him and other animals in my life to validate my belief in the steps in this book, but none as powerful as that.Oh, and I'm not one most people would consider a hippy, new-age, nut.

I recommend this CD for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best (and most overlooked) Films of 2005","review":"Slightly different in tone and details from the Series Firefly, on which it was based. This in no way deters from the film, and makes it accessible to both new viewers and fans of the Series, a ground breaking, genre-busting program that was cut down before it could begin (Curse you, FOX!). This film, Serenity, has it all: Action, Adventure, Mystery, Drama, Comedy... Science Fiction meets The Western meets Fim Noir. A MUST see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Greg Edmonson!","review":"I'm glad I'm not the only reviewer here who realizes that the score to Serenity was an absolute spit in the face to Firefly fans. Greg Edmonson's score to Firefly was as much a part of the overall aesthetic as anything else, and was, in my opinion, importantant enough to be considered the 11th character of the show (after Serenity herself and the cast). It gave the show a feeling all its own, one that was terribly missed from the feature film. I can only hope that if any more Firefly-related projects come to light, the Joss & the studio come to their senses and bring back the genius that is Greg Edmonson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lover of film scores way disappointed","review":"I was terribly dissappointed with the CD. I enjoyed the score during the movie, but all that action noise should be left off the CD! I would have bought it no matter what. What I do is program tracks 3,4 and 19-23 and repeat for a decent taste of the score without completely blowing my ears out. That's about 12 minutes of fairly nice listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not Edmondson?","review":"Meh. That's the best that can be said of this soundtrack. Which is disappointing, because music enhanced the action on FIREFLY so much! Greg Edmondson's innovative scoring in the show was so fresh and unique, and punched up the drama in wondrous ways. In fact, I can't think of a single other drama in recent years that used music as effectively as FIREFLY. Why was Edmondson not brought on board to score the movie? There's nothing particularly wrong with Newman's score... but that's the best I can say about it. It's just kind of there. Meh. There were a lot of bold choices made in bringing FIREFLY to the big screen... it's a shame somebody wimped out on the music. If you want the real music of the SERENITY universe, wait until next month and buy the FIREFLY soundtrack (which, btw, should have been released long before now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiny!","review":"If you are a fan of the show you will appreciate the diversity of the instruments used. The music propels you to the exact moment in the film. It's good to relive the experience. The only thing that would make it better is if it had included the Hero of Canton!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am pleased.","review":"I am trying to ween myself away from obsessively watching Serenity so I figured I would do that by listening to this instead. I noticed people complained about the short tracks. But that is how it was in the movie. It is good for someone has a short attention span for soundtracks. No drawn-out pointless filler. The only complaint I have is that the remake of the Firefly theme that appeared in the closing credits is absent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relatively Poor","review":"Compared to the Firefly series soundtrack, released (online download only) by Fox, the Serenity soundtrack is poor.The Serenity soundtrack is fine in the movie as it reflects the tension and highlights the action. But as a soundtrack to listen to it's terrible. It sounds like it's from a grade B horror movie. This isn't music, it's orchestral noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recording","review":"The soundtrack is a really nice piece of work, especially for fans of Firefly and Serenity. Though most of the tracks featured come from the second, more action-packed half of the movie, the signature orchestral work and themes are really well captured. Unlike a lot of other movie soundtracks, it's not that hard to picture exactly what point in the story each selection was featured in and remember the specific emotional tones it was trying to convey. Overall a great album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Soundtrack","review":"David Newman's score to Joss Whedon's Serenity does not capture the mood or feel of the movie as Greg Edmondson's did for the television series Firefly. The show has a heavy western theme and the TV score reflected that mood, while the movie score briefly touches on it with a guitar here and a banjo there. Mr. Newman clearly did not inherit his scoring ability from his cousin, the great Randy Newman who is one of the best in the business. The music isn't terrible, it just doesn't capture the mood and spirit of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good without being outstanding","review":"I'm a huge fan of the Firefly series and Serenity, the subsequent film. The concept was the most original science fiction idea in many years and it was a great tragedy that the TV show only ran for one season. So with that said, how does the Serenity sound track shape up?In my opinion, this is a good soundtrack without being an outstanding one but the music is not the same as in the TV series. It still stands up pretty well in its own right however. There are some catchy, folksy themes that fit in well with the futuristic western plot combined with a few haunting melodies that go well too. My main criticism is that some of the music based around the action that happens late in the film is a bit loud and jarring to the ear. I would have preferred more of the folksy tunes and less of the loud jarring stuff.I think it's a four star effort though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie music cues: not good as an album","review":"The musical themes in this soundtrack are really good, but are not given time to develop. There are a couple times in the movie when the music is really beautiful (especially the \\"Funeral / Rebuilding Serenity\\" track). The problem with this soundtrack is that those one or two minute cues from the movie are all you get. I would like to hear a several minute long version of \\"Rebuilding Serenity\\" that has time to breathe. The bulk of the soundtrack is atmospheric or action sequence cues which aren't really enjoyable on their own. (Great movie though!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but a toy","review":"I purchased this helmet for my brother-in-law, who is a HUGE Panthers fan, to display in his office.

It had been repaired with clear tape apparently prior to shipment. Fortunately, the carton did its job and the amplifier was not damaged. I bought the amp to work in conjunction with a wireless microphone on a Native American flute. This, to provide the 'Canyon echo' effect heard on many flute CD's. Using various combinations of the controls provide not only the desired echo sound but some pleasing and unexpected additional effects. I have only used the amp on 110 volt, so don't know how long the batteries will last. My only negative comment is that I would prefer if the on/off power switch were located at the top of the unit with the rest of the control knobs rather than behind the amp. I'm very pleased with its performance. It makes my 'flute tootin' almost sound professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"No new insight - don't waste your time (or money)","review":"I actually bought this from a record store on a day when I was in a Nirvana mood and wanted to learn a little more about the band and maybe see some live footage. Upon watching this, I don't know anything that I didn't already know before. It seems the makers just interviewed random people from Kurt Cobain's hometown of Aberdeen, WA, and other third-rate rock journalists, and they have to say is that \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was of great cultural import. Big deal. There were a few short clips of interviews with the band, but the whole documentary is very \\"outside-looking-in\\" and seems pretty shallow.Now I know better than to pick a random music DVD from a store without first doing my research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way To Go Lanchester!","review":"I loved this sweet, funny, elegant novel.

Other than meeting Susan Silverman, who is not that much more than Brenda Loring with brains in this book, the story is an unappealing shaggy dog tale of a screwed up kid who may or may not be kidnapped, his goofy dad and his drunken, nymphomaniac mother. The resolution of the story is entirely regrettable. Even Parker must have thought so, because he basically re-did this plot in a masterly fashion in the later classic, \\"Early Autummn.\\"Don't read this as your first Spenser book; start with the first one and skip this one or save it for last. It's definitely not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPENSER, SECOND BOOK","review":"I have no idea why I waited so long to read the Spenser series. I is great detective stuff.

DeCarlo, who died in 2001, also had a prolific career as a pin-up artist for humor magazines, and this little tome collects some of his best work from the late 50s and early 60s. DeCarlo had a knack for making his women appear funny and sexy at the same time. While most of the gags aren't much, the girls are simply TOO much. There's some (relatively tasteful) nudity here, but most gags involve skimpy clothing and lingerie, so I'd rate this between a PG-13 and a \\"soft\\" R."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Treasure","review":"If you are interested in what house and home mean to people, you'll love this little collection.

I loved this book; it would make an excellent gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent time-travel romance!","review":"I haven't read many time-travel romances because the ones I did read always seemed so unrealistic and the heroine never seemed to have any trouble adjusting to life in a different century. Time-spun Rapture was different in that aspect since Astrid (the heroine) had quite a difficult time getting used to 17th century dialect and customs. This book was a wonderful mix of the 20th century and 17th centuries. It was very interesting to \\"see\\" things through her eyes.The love story between Astrid and Thomas grew slowly and wasn't an instantaneous thing so it was very believable. This book has adventure, romance and some very amusing scenes! I would highly recommend it even if you haven't been a fan of time-travel romances in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a training book","review":"This book will not give you ideas on how to train for a marathon.

Great advice for the beginners Joe.This is a guide for you to fill out your miles as you run them not really a training program. It has very little substance on training and advice that is helpful to anyone getting ready for their first couple marathons.The only good news is I bought it used on Amazon.com for $.

We had resisted buying a swing for the longest time. This one works for us great and the price can't be beat. Our daughter slept in this swing and quit fussing. The seat tilts back to allow an infant to recline. Now that our daughter is bigger she sits upright and can pull the butterflies to activate the sounds. She laughs everytime! She is also content to swing and look out our sliding glass door. I have not had an issue with the batteries running out. I have recommended this swing to my new mom friends because I love it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing!

Actually, she screamed when we put her in it. Then, we tried it a couple weeks later and she really enjoyed it. The sounds, lights, and noises kept her entertained for about 15 minutes. She also liked looking at the print on the ruffle around the chair and the birdie that chirped at her.<br />Now, at 5 months old, she likes the baby-activated mode in which she has to pull on the toys on the side to get the music and lights to go. We originally bought this to soothe our baby when she was fussy, but it has turned out to be so much more than that. Worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We returned this swing!","review":"We hunted every toy store for this swing and were thrilled to find it at Toys R Us until we assembled it and discovered that the swing is rather unsafe. Our 5 mo. old pulled the tray off! Thank goodness we used the seat belt! Also, the birdie doesn't start flying unless you have the swing on a higher speed. :( Otherwise, the bird is totally motionless. We were very disappointed with this swing. We got a Graco swing with a safer tray that swings up to take baby out and doesn't fly off. Baby doesn't miss the birdie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing with options","review":"This is a great swing! My daughter is 5 months old and loves to watch the birdie swing and grabs at the hanging toys. Often times, I leave the toy bar turned off and just let her watch the hanging toys and she's happy with that. I thought the toy bar with all the lights and sounds could be overstimulating for a newborn and now I leave it off sometimes to save batteries. It's great that the birdie moves without the use of batteries. The padding is so soft and she is really comfortable in it.

I was quite disappointed to find that most of the songs on this CD are not only highly repetetive, but contain distracting snare/drum beats that overwhelm the melodic background tones. I definitely agree with Mr. Hernandez's review that it does seem like the album has a divided essence to it, and feel like the CD would've actually been better if they removed the faster-paced drum beats that make it difficult to mellow out to the tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I loved the original JA, but couldn't get it to run on XP so I bought this.

Since many of the photos are from the private collection of the authors, who claim to be the country's largest supplier of vintage kimono, it reads more like a catelogue of their inventory than a resource book.

Eye opening. This is an important read for any person who wants to be a disciple of Christ in this Post Modern Era. Missional Churches, intra cultural communicators, and ministers prepare your hearts and read this book. Jack Rogers affirms that the Bible is the inspired word of God, but offers insight on man's interpretation of \\"the word.\\" If you are gay, read this book. If you are anti-gay, read this book. If you are homo-phobic, read this book. If you are a minister looking to reach out to the homosexual community, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Context, Scripture can Mean Anything","review":"I bought this book to help me understand the liberal position of homosexuality within the church. It seems to me that the author takes some novel interpretations of scripture to support his political position. While the author makes a compelling modern-culture based argument for tolerance, and even full acceptance of practicing homosexuals into all positions in laity and ordained church leadership, he failed to make a compelling, Bible-based argument to support his case.I think you'll be disappointed if you look to this book to equip yourself to support the liberal viewpoints -- the arguments just aren't that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus, the Bible, and Homosexuality by Jack Rogers","review":"I am delighted to see a second edition of Rogers's book. He has given the reader substantial data and Bible references to back up his story and reasoning that resulted in his becoming supportive of gay rights in the church. This second edition includes summaries of where a number of denominations are in their progress towards equality for LGBT. One of the most valuable additions is a study guide that will make this a very practical resource for churches to use for dialogue on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Jesus Would Never Do","review":"This book saddened me deeply. It unfortunately confuses Jesus' love and respect for all persons with approval of their behavior. Jesus loved prostitutes, but never applauded prostitution. He loved tax collectors, but abhorred their dishonesty. In direct contrast to what Scripture actually says, Pastor Rogers imposes his own moral code on Jesus with nothing more to back it up than Jesus' open-mindedness and inclusiveness. This is a disservice to Christianity and to those who struggle to be chaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthy Read No Matter What Your Denomination","review":"This book focuses primarily on the Presbyterian Church, USA, and its struggle with the issue of LGBT equality in the Church. This does not mean, however, that the book does not have relevance for Lutherans, Methodists, Baptists, Catholics, even Mormons. Christians tend to be far more alike than they are different, at least those in the mainstream.The book is extremely well-written and researched; it makes its arguments clearly and with considerable force. Those who are not Presbyterian may find the details of the inner workings of the denomination a bit distracting, but I happen to be a United Methodist, so I could certainly relate; once again, our similarities tend to outweigh our differences.All in all this is a worthwhile addition to the literature on the Christian faith and homosexuality. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pastor rethinks his opinion on homosexuality","review":"JAck Rogers in this book exemplifies what SHOULD be going on in the church today. He challenges his traditional view on a controversial subject, and, using the Presbyterian church's methodology, changes his mind. This is a spiritual and thoughtful book that every Christian (and homophobe) should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misuse of quotes","review":"Jacks Rodgers does a terrible job in checking out his quotes. There are times in which citations are improperly truncated, and then misinterpreted. He used at least one citation and drew a conclusion which was actually unsupported by the actual document. His logic is faulty as well in that he draws a conclusion based on a correspondence that is not warranted. If you read this book, be sure that you check the actual sources and quotes and question any conclusions that he makes. You may agree with Dr. Rogers, but don't accept his arguments without careful thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"This is a must read for clergy, seminarians, elders, deacons...everybody who cares about the Presbyterian Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Biblical scholar","review":"This book contains some of the worst exegesis and forced interpretation I have ever read.

At no point in this work was he objective or even care to acknowledge another possibility. He was out to justify homosexuality and he twisted every biblical passagae he could . It is one of the worst cases of bigoted scholarship I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"But do you love God?","review":"There is no debate about whether God loves all people, but rather do all people love God (the Word made flesh). It seems they do not, who say that the Word (God) does not mean what he says, but just the opposite instead. Woe.... better in the end to let God be true (Rom 3:4).The author errs by equating homosexuals with women. But women are born women, just as African Americans are born black. Those inborn traits are far different from \\"behavior\\" like homosexual behavior. It's behavior that makes a homosexual a homosexual and no one can deny that fact. A woman is not a woman because she behaves like one, but because she \\"is\\" one. Same for black folks. They don't \\"behave\\" themselves into being black.Everyone knows homosexual behavior is wrong and an abomination to God, whether they're homosexuals or not.

(Sometimes you just need to know exactly how and when the partative genitive works, rather than simply how to translate it, you know?)I believe it to be a guide that Latinists find increasingly helpful the deeper they delve into the field.I agree though that it's a shame it's not available in hardcover.

Also alot of things are different from the real story.I anticipate for someone who does not know the story and descriptive emotions between the characters this movie will be quite confusing since it begins at the middle of the book then jump to Jane being a child and back and forth, without including much of what originally was going on in her life. The scenes between Jane and Mr. Rochester are so few and cut short that there isn't very much to see regarding the development of there love, the ending where Jane returns to the blind Mr. Rochester was also the worst, viewers will be left waiting for more but will sadly only see the credits. So disappointing...since i think it had potential to be a very good updated version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this version...you don't get enough of the story","review":"This movie is horrible. No chemistry between the actors, no relationship built between you and the characters, the story is half told, half missing and totally incomplete.

I love Michael Fassbender but that's not enough to like this version.

The writer, producer, director and actors appear to have never read the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre","review":"Mia and Michael were fantastic. The best version I have ever watched.

Definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Stilted","review":"I wanted to like this, but it just wasn't any good for me (the great 2006 version of Janey Eyre puts this movie to shame). I was so bored watching this movie, it was rushed and not engaging at all.There is very little to no chemistry between the actors who play the leads; Their lines are delivered in a very stilted manner, it's like they're reading the words and reciting them without any emotion (the viewer doesn't see or feel any romance in this version). The ending is also very weak. They don't even show the fire in Thornfeild, but rather Mrs. Fairfax (who is the only well cast character in this movie) is the one who tells the story to Jane, and that's it (talk about a weak and anti-climatic ending).In the end, this was just a boring, weak and stilted movie... disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking chemistry in this Jane Eyre version","review":"Very disappointed! The main actors are all great actors, but I found that the director did not use them accordingly. I found this movie very boring and even though I'm a huge fan of the book, I don't mind loose versions, but this one is too incomplete, missing important parts and characters of the book, so why to name the film \\"Jane Eyre\\"?. In my opinion the main problem is the lack of chemistry between Mia and Michael. I saw this DVD three times to see if I was wrong, but still, you don't feel the chemistry of the two main characters and without that, there is not Jane Eyre. If you want a good version, with actors that make you feel like you are really leaving the story and that they care deeply about each other then buy the 2007 Masterpiece Theatre version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson. To me that is the best version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love it!","review":"I first saw this on Netflix and then became rather obsessed with it and had to order the DVD. I also read the book after seeing the movie for the first time so I can actually tell how good the adaptation is. This is just a perfect movie about love, Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender were made for this part. Jamie Bell is not really a good fit, considering how in the book he was described as being much taller and more attractive...but I digress. The cinematography is incredible, along with the set and costumes. I wish it was longer, even watching the deleted scenes makes you feel unsatisfied - but it's based on a 500 page novel so I suppose that was bound to happen. Chick lit and love movies are not my typical genre but I really enjoyed this one - highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite version","review":"This book is a favorite of mine, and I'm always a little wary of movie versions.

I love the book and have watched most of the movie versions from the last 20 years or more and was so looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, it does not follow the story as accurately as the Timothy Dalton version and is so disjointed and anti-climactic that is was not really enjoyable for me.

I enjoyed this version, but it is not my first choice when I want to watch Jane Eyre. I don't know why it was rated PG-13. It was a little scary at one point, but that is the only thing I can think would possibly make it PG-13. If you love Jane Eyre like I do, you will enjoy seeing this movie.

The actors are superb, though, especially the two main ones as Jane and Fairfax. Judi Dench is of course excellent as always. The enormous English country houses used are stunning, to say the least.Jane leads a difficult and lonely life until she ends up a governness in a mysterious household with a dark secret upstairs. This leads to much angst and conflict between her and her employer-turned-would-be-husband.

I have seen better versions of this movie. Also this movie jumped around to much. When you go to the special features and see the deleted scenes that they should have keeped in the movie would have been better with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have watched many Jane Eyres and loved them all but this one was boring.

I saw this version in the theatre last year, and just re-watched it after receiving it for Christmas. I remember being disappointed then, and now remember why. Without going into detail on the liberties taken, I'll just say, there are WAY too many. Which is so disappointing as the actors may be my favorite of the versions I've seen. I don't think I will ever watch it again.

I own other copies of this classic and this one was my least favorite although the Welles version come a close second. I passed it on to someone else and did not add it to my collection. sorry about that!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest version.","review":"Unfortunately this version of one of my favorite tales, Jane Eyre, falls way short. It feels forced, the acting rather bland and wooden. I love Fassbender, but I just feel like he was trying rather badly to copy previous 'Rochester' performances and failing instead of owning him. Jane was mopey, none of her cleverness really showcased, and the emotional moments felt highly ingenuine. An example would be the bed-on-fire scene. Dreadful. In essence, a dvd to be passed over if you're looking to own a great Jane Eyre. Try the Toby Stephens/Ruth Wilson undertaking instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo.....","review":"I just finished reading the book last night and so I had to go pick up this dvd today. Well, I just finished watching this movie version of Jane Eyre and I did NOT enjoy it. I thought this would be like the updated Pride & Prejudice but it's not. It leaves out soo much of the story and it doesn't fully develop the characters so that you can't really connect with them. This movie would only make sense if you had read the book. The 1996 version of Jane Eyre (which you can stream on Netflix) is A LOT better. I like that this version is updated but it only scratches the surface of the book. My advice is to rent it first before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I've been a Jane Eyre fan since I was 11 years old! In addition to having read the book multiple, multiple times, I own 5 different film versions of Jane Eyre. I pre-ordered this latest version, hoping to relive the romance and mystery of this exquisite novel by Bronte. I was in shock when the film ended! Only the version made with Orson Wells where he plays Edward Rochester could be considered as being the worst. This is a close second! I guess, both, the director and screenwriter were just trying to make a quick buck. The mystery was a muddled mess, the romance was stilted, important clue elements were left out of the script...Terrible,terrible. Be happy I gave it a star!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame and weak","review":"This is the worst adaptation of Jane Eyre that I have ever seen so far! There wasn't any chemistry between Rochester and Jane. She was a cold fish compared to what one imagines her character to be when reading the book. The only redeeming aspect was the scenery in this movie. Otherwise I would say it was a total flop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the good reviews!","review":"Don't waste your money. This is by far the worst Jane Eyre I've ever seen. I didn't even finish it. The main actress plays Jane Eyre as if she is half asleep. There is no passion or spark to her performance. It's as if she has no interest in the role that she is playing. If she has no interest, why should we? (Note the young actresses playing Jane Eyre were great, but they're on the screen briefly.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad adaption!!!","review":"If you make Jane Eyre into a two hour movie you have to work extra hard to make sure it is not boring and dull, that time was not taken for this adaption. The director and the writer did not worry about such things as making a good film, they simply took out all the action and replaced with terrible dialog that made you want to fall asleep. The burning of the house, the accidents, his horrible crazy first wife Bertha, all explained away and not really shown. The acting, make-up and costumes were wonderful, but it could not save thing boring movie.If you'd like a good movie, see the masterpiece theater version from 2006, four hours well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased","review":"I will not go as far to say I hated this adaption but I very much disliked it. (Which I don't say too often about movies). First off, I was confused the first 5 minutes of the movie because the opening scene is about the halfway point of the story. Then it goes into 'flashback' scenes as Jane is 'remembering' what happened. Second, the story line was very rushed, lots of information was skipped and many characters left out. Third, the acting was only so-so and lacked the emotions that the characters should posses. Overall, it was a weak interpretation of the book and I probably won't make the effort to watch this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This disjointed version of Jane Eyre is simply not worth the money. There was so little development of the relationship, having it leap from introduction to passion without any scenes to speak of to allow for this progression.The relationship between Eyre and her cousins is not developed at all, simply going randomly into \\"choosing\\" to be family without anything said of being cousins-- in fact, it is a fiction of sister and brother that is given without a foundation in relatedness as in the book-- this is a rather random and objectionable alteration.There are multiple movie versions of this book and several of them are far better!!I expect better from a BBC movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"same old story","review":"This has to be at least the third, if not the fourth version of this movie . However it flashes back several times. It's as if the makers of this movie said to themselves \\"how can we make it different this time\\" . Well I don,t enjoy \\"flashbacks\\" in a movie, it sort of ruins the flow of things. It makes it a little too 'artsy-fartsy for my tastes...That being said it was still well worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Having read the book multiple times and viewed several of the previous movie versions of this brilliant story, I must admit that there was much lacking in this presentation. There was so little character development as to draw me in to truly empathise with our heroine. Her earlier years at both Gateshead and even more so at Lowood were what shaped her character and ideals. To have the relationship with Helen Burns so lightly touched upon was a shameful neglect of the story. Many other pieces of the story fell flat as well, notable the relationship with St. John and his sisters. Understandably she felt indebted to their kindness, but there was no build up of (family) connection that it made you wonder why she was generous in a financial way when she inherited Mr. Eyre's wealth. Too many sketchy details and too much jumping back and forth in time leave this movie with much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"JANE AIRHEAD","review":"Sorry...but Jane Eyre was an intelligent and very opinionated girl full of energy and passion. This girl had very little personality at all, not enough for a master to take notice of a servant. Not even close. I blame the director. He seems to have taken more interest in Rochester's character while leaving poor Jane wondering around like someone had slipped a sedative in her drink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful but blah.","review":"I had considered buying this movie, but I decided to rent it first, which is a good thing. While the movie was filmed beautifully, there was little to no emotion conveyed by the characters. I got bored and fell asleep while watching it, and I love Jane Eyre. I felt as though there were many areas of the story that were not expounded upon in the way that they deserved to be, and there was no chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester! I suggest the Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Eyre, if you're looking for a better retelling of the story. Yes, it's longer, but it's worth it.Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED THE ENDING","review":"Though I love Jane Eyre this version didn't move me like the one before it! The end of the movie made me want to break my dvd and trash it! Although it was really good in detail in the beginning. And the cruetly that Little Jane endured was heart wrenching. I hated this adaptation. MY DVD watched only once is for sale! Any takers??!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I pre ordered this and was really looking forward to seeing it but right from the first scenes I was very disappointed. I didn't like that they went on and on with her leaving and trudging around after discovering he was married before they finally got around to getting on with the story. Plus it gave away a latter part of the story. Then for a long time they jumped back and forth in the story. Nothing wrong with the casting. I thought all were good. I would just have preferred that the movie follow the book more closely. I wont look at it again and will resell it at a half price store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subpar!","review":"I wanted to like this movie; I really did.

Did not like it at all. It seemed that too many important scene are rushed together, I suppose for the sake of time. There is no no real time spent on the developing of the relationship of Jane and Mr.Rochester. The reviews that I did read, went on and on about how great it was and so much better. But even my husband did not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jan Eyre","review":"I loved the attention to detail. From the Homes that they used, the kitchens, the court yards, the furnishings and the clothes, everything looked authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish it!","review":"This version was so poorly done I had to turn it off half-way through! There is no passion, no chemistry, no reason to believe these people would have ever fallen for each other. Of course I didn't watch the whole thing, but I did watch enough to know that I didn't believe their romance. By the time I turned it off they had bored me with parts that I thought they would have shortened but hadn't. They cut out important parts, like two of the conversations between Mr. R and Jane leading up to them falling for each other. The conversation they did have was dull, uninteresting and left me not liking Mr. R where in other versions it is the same conversation where one would start liking Mr. R. Will not watch again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Money","review":"I have read the novel many times and have watched every film version of Jane Eyre. This is the worst of the lot. This is one of the greatest love stories written. And yet this film version shows no emotion. I felt no passion between Jane and Rochester. These actors said their lines with no feeling. And to make matters worse someone changed the ending of the story. Do Not waste any money on this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regrettably bad film","review":"I wanted to buy this movie as a companion to my Masterpiece version with Tobey Stephens and Ruth Wilson. I ordered it on Comcast first, and I am glad I did. I only wasted $5 rather than the full price of the dvd. I love the story, but this version is disjointed and bland as dish water! It's like the poor man's version of the BBC mini-series. And everything is either rushed or totally missing! If you weren't familiar with the story, you would be totally lost! I so wanted to like this movie, but I can't....it is just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great Jane Eyre","review":"Everyone has been raving about this movie.

This is definitely not the best one out there. So much of the movie is rushed, and the flashback device absolutely does not work with this story. My daughter and I watched it and could barely get through it, we felt it was so muddled. I'd suggest the latest Masterpiece Theater version with Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson if you really want to see the story in its full beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it L'Amour Fou for You?","review":"If you were as disappointed in this production's failure to portray \\"l'amour fou\\" (the crazy love) between Jane and Rochester as I was, try the production William Hurt stars in,Jane Eyre. I was so looking forward to a new production of this classic but besides all Cary Fukumaga's forward flashes to the side flashes to the back flashes(found myself wondering if viewers that had never read the so well written book, would be able to keep up with all those chronolgical time jumps)there was simply no, zilch, nada, zero, nil chemistry between Mia Wasikowsk and Michael Fassbender. Huge downer! This film is so badly done and unlikely to capture the imagination of new fans that it will be another decade or two before anyone attempts to produce \\"Jane Eyre\\" again. Lovely scenery, but lovely scenery does not a love story make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the book better","review":"I read the book several times growing up and loved it. I found this movie version left too much out."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst adaptation","review":"By far one of the worst movie versions of Jane Eyre. Why was it even made? There are far better versions already. The actors had no soul. They were lifeless, uninteresting, boring. Very typical of Hollywood movies these days. A similar style to this one was True Grit that just came out with Jeff Bridges. Just awful-again no soul, no meaning. This Jane Eyre appeared to me to be a version for people out there who aren't familiar with the story and so it was dumbed down for the average person who really couldn't care less about literature. The book is awesome and very rich and deep. News to you Hollywood, were not as dumb as you think...I own every version of the movie to date execept this one. I wouldn't watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Eyre is now a horror movie?","review":"Dark, too dark for Bronte.

This version was bleh. You really can't do Jane Eyre justice with 2hrs. I recommend the Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson version.

I started laughing when Mia gave her \\"just because I'm poor\\" speech...horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If you've never read the book, you might find this tolerable: wooden, ridiculous, awful. The acting was poor; the characters bore little resemblance to the characters in the book; important dialogue and scenes were cut or altered. Yeesh.

Waste of $3.99; waste of time.I agree with the individual who wanted to give it negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the best novels of all time, and I feel like this movie does not do it justice. I've seen quite a few adaptions of the film and I cannot understand how this can be a favorite, but to each his own, I suppose. The mini-series from Masterpiece Theatre (2007) is much, much better. This movie begins right as Jane is running away from Mr. Rochester and the movie is basically a series of flashbacks. It leaves out so much from the book and after watching it I was completely disappointed. As many movie adaptions as there are of the novel already I was expecting something a little better. It seemed like a waste. I, personally, would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST VERSION","review":"Since Jane Eyre is one of my favorite love stories, I was very dissappointed with this film.

I'm glad I watched it for myself. I enjoyed it very much. I have never read the book and I get the disappointment in films after reading books. They rarely capture all the details and nuances that the reader enjoys. And cannot compete with the visions that readers draw in their minds.

It was well packaged to prevent any damage in shipment, and I would buy this shelf again. One other note: drawer slides are on the bottom of shelf and don't give the same degree of rigidity as slides that mount on side of drawer. Think of a hack saw blade: easy to push on the flat surface and make blade bend; if you push on edge of blade in will not bend. This means shelf sags a little when fully extended, and also that shelf cannot support as much weight as a unit with side mounted drawer slides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Home/SOHO Studio Component Rackspace","review":"The construction is solid and square. Once populated the Rack looks great. The screw rails are thick gauge steel -however no screws are provided to affix components. 10/32 and 10/24 screws are common so get both if in doubt however it appears for the units I received 10/24 screws were required. The manufactures website stealthily concealed this information. There are rubber feet fastened using woodscrews at the base of the unit. These can strip out of the unit when sliding the assembly into position for example under a desk over carpeted floors. Once this occurs only wood glue and time can resolve the issue. Removing them makes for easier repositioning in this scenario. The carpet is a short knap variety wrapped neatly over the wood framework, but there may be some loose carpet corners. These seem to be a real value in an otherwise pricy utility furniture market.10/32 Screw for Rack, 50 pcs Black12/24 Screw for Rack, 50 pcs Black"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"This fuzzy 12 space rack is great.

I had all the other seasons, and when I got my husband watching them, we decided to complete the collection. It isn't the best season of this series, but that is perhaps personal preference. We have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not really appropriate for kids, but if you're looking for an addictive season, this is it.

The biggest draw of Alias in the prior seasons was that each episode solved some mystery and started another. The big plots that continued from week to week always left you wanting more and desperate to see the next episode. In season four, most of the episodes featured villians and story lines that ended with the show and I found myself not much caring about the next week.J.J. has some big shoes to fill with Season five to get back to the star quality that Alias had in prior seasons - and trying to write Jennifer Garner's pregnancy into the show seems like a disaster waiting to happen to me...but I am hoping to be proved wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"season 4: a complete waste of time.

It starts off kinda slow and with the Rambaldi plot lines taking a backseat, the first few episodes really didn't keep my attention. With a few exceptions like Liberty Village. It is nice to see Greg Grunberg's Eric Weiss character with more to do. He is one of my favorites on the show. The addition of Sidney's sister doesn't really feel worth while until about mid season, where the stories really start to get better and plot lines start to come back into focus from previous seasons. It is still a great show and always fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"twistyist season yet","review":"This season is by far the best one.It has more twists and turns then the previous seasons.I enjoyed Jack more than ever and thought that Nadia was a great edition to the show as Sydneys sister.Speaking of Syd she has a lot of things going on.She has to deal with what she found at the end of season 3,Her and Vaughns relatonship and The fact that she learns something huge about the rambaldi symbol.And in true Alias fashion,It ends with a hell of a cliff hanger.One of the best episodes of the season is Tuesday,But everything from the 4th dis to the last disc is non stop action and twists.Can't wait to get the 5th season next week!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing steam","review":"Alias is gradually losing momentum in the fourth season.

Initially I didn't really enjoy the third season, but over time it has grown on me. The first half of this season was kind of rough, and seemed to stray from the formula that worked so so well in the first couple of seasons (personal relationships with all the characters are a bit strained at first). The second half of the season is better and returns a bit more to its roots, although it gets a bit sci-fy with the Rambaldi stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alias DVD series","review":"It came in perfect shape.

The final two seasons four and five were a huge drop off with dangling plot lines and useless tangents.

But the resolution was so weak it made me wish the story ended in the third season.That being said, the final two seasons are vastly superior to the majority of shows on television today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alias series","review":"First two years of this series were pretty good.

The killer robot helicopter chapter was nonsense.I'm very disappointed with the whole season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alias continues to impress!","review":"Season 1 to Season 4 - Alias constantly continues to deliver the goods. Simply one of THE best shows on TV, and possibly the most underrated, Alias never fails to deliver the most exciting cliffhangers and the most exciting drama there is.So wonderful to see new relationships blossom (Nadia & Weiss), almost as good as seeing Lena Olin making a comeback at the end of the season.5/5 for the season. From vampire-like characters, to clones and a killer season finale, Season 4 will most definitely not dissapoint an avid Alias fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book for any age","review":"I bought the book out of curiosity and was enthralled. I have never been to West Point and I am not a young girl, but the story and the writing were riveting. One night I read the book to my 5 and 1/2 year old son at bedtime and he could not wait until the next night's reading. The descriptions are excellent and the struggles that the young heroine and her friends experience are universal. I am looking forward to her next book and so is my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel for all young girls!","review":"I pre-read all the books my pre-teen daughter reads. Recently Iread Battle Dress by Amy Efaw. I found this book extremely relevant tothe needs of her age group. It illustrates the values and perserverence a girl needs to realize goals. In this book the main character, Andi, aspires to complete the rigorous military summer training program at West Point. Young girls can relate to Andi, who comes from a disfunctional home and struggles with her self-esteem and ghosts from the past. By the end of her summer of \\"Beast\\", she comes to appreciate and learn from both the positive and negative aspects of her present experience which taught her valuable life long lessons, including the benefits of team effort. I highly recommend Battle Dress to any pre teen who will find Andi inspiring as well as determined to realize the goal she set out to accomplish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Dress","review":"Battle Dress, by Amy Efaw, is a wonderfully written piece of literature. Honestly, it was one of the best books that I have ever read. It really does a good job at depicting the hardships and troubles of being a new cadet at West Point, especially for girl. With so few girls at West Point it makes them stand out and they can become an easy target for a lot of flack from the upperclassmen. Most of all, this book shows that when you pursue your dreams and never give up that great things will become of it. You just have to decide what's important to you and never surrender. I would recommend this book to any one who might be interested in West Point or any one who likes to read about women overcoming enormous obstacles against all odds. Scratch that, I would recommend this book to any one. It was just a good book and I had a lot of fun reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was thinking about applying to West Point, but after reading this book from the library I've decided that there is no way. It's not only because the environment depicted is so bad, the book itself is so bad! I can't believe the author of this book graduated from college. Did Amy Efaw really graduate from college? Apparently yes because the life of the main character, Andi, is based on the life of the author, Amy Efaw. (In other words, this is an autobiographical novel.) Every page of this book is terrible...from the dialogue (way too much) to the descriptions (few and far between)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Riveting and inspiring.

Family drama, friends, sports & finding yourself all wrapped into one novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever!!!","review":"Battle Dress is one of the best books that I have read. Its based on a female in the army or getting through the first tiny part of it. There are parts when the pressure gets too much that she just wants to go home and then there's times when she thinks she can do anything. This book isn't just based on army stuff (even though alot of it is) it's on her life through it what she did, what she felt etc. to tell the truth I'm really not into army things at all but this book i got excited at parts and sad other times.this is a really great book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms Jones has done it again","review":"After reading \\"Bloodline\\" I was anxious to read another book by Ms. Jones.

Slade's daughter Veronica is a key suspect, as well as a local drug lord who has just gotten out of prison.I enjoyed the inclusion of voodoo in the story. Ms. Jones begins each chapter with an excerpt from a fictional book of voodoo. The eerie voodoo-related happenings really added a lot to the suspense of the story.The resolution of who killed J.J.

Seeing the world through a mad third eye, the reader sees Brian's soul laid bare through his hilarious interactions with the inner, outer and underworld. A seemingly linear spiritual quest turns into a mobius strip mining of the soul, peeling the skin off a moment in time amidst a search for redemption into the comically unredeemable.

What this book illustrates, however, is that managers don't make companies work, worker-centered policies do.Now, years on, that company has become part of something much larger and quite successful.

The depth of research and research techniques themselves are commendable. Credibility is the result. The idea that companies contributing in great measure to civilisation underlies much of this book. Why they contribute so much, and how they do it are fascinating in themselves. But it is the very concept of \\"built to last\\" that I found of greatest interest.

Troubled by inconsistencies in application of knowledge, author John Mangano sits down with us to chat about \`life as we know it.' What becomes evident in reminiscing snapshots that no longer make sense is the keenness to change one's thinking to the betterment of the individual and society.Issues in religion and science that beg for responsible sense-making without censure come together in a series of vignettes compiled from the laboratory of life.Entertaining and heady, this is an honest work by a learn-ed man who still cares... the perfect exercise to stimulate apologetics thinkers and skeptics alike. \\"Eating the Elephant\\" provides the questions...you become the solution. My recommendation: 'Don't bite off more than you can chew.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This book is a terrific read and a wonderful look at life from an author who is humorous, fun, and a great storyteller.

If you love tons accessories then you must own this particular G.I. Joe. 'Coastie' G.I. Joe comes loaded with, an M-16 A2, a shotgun, a faux leather holster with a sidearm, a life jacket, a radio with MIC, a clipboard with paper,a pair of binoculars, a camera with a long telephoto lens, and a huge flashlight! This G.I. Joe is also extremely posable,and so the kids will have a great time playing with it. I especially liked it that Hasbro provided a brief history of the U.S. Coast Guard on the outside of the box! So now you not only get a great toy, but you also get to brief history lesson. FUN + LEARNING = G.I. Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blast From the Past","review":"As a former Coast Guard Radioman, I purchased this figure as a birthday present for a neighbors child (I live overseas). I was so impressed with the detail that I kept the figure, and ordered a second one for the child. The toy is a fine tribute to the Guard and does raise awareness of its many missions--more importantly the kids love playing with it. I even sent one to my Father In Law as a get well present. He's X-Navy and he loved it. The general idea was to give it to his grandson, but the doll still sits on Pop's dresser i.e. it ain't going anywhere!Dave J, Muscat, Oman"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no...","review":"I'm a die-hard wrestling fan, and I had great expectations when I bought this book. Sadly, it turned out to be a complete waste of money. The book wasn't that much about wrestling, and the bits that was actually had some factual errors. It's strange, but when reading the book, it actually seemed like I know more about Ted DiBiase's WWF days than he does himself. The only thing even the slightest interesting is when he writes about the backstage ongoings in wrestling (wich he, again, doesn't do much) and the creation of the Million Dollar Man gimmick. Ted DiBiase is one of wrestling's true greats. He deserved a better biography than this. I never thought a book about wrestling could bore me to death. Sorry, Ted."},{"rating":"1","title":"MILLION DOLLAR BORE","review":"THIS BOOK BY TED DIBIASE IS FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT TED AND HIS BORN AGAIN CHRISTIAN LIFE.

THE $1,000,000 MAN FILLS THIS BOOK WITH SOME EVENTS IN HIS LIFE ALONG WITH A BIT OF WRESTLING BUT ALOT OF VERSES FROM THE BIBLE AND SOME DETAILED EVENTS OF LIFE AS A CHRISTIAN. I REALLY THINK THIS BOOK IS BORING AND NOT WORTH IT FOR THE AVERAGE WRESTLING FAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Man Has His Price, and Dibiase paid his well","review":"This is one of the first pro-wrestling autobiographies I remember hearing of. Dibiase wrote this, and was popular, back before wrestling was as main stream as it is today. He was a top guy back in the day when it was still considered a joke by many, so a die hard wrestling fan will love this book. It details not only Dibiase's career, but his personal life as well. Dibiase is a great writer, which doesn't come as a surprise to any die hard wrestling fan, because he always did seem like an intelligent person. Have a nice day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goes Beyond The Mat","review":"Ted DiBiase's book has a different slant than the biographies about Mick Foley, The Rock, and Arn Anderson. Ted' story not only deals with his struggles in the wrestling world but also his relationship with God and family. The reader gets a good idea of the pain Mr. DiBiase went through when he suddenly lost his father. Also revealed is the emotions of watching his mother perform and later how his mother withered away into a shell of her former self. Ted also gives us some insight into the legends such as Terry Funk and Harley Race who made wrestling what it is today. The reader really gets a feel into the character of Ted and his constituents as they their jobs with pride and dignity.This is a special book that can spread to reeligious audiences as well as wrestling fans as one can see that Ted DiBiase has learned to become true to his beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every man will be bored","review":"This book was not the wrestling bio I was looking for. Dibiase doesn't go into detail about the \\"unholy\\" things that he has participated in during his lifetime. He instead likes to focus on the positive aspects of having God in his life. Thats all well and good but I thought the book was a wrestling bio not a 200 page infomercial for the church. Bottom line..........if you want wrestling stories and detail this is not the book for you. However, if your looking for a great story about a man's love for Jesus Christ this book is great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its o.k.

Ted DiBiase doesn't really get into specifics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on wrestling, long on religion","review":"Do not read this book expecting a tell-all behind the scenes look at pro-wrestling. Instead it quickly turns into a syrupy sweet look at Ted Dibiase's life in wrestling, culminating in his emergence in WCW. It provides very little insight into the sport instead focusing on the role religion played in his life. In short a great book for someone looking for an inspirational story, but not one for a hard core wrestling fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"I am a wrestling fan and bought this book on a whim for a few laughs.

For one, Mr. DiBiase wrote it himself. DiBiase doesn't pretend to be a writer, so he produces a simple, straightforward account of his life and career.In reallity, this isn't a book about wrestling as it is a book about a man's turn to God, a man who happened to be a pro wrestler, and one of wrestling's greatest heels.The books's major flaw is that it's too short, and many details could have been added to supplement the book's story. There are a few factual errors, the one I remember was when he described the Wrestlemania 8 match with he and Mike Rotundo against the Natural Diasters has a great match.

She avoids hard-to-find ingredients. Everything in the book can be prepared with items you can buy in any supermarket, yet it all tastes completely authentic. I pull this one out for special occasion baking and for everyday suppers (I particularly love the Sauerbraten, prepared with a side of homemade Spaetzle). Anytime I get homesick for Germany, I know that I can turn to this book for, at least, a taste of what I miss.The book is well organized and the recipes are set up in an easy to read format.

Entire paragraphs are adjective-riddled and hard to keep one's interest. Examples of this are incredibly long, drawn out descriptions of parking her vehicle in a parallel spot, noting directions from a restaurant to a person's house, turn-by-turn, and lots of very boring conversations and observations, etc. Too much minutia, and not enough substance in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"meloncholey.....","review":"when I bought Volume 2 blueray of UC gundam, I was expecting to contiune from where the volume 1 DVD left off from.

The plot holes, inconsistencies and confusion are the result of terrible editing. The only reason I decided to write this review, is simply because, the more bad reviews this DVD gets, the less people will buy it.

I couldn't put 0).","review":"Well whatever the reason let me tell you my opinon of \\"Cardcaptors.\\" First off it's a show first aired in Japan in '98 under the title of Cardcaptor Sakura. It was a show about a girl named Sakura Kinomoto. It had 73 wonderfull epi. Cardcaptors started with the episode when Shaolan Li(Li's the Family name you don't switch rich, powerful, influental peoples name). Oh I wish i could continue but I got to go so in total Buy the show about Friendship,love,trying your best,stop the world from dying.

However, people should not be tricked into thinking that Cardcaptors is the same thing as Cardcaptor Sakura. They most certainly are not. If you are thinking about purchasing this dvd, do yourself a favor and instead buy Cardcaptor Sakura Vol. 1- The Clow. Not only will you get the original storyline from the japanese series and spare yourself the complete hack job Nelvana did attempting to put it on the American market; you will get more episodes and a storyline that makes more sense. I think if you read more of the reviews you will find that those who have seen both Cardcaptors and Cardcaptor Sakura agree that Cardcaptors is no more than a grotesque cut and paste editing project on a fantasic series."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"absolutely NO plot, completely butchered, not intresting. this is a dubdubdubdubdubdubdub of CCSakura, with no plot/ storyline besides mindless card captoring/transforming. in scenes where Li is *supposed* to be blushing, they change the dialouge, but have him blushing. The last episode out of like 20 (suposed to have 70) is totally dumb, with such a bad cliffhanger (that cuts out the 2nd movie) that ends the series on a bad note. WIll Li come back? Goodness, it seems like Sakura is hoping that he will come back so that she will have all her friends. All the character's personalities are gone, so I recommed you don't buy this. Go get the VHS with subtitles- you'll at least get the real thing, even if the subtitles aren't that um good. At least they are 80% accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Cant they leave cardcaptor Sakura ALONE!!!","review":"Ok i hate the english version of cardcaptors.

What IS bad is the order theepisodes are being arranged. This tape jumps many episodes, like theyaired of the WB, ultimately resulting in a confusing experience.

Also, I am a huge fan of Cardcaptor Sakura. Though, let me make it clear, I am not a fan of Cardcaptors. This show is an insult to CLAMP (the 4 women who created the original)! Many changes such as needless cuts, name changes, many dialouge changes, and mixed episode orders make this show incompetent. After all of that it would still be decent but they did two things that changed it for the worse. BAAAD voice acting and trying to make Saoyran another main character so it would appeal to boys! He is not, as the 12-year-old reviewer stated, Sakura's partner. He is a supporting character. They also made dialouge changes to make him sound stronger and gruffer but instead they made him a bully. Not to mention they cut out his harmless crush on Sakura's bro. BOTTEM LINE: Not bad for a kid's show but otaku need not apply. Get the subbed under the title, \\"Cardcaptor Sakura.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disgrace","review":"This video is not worth the tape it is printed on. It bears little resemblance to the far superior show it was taken from, Cardcaptor Sakura (which I would highly recommend!), aside from the animation and such. The dialog is very poorly written, the voices were ill-cast for many characters (Kero stands out as being particularly horrible), the story was changed, the characters suddenly all act very stuck-up... I can't think of a single good thing to say about this except that the animation is quite nice. Whatever you do, don't get this poor imitation - get the *real* Cardcaptor Sakura, which is uncut and unedited, the way the show was meant to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"This is nothing but a butchering of Cardcaptor Sakura. Where CCS excels, Cardcaptors flops completely - the plot is hardly explained (and completely out of order), the characters are changed from being interesting and lovable to being stuck up and impossible to relate to, the appropriate music has been replaced with stuff my little sister could play on a Casio.... There is very little value in this show, especially since it also teaches that a show is not worth anything unless the main female character is dumbed down and a male character played up to be the main character instead. This sets a bad example for all. If you want something worth your time and money, you should check out the unedited version. It's an entirely different show, and it's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"I have seen the american Cardcaptors and the original japanese subtitled Cardcaptor Sakura. I have to say that the subtitled original version is better because the story is better and it's much more cuter.

The characters' voices are exciting and clear. It contains action packed episodes. I like the stylish outfits and the entire artwork. Cardcaptors is very comical with plenty of action!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent series!","review":"First off, to those who rated this product and any of the other dubbed Cardcaptors products as horrible, I'd like to say something: You only think the dubbed version is horrible because you are used to the subtitled version! I, personally, grew up to the dubbed episodes; and so, when I watch the original Cardcaptor Sakura, I think that /their/ version is horrible. It is all a matter of opinion, and that's that. If you don't like the dubbed version, DON'T BUY IT. Seriously.Anyway, on to the review.I've always been a fan of the Cardcaptors series, even though I am just now starting to buy the show on DVD and VHS. The characters were fun, the plot was engaging, and the action was fairly constant. However, I found that sometimes the episodes, when being watched, seemed slightly short and abrupt. That aside, I would recommend this series to anyone who loves anime and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh god noooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"PLEASE DO NOT BUY CARDCAPTORS!... Try Cardcaptor Sakura/Card Captor Sakura (just different spellings)... it is the original Japanese version and you can the videos and DVDs from Amazon. The English dub is NOT worth the money at all! If only some people knew just how bad it really is compared to the Japanese... Sakura and Tomoyo(Madison) sound like little brats in the English dub.. and all the romance and funny scenes are cut making each episode about 5 minutes shorter than it really should be! Names are changed and they always pretend that they're not in Japan... it is sooooo edited any good Cardcaptor Sakura site on the internet will tell you just how bad it is! I could go on forever but please... do yourself a favour and buy Cardcaptor Sakura not Cardcaptors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Skipped the first 7 episodes, bad dubbing, 10 minutes edited out of the original episode, doesn't even have the English version of the Kero-chan ni Omakese (Kero's Corner) as broadcasted here in Canada. Why waste your money on this load of crap when you can get the UNCUT subtitled version by adding a few dollars more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardcaptors - Tests of Courage (Vol. 1)","review":"This butchered version of Cardcaptor Sakura is just pathetic! Apparently, Nelvanna, who did the North American dub, decided that no one will watch their anime unless it was marketed to boys (as in, a girl can't be the main character, it should be full of action) and all references to Japan removed! To do this, they had to totally edit the plot, and cut huge amounts of the show. Some of the episodes are a full 5 minutes shorter than the originals. They also had to change the characters' personalities. To make sure it was as full of action as possible, they did things like only showing a few of the episodes and splicing pieces of seperate episodes together. Another complaint I have is that the theme music was totally changed. \\"Catch You Catch Me\\" is one of my favorite songs, and they replaced it with some other inferior, short song. My advice is to just buy the uncut versions, and ignore the Cardcaptor videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this review could get 0 stars, it would","review":"Let us start off. Cardcaptors is the worst dubbed show event to premiere (it actually beat Sailor Moon in terms of this), and worst than Pokemon in editing. This show is so pathetic in its dubbing that you can laugh at it. The only thing of interest in here is the first episode. If you notice, Terada-sensei writes Li-kun's name on the blackboard, but nothing shows up. Hah! Now you can see how bad Nelvana is at this and what is in store.Buy the subtitled Cardcaptor Sakura, please! You will hate yourself forever if you buy this and you go on cardcaptors-uncensored.com and find out exactly what you missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined","review":"Cardcaptors was butchered very badlyfrom the original Japanese version. This new series by Nelvana (grr.. I hate you!) is missing many episodes and the story is somewhat different. They wanted to turn this heart-warming girls' series into a action-packed boys' series (which it is not!). In the series (refering to TV) scenes with Sakura's grandfather was taken out because it would have seemed inappropriate for an action series. They also changed relationships and feelings, such as Syaoran's (Li) love for Yukito (Julian), Chiharu (Chelsea) and Takashi's (Zachary) relationship, Meiling's (Meilin) feelings and relationship with Syaoran (Li), and so much more.If you are into the series, I recommend Cardcaptor Sakura, the un-dubbed and untampered series. It is so much more satifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good =)","review":"Okay I personally thought the movie was great! I like the charactors and the plotlines! I never miss it when its on the WB! Okay but about that one review that said this is horrible and that Card Captor Sakura is muuuuch better. Well thats all high and dandy that you had the OPPORTUNITY to watch the original versions, but for many people the dub is all there is! And I mean, the artwork is still very beautiful, and the plotline is still followable! Aaaand if you haven't figured out why Madison follows Sakura around with a camera then you obviously dooon't watch the show (which is understandable seeing as you hate it) and so I mean, just cause you don't watch it you are making false accusations at it. And plus, if you had seen ANY episodes, you would know that Sakura is STILL the main charactor, not Li. Okay? Hmm...anyway, I recomend this movie, it was very nice =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"People get a life it's just a cartoon!","review":"Get a life this is a great show.

It rings 60 seconds early as a warning that the time is almost up. Watch timer as it will continue to keep track of remaining seconds, but does not ring again.\\"And the one-minute-early ring is barely two seconds, not the five seconds as described.Do yourself a favor and just avoid this awful product :-(I am returning it to Amazon for a refund. Why is it so hard to find a decent kitchen timer?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed \\"feature\\"","review":"This timer has a design flaw, instead of changing the design to fix the flaw, the defect was incorporated as a \\"feature\\". The timer does not ring at zero, as other timers do, and is the base function of a timer, instead it rings at one minute. The instructions in the package claim this is a warning ring to let you know time is almost up.

So when you want the Timer to ring loud and long it won't and when you don't want it to ring at all it rings loudly for 10 seconds or more. Made in China.

What timer/alarm clock do you know that you don't have to WIND the bell? I can't believe eight buyers of this timer on Amazon were unable to figure this out! Come on!ignorance aside, it's a great little timer. Well made and works great. I like the fact that it goes off 30 seconds before it hits zero. Theoretically that should give you advance warning to turn off your pot, open your oven, or walk across the kitchen to the stove.

Benji is a fine example of his breed: they are real characters!

I found out I could borrow the cds from many public libraries, which is what I did. I would say this is the best 4 hour-series I have come across.

The story begins centered around Batgirl and Detective Bruce Wayne, but it stretches to almost every corner of Gotham, and even incorporates Black Canary in the '62 thread.Two many threads don't go anywhere, and though some provide great dramatic moments, they are watered down by the point that they have no function.Neat new origens for Batman, Batgirl, Black Canary, Mr. Freeze, and Killer Croc, but the Joker aka Bianca Steeplechase aka Blache Gregory could have been fleshed out, as well as the TwoFace thug and Harley Quinn, which is a horrible attempt to add in more drama to the climax.The characters aren't likeable, and the cleavage is laid on a bit thick for 1961/1962. Not very time-themed, and a bit forced.Read for the new takes on costumes and origens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth a read even if you disagree","review":"Saw the author on televison while flipping channels and was intrigued by the title and agreeable with the underlining concerns. Now there are a few elements I disagree with, like the authors negative statements regarding Mel Gibson.

It is only one of the four volumes of that collection, the one containing the second half of the Confessio Amantis (books 5-8), and the poem \\"In Praise of Peace,\\" along with some editorial matter, including the glossary and Proper Name index. The reproduction of the volume is not badly done; though some pages have a darkened background, they are quite readable. Without the other three volumes (or at least the one with the first four books of the Confessio), this edition is of limited utility. Unless you are looking specifically for Macaulay's notes on the latter half of the poem, his index, or \\"In Praise of Peace,\\" you can find a better edition of the Confessio for this price.

Duane travels over the fret board like few I have ever heard even some 40 years after this album came out. 'Rebel Rouser' is a pioneering album even by today's standards. The Peter Gunn theme is classic, Rebel Rouser even more so and on theme of Dixie what a job Duane does! What I like about Duane's music is his eagerness to use the lower frets so the solos are in a lower key. It is quite the contrast to today's high fret use where notes are so high they easily get garbled.

The interface is horrible even with the Nano though as none of the functions (play,pause,forward,backward,shuffle) are mapped the the buttons on the unit.

The author's years of experience and rational mind shine through. Anyone interested in martial arts, from beginner to black belt can use and benefit from 'Analyze Your Fighting' by Darin Waugh.

Used component outputs from XBox 360 and Wii as inputs 1 & 2 on this box. Then used component video + optical audio output to the HDMI converter. It degraded the picture quality for XBox 360 to 480p and no sound. The 2-page pamphlet included with this item lists only optical audio from input is transmitted to optical output and the box does not perform any conversion. When I hook up the XBox 360 to HDMI converter directly, it generates 1080p output plus excellent audio on TV. Returned this item next day and found Neoya.com has an HDMI converter for Wii as well.

It is small and low quality as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is the best device for the job","review":"I looked at a lot of different devices and read a lot of reviews before I found this switcher, but this one has a remote that changes to the input of your choice, and has indicator lights so you can see which one is currently in use, and these 2 factors contributed heavily to the choice. In a multiple component situation such as what we have, we needed to be able to have more optical ports than our surround system offered in order to have digital TV, video gaming, and 2 other DVD players provide surround sound.This unit was exactly what we needed, and has no moving parts like other switchers that are less expensive and prone to more wear and tear. It's better look and solid metal chassis blow away the alternatives and has potential for long-term reliability.

Before I knew anything about audio I bought myself a home theatre in a box. It worked fine up until I got an HDTV, and then a TiVo HD and then a PS 3. The problem was the receiver only had 1 digital audio input, and now I had 2 devices with digital audio. The solution was the 3-Play Component Video Digital Audio Selector. The hookup was very simple- 1 digital audio cable from the TiVo to the selector, 1 digital audio cable from the PS 3 to the selector and then 1 digital audio cable from the selector to the digital audio input on the receiver. After all that I simply programed my Logitech Harmony remote to select the proper channel on the selector for the device I was using. The fact this selector had IR was a major selling point for me.PS- I only use this device for its digital audio functionality and not for its component video functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoulda woulda....","review":"Instead of upgrading my aging Sony home theater receiver to one that has built in component/HDMI monitor outputs with upconversion, I decided to give this a shot.

I'm certain it is not a cable, projector, nor a dvd issue as I have no issues when bypassing the switch and directly connecting the projector to the source.I've also tried swapping out cables.

After messing with it for a while, I discovered that the only way to restore the U-Verse audio is to unplug its TOS cable from the back of the 3play and then plug it back in.Do I just have a defective unit, is this a known problem, or is there a solution?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for optical audio switching","review":"I got this to go along with my AX720 so I could connect multiple sources to the one input in the Ax720's. This thing worked like a charm, I have my PS3, XBOX360 and Cable box connected to the switch with optical cables and it is working great. I even get my 5.1 surround sound through the switching system. The control works well however I use my harmony to control the unit. I havent tried the video inputs since I only use it for audio so I cant comment on the video quality. This is a great moderately inexpensive solution for those of you looking for a remote controllable audio switch for TOSLINK audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I use this product for audio only connecting my tv box, apple tv and ps3 to my home theatre system with optical input. I haven't noticed any loss of quality in the sound. This product has been a great solution against messing with the cables as i switch between tv box, ps3 and apple tv.You have to be very accurate with the remote though, doesn't work perfectly.One important thing is that the adaptor supports 110 v only.

The screen blanks for a half second or more. This occurs with both my Blu-Ray Disc player and HD DVR. After talking with the Cables-to-Go tech support I returned the unit to Amazon and obtained a replacement. The new one didn't work any better. Since I like action movies, this switch makes them unwatchable. As a toslink switch, it worked extremely well. But, that's not why I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote control and optical audo plusess don't outweight frequent resync issues","review":"I experienced the same problem with this device as reviewed by others. Sudden changes in the brightness of onscreen material causes a resync. My setup is a PS3, HD DVR & XBOX 360 running into this switch, then a Yamaha Amp/Receiver to a Sony XBR TV. Every time a grenade exploded on an xbox game or any affect that caused a bright flash. The HD DVR experienced a similiar issue with sudden screen brightness changes or switching between an HD program and the guide. This is particularly frustrating when playing online games. The screen would suddenly resync to black and back to the displayed material in the middle of fights or major cinematic events. I guess there's a reason why it was only $40.

Also works well if you need extra optical outputs. One con of the unit is its light weight, the heavy component video cables tend to lift up the front of the unit. A solution I found for this problem is to buy a small piece of craft foam to put under the wires to keep it from tipping. Well worth the 50 bucks or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I did not know such a product even existed. I have a six year old HDTV rear projection for the basement.

When running the Nintendo Wii through it I would often get sync loss and flickering anytime a bright white screen came on (which happened a lot in Super Mario Galaxy).Additionally, while running my XBOX 360 though it, the screen would often scramble and freeze up (confirmed this was not the 360 itself). FYI, my Wii is set to 480p and the 360 at 720p which this switcher could supposedly handle. Unfortunately that was not the case for me. Was it just bad luck? Who knows, but I'll have to look for another brand now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as it's designed for","review":"The device works well, just like advertised/designed. One suggestion when you hook up: better make line #1 be the one you use most since that's the default when you turn the unit on (no matter which line you used the last time before you turn it off)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value in a fine component video switcher","review":"If you're adding high definition sources to your system and are running out of component video inputs, the Impact Acoustics (Cables To Go) Component Video Switcher may be just what the home theater doctor ordered. Its 50 MHz rated video bandwidth supports the full resolution of HD video sources as well as standard video devices such as game systems and DVD players.Its credit card remote is perfectly functional and the fact that it offers direct input access via the remote for each of its three component video inputs means that it's easy to integrate with a universal remote control.Don't let the low price fool you. This little switcher is a great way to add high definition and standard definition component video sources to your system without having to upgrade your TV or home theater receiver.Check out the complete review on Big Picture Big Sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked well","review":"This product worked very well, and was easy to hook up.

No batteries needed! It has a led that shines in the back and illuminates the wall behind. Some users may find this a problem. It has to be powered on in order to switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works About One Third of The Time","review":"It really depends on the power-up order, whether this switcher responds to commands. Sometimes, it won't even respond to the physical buttons on its face, let alone the remote control, necessitating a \\"hard reboot\\" -pulling the power cord- before it responds.Not a high-quality circuit board, I fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"This av switcher/selector works perfectly for my needs. I have an older HDTV that does not have any HDMI ports, so component video is my only HD option at the moment.My TV has two \\"component in\\" connections but I needed three and this switch was the perfect solution. I now have my PS3, Roku Netflix player and my digital cable TV signal running through this switch into component one on the TV. It also has digital (fiber optic) audio, so I have my PS3 and the Netflix player audio running into my Yamaha receiver via toslink optical/digital audio cables for excellent sound.This item really simplified my setup. I couldn't be happier with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I was an early adopter of HDTV, so my 8 year old Mistubishi Diamond TV only offered one set of component inputs that did 1080i (it also offers fire wire inputs - but this never caught on and was replaced by HDMI a few years later). With the purchase of a Blue-Ray player I needed to be able to switch between my Cable TV HD-DVR and the Blue Ray player.As other reviews before have noted - there no no visible loss of signil quality using the switcher. It really does work quite well. It also switches TOSLINK and the old red/white RCA streo audio. I used the TOSLINK and that works nicely too.If you are like me and have an older HDTV with plenty of life left but not enough component inputs, this little box does the job quite admirably. It even as an itty-bitty remote so you don't have to get off the couch if you don't want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"I've been using this A/V selector for a couple of weeks and so far everything is working well.

Although there is not much diversity in the level designs (your environment is one of 3 buildings), the levels play out really well.Two things shine about this games - AI and sounds. The AI is still some of the better AI in a video game out there, and the sound is immersive.At the time it was released, the multi-player was extremely fun and I played it for hours on end. Nowadays nobody really plays it anymore, and the few servers you find are riddled with hackers. If you can find a used copy of this game for a few bucks, it is worth it for the single player portion of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"started out good then declined","review":"i havent taken the time to finish the game yet (finals are coming up)so some of what i say might not be accurate for the entire game.in the begining of the game it was really fun. it had some good shooting and was a lot like half life except scary. until you play the game you cant understand how it can be actually scary, but believe me it it, in some parts. the slow motion during the fighing is really cool. this game has really good AI for its age. it was a good game but it got worse maybe the ending of it will make it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear inducing!","review":"FEAR is scary!

A learned gamer knows his stuff and stays ahead of the game. If u don't update your video card for more than a year you can't expect it to handle the more demanding newer games. So critique just the game and don't bring us your video card issues because we don't care. The game is very good by the way. Most sophisticated AI i've seen in a game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scary, Too Linear, Stale Environrment","review":"I found this to be just another ordinary shooter. Its thin plot didn't scare me at all (see such classics as Clive Barker's Undying and System Shock 2 if you want a truly scary shooter). There are a few NPCs (Non Playable Characters) that try to move the plot along but your time with them is way too brief for you to care what happens to them next. Your progress through the environments in extremely linear which is exacerbated by the fact the environments are ALL buildings. The whole game takes place in a collection of office buildings and warehouses where you'll fight in close quarters surrounded by the mandatory collection of boxes, crates, and pipes. I admit that the enemy AI is very good and the graphics are impressive but they weren't enough to save me from boredom after only a few hours. Overall, a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overhyped.","review":"I bought this game after trying the demo, thinking the demo was a sneak peek at what would be an even better final commercial product. What I didn't realize was that nearly everything in the commercial product was already seen in the demo. The same bland environments (3 total) The same enemy (nothing but guys in black body armor) No real in-game plot. No puzzles, no non-weapon equipment. Very little suspense. As soon as I saw a flashlight that needed recharging every 15 seconds, the lack of friendly fire (shoot at an ally and the bullets don't hit them), and gratuitous use of explicit foul language and blood, I knew what I was in for, because those are all things a company throws in when a game isn't well-rounded enough. The enemy AI and physical performance were interesting, but that's mainly all this game has to offer. And for a game that demands cutting edge hardware, the graphics still are bland, repetetive, and overall disinteresting. I wish I had waited for the Bargain Bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is dope!","review":"Ive been hearing a lot of talk and a little complaining about how this game is too much like Half Life 2.

Half Life 2 rocks so whats the problem if this game were very similiar? NONE to me at least. I enjoyed this first person shooter the gameplay is excellent and fun throughout the whole game. The storyline could be better told and tied together more during the game but its still good enough to keep you interested and like I said the gameplay is where its at. Sounds are erie and great and set the right mood for the type of game it is and graphics are decent as well. There are some cool looking special effects but nothing groundbreaking or really astonishing that hasnt been done before but the game is very good overall most people will be very pleased with this game as a purchase or rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Story","review":"I thought the gameplay was great, but the story was awful. Play Half-Life 2 for five minutes and you quickly have an interest in the story and the characters, but after finishing this game I didn't care at all what happened to the story or the characters. I thought when they brought in some npc's that they would start to develop those things, but I was to be disappointed. The environments aren't anything interesting either.If you don't care anything about having a good story and are only interested in a decent fps, then go ahead and try this. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"F.E.A.R. is a real P.I.A. to install but fun to play!","review":"Although this game is fun to play, it is a nightmare to install.

The next thing I knew, it was 3 o'clock in the Afternoon. This is a very immersive game. Though not as intresting as HL2 or action packed as Doom 3. It is an excellent shooter with graphics that will test any system. The sound is excellent..the best I've heard and there are some generally freaky parts. I agree that the worlds are a bit boring and the enemy's repetitive. The action is great as it requires alot more stealth and strategy to frag your oppenents.

All too often, commentaries on specific Bible passages seem to conflict with the very passage they are trying to explain or illustrate, and devotional works which are intended to stand on their own tend to be too sickly-sweet for me, or have questionable theology from time to time.But of course, this is C.S. Lewis. Walter Hooper has arranged some of Lewis' pithier passages into a series roughly paralleling the Church Year as observed by Anglicans. I read it in parallel with my own Bible reading, and was somewhat bemused to find how often what Lewis wrote meshed with what I was reading in the Bible, even though I made no attempt to coordinate or harmonise the two. This is a \\"devotional book\\" with which I can be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melted and burned my cat's fur off!!","review":"I purchased 3 collars. One was lost immediately--not shocking as that is how things go with kitty collars.However, the other two developed a horrible issue. My cats are indoor only and have never had any issue with their collars before. However, the plastic on these collars melted, burned their skin and fused with chunks of hair so that my two medium hair kitties had chunks of fur missing.It was traumatic and upsetting--you should investigate your product and why the plastic would melt on a normal indoor cat.We have since switched back to Red Dingo brand collars--which are great. Never had any issue with their plastic melting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this collar is tacky!","review":"I was very disappointed with this purchase, the collar is built with rough metal crimps that look ugly and cheap that I wouldn't want around my cat's neck.

They are hardly noticeable, by us or by the cats, as they seem to disappear in the hair. Also, when you take them off the cats, there is no tell-tale indentation in the hair, and these collars do not wear the hair away like other collars do.I am buying the new collars because of the improved breakaway feature. You just can't be too careful, even though my cats never go out of the house. I still like for them to wear their identification tags and rabies tags, just in case. These collars are more like charm bracelets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money !!!!!","review":"First of all, I expected a better story. The plot stunk. The character of Pylocke was messed up, they didn't get her character right. They didn't even get the orginal voice for Magneto, they had a different guy. Apocalypse's plan was pretty stupid, he wanted to play God - he is a jerk. Wolverine and Sabretooth's fights should have been more realistic to their character's - they locked each other in a small room to fight and when they came out, there was no scraches or blood on either of them, when really they would both be a bloody mess. The Professor is standing at the end of the episode, when he can't do that. I really can't stand this episode, it is the worst one ever made. If I were you I would go buy any other episode but this. Don't waste your money !"},{"rating":"1","title":"More bad history by a Brit","review":"This is one of the worst Napoleonic books I have ever read, chock full of meandering eye-witness accounts strung together with poor phrasing and writing. But what is the worst part of this book, and what is inexcusable, are the numerous mistakes of fact...so many of them that it is not worth the while of recounting all of them here. Simply put, if you want bad history, buy this book. If you want a decent treatment of the Battle of Nations, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The Buffalo Bills are arguably the best barbershop quartet of all time. Unfortunately, this CD does not offer much to support the above assertion. Because it is less than a half hour in length and of mediocre sound quality, \\"Barbershop Harmony Time\\" does not do justice to the impressive sounds of either the Buffalo Bills or the Chordettes. For better performances from the Buffalo Bills, you may want to consider the soundtrack from the 1962 version of \\"The Music Man\\". For better performances from the Chordettes, you should definitely check out their \\"25 All-Time Greatest Recordings\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of Two Giants in the Genre","review":"I recently discovered how much I liked barbershop music and decided to add some barbershop CD to my collection. One of the first names I had recommended to me was the Buffalo Bills. So I got this CD featuring them and The Chordettes.From what I know of barbershop, this contains several standards of the genre. Unfortunately, I didn't like the version of \\"Down by the Old Mill Stream\\" presented here.The other tracks are wonderful, however ranging from the upbeat \\"Angry\\" to the slower \\"I Believe.\\" The Buffalo Bills are joined by instruments on \\"If I could be with You One Hour Tonight\\" and \\"Fit as a Fiddle.\\" And I love their rendition of \\"As Time Goes By.\\"The other drawback to this CD is that it's only 24 minutes long. As a result, it's quite easy to wear it out after a few listens. Still, it was money well spent and a good introduction to two giants in the barbershop genre from days gone by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful to Get Right Author","review":"George Hawtin is a fairly infamous figure of the Latter Rain Revival. He was a highly controversial teacher given such strange teachings as Anglo-Israelism and other errors. This book is significant therefore when researching that movement but by no means as any source of doctrine.

It's just one more book of ideas and suggestions, foregoing the opportunity to mention standard (but rarely outlined) guidelines that can be adhered to or just to be aware of, so that if, as I do, you have some clients who are more on the traditional side, you know the rules and reasons behind what makes a stationary system a \\"system\\"; and then you can go ahead and bend the design rules with an understanding and better feel for how far you want to veer away.

The book is a poorly formatted and the content is 98% fluff.Sadly, Burgett lists Dan Poynter's SELF-PUBLISHING MANUAL in his bibliography, but does not follow any of his advice.A much better use of your money is the paperback edition of MONEY TALKS by Alan Weiss.

The author even explains at a point about how memory is stored in the blood, reminding us why it feels so natural to think like a Celt, Saxon, and so fourth. He makes VERY important points like these and backs them up with proof and fact-also a very important quality for a book to have. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for just an intro to the meaning of the runes.

The pages get busier and busier as it goes. The picture pages stop at 6 instead of going all the way to ten. On the page with six it had addition problems with cut out circles that fill a whole page the pictures are very small on the opposite page.

Now I know when she writes a 4/5 star review, it's usually bogus.)The REAL review of this novel is that it's DULL. I felt had no enthusiasm for this story. Ms. Smith wanted to tell a moving, tear-jerking love story but ended up with a silly, shallow plot (the so-called mystery of who's writing threatening letters to Vie is solved in a really dumbed-down way!) and there's a clumsy feel to its execution. There's no tension, there's no excitement. I give it 2 stars for the hero, who has some depth to him, but for the rest: the heroine; plot; supporting characters; dialog - bah humbug. After reading \\"For the First Time\\" I thought Kathryn Smith was an author to watch for, but this novel is a big step backward."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong collection of essays","review":"I've had to read a slew of leadership books for my doctorate -- as for a collection of thoughtful essays, this is one of the best. It's well organized, well laid out and has almost every major thinker represented. It's got theoretical parts, practical parts and questions for down the road. The essays span all types of learning organizations: schools, hospitals, companies, etc... It's a bit long, but if you take it piece by piece, this is a very enjoyable and informative collection. Highly recommended and well-conceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the liturgical life and unoriginal to boot","review":"This booklet's ideas for family times are quite uncreative-- things like playdoh time, drawing time, etc. are nothing parents couldn't have figured out on their own. Furthermore the ideas for making audio-tapes are only good if you are one of the few who still owns an audio-tape player. What most turned me off by the book, however, was the suggestions for teaching your kids to sit perfectly still and silently for long periods of time to prepare them for \\"church.\\" As a Lutheran, I don't believe in teaching my kids to quietly observe worship, but to actively participate in the liturgy, hymns, prayer, the Lord's Supper, etc. Whether or not they can sit still for preaching isn't the heart of the worship experience for adults or children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange,isn't it!?","review":"Now I get it,they are making DVD's version of the serie featuring different characters.Now it's Sinister's chance.I really don't like it this way,I mean,how that heck will you be able to understand the story if it doesn't follow a correst order? It would be nice if they set up the serie by Volumes,I'm lost with all this serieses,how many are there anyway?

Being a speech pathologist, it did not help my students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Much Better","review":"I wanted to like this book. The ideas are good, and the activities effective, but they're riddled with errors. An activity that asks the students to shade verbs in a chart and leave behind a number, for example, doesn't leave a number behind. A number of activities suffer from proofreading and editing problems, which a grammar book should never, ever have, rendering large portions of the book unusable. Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I use this book for teaching a remedial English class to college students and it's an excellent supplement to the course text.

I'd bought it because the other collar had rubbedand created a sore under her neck, so I was looking for a very narrow lightweight collar. However,this cord is clamped with two metal fasteners that have rough edges--plus the glued end of thecord is sharp. So I'm just throwing it out rather than chance it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best collar ever!","review":"I disagree with the other review on this. I purchased this for my cat since all the other collars were leaving huge bald spots around her neck and fraying from her scratching it. I haven't had to adjust it at all and her hair is starting to grow back in the area where the other collars rubbed!

I'm tossing them in the garbage and going back to the other kind I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a safe collar","review":"I bought one of these for my small cat. When I looked the collar over I found I was able to pull on one of the two adjustable portions and the collar tightened.

I tossed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collar","review":"This is a great little collar for a great price.

The top piece comes off a lot. The main body is two pieces that snap together, but they don't snap together tightly, a seam is still visible. Also, comes with no padding at all, we had to glue in padding ourselves, after having to reinforce all the snaptogether bits with glue and this was just for a few blocks of trick or treating.

It has 14 songs; some new, some traditional and all but one (Diez Ni?itos/10 Little Indians)originally written in Spanish. Because it was recorded in the early 60's the music and lyrics are simple, basic and not overdone or too busy for young ears. The singers, both adult and children, speak clearly. It was just what my baby (7 mo.) and I wanted to hear to reinforce her Spanish language acquisition. So many others use translated songs that are great in English but rarely work as well in Spanish. Cri-Cri is nice but not really a sing-along, more of a story telling since there's no chorus and nothing ever repeats. This CD gives us a welcome change from our Jos�� Luis Orozco and you can't beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute!","review":"This is great a home product but difficult for use in the classroom since it does not come with printed lyrics.

When this CD arrived my daughter (age 3) was so excited! She plays it in her room all the time and I can tell she is listening hard to understand the words. What better way to introduce children to a new language than music? We also bought the cdMu��vete- Learn Spanish Through Song and Movementand we all love that one as well! Again, I don't speak Spanish (yet), so this has been a fun way to integrade it into our home. We are picking up on words and phrases through the Flip Flop Spanish: Ages 3-5: Level 1 (Book + CD) method, which has also been great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Pity no lyrics though.","review":"My 10 month old son has been listening to this since the day he was born. His eyes just light up now when he hears the start of El Barco Chiquitito.

Not what I hoped for, but that's my personal taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality!!!","review":"While the songs are nice, the volume of the different voices is at all different levels. I thought it was our stereo at first, but have since tried it in the computer as well as another stereo. It's definitely a problem with the CD recording. Some of the voices are so soft you cannot tell what they are saying, which ruins the songs (as the singers are one at a time). Also, it's only 33 minutes long. Look elsewhere for a good Spanish CD for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you love old school/Sounds like its from the 50s!","review":"I have 2 year old twin boys who we are teaching both Spanish and English.I saw this CD and thought it looked great ,it includes all the classic Spanish songs.I was really excited to play it for them and then it started....my husband and I couldn't help but laugh.It sounds like its from the 50's !!Something my mom would listen to growing up in Guatemala.My kids seemed annoyed I had to stop playing it and had to request for a refund(which I didn't know if I could since it was a cd and was opened but as always Amazon was pretty amazing and offered a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"The study guide is helpful when used along with the textbook.

Having decided to leave Northern Spain Mulville sails North and by stages arrives at Gigha. Disaster strikes when the anchorage becomes untenable and Iskra is wrecked on the rocky shore. All seems lost until the resolve of crew and skipper aided by resouceful islanders saves the day, and the vessel is repaired to yet again sail the high seas. Not so much about sailing, more about the determination of individuals offering skills and aid to achieve a goal. The voyage resumes and Iskra completes her voyage 'over the top' and down the East coast. Mulville tells a super tale, and this one makes good reading. Some lessons can also be learned, as Mulville would I am sure would agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely hilarious!","review":"Another great season here.

I recommend XML By Example, far better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Helpful","review":"The book has a few good practical suggestions for XML, like \\"Now Throw the DTD Away.\\" However, the bulk of the 900 pages contain a rather roughly written overview of XML that is not helpful to the student trying to master XML for some productive use. The various programs on the included disk are likewise not very helpful, which may indicate that the main problem is with the current state of the subject matter.

This book started out with history, goals, and the future of XML that took around 50 pages. Then it proceeded with theory that did not stop until the end. For example, it does not tell you how to display an XML document until Chapter 10, and that's 200 pages of boring, useless reading. And when it tells you how to display a document, it does so only theoretically. After quitting reading the book (appx. Chapter 7), I decided to load the sample XML documents from the CD and try to understand them without the book. I was able to learn more with just trial and error in 30 minutes than I was able with this book in 150 pages.In short, if you want to learn the theory of XML you might like this book, however if you need to learn XML to actually use it, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst Technical Books I Have Read","review":"This is a really bad book, i had a presentation to make and even after reading this book for a whole week i couldnt get grasp on xml.

It's about decent people making choices, sometimes simple, sometimes complex, but in an environment of love and sustaining values. The book speaks to the heart and celebrates the goodness in people. Not that there aren't people who make bad choices, but, more often than not, the love and support of family has been missing for them.Once you read 'Uncle Sean', you will want to read 'Lance' and 'All Over Him' so I recommend buying all three books at once, and settling down to enjoy yourself.Ron Donaghe captures exactly what it meant to be growing up, discovering you are gay in a small town, but his writing speaks to all of us.Finally, write the author and let him know what you liked (or didn't) and why.

A strange \\"call\\" draws people, lemming like, to self destruction. Any technological (read \\"electrical\\") device destroys itself in a shower of sparks if operated. Pistol duels are commonplace.The story, the characters, and the writing are all excellent. Unfortunately, the book out-scopes itself, particularly towards the end.

The combination of excellent storyline and character developement is all too uncommon. What really amazed me was the way Mcmullen was able to switch from one main character to another.

However, the book wore me down over time because of two major problems which kept cropping up.1) The author is constantly 'fast-forwarding' his story with no warning what-so-ever. One minute, two characters are entering a desert to find somebody. The next, one is some kind of monk and the other is a warlord. Say what?!?!2) The coincidences are extraordinary. The characters are all doing their own things, wandering back and forth across the continent, yet every time one of them is in a city they manage to accidentally run into each other. I can't really go into the other coincidences without giving away parts of the story to those of you who want to read this.400 pages into the book, I've decided to toss it aside and forget it. I would advise you to pass on this book before you even hit page one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was I the only one thinking it difficult to read?","review":"I expected something...different that what I found. The premise alone was enought to make me by the book. I started it three times and had to almost force myself to continue. The various vignettes seemed part of the story but the action did not proceed linearally, The idea of desperately needing technology when it is not allowed sounded like a great plot yet the pace was too slow, the actions too disjointed to appreciate.Perhaps there was something else. When action occurs in the far future it is imperative that the author use discretion in establishing a whole new society with new terms, names and mores. Understanding and digesting the society was a task as big as following the story line. This idea has great potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concepts but not a story","review":"In reading this book I got the sense that the author pulled some interesting concepts out of a hat and then struggled to tie them all together. The concepts although intriguing have rather flimsy scientific basis and are not very credible. I did not find the characters very believable or appealing. They were really very cliched and two-dimensional. Even though many of the lead characters were nominally female, they were really based on male models with a gender change.

I wasn't even interested in it enough to skip to the last couple of pages to see how it ended. The characters - 5 or 6 groups of them with difficult names - did not capture my interest. The story jumps from one group to another constantly. If I were to try to read this book again, I'd have a notepad & write down the names of each group to keep them all straight. Very disappointing.

This is definitely the case, and these SAIT belts work just as well as anything else I've tried, but cost half as much. The open-coat does resist clogging (as does using a rubber belt cleaner), but eventually the abrasive wears off, and the effectiveness drops. When this happens, just throw the belt away and install a new one.

The soft and rounded fabric looked like it would be very comfortable on a cat. I ordered 3 collars but was very disappointed with them. The snap apart feature was so hard to come apart that the collar itself broke away from the snap rendering the whole thing useless. This happened on two of the three collars. The 3rd one was also hard to snap apart but at least the collar stayed connected. The metal tubes that are used to adjust the size of the collar are bulky and don't look comfortable for a cat. The collar slides very easily through them but so easily that it appears the collar would not hold its size once it was placed on the cat. Also, these metal tabs are open on the ends making it possible for your cat to catch a claw inside one of the open ends if it scratches its neck. I returned all 3 collars and would never buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"Collar was so poorly made I threw it out.

I decided to try this collar on the advice of a friend. I was so surprised! My cats don't even know they're wearing it! It looks nice (it's so narrow that sometimes you can't even see it in their fur) and it's sturdy. Two of my cats have had them for over a year and they look like brand new. I just bought one for a third cat and she doesn't even notice it! The breakaway feature works well. She snagged it on a piece of furniture and it came right off. I simply picked it up and put it right back on.

My cat flipped this collar off her neck in about 2 seconds. What you can't see is that the two silver \\"adjustors\\" are some kind of metal cylinder clamped on the edges to hold the position of the nylon cord. I found the crimped edges to be sharp! Held just so, it could give you a nasty slice on your finger. My cat kept scratching at it, and even caught her claw in the doubled up section. I had to rescue her.

What worries me is the \\"sick minds\\" that are also reading this book or other books like it. Those that sickly \\"dream\\" of such porn may be inspired to act. My copy will not be recycled to the public, but rather burned.My sympathy to the Mahaffy, French, and Homolka families.Too bad Paul & Karla couldn\\"t receive the dealth penalty.I would like Karla to know that no decent person allows such to happen. You should have contacted the police before Tammy was killed. You should have died trying to save her. You should never be allowed on the streets again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too brief","review":"Too brief. No real detail. This book did not really get into any of the details surrounding the events regarding the investigation. Just a brief overview of a very tragic case"},{"rating":"1","title":"aggravating","review":"This player does not play a dvd straight through. Every time it gets to the half way mark the picture starts to break apart and the audio does the same. I'm really disappointed with this player. Wish I had bought one locally instead of on line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"I bought this item recently.pros.Cheaper price than other players in marketCons1)Controls on player are not adequate you have to rely on remote control.2)ON/OFF switch is too delicate.3)Player doesn't look solid enough.4)I hardly got 1 hr 50 min of play time on battery charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonicare Crest i8500 intelliclean","review":"This toothbrush was recommended to both my husband and I by our dentist. We were a little reluctant about spending so much money on a toothbrush. Now that we have it we wouldn't use anything else. Every time I use it I feel like I just came from a cleaning at the dentist. It really cleans your teeth well. You still need to floss, but a difference!! Well worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"made a big hole in my teeth","review":"this item made a big hole in my teeth, then that hole turned into a cavity. I went through a lot of pain and suffering with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE","review":"Well, the title says it all. Its performance is not as good as I expected. I feel like I have to brush many times in order to feel clean. The brush is not as strong as my Oral B one. I am very very disappointed. Sonicare lets me down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sonicare Crest i8500 Power Toothbrush","review":"A product feature needed is missing. The toothbrush turns off 2 minutes after turned on, as a part of the designers idea on how to help the public brush for a certain period of time. This feature is not deselectable and is annoying to someone who brushes for longer than 2 minutes. A complaint on this feature was sent to the manufacturer and ignored, also annoying. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky Mess","review":"I've had it for a while now and I'm going back to the older model that I had before it. Because this version opens up in the front where the toothpaste goes, the water leaks into there and into the entire area where you replace the head. So all of your backwash and suds from the toothpaste goes in and causes bacteria. You have to constantly keep opening it up to clean it. You can smell it after a while and no matter how much cleaning you do, it doesn't help. I am not that lazy, I can take an extra second to put the toothpaste on my toothbrush. Trust me, you're better off. I got it when it first came out, so I didn't have the luxury of looking at the reviews. I hope this helps someone out there. I would suggest the older version, or maybe even the newer version. Any version except this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liquid toothpaste?","review":"Why do they call this liquid toothpaste? I took it literally, thinking it would shoot out as I brushed (each time I pushed the button) - they should call it automatic toothpaste dispenser. It is really just like regular gel toothpaste, but it comes up through the neck of the brush to the base of the bristles. It is nice to be able to apply fresh toothpaste half-way through brushing, w/o having to pick up a tube and do it manually, but other than that, I don't see a benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"What a treat to own! If you have a few extra coins hanging around and don't mind the price, get this! What a treat"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cleaning issue","review":"The toothbrush works fine as a toothbrush. However, toothpaste and water drip down and into the cavity where the toothpaste cartridge goes. As a result, if you don't take the toothbrush apart regularly and clean out the compartment, you get a bacteria laden stinky mess. I'm going to get the simpler version which i hope won't have this 'stinking' problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Great Performance","review":"I have been using an Oral B brush for a few years now and thought it was time to upgrade. My dental hygenist recommended this one so I decided to try it. My teeth feel a lot cleaner and are noticable whiter after only 1 week's use. The integrated toothpaste is good, but I recommend using your regular toothpaste as well (it goes a little faster than advertised.I recommend this product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mold grows inside the toothpaste dispenser","review":"I bought this thing a few months ago, it's fine, nothing special, and a little overpriced. The big problem with it (and the reason I no longer use it) is that mold and other disgusting stuff grows on the inside compartment that holds the toothpaste. That can be very disgusting. I decided I rather spend the money to buy a new power brush than keep using this thing.To be fair, I should say that if you clean the inside of the brush every day, maybe you will not have a mold problem.As a final note, I did not notice any significant improvement since I started using this thing, and my dentist did'nt either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonicare IntelliClean is great!","review":"I was leary of purchasing this toothbrush with the toothpaste installed inside, but my husband wanted a Sonicare and he didn't specify which one. It has turned out to be wonderful. His dentist recommended a Sonicare for his gums, but we were not really expecting how much whiter his teeth have become in just three weeks! I would highly recommend the IntelliClean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational","review":"Not only educational, but the kind that stays with you long after the video is finished! My three yr old reminds me of tiny details from this movie, that I did not even catch in the first viewing...Good thing there is a REVIEW at the end of the show!!!!! To remind us what we learned during the program! Amazing! Almost better than Sesame Street, except, I prefer more plush animated character puppets to the one creature, JibberBoosh, the star of the show... Perhaps, that is merely my opinion, though? The child seems to love it. That's what counts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Essence?","review":"Being a BIG Maynard Ferguson fan, from the old days of the MF Horns albums, I have to question why they chose these songs for a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection. No matter what the previous reviewer stated, Rocky and Gospel John are not included here. If they were then this might collectable. With the exceptions of Birdland and maybe MacArthur's Park most of these selections would not be considered his most popular. It would be understandable if this had been released in the mid 1970's but it came out in 1993. Believe me, Maynard has much better music than this. If you're looking for the \\"Classic\\" Maynard sound, try Chameleon. If you're looking for a great Jazz/Swing set, try These Cats can Swing. This should only be considered if you're looking for some of his lesser known works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woodstock '69 - Birth of a generation","review":"A \\"must have\\" documentation, showing the creation of the Woodstock Festival in 1969. Never before seen footage and a lot \\"behind he scene\\" -informations. Very interresting - if you are a Wood 69 - fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like bike stunts you'll love this!","review":"I liked the fact that this isn't a studio production and totally homemade on a camcorder. It' all real and nothing is faked including a couple of crashes. I would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try something else, this dog won't hunt.","review":"The book starts out nicely explaining everything and it gets you motivated. From chapter 3 onwards, 19 pages later, its all guess work. He gives pieces of information with no coherent example that shows how all these pieces fit together. Its left up to your imagination to guess how it all comes together. Once more, I had to go back to internet tutorials (which I have found to be way better than a lot of computer programming books). XML is not rocket science. If you can't write a descent book about it, you ought to think about quiting the writing profession (stick to writing code). This was a waste of my time and money; needless to say a waste of paper and ink too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine of Cliches","review":"I did not know that so many cliches existed in the English language until I read this book. Take at least the last 20 movies you've seen and every British author from the 18th and 19th centuries, and you have this author in a nutshell. Go watch an epidsode of the Godfather or the Sopranos, anything, just don't waste time or money with this ... ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing journey into the human condition.","review":"While traveling with the author through locales, both physical and metaphysical, the book overreaches in its attempts to know and celebrate the soft, vulnerable underside of the human condition. Shared experiences that might have felt authentic and profound if conveyed, perhaps, with a lighter touch straddle the maudlin; being saccharin and preachy when sweetness and insight are just out of reach. The author's conspicuous omission of any reference to his first marriage and children further undermines his credibility as a bearer of genuine soul and seeker of truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required for any Software Engineering pursuing CSDP","review":"I agree with other reviewers on editing problems. However these books (vol I and II) offer a strong support to Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) and are a required reading for those pursuing IEEE Certificate Software Development Professional (CSDP). I used it along with other materials in my preparation for CSDP exam and PASSED.Bottom line: A good compilation of software engineering readings supporting SWEBOK worthy of some room in software development professional bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"good try; not good quality recordings","review":"While these are representative vocals from Gene Autry more often than not the sound recordings from which these songs are selected and reproduced are simply not good recordings, and not simply a factor of aged originals. There are better Gene Autry recordings on the market. This was a stark disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-liked by Green Cheek Conure","review":"Harrison's is always on the avian vets' \\"short list\\" for quality pellets. Quality pellets are only beneficial though, if the bird will actually eat them. My Green Cheek Conure really likes Harrison's Pepper Lifetime Coarse. Although the pellets are larger than I would have thought he would like, he actually prefers this size, as he can hold a pellet in his foot and munch on it that way. He seems to like the spice too. Sometimes I moisten the pellets and heat for 5-10 seconds in the microwave. Just a word of advice-- the best price for this product (that I've encountered) is at [...]. (Just put all of that together.) It's not THAT much less, but depending on where you live (and shipping), you save a few dollars per bag, which adds up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"My bird wouldn't touch it","review":"In contrast to other reviews my bird (Caique parrot) will not eat this. He will however, eat \\"Harrisons Power Treats\\" instead. Perhaps he doesn't like the pepper flavor?I would recommend trying Power Treats instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christmas Short Stories Ever","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading the World's Greatest Christmas Stories by Eric Posselt. Most of the stories are European and take place during the late 1800's to the 1930's. Included in the book are short stories by famous Russian Authors that are easy to read, a little tragic but very enjoyable. The Irish ones are very witty and clever. The German stories are fun to read with descriptions of large christmas trees and parties. The majority of stories dealt with disease, warfare, poverty, bad weather and living and surviving in remote areas. The stories vividly describe life during those times (1800's-1930's)but give great encouragement through wonderful descriptions of family life and kind friends. Included were French, Polish, Croatian, Belgium, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, Dutch, Swedish, Swiss, English and American stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap on a Disc","review":"Zaiko Langa Langa is a great band but this is a terrible album. It is pieces of songs, cut into 3 minute chunks. Just as the band prepares to shift gears, the song abruptly ends and another piece of a different song starts. It's like listening to the samples on Amazon. (Do you really believe ZLL has one and a half minute songs?)Buy their classicZaire-Ghana. If you already have that then save up your money and buy one of the over-priced used copies of another album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Appealing Clydesdales","review":"I enjoyed reading this book for three basic reasons:1) It reminded me of my home & family 2) It is cast in a simplertime and place, and 3) It's a clean, moral, family read!The Clydesdale Clan makes me wish that I knew my geneology in a much deeper way. I also appreciated the fact that the book keeps in step with the times, and period to which it speaks chapter by chapter. Not to give away the end, but I truly found the last pages of the book quite different. Characterizing the various personalities throughout the novel in an unusual, but delightful way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clasp broke right away.","review":"I love how slim these collars are, but I put the collar on my cat after the clasp on the one she was wearing broke. She was sleeping on my bed when I put it on her. 10 minutes later, I noticed that the collar had come off, and lo and behold - it was because the plastic had broken. She wasn't even doing any crazy cat acrobatics.I ordered the kind that has no plastic clasp directly from the manufacturer and would give that 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"On The Road Again","review":"After the second book Kerry has decided to strike out on her own. She is still dedicated to destroying Season and one of her friends has spotted her at a ski resort. Kerry races to the confrontation while the rest of her friends also try to join in the hunt.But Kerry's life is anything but simple. Her lessons with Mother Blessing and a confrontation with Season serve to bring up more questions that can only be answered by Season. Kerry decides she needs the answers before she can finish her quest to destroy Season and avenge Daniel.Some wonderful twists in this one. More development of Kerry's friends as well. Another cliff hanger at the end (glad I already have the last book). I really can't figure out just how this is going to end but things are moving fast. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Anthro Fiction","review":"Wilson's Crazy February is perhaps the best example of anthro fiction that I've read, and gives a much clearer idea of life in Chiapas than most anthro nonfiction. Crazy February gives the reader an acute sense of what it is really like to live there. I'd also recommend Peter Matthiessen's Far Tortuga as another wonderful example."},{"rating":"1","title":"a false image of indian life","review":"i felt this book had a false image of true indian life. it gave only negative images."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairly weak introductory game to Eurogames","review":"This game is basically weak. Hoiwever, game components are well made, mapboard is beautiful and five players can play it. It's fast (75 minutes) and at the least you'll learn something about the geographic regions that Alexander travelled when going to conquer.There is strategic thinking, but not one that will overwhelm you and delay the game.The game is not particularly exciting, but this does not make it not fun to play.I recommend it if you wanna a fast gateway game to Eurogames. But in my experience it is better with the full five players."},{"rating":"2","title":"an important book for parents to discuss with their children","review":"I read this book many years ago and I still have a copy on my shelf. I think all parents who have strong feelings about nuclear disarmament should read this to their children and use it as a jumping off point to discuss nuclear weapons, war, and the impact that softspoken leaders like Mahama Ghandi and little Georgie (the book's main character) can have when our nations' leaders let fear prevail over morality. I also believe it reminds those who seek to use the flag as a symbol of blind patriotism and allegiance to American military actions that pacifists can be patriots, too. There is so much to carry away from this simple, but elegantly written book that an elementary or junior high school student can understand and appreciate... it certainly speaks to many of the issues that are being debated in the current political climate."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G...","review":"Too much technical legal mumbojumbo about corporate shells and confusing ethnic semi-criminals. If I didn't care about the Southwest setting, I never would have finished it. I do like her down-to-earth protagonist, Matty , but that's about it. I was mixed about Frieder's first book, and this was worse. Just because frider is herself an attorney doesn't mean the aveagre reader is can follow or is interested in legal details. My advice is, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"real and magical","review":"This a wonderfully imagined and wonderfully told story, full of realism and magic. Fenkl does an amazing job of interweaving korean folklore and asian cosmology with the story of his (semi?)fictional counterpart. For those interested in the lives of mixed-race children and for those interested in the form of the bildungsroman and the memoir, this is a MUST. Those who know korean and chinese are in for a special polyglot treat in the hidden structure of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I found this book boring, dull, and self-indulgent. Fenkl has little adeptness at narrative or storytelling, and instead relies on shop-worn semi-autobiographical memoir-ish techniques. But really, who cares about this kid, the protagonist? Not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't worth the wait","review":"Madonna's latest does not stand up against her previous releases. Music is by far the best song on the entire CD.
