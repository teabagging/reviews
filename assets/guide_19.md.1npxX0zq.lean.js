As with all of the Bond films there are some redeeming qualities, such as: the opening sequence where the space shuttle is hijaked, the boat scene in which Q supplies Bond with a high powered and lethal boat, and the scenery in and around Rio De Janero. Unfortunately this is not Roger Moore's best performance as Bond, the film really suffers from a lack of energy in many of the scenes, Roger Moore is my favorite of the Bond's but in this one he appears to be on cruise control. Though this film did well at the box office, I would rate it in the lower echelon of the series. The outlandish story and action sequences in the end of the film were addressed in the follow up to this movie \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" which I consider to be one of the very best of the series, where the film was committed to credibility and more down to earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bond Falters...","review":"Corniness and Sci-fi battles are included in this entry into the Bond series. Roger Moore comes back as James Bond, 007, and he must pursue the head of a computer company named Drax. He has a boring name and does manage to be boring throughout the movie, absolutely listless until the moment he dies. Jaws is back, which can be seen as bad or good. The villain, who seemed so original and cool in Spy Who Loved Me, is merely a distraction here, he is only in a few scenes and none are memorable. Plenty of gadgets and special effects, though, which keep this from having no redeemable value. There was little here to keep me watching, except I noticed the door tone on the apartment is the same as in Close Encounters. Really, if you are a Bond fan, do not buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst Bond film","review":"There is no element in this film that establishes the character Ian Flemming created.

She played a CIA agent if the CIA was ruled by Forrest Gump or Rain Man.4- Rio de Janeiro as it appears on this movie is not the REAL Rio de Janeiro. It was an example of poor research, like Santos Dumont Airport named San Pedro Airport(???).5- Bond producers did the impossible: turned Hugo Drax, one of the most Fleming's interesting villains into one of the worst of the Bond series.

I am surprised they even call this cheesy flick a Bond film. Here is some reasons why I didn't like this film:The movie dragged on and on, espically when Bond was in space.The villain had no reason what-so-ever to do what he was doing, so the plot falls flat.Any shot at subtle humor Moonraker has is pathetic.So if you like Bond, I suggest skip Moonraker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gadget-heavy, low-water mark for Roger Moore","review":"The year was 1979 and America had rediscovered its fascination with laser guns and space battles, courtesy of \\"Star Wars\\" a couple of years earlier. This movie is clearly intended to ride that wave.This movie relies too much on its visual effects and gadgets and is missing the intrigue and intelligence that marks the better Bond pictures. This movie also takes the prize for most egregious product placements.

If you are looking to buy just a few of the 007 movies, try For Your Eyes Only or Octopussy. Moonraker turns stupid when it goes to outerspace. The effects are pitiful, especially the firing of laser weapons. Considering that this movie was made after Star Wars, it is amazing that the effects are so shoddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muckraker!","review":"This by far has to be Roger Moore's worst James Bond film. Obviously released at the height of the Star Wars craze, this movie is just plain sad. The special effects are laughable and the love scene between Jaws and the girl who looks like the Swiss Miss, is just so incredibly stupid that it's just embarrassing to watch. This is probably the worst adaption from Ian Flemings original novels since \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\". If you want to see a decent Bond film with Roger Moore in it buy \\"Live and Let Die\\" or \\"The Man with the Golden Gun\\". Avoid this waste of celluloid like the plague. It's a shame they didn't wait 'til now to do \\"Moonraker'. With all the new advances in technology and special effects, they could probably do a smashing film. Unfortunately, we're stuck with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Plain Corny","review":"If \\"A View to a Kill\\" is consider the worst Bond film, this turkey call \\"Moonraker\\" has to be viewed as the silliest Bond film of all times. James Bond in Space? Why oh why?The movie is filled with problems. Roger Moore sleepwalks his way in his performance. Lois Chiles (Dr. Holly Goodhead) is one of the dullest Bond girls of all times. Michael Lonsdale (Drax) is a brilliant actor, but in this movie he appears bored. The storyline of Richard Kiel (Jaws) finding a girlfriend was so corny I could not believe it. And the space fight scene at the end was hilarious in the worst way. Despite this, this movie was a HUGE success (thanks to the return of the character Jaws and the success of Star Wars, which this film ripped off) and is considered the quintessential Bond film. However, most hardcore Bond fans (like myself) consider this film a joke, especially with Bond and Goodhead making love mid-air in space. Yes, its that silly. Watch for a good laugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond Meets Sci-FI","review":"Moonraker, the 11th James Bond adventure is truly under rated but one of the best. This time Bond (played by Roger Moore) is up against Hugo Drax, a mad man obsessed with the conquest of space. Bond travels from Venice Italy, to South America and even to space to stop Drax from distroying the human race and replacing it with his own perfect specimens. Also Jaws, an 8 foot tall giant, is Drax's new henchman. Only problem is he isn't in it enough. This was also the last Bond movie with the original M. This Bond film might have been the most under rated of all 19 films, but it's still one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This knife has been more than handy since the day I received it.

It is about a vicious form of non-consentual sado-masochism. The books consists primarily of a tedious series of brutal beatings and humiliations. If this is the kind of thing you enjoy reading I suggest the Marquis de Sade, his prose are more lyrical, and his accounts challenge the status quo.In \\"From Pimp Stick to Pulpit\\" there is scant attention paid to the subject's conversion and no reference to a pulpit, or to the consequences of his actions prior to, or after, his acceptance of Christ. The book does communicate well the human side of each of the characters, but in the balance all are found wanting.The book characterizes the mack life as one of glamourless, degenerative moral and intellectual decay - and I don't mean that in the good way!

He then finds god and gives it all up while smoking PCP and having a \\"vision.\\" I don't think it was god, it was more the sherm he was smoking that was messing with his mind and made him think it was god.

Such campy elements as Dr. No's secret island stronghold are gone, and director Terence Young presents a gritty spy drama that one could imagine happening in the real world. For better or worse, the more cartoonish Bond would win out. Robert Shaw and Lotte Lenya make memorable Bond villains, but Bianchi is not very impressive as the second Bond girl, especially coming on the heels of Ursula Andress.

The romance plot is laughable and badly acted, Connery and Bianchi don't even have any chemistry. A ton of scenes in the film don't make any sense either--- the gypsy camp sequence for instance. It has NOTHING to do with the plot, yet a good deal of the film is spent here. It's almost as if the filmakers had 2 scripts, couldn't decide between the two, and just used them both, resulting in one huge convoluted mess.

It has a down-to-Earth plot that turns into a Cold War thriller that resembles the 007 stories that Ian Fleming narrates in his books. Even though the gadgets begin in this movie, Bond's multi-purpose briefcase is believable, unlike most of the gadgets from the Moore era, and only adds to the classic feel that this film carries. Lastly, Robert Shaw fights Bond in one of cinema's most memorable fight scenes, and is a fearful and dangerous villain: cunning, lethal and cold.I strongly suggest that you watch this movie, and if you are a Bond film collector, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"james bond at his best...","review":"love this movie, i believe one of the best, or the best james bond movie ever, and Sean connery did it naturally. thank you Amazon.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD case","review":"From Russia with love was a gift for my dad and when it got here I was expecting a standard, centimeter thick DVD case.

I recommend that Soulmate be viewed not only by singles, but by churches across the country so that spiritual leadership can get a clearer picture of the challenges single Christian women face on a daily basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy used","review":"Don't buy this used. Neither of my dvd's could play it because of the scratches. I was very disapointed that I had to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This movie wasn't at all what I expected. It's more of a documentary, not a movie with a story line. It was about a study of single christian women and each one of them discussing their problems and/or joys of being single and trying to live a christian life. It was a group discussion, sort of like a therapy session. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old stuff","review":"This documentary is for single older ladies only. Not very interesting...it just stated the obvious. With the exception of the author, she gave really good advice. I am married but I have had this same conversation with every single woman I know. Everybody knows if you play around in your 20s: dating jerks, being selfish, spend most of your time career chasing or basically not taking yourself serious there is a good chance that you will be single in your 30s and 40s+. I do think it is absolutely heartbreaking and truly unfair that sometimes black woman have to pick between being highly educated/independent/successful or finding a man. But unfortunately that's just the world we live in. Maybe one day that will change for our daughters. In summary I think there are good black man, you just have to know when to \\"hold them & when to fold them\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!","review":"I received this dvd today and had been very excited about watching it.

SoulMate provides an honest look at being single and Christian. I appreciated the variety of topics covered and the mixture of expert opinion and thought.

It just helped confirm my choice of living the best and greatest life possible. Some things that I want to happen, such as marriage and a family might not happen. So what do I do?

The rest is well below MAriliion's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pains of replacing Fish with Steve Hogarth","review":"Marillion albums are fun to listen to. They're alternately moving and rocking. That said, Holidays is probably the least consistantly satisfying of their records. A bit poppy for Marillion, my guess is that the group and Steve Hogarth were feeling each other out. Thankfully, the process went extremely well and we ended up with several stellar albums since Holidays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lusitania: Dense and Plodding","review":"Author David Ramsay's account of the sinking of The Lusitania is one of a glut of maritime disaster books to appear in recent years (and, indeed, was released almost simulateously with Diana Preston's book on this particular disaster). Obviously, this is a hot publishing trend. Alas, it is also one that could stand better editing. Ramsay gamely provides the full sweep of The Lusitania tragedy, including detailed accounts of the political intrigue that surrounded it. Unfortunately, his prose is so, uh, lifeless, that the book is barely readable. Ramsay's approach might be fine for historians, but readers who are looking for the kind of lively narrative history that has become so popular recently should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kites Are Fun...","review":"Picture a weird commercial from 1967 - the men wearing turtleneck sweaters, the women with long blonde hair. Perhaps the ad is set in a ski lodge. The sun is impossibly bright, the music impossibly sweat and pure. Around the fire, their eyes would glow as they smiled with perfect teeth. This is a memory that is on the verge of disappearing - or perhaps, for you, it's what Clark Ashton Smith called \\"the nostalgia of the unknown.\\"The Free Design opens the gates into this long-ago time - now as dead to us as ancient Rome. Will you go there and greet the men and women at that ski lodge? Why not? It's the perfect soundtrack to a half-remembered dream, or an evocation for a vanished world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"There's a very good reason that The Free Design never hit the big time.

I felt like I wasted time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great instrumentals","review":"what i like about it is that its all instrumentals, it has an older hip hop feel to it. only two tracks have lyrics on them and the instrumental only version is included as well. im very satisfied with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, should last a while, too","review":"I was a bit bummed that there's not only peppermint oil, but I think that's what they have to do to make a solid bar. Seller was great, and product smells truly amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I checked this book out of the library based on the promise of the first sentence, in a Chapter entitled \\"The Virgin\\": \\"It is one of the wonders of the twenty-first century that a beautiful, brilliant and broad-shouldered man could reach almost forty without someone, somewhere convincing him it was time to drop his guard -- or his underpants.\\" Shades of Jane Austen, I thought, could be amusing. Unfortunately, not very amusing after all. The narrator cutely names all her lovers, The Virgin, The Schoolmaster, The Lawyer, The Lover, The Lord, The Billionaire, The Actor... and recounts in excruciating detail her pathetic encounters. Seems to be a thinly-fictionalized memoir, and really, who cares? The only ones who were any good were quickly dropped, and she unaccountably and boringly chases after the cads. Waste of time, and waste of a good premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were the publishers thinking?","review":"In assessing this book as chick-lit? It's really a very well defined genre right now, and just because the protagonist sleeps with ten men, doesn't make it chick-lit. The novel is dark and dreary (really); the main protagonist comes across not as courageous but as immesurably whiny.I'm surprised at the reviews and reviewers also, one of whom dubbed this a true successor to Bridget Jones--there is no way Gray can measure up to Fielding's witty style.The book has very few redeeming features. The writing is leaden, weighs you down (where was her editor?) and add to that the darkness of the book, it's suffocating.There's a blurb at the back from some Suzanne Finnamore who felt \\"inadequate as a writer more than once\\" upon reading this book. Well. All I can say is if THIS book makes you feel inadequate, perhaps you shouldn't quit your day job."},{"rating":"2","title":"'98's Most Overlooked Masterpiece","review":"Hailing from Cannes with a Best Screenplay Award, this film packs a triple dose of excellence in storytelling, emotion, and performance. Certain moments are explicit, but interesting and necessary nonetheless. Often, such examples contribute to Hal Hartley's more self-conscious stylizations with dialog and camera. Produced for around $1mil, writer-director H.H.'s budgetary restrictions have bred fantastic alternatives to technological chicanery and lavish production overkill. His economy is powerful. Very, having much in common with Danny Boyle's use of Victorian stage tricks in lieu of visual effects in TRAINSPOTTING. HENRY FOOL'S subject matter and narrative pacing are quite different from TRAINSPOTTING, but the film's common success is the postmodern mythification of current day losers. Both serve societal underlings-- in class and lifestyle-- with masterful literary treatment on the screen. Quite possibly, the very best film of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"If you are a person who likes idealized, Hollywood -style representations of what life should be like, then this is not the movie for you. But for those of us who relish the contradictions present in human character, who can find beauty and comedy in the profane, and who see beyond the dichotomy of \\"good\\" and \\"bad/evil\\", Henry Fool provides a gripping, funny, and inspiring portrait of \\"real\\" people, with all of their complexity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can You See Beauty in Ugliness! (Lou Reed/Andy Warhol)","review":"Hal Hartley is annoying as a director. Fed on the cotton candy of Hollywood conventional narrative we initially recoil from his parody of the mentor/author relationship. It is overlong, built around a series of anti-climaxes, and is sometimes didactic. Nevertheless, it is engaging. At the center of this engagement lies scenes where serious emotional trauma tangles with the idiotic, surreal or profane. This erupts into a humour as black as anything in Jim Jarmusch's \\"Dead Man\\", and while it cannot carry the whole film it does help endear it to us. By the end of the two hours plus you are left tested and ehausted, but with an odd sense of catharsis, and cannot help but wonder: 'what was that beauty amongst all that ugliness?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it","review":"To be fair, I may give this another shot. But, for now, I had to hit eject after about 30 minutes. Wasn't happening for me. Neither funny, nor interesting. The main character, Simon, a sad-sack mechanic who is a fledgling writer, wears the same blank expression in every scene, so I never became interested. His mentor, Henry Fool, is nearly as expressionless. Maybe this goes somewhere eventually. But I shouldn't have to endure so much to find out. Neither should you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing comedic in this movie!","review":"This is advertisd on the jacket as a \\"hilarious comedy.\\" I kept waiting and waiting for anything that was even remotely funny. This is a grossly sad movie with absolutely no plot: a con man, a young man who gets beat up consistently, a promiscuous young girl is sleeps with Henry Fool, who also sleep with her mother. Everybody in the family watches each other have sex. The back jacket advertises the movies as a \\"Faustian black comedy that will have you screaming with laughter with the mix of vulgarity, humor, and deeply felt emotion.\\" There certainly was vulgar, but not the funny type, unless one finds a man excreting diahrrea for 2-3 minutes will all the sound effects funny. At that point, which was 80% through the movie, I turned it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost a great film","review":"It is almost a great film. Watching the last half of this movie, I felt like a was watching a totally different movie. The beginning is brilliant,funny, insightful and poetic. The beginning makes the movie great. The last part of the movie is darker, depressing and hard to watch, ruining an otherwise good movie. most of the movie centers the Simon character and his writing and his raise to fame, with Henry Fool offering little bits of literary insights. For some reason, Henry is the main character and Simon isn't. The first part of the movie (the good half) focuses on Simon. It fails when, at the end, it focuses on Henry Fool and Simon almosts disappears. Maybe, it was the actor's performance or screen presence, but Henry Fool was not a great character. And watching the film, I didn't think he was the main character. The movie should be retitled with the ending changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried","review":"As a big Hartley fan, I tried hard to like this, but after about an hour, I just couldn't continue. Unlike some of his other films, which are slightly excruciating in their pace but won't let you turn away, at some point, I just stopped caring about this one, and decided to give it fast forward help. There were no great insights though, or descriptive genius. It was just too long, and not as creative."},{"rating":"2","title":"a total and pleasant surprise.","review":"i purchased this movie because i knew a hal hartley many years ago.i not only learned that it was not the same man but that this hal hartley directed one of the best movies i have seen in the last seventy-six years. i am pleased that i own it and i will share it with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, kept my attention all the way through.","review":"Once again Hal Hartley has a very entertaining movie with interesting characters. I think his characters are the strongest parts of his stories. I did like Fay Grimm a little better. I expands on the Henry Fool character even more, even though he appears in the film less. But you really need to see this one first. P.S. I love Parker Posey!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Bad","review":"Like many others, I rented this movie because of Parker Posey who I loved in Waiting for Guffman, Clockwatchers and The House of Yes. Unfortunately, the character she plays in this film was pretty flat and uninteresting. I really didn't care what happened to anyone in the film. It was slow, long and some scenes just plain made me sick and I had to turn away. I fell asleep near the end (that's how thrilling it was), and I never do that. The whole storyline was unengaging and the dialogue was very tiresome and repetitive. This film lacked everything: a well written story, detailed character development and any semblance of purpose or direction. It relied on cheap meaningless scenes with vomit, diarrhea, sex, violence etc. Not all independent films are worth raving about."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Henry Fool\\" was so bad, I had to stop the VCR.","review":"I found Thomas Jay Ryan's performance, as Henry Fool, dull, overacted, and pretentious. Urbaniak was somewhat better. Parker Posey as the promiscuous sister, was one dimensional at best. The storyline was good, but the actors just didn't make the cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Line Review","review":"I know people think that Hal Hartley craps gold, but after 2 and half hours of boring, I'd have to disagree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Off Interesting","review":"I thought that the idea of \\"Henry Fool\\" was interesting. A garbageman, encouraged by Henry Fool, a mysterious stranger, writes his heart out into controversial poetry. We never ever get to read this poetry, making it all the more intriguing.However, I did not find this film enjoyable. One fundamental reason for this was that Simon was the only character we could remotely care about. I found Henry's pretensions annoying. We learn that he served time for statutory rape, but this has no relevance within the film and is useless information. Another reason I didn't like the film was that it was boring and ran too long. And I loved \\"Magnolia.\\" Yet another reason for me not liking the film was the scene where Henry has diarrhea, complete with gross sound effects. This totally took me out of a film I was not that involved in in the first place. \\"Henry Fool\\" is a morose, lifeless film that seems longer than 137 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more further step in the decline of a great film-maker.","review":"\\"Henry Fool\\" is, judged by the inevitable standard set by Hartley's impeccable first four films (\\"The Unbelievable Truth\\", \\"Trust\\", \\"Surviving Desire\\", and \\"Simple Men\\"), an ineffable abomination. For those of us genuinely exalted by his work prior to \\"Amateur,\\" Hartley's once uniquely promising creative trajectory seems to have dipped headlong into a sort of decadence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"Any person finding deeper meanings in this movie is just an unintelligent person \\"fooled\\" into thinking that they understand things, because sometimes it's cool to pretend to like indie movies, even though many of them are just plain c**p. This movie has no deeper meanings, and its only redeeming quality was the vomit scene. I don't even like toilet humor, but that was the only time I had any interest in watching this movie. After 30 minutes, I turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self absorbed, overacted, pseudo artistic drivel","review":"This movie is totally unbearable to watch.

Skipping over the most basic elements of photography, he provides practical advice on technique and creative vision. He isn't shy about using digital processes to enhance images -- not adding or subtracting visual elements, but manipulating the image so that it represents what the photographer saw, overcoming the limitations of film and photo paper.Highly recommended.

By far, the tracks which featured Paul Di'anno were my favorites. Soon after, I purchased all the Iron Maiden cds.I've not purchased many other albums that featured Paul Di'anno, but I got this one, and I regret it. This album is funny, in a weird masochistic way. When I listen to this cd, all that comes into my head is \\"Will make music for food!\\". There is some real terrible cover songs, some AOR sounding songs, generic ballady type stuff, and the 92837982 rehash of iron maiden tracks which Paul seems to like to put onto every cd he releases. From what I gather from reading his book, \\"The Beast\\", he was most likely drunk or high on cocaine while recording these.

As the director of the movie, I suppose that he has that right, but it is a shame. Other reviewers ask you to wait for a re-release. There will most likely be none, so don't let Lynch's decision dissuade you, particularly since the transfer and sound are wonderful and the few extras that are provided are equally so.

There is one scene in particular, that SHOULD change your thinking forever. And without ruining the scene for you, I'll tell you what it produces, an appreciation for a man who experienced pain upon mistreatment upon despisement, AND, when finally treated with human dignity, showed utter amazement and gratitude with tears and humility.

He was very close to his real mother, though. He was not able to hold obtain a job because of his appearance, and people thought he was stupid because of the way he looked.

Some people may like her rather \\"unique\\" sound. I find it overly forced, and I feel that she misses nuance in everything she plays.

One of his first film breakaway roles from Jack Tripper, his true talent is very visible in this picture. It is a sad task to write this review, being that Mr. Ritter is no longer with us. But his legacy of comedy, and drama, will be a memorial of the talent he had. If you want a feel good movie filled with a sense of hope, and an ultimate happy ending, this is the film for you, if you just love John Ritter this is the film for you. 5 stars my seem too much to some people, but for the comedy, charisma, and color it contains, this movie deserves it! Watch it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent memories from this film","review":"This is a true \\"feel good\\" film. I remember watching it many times as a child. The message was moral and the story of \\"real guy turning hero\\" never dies out. The fact it is John Ritter in his prime just adds to the draw. In addition, Anne Archer puts in a strong and lovable performance as the love interest.Don't miss this film. For kids though, the violence and mild language could be tough. I suggest 9 or older (if I remember the language issues correctly). Best to pre-screen before showing it to the children."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"This is a really good movie. John Ritter is charming, Anne Archer is sexy and the story is really heartwarming. I don't know how this movie did in theatres, but it deserves to be discovered all over again. I see it as an oft-overlooked film with a big heart. Too bad the DVD has no extras other than the trailer. You can't help but root for John Ritter's character and the ending is a good one. See it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Ritter's Best Role","review":"One thing I hated about \\"Three's Company\\", was Jack Tripper being a wimp. He claimed to take karate lessons, in the Navy, but was beat up very easily (especially by women). This role shows how a \\"Jack Tripper\\", would fight for real.Granted, John Ritter pulls some non-Tripper acting, but you can see some character in Steve Nichols. I was seven, when I saw the film. I begged my folks to see it, because of John Ritter and a superhero movie. While a little disappointed the character was an actor, and not a real superhero, John Ritter was still great. The best part of the film is a spoiler. If you don't want to know it, stop reading now.Before Steve Nichols gives up the superhero role, he saves people from a burning building. He leaps down on the roof and goes inside. He saves the people and walks off with Anne Archer. A perfect ending, to a \\"realistic\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Formula but inventive concept.","review":"Do you really think the guy won't get the girl in the end? If you don't, you haven't seen too many main stream movies. John Ritter has always been likeable. This film was made during \\"Three's Company\\", and just like his Jack Tripper, his character is capable of being corruptable but finds its way back to morality. Rightfully, this film did not win any oscars but humbly tried to entertain. What can I say, a good rent, enjoyable to own and if it is any indication of its cuteness, Kinsley liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirkie","review":"I saw this movie years ago.

It was made for tv ...so what do you want? John Ritter is delightfully sappy as the hopefull Hero who believes that good always triumphs over evil.Anne Archer is enticing as the neighbor not even the good guy can resist. The movie revels in its simplicity but manages some scenes that are close to movie classics. There is even a scene that no matter how many times I see it still makes me tear up, and as a 55 year old male the only thing that brings me to tears these days is politics. Its fun, start the popcorn and order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be a Hero","review":"Fun story about an actor who is promoting a new superhero movie.

Obviously the albums with Ozzy are classics, but I also like the ones with Dio and Tony Martin too. On paper Born Again looks great but after repeated listenings I come away feeling like this material is mostly fourth class. Ian Gillan and Black Sabbath are just not a good match and songs like Digital Bitch should be left to laughable hair bands like Winger or Warrant. That tune is just not worthy of the Sabbath name. I know alot of fans like this album but I am one who just can't seem to find much to recommend. It doesn't help matters that the production is the weakest of any Sabbath album. Basically if you are new to the Black Sabbath catalogue I would avoid it. I keep it just to keep my collection complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"sabbath's least appreciated","review":"well, let's start by saying that Sabbath never had and will never have anything as powerful on vocals as Ian Gillan. So why did this album fail? Very simple: because Gillan and Iommi are two different schools. When you combine Deep Purple with Black Sabbath, chances are that the result will be more of a confusion than success.While Gillan's voice is unmatched, this is certainly the most un-Sabbath record. Hell, it's even odd listening to Gillan screaming about witches and satans. I guess, a perfect lineup may not necessarily imply a perfect record."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defaced cover artwork and misleading advertising","review":"Like all Black Sabbath and Uriah Heep remasters released by Castle between 1996 and 1998, this 1983 masterpiece featured a sticker on the front which stated \\"faithfully restored artwork\\". Unfortunately, the cover artwork on these releases was in most cases very badly reproduced, with grainy printing and wrong colors. In \\"Born Again\\", the purpleish background was printed as a far lighter shade of blue, completely different to the original LP artwork. I've always considered the cover artwork as much a part of an album as its musical content, so I can only rate this release as an unacceptable insult to the band and their fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars? You must be joking!","review":"Yeah, I love Sabbath, and also listened to their albums with great will to like them, even when theyre nothing more than \\"Tony Iommi Project\\".To rate BORN AGAIN as a five or four stars album must be a joke. The album has the dubious merit of possessing one of the worst album covers ever, and also the worst production for a Black Sabbath album. It's muddy, plain and simple. It has only seven songs, and I agree that they are heavy as hell, really, really dark.TRASHED opens it with a bang, and I just love the song. Gillan is singing all the album with the top of his lungs, his voice sounding strong and clear. But the songs simply don't take off. Sometimes they are painfully dragged (\\"Zero The Hero\\", \\"Disturbing The Priest\\") sometimes downward silly (\\"Hot Line\\", \\"Digital Bitch\\") Given a better production, this album had potential. The way it came out, it's just a black mark in Sabbath's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST NON-OZZY ALBUM1","review":"Okay, all of the Dio-phyles can kill me, but for those of us who loved the power sludge Ozzy days, this album comes the closest to reliving that magic. \\"Zero The Hero\\" is without a doubt the best non-Ozzy Black Sabbath song, and a few others (\\"Born Again\\", \\"Disturbing The Priest\\") are damn close. It's the last album that Bill, Geezer, and Tony all did together, and after this they fluxuated from totally sucking to only being okay, so it has historical significance too. It isn't their best album, or even a completely solid album, but it's good old fashion METAL, and that's something that we all need every once in a while. And if it sways you any, this was one of Kurt Cobain's favorite albums as a teenager. No joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG STEP","review":"A lot of people below don't know what they are talkingabout. Iommi and GIllan own opinion is that this album [is no good]! Look at the cover art ! THen look the mixing which is horrible, the sounds are all together, with Gillan's voice well below. It is a record below Sabbath's standard, an album to be forgotten forever, with the exception of \\"Trashed\\", an astonishing gripping tune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gillian + Sabbath = Unsuccessful Results","review":"What a mess ! This thing sounds like it was tossed together in a day ! Horrendous sound, dumb lyrics (example: \\"The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away/We're disturbing the priest, come to our feast\\" can we say Kindergarden). Gillian's voice sounds shot,Ward is just too messed up to play anymore by this point,Butler can't be heard amongst the murky production, even the glorious riffmeister Iommi god can't pull this one out of banality. Reportedly this union was put together by management and lawyers. The result is something that is hard to believe it could have been created by such legendary musicians. No small wonder this Sabb was short lived and the original vinyl was headed straight to the cutout bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The end of Black Sabbath","review":"This album started the decline of Black Sabbath. Ronnie James Dio started a classic, but short-lived era, for the band after Ozzy. However, the era of vocal musical chairs began with Ian Gillan and this album.

Better yet, start with, Reunion; work your way from there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"Maybe it is the import release I received, but the mix on this album is horrible. The bass is way too prominent and the vocals sound like they are recorded in a can somewhere far far away.The mix does seem to get better on Zero the Hero and the songs after it, but the first 1/2 of the album is a muddy mess.As for the music itself. It doesn't really sound like Sabbath. It sounds more like someone trying to sound like Sabbath. Gillan's voice just doesn't go well with the Sabbath sound. The guitar work is good, the bass and drums are somewhat pedestrian. Just missing something.If you are a Sabbath fan and need to complete your collection by purchasing this album then I suppose it is worth it. However if you are looking for a good Sabbath album look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't real sabbath","review":"There are only 2 good songs on this album.

Born Again with Ian Gillan is no exception. The music itself is phenomenal Iommi and Butler never disappoint it's probably their heaviest record since Master of Reality. Gillan does a fine job on this release although the lyrics could have been better. My real complaint is with the constant screaming someone had to be grabbing his balls while he was recording his tracks. It's just waaaay over done and in some songs completely unnecessary...Gillan's tracks need to be edited. When his balls are not in a vice he sounds good over the music. I bought this on vinyl as a kid back when Maiden and Priest were both utilizing the operatic scream and they sounded great but in this case, it does not. Born Again is a terrific album if you could get past the screaming. It's a must have for any Sabbath Fan. Btw, I don't know why so many people dislike the album cover I think it's one of their best...it's pure evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"eh...","review":"here goes dio, his dragons, demons kings and queens; enter Ian Gillan and the result is a more \\"down to earth\\" Black Sabbath. topics on that album are thus, more varied: booze, women, satanism, fantasy, women again, social outcasts,... it's like Sabbath doesnt know anymore what audiences they're addressing. fortunately, the \\"sandwiches\\" they serve us on this album are brilliantly done, which saves the band's credibility: you'll be glad the awesome riffs are still there, while the sound is even heavier than before.musically, this album is closer to the Ozzy era than Dio's and since i find ozzy's voice better than gillan's... 3.5 stars and a worthy sabbath recording. you'll know where to start now: not here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purple + Black","review":"Delectable disappointment.

Die Hard sabbath fans may not like this because Ian Gillan from Deep Purple sings it, but if you just listen to it for the music, I think you'll enjoy it. My favourites are Trashed, Disturbing the priest, Zero the Hero, and the title track. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of a few weak tracks at the end, Digital Bitch, Hot line, and Keep it warm. All in all, though, an album well worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy production...","review":"Whatever merits this album has, they were buried in the absolutely obnoxious production, the worst of Black Sabbath career.For those who say this is great, I must remind you that Iommi himself confessed that this would be a new project, and not a Sabbath album, but the record company did not aloud it.Also, it marked the beginning of the chair dancing that Sabbath would become, when led exclusively by Iommi.As for the songs, TRASHED is by far the best. IT's like a thunder on the roll, strong, powerful, like a snowball going downhill and sweapting everything aside!! BORN AGAIN is also very good.The trouble, I repeat, is the production. no more comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"...really dig this album.","review":"I certainly fall among the fans who really dig this album. It may be my favorite Sabbath album spanning 1970 thru 1996. As for the deluxe edition I have no input, considering I own this on cassette, but I do feel that this is one of the more creative Sabbath albums and that includes the album cover which I think is great. What I appreciate about this album is it's not an attempt to recreate old Sabbath sounds. It is, in fact, forward movement from a band that had been struggling for years to find stability. I think it's cool - forward movement that is. To cling to the past is destructive and eliminates the possibility of discovering new talents. Perhaps this is why I appreciate all Sabbath albums. Here's to looking forward instead of backward. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital snitch","review":"Fantastic album, one of my all time favs, the bonus disk is great, sound quality not the best, but hey, you can't win em all, overall a great addition to the collection !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money....","review":"This \\"deluxe\\" edition sucks. I ordered it up from Amazon and while waiting for it to come in the mail, sold my old copy back to a local shop. Boy was that a mistake. The sound quality on this is horrible -- quiet and muffled. This is really false advertising at its finest. Many great classic albums are being remastered and expanded by major labels and called \\"deluxe edition.\\" This is not one of them. It looks like the same style packaging as the other major labels, but it's not the same quality or intent. Some of these Sabbath expanded editions are just a money making scheme. You want the bonus disc, so you shell out the bucks. I just don't understand what source they used for the main album material because it really does sound like crap. My old version sounded way louder, more vibrant and alive. The packaging is just stupid. It looks like the \\"real\\" deluxe editions you see, but instead of a plastic outer sleeve, it is just a sticker they applied to the digi pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated, but worth a try","review":"If you're part of the \\"Ozzy is Sabbath, period\\" crowd, skip this one. Ian Gillan claims to have been \\"the worst vocalist Sabbath ever had\\" but it is an interesting and enjoyable mix of the talents of both parties.

What I remember when I played the vinyl in 1983 was a sonic mudslide pouring out of my speakers. Beyond that, I thought the combination of Sabbath's predilection for doom and gloom and Ian Gillan's cleverly twisted musings was the ultimate odd couple. Listening to it (yes, the vinyl edition) decades later hasn't changed my opinion of the music, and I doubt even a perfect remastering job could fix the inherent flaws in this short and wisely forgotten marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work.","review":"I like nearly every Sabbath and Purple album. This is the exception. Gillan combined with Iommi is not Black Sabbath, it's not Deep Purple and it's not \\"Deep Sabbath\\" but something different. Maybe the problem is that the Sabbath and the Purple sound is burned into my brain and listening to the voice of Gillan and the guitar of Iommi without really \\"feeling\\" the sound of one of the two bands makes me sick. Maybe I would regard this album as great if I never had listened to the two bands before. But is this actually realistic for any hard rock/metal fan on this planet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sabbath \\"parody\\" at best","review":"This does contain a couple of good songs, but really people a 4 star average? First of all, remaster or not the production is completely TERRIBLE considering how fantastic Mob Rules sounded. Zero the Hero is about the only song I \\"return\\" for, it does have a nice groove, and going years without hearing this disc doesn't bother me. I return every 3 or so years hoping THIS is the year where I get a lot out of it, but sadly it isn't. My love for Tony is the only reason I persevere. The biggest thing holding this disc back is the fact that Ian simply doesn't fit. The lyrics are so blatantly written by someone who doesn't understand this sort of music and his sound just doesn't mesh with the music. Ironic to think at this very moment in 1983, RJD is conjuring up one of the greatest cd's of the era in Holy Diver, make that ANY era:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most maligned Sabbath album!","review":"This has to be the most misunderstood and maligned of all Black Sabbath's albums. First, Ozzy Osboune is not on vocals and this for many fans is enough to label it as bad. Second, the corny cover. Third, Ian Gillan's vocals are an aquired taste to say the least. But if one puts prejudice aside one will hear a good solid metal album that delivers on every level. Great songs, great performances and the trademark Sabbath sound. There is one flaw- the mix. The sound on the album is rather muddled and the drums can hardly be heard. Even on the remasterd edition, this characteristic remains. In spite of that I still recommend it as a view of Black Sabbath's history. High points include the fast paced \\"Thrashed\\" and \\"Zero the Hero\\" with a before-its-time industrial feel. The title track as well is quite haunting, with Ian Gillan's vocals a standout."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different sound","review":"BORN AGAIN: Black Sabbath's second comeback album produces a newer sound that is not so easy to listen to. Gillan's vocals are embarrassingly high at times and his lyrics seem to run together with the music so that we cannot really make out what he's saying.The good things about this album is the outstanding STONEHENGE track and DISTURBING THE PRIEST. ZERO THE HERO has a dark lurking sound to it. The band sounded like they were really trying and they've managed to produce a short but solid album.Overall, you have to be in the mood for something different. This is not a dance album. I think it might be a unique experience for Sabbath fans that are not too familiar with anyone other than Ozzy. Buy it if you're curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated album","review":"The original vinyl version didn't have the best sound but unless you're hung up on Ozzy being the only real singer of Black Sabbath you will probably love this album.A couple of the songs grab you instantly but this is one of those albums that ten listens into it some of the other songs like Keep it Warm will be your favorite.Don't buy just one download - this is an album in the classic sense - buy the whole thing or you will be missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Deep/Sabbath","review":"This is a must have Sabbath disc a bit dark and hoary from Disturbing the priest,Digital Bitch,Zero the Hero. This is a classic Black Sabbath album and even better on disc, so glad I bought it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Call 'em on the hot line","review":"Granted, this album should've been called Deep Sabbath. Despite having lommi playing, hearing Gillan sing with a virtuoso like Tony lommi, the sounds conjure up Deep Purple. Sure being a ''Black Sabbath'' album it has the darker themes that go with being a Black Sabbath release. But Gillan's operatic voice dwarfs that of 0zzy's and Dio's. Then again, just about everything dwarfs Ronnie James Dio (tee-hee).Despite having been written almost a quarter century ago, ''Digital Bitch'' is even more relavent now than it was then. ''Trashed'' has the theme as ''Snowblind'' did years before and ''Zero The Hero'' shows lommi at his best.As a reviewer mentioned before, ''Hotline'' could've fit on any Purple album that Gillan was on, both during their 7O's heyday as well as the 8O's reunion era. And ''Born Again'' is an epic tale that was Sabbath of any era.Too bad this album is but a footnote in Sabbath's as well as Gillan history. lt's kept me warm for over 2O years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sleeper CD","review":"This is a one shot wonder for this band, strayed away from the Ozzy & Dio sound, but came up with a gem with Ian Gillian as the front man. The riffs and style is what Black Sabbath is all about, heavy, heart punding, head banging msuic. The album is a sleeper, but a great value and a collectors item if you are a Sabbath Fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Production / Weak Lyrics","review":"I'll never understand the cult-like following that this album has. The studio production is the worst I've ever heard of any album released by a major recording outfit. Geezer is buried in the mix. The drums sound horrible. The lyrics appear to have had almost no creative thought put into them. For the most part, the songs have a \\"phoned-in\\" quality to them. The only highlights that save this from a one-star rating are some of Gillian's masterful screams & a couple of decent & fluid solos from Iommi.This is for Sabbath completists only, if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital bitches.","review":"This Black Sabb album is not the Black Sabb I loved.

The production is so bad that it's almost impossible to kind of talk about the actual songs. I guess some of the tracks would be much better with a proper production, at least we might be able to hear the different instruments and not only this \\"blur\\" that sounds like a very bad demo tape. If you're not a dedicated Sabbath (or Ian Gillan) fan, stay away from this one. If you are... I guess you already own this album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"I remember how psyched my high school friends & I were when we heard that Ian Gillan from Deep Purple was joining our favorite band Black Sabbath. We of course loved the Ozzy era and were pleasantly surprised at how well Ronnie James Dio of Ritchie Balckmore's Rainbow did, especially on the Heaven & Hell album. By all accounts fellow Blackmore alumnus Ian Gillan should have blazed an equally interesting path with Tony Iommi & Co. But amidst the hype (and booze) they forgot to write some songs. Thankfully Gillan went on to rejoin Deep Purple the next year for their strong Perfect Strangers comeback album. But Born Again should have been aborted in the first trimester of recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Sometime in the early 80's there were rumours about Black Sabbath's new singer being Ian Gillan. We all laughed. We should have cried. Being full of anticipation I bought Born Again, but having listened to it, I was so sorry. I really tried to like it. Ian Gillan singing with Black Sabbath. What could go wrong? But all I was, was a sorry teenager having wasted what little money I had. It didn't sound like Black Sabbath at all. In my opinion the sound is too sharp edged and flat. All about the production seems rushed and the lyrics are really silly. And Gillan's way of singing doesn't fit the music at all. It actually feels a bit odd listening to Gillan singing while Iommi's riffing. Unfortunately this must be one of the least enjoyable recordings by any of the participants. Consider buying something else by Black Sabbath or Deep Purple, like all albums featuring Ozzy and Gillan in respective band."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD AGAIN","review":"GIllan in Sabbath was a mistake since the beginning, according to Gillan's own words in his autobiographical book. He said this was to be a project with another name, not \\"BLACK SABBATH\\".

The Meters' guitarist, Leo Nocentelli, was dynamite with the Meters. His riffs on \\"Fire on the Bayou\\", \\"People Say\\", and all the great late sixties funk instrumentals were innovative and inspiring. This recording includes many of those famous tunes, including the aforementioned and \\"Africa\\", \\"Hey Pocky Way\\", and \\"Cissy Strut\\". The Meters' drummer, the super-funky Zigaboo Modeliste, plays on this live recording as well, making it a very attractive purchase. Don't be fooled.

Her lyrics, however, are a different story. More twang and rock than smoke, the resulting songs are texturally unique and defy classification.The songs (a few written by Hogan, a few written by others, and a cover or two) on \\"The Whistle Only Dogs Can Hear\\" vary from rocking to ballad-y to almost punk, but all are emotional. Put together after the painful demise of The Jody Grind, the album explores life, death, love, and surviving it all - and she does so in grand fashion. Hopefully we'll hear much more from Kelly in the future, because her talent definitely deserves recognition. Pick up this album and share it with your friends - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly hooked by third listen.","review":"First listen was underwhelming, second listen started to click, and third listen found me bordering on addicted. This album has more traces of The Jody Grind and Rock-A-Teens than Kelly's 2001 release (\\"Because It Feel Good\\"). Lots of great reverb-guitar moments, as well as some unmistakable nods to her punk rock roots, woven into a big picture of alt-country goodness. She seems uncharacteristically pitchy here and there on this album, but the more I listen, the more I think it's intentional - in keeping with the edgy, punk undercurrents. If you're looking for an album of Kelly belting out torch songs in that full, glorious chest voice of hers, this is not it (although there are a few shining moments of that). \\"Because It Feel Good\\" seems to showcase her voice more, but the edgy quality of this album has its own appeal.

The family members that have been trained with the other book have been successful in one day with minimal accidents and overnight training within a few weeks. We are now implementing the ideas from the other book and are much more happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Motivational Ideas","review":"This is a very good book, although, it is intended for the mid three's and up or a younger child with a high comprehension level. This book reinforces positive reinforcement and has lots of great party theme ideas that can be used even if you aren't potty (\\"party\\") training. I did not buy the recommended Corelle doll and really wish I had. It's expensive, but you will have much more success with the Corelle doll, In addition to be anatomically correct, it functions on demand not spontaneously. Good luck shopping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value","review":"I got a better value online than what I could get at Wally world. Good, quality children's books at a fair price. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not for every child","review":"I bought this book on a whim at a bookstore when my infant was fussing in the shopping cart. I didn't read the book jacket well enough before buying it and most likely would not have purchased it had I known that the technique only involved throwing a party. Like a previous reviewer said, this method will only work if your child enjoys a party and likes to have a fuss made about them. My son isn't shy, but he gets embarrassed easily. I need to take a more mellow approach to his accomplishments or he refuses to repeat them. This book wasn't for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING PROGRAM THAT WORKED FOR US!!!","review":"We got this book to start the potty training process. I did not like the book. It is kind of vague on what you are supposed to do and just concentrates on throwing a potty party. ThaT is great if your toddler knows about parties and you can actually have a full conversation with him but useless if you can't. It did not cover in detail what to do during the day or what to do if the child had an accident, etc. There is a MUCH better potty training in a day written in the 1970's that TOTALLY worked for us. This one was useless.0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great read","review":"I got this book thinking it would direct me to some really critical views on potty training. I was dissapointed because the author takes a 10 minute lesson and turns it into a book! I kept reading thinking maybe we would learn somethign crucial, but no, half the book is just party ideas for the potty party they say will train your child. This book is geared to 3 or 4 year olds who have great vocabularly, understanding, and will bribe. I really didn't walk away with much but a wasted evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"potty book","review":"This book seems to target older kids, maybe 3 and up... my son just turned 2 when we finished the book and tried the potty party. I noticed alot of the advise throughout the book revolved around older kids that could understand alot more. Also, the party \\"fun\\", treats, etc wore off really quick with him. He got to the point where he wanted to do his own thing instead of dealing with the potty. I think it all could work well with some children, but not with mine. He was so excited at first and went potty quite a few times. Then, the next few weeks were tantrums, not wanting to sit on the potty, not caring if lollypops or chocolate were dangling right in front of him, to the point we are at now: no potty what so ever. I wish we approached it in a simple manner, but now we can't even get him to budge, even if we take a few weeks to a month break before trying again. I will say that there is a lot of great potty training advise in the book, no matter if you use that approach or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I thought there would be some special secret in this book that would make my child magically potty trained.

And definitely can see the appeal for kids who have negative views on potty training. BUT what about after?? The books barely talks about how to reinforce it, how to phase out treats and stickers, how to get them to tell you when they need to go as opposed to telling htem when they need to go.Also - its an EXPENSIVE way to potty train for sure!! So this book is good... but get another one one how to maintain potty training after."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome book!","review":"I book this book as I needed to potty train my daughter for pre-k. In one weekend, my daughter was using the potty, telling me when she had to go, and also staying dry at night. The author gives clear cut instructions on how to have a potty party, and ways to get your child to focus on the task at hand-going potty.I also went on the author's website, and sent her email in the off chance she would write back. Not only did the author herself write back, she even gave me her number to call her if I had any trouble during the potty party. Highly recommend this book to any parent starting to think about potty training!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teri Crane is a miracle worker!","review":"Imagine having no clue about how to potty train a child. Now imagine having to potty train TRIPLETS! I did not know where to turn when my triplets needed to be trained and luckily I found this book. I EASILY trained each of them using the techniques in this book. They each were FULLY trained in ONE day! The book is well written and easy to follow. I have recommended it to every mom I know (especially those who have limited time due to caring for multiples ) and they have had equally great results. Whether your child is partially trained, or not trained at all THIS is the only source you need to potty train IN JUST ONE DAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big promise Big disappointment","review":"This took a lot of planning but my son didn't read the book so he go along with it the way he was suppose to. The party idea was fun, but he was confused and frustrated and I think he felt a lot of pressure to proform a big task in such a short amount of time. The readiness methods have been around forever, probably because they are the right way to go. We're going to relax and not push the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teri Crane really is a Potty Pro !","review":"I was so impressed with Teri Crane's book on how to \\"Potty Train Your Child in Just One Day\\" that I read it twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything.

I hope Teri is in the process of writing another insightful book for us.Sincerely,M. P. Sullivan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top!","review":"This method is so over the top. I like the idea of a potty party but really, matching undies for the doll and your child, presents, all other children and people out of the house? It just seems over the top and unneccesary. I do like the idea of devoting one full day (or weekend) to potty training which is why I gave it 2 stars vs. 1.We did tell our daughter that she gets a potty party at Chuck E Cheese when she was potty trained and that really motivated her, she watched Potty Power DVD which she loved and we just did our own reward system (2 skittles for pee, a dum dum for poop)but this was just over the top, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for older toddlers","review":"I read this book and thought the suggestions were great for older toddlers. My guess would be 2 1/2 to 3 year olds or older would really benefit from the format and ideas. I was looking for tips to help my barely 2 year old daughter and some of the party ideas were a little over her head."},{"rating":"2","title":"But this book!!!","review":"If you can only buy one book on CRM, this is it.

This is one of the worst books I have ever read in college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot recommend this book","review":"I bought this book for a course called \\"Customer Relations in Business.\\" The material does not appear to have been edited as there are numerous grammatical errors. The index is poorly done and does not always refer you to the right page. The authors' use of marketing-specific acronyms is excessive and slows down the reading. On a personal level I cannot condone what this book advocates ... collecting information on customers with or without their knowledge or consent for the purposes of manipulating them. In short it treats customers as a means and not as an end."},{"rating":"2","title":"H.D. Through the Looking Glass","review":"With _Asphodel_, Hilda Doolittle takes her readers across the Atlantic and introduces them to the literati of the early twentieth century. Her thinly veiled portrayals of Ezra Pound, Dorothy Shakespear, William Carlos Williams, and D.H. Lawrence are insightful and perhaps far more accurate than any biography would dare to be. While it is difficult to believe that she was as naive an ingenue as she attests, it is harder still not to sympathize with the youthful poet determined to succeed abroad even though discarded by the charming but inattentive Pound. This novel is one of H.D.'s best, clearly as strong an example of her writing as _Bid Me to Live_ and _Paint it Today_. While still not consdered a first-rank Modern, Hilda Doolittle is arguably one of the most important literary figures of her day. Her description of the Moderns abroad is flawless and no examination of the Modern era can be complete before reading her prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boon for scholars, bane for readers","review":"H.D. was seized by a flash of wisdom when she pencilled \\"DESTROY\\" across the manuscript of Asphodel; it's a pity her eager publishers didn't heed her sense. As I understand it, this text was coveted by feminist and LGBT scholars who wanted to recover a major work by a lesbian modernist. Unfortunately, Asphodel is major only in the sense that it is long, and modernist only insofar as its landscape is obsessively internal. As for any \\"lesbian\\" theme, there's nary a hint of affection, much less desire, for another human being in this tedious aria of self-justification. H.D lays waste to page after page with bitter monologues about how her own exquisitely quivering sensitivities are forced to suffer everyone else's idiocies. It's like reading the diary of an unpopular and astonishingly dense fifteen-year-old.Wade through this only if you're an H.D. scholar, or if you're really into playing guess-the-literati."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I teach a first year Allied Health class and played this DVD for my class.

Needless to say if someone can point me to the real 99-minute UK release of this movie, I'd greatly appreciate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked but be warned","review":"Human Traffic is an absolutely amazing film, I would definitely put it up there in my all time hall of fame type places. One of the best things about it is that the main characters are all real people, they're not glitzy Hollywood stars but people that you could really meet on a night out. Of course, that's not to say that they're nothing special as they're all people I'd like to know! Another of the best things is that you can really relate to this film if you've ever indulged. Everyone plays their parts perfectly, and I laughed my head off when one of my friends exclaimed that they even chew their gum \\"in that way\\". One word of warning though, the American version of the film has been slightly censored. This didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the movie, but is was a shame to see that some choice scenes had been cut. As I say though, don't let that put you off! It's still a wicked movie and it will have you grinning from ear to ear. \\"Reach for the lazers!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The American DVD is BOLLOCKS!!!!","review":"Don't listen to the hype of the other reviews... this version of this film and the version that was shown in US theaters isn't half the film that the UK version is. Miramax cut so much of this film one would wonder what they were trying to do... but turn it into a romantic comedy!?! Plus, the PAL version of the DVD has a load of extras and music!!!Lets just say this, one of the funniest moments in the film is the \\"I remember what kind of club this used to be\\" segment... and you won't find it in the US version. Plus, just about every drug reference has been changed.. including Moff's sequences. Brtish humor has been cut or overdubbed in the US version as well, so you won't see any East Enders jokes. Seriously, the amount of film that was cut for the US is too much to list here.Don't believe the hype!!!! Buy yourself something that will play the PAL disc and buy it from Amazon.co.uk.

You will be able to identify with all the main characters what ever your background is, and would have, at one stage or another, found your self in their shoes. If you've ever expressed yourself in club, with friends or with a little help from some 'party prescriptions' then you'll love this film from start to finsh. The director, Justin Kerrigan, has the right formular for making the hair on the back of your neck stand up. It's a true portrait of 20 something clubbers and the problems that all todays youth have to deal with in life. I saw this when it came out in London and was so taken by it that i went back 4 times to see it! If your a bit of a musical trainspotter then you'll love the sound track to, as the musical director was on more than Radio 1's Pete Tong.

It is one of the greatest and most true to life films I have ever had the pleasure to watch.Having been part of the rave and club scene, you can not fault the film at all. All the actors in the film must have 'been there and done it', you cant fault any of them. They give a strong performance.I have seen the film twice in the cinema and many more times since buying it on DVD. I know the American club scene doenst have such an foothold on the youth of the US, but if anyone wants to see what the club scene of Britian is like, watch Human Traffic.

If you are looking for a zip code this book will indicate several telephone area codes for one zip code. If you are looking for a telephone area code this book will reveal several zip codes.

But soon after I stop noticing the deficits of the sound recording, because this band is totally hot! I love the rendition of \\"Chicago\\". To be sure, some songs are better than others, and I admit I am not a fan of \\"Mystery Pacific\\" which strikes me as some sort of European bluegrass notion.

Much like a Freddy Kruger nightmare it almost is sweet and rosey until you realize something is not right and all of a sudden your arms fall off and in place of them are roach like tentacles.

How does this egomaniac piano player fit in? Seamlessly! Once again you will not believe that there is only one pair of hands on the keyboard. I defy you to listen to this album and not have your fingers and feet tapping along. I regret never having heard Booker live but thank heavens we have these lost tapes to fill in some of the holes.

Some crazed science fiction. Ok, the skiing scenes were cool, but thats all I liked. Denise Richards, although I wanted to like her, deemed to be close to impossible.

I love this and Brosnan seems at his best in this outing. I noticed that a lot of people hate this one but I think that because they are expecting something else out of the film. Rather than the special effects concentrated shoot-em-ups of the last two brosnan bond films, this one is a lot different, concentrating a lot more on locations and story line with the right about of gadgets, humour, and action... this one take a leap back to the more traditional Bond adventure.If you are expecting a short one liner movie with pleanty of explosions and gun-fire, you are probably going to be a little upset, but if (like me) you want a heathy mix of all the great things that made bond so popular in the past with action, adventure, romance, comedy, thrills, and just general fun ! then this is the movie for you !Buyable just for the pre-title sequence which is the best Ive seen ever in Bond. A must buy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with each viewing! Brosnan is awosome!!!!!","review":"The way this movie worked for me is weird. When i first saw it in theatres i have to admit i wasnt overly pleased with it. I thought it was alright. I decided to go see it again. That time i understood the plot better and i liked it more. But i felt it wasnt one i wanted to own. Finally a month or so ago i decided to rent it. I was so pleased with it then before! Now it is my favorite Brosnan 007. This movie is great! Lots of action, good bond girls and an excellent plot that requires 2 viewings to get completly. All the actors are great. If you are skeptical about this movie give it another try. Pay close attention and maybe you will feel better about this movie like i did. The plot is too complicated to tell but just see this movie. Even none 007 fans will like it. See this movie. By the way it has a great soundtrack! Rated PG-13 for violence and sexual innunendo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond is Bank, Brosnan Best Bond Yet","review":"Bond is back and it great to say Pierce is growing into the role with every movie. As always this movie is exactly what you would expect for a 007 movie. The girls , the car chases , the licence to kill and Q (Brillant Way for Desmond Llewelyn to sign out of the movies and it was great to see the tribute to him on the DVD). If you looking for gritty realism then 007 isn't for you but if you willing to suspend belief for 2 hours and just go with the flow then I would recommend you BUY this DVD. It dosen't move 007 on and it is a by the numbers James Bond movie, but isn't that what we expect , we do miss the charm of Sean Connery or the quips of Roger Moore but Pierce seems to be growing into the role by the film and I look forward to the next edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"The only thing that could have made this movie more perfect isif Sean Connery himself could have played the roll! I mean, don't getme wrong, Peirce Brosnan is one great actor, but you just don't get any better then Sean! This is one of those movies that are definately worth buying!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Goldeneye, but much better than Tomorrow...","review":"With a cool overture (the adventure before the title), a well performed song by Garbage, and a great cast of characters, The World is Not Enough is one of the best Bond flicks yet. Brosnan is back with his new P99 pistol and lots of new gadgets and car. He's assigned to protect a billionare's daughter who's targeted for murder. But is she all that she turns out to be? Though the story gets confusing and the bad guy is pretty lame, the action sequences make up for that. It is worth buying if you like Bond. 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"an OK bond","review":"Bond returns in a complicated & confusing story, although the special effects are as good as always. A little too serious, maybe, but bond is still bond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless You're a Big bond Fan, Don 't See It","review":"This was a ridiculous Bond film that used women as objects, he had sex with 3 boring characters during the course of this movie! The sex jokes finally have gotten tiresome. The action was good, but certainly not great, though there were a couple of very cool, ridiculous moments, for which I will give it one more star. The idea of someone getting stronger everyday, because of being shot in the head is about as stupid as any idea that I've ever heard for a villain in my life. I personally liked Tomorrow Never Dies. It had pretty good action as well, and it was funny, and had a badguy that was a lot cooler that this Renard. If the reason you like Bond is just for the sex scenes, enjoy. If you have a decent reason to want to watch a film, don't even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could hardly wait till the end of the movie...","review":"Contrary to the reviewer Mr. Dave, I would place my references in reverse order (\\"Goldeneye\\" first). All this storyline with Baku gas pipeline was ridiculous (and a Christian church in a cave! Guys, even Georgia does not live in the Middle Ages anymore), choppers with flying frame-saws and Mr. Bond who, despite all laws of physics, floats up and does not drown - it is more than I can bear. I also bet that Electra King was a better bedmate than Mr. Doctor Jones (an atomic physicist? Why not Mr. Einstain's daughter?): she at least has a sparkle of intellect in her eyes. Yes, James Bond is an immortal hero, but can't he suffer a little bit, get wounded at least? I heard Mr. Brosnan signed a contract for several more Bond episodes.At least I'll not waste my money on this rubbish anymore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Was Not Good Enough","review":"I have to admit that I went to this film expecting to be removed from my dreary existence for two hours. The reality of Bond is normally a fun place to be. Who would have thought that Bond's world is duller than my own? This is easily one of the worst, if not the worst, entry in the series. Brosnan's no longer acting suave, but instead is acting like he just doesn't care. Richards is easily the most grating Bond girl to ever grace the screen. Director Michael Apted seems to give little credence to timing and pacing in his action scenes. There is no suspense, no sense of anticipation, so it's impossible to suspend disbelief. All that's left to do is sit back and mutter: \\"Well, that was pretty lame.\\"After just three films and I'm hoping that Brosnan throws in the towel. Bring back Roger Spottiswoode and Michelle Yeoh. At least they knew how to put some energy onto the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggest Bond of all","review":"This is the best 007 movie I have ever seen. My advce to anyone is to buy this movie ASAP! It has all the essential elements of a Bond film beautiful seductive women, gadgets, an awesome car ,wild stunts, a great plotline, and best part of all.......it's James Bond 007."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...","review":"The video quality for the Blu-ray was good, but not great. You could see the grains/noise, which tells me it was transferred in lower quality. Definitely better than DVD transfer. The sound quality was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOT OF GOOD WORK HERE-- HIGHLY ENJOYABLE","review":"The film's opening sequences are better than most movies, and it works wonderfully with high-grade special effects. Had lot of technical gizmos that were fascinating, and really done quite well.The women here actually had a brain-- a new thing in Bond films. While highly unlikely that a girl that beautiful would be a nuclear scientist-- it shouldn't be. The movie ran like sweet wine-- sweet and smooth-- this one is one of the top 007 movies. I would rank it for sure in the top 5 Bond movies of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond is back!","review":"This is one of the better Bonds movie made.Pierce Brosnan makes the best James Bond.I love him in this movie. Well in this movie we start off with as always a supenseful moment before the song.As awlays it is a clue to the end so watch closely.The plot in this movie is A number 1.The women are beautiful.Most of them can actually act(I know amazing.)I don't like it when people give away all the movie so I'm not either so I will leave it as YOU MUST SEE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Bond baby!","review":"Over the years Bond has faced steel-toothed giants, hardy men with razor-sharp hats, and an assassin with a golden gun, but never such an original villain as Renard, the man who feels no pain! The story has some interesting twists and turns and all in all is \\"rather stocked\\" with danger, action, mystery and romance. Although unbelievable as a nuclear scientist, Dr. Christmas Jones makes for a very stunning Bond babe. Even though the fight between Bond and Renard is short and over in only a few moments, and the death of Renard unexpected, acting of his death was great. If you like Bond, action or a interesting story, rent The World Is Not Enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Brosnan as Bond","review":"Though I've enjoyed the later Bond movies starring Daniel Craig, I still think Pierce Brosnan was the better Bond, James Bond. Craig never seems like he's having any fun. Brosnan has the ability to show Bond enjoying himself, while still bringing a more realistic performance to a very non-realistic film genre. When Bond is getting choked to death in some Byzantine torture mechanism, Brosnan makes you feel Bond's pain (even if it is much less pain than a normal person would feel.) This movie is blessed and cursed with one of the best of the \\"Bond girls\\" and one of the worst. The beautiful Sophie Marceau plays Bond's love interest in the movie, gorgeous and mysterious. The beautiful Denise Richards plays Dr. Christmas Jones, a nuclear scientist, but the actress just is not up to the job. The World is Not Enough wasn't the best Bond outing with Brosnan, but still one of the better of the series, and one I enjoy rewatching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This is a pretty exciting movie. I have to say Pierce Bronsan makes the best James Bond, even better than Sean Connery in older James Bond movies. Some of the top action scenes include the Boat Chase, James Bond and Electra King(a very beautiful woman) getting chased while skiing and the helicopter scene. The basic story is that James Bond is sent to protect an oil heiress, whom unknown forces are trying to kill.Bond thinks it is because they don't want competition from her Oil pipeline. However, the story takes a surprise twist that most won't see coming. For that reason I give this movie 5 stars; for this unusual twist that is not there in other Bond movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Bond Movie.","review":"The World Is Not Enough is a good Bond and action film. Pierce Brosnan gives his best performance as OO7. All the other actors are excellent, direction and production is suberb, gadgets are fantastic, production design is amazing, music is thrilling and so much more. Under GoldenEye, this is Brosnan's best Bond film. All Bond fans should by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great 007 Blu Ray!","review":"If you're a Bond fan,this is well worth getting,crystal clear picture and top notch sound,rounded out with awesome extras! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of The Brosnans","review":"Although this movie is at times clichéd and, yes, Denise Richards tries but she just IS too improbable, it's pretty good. I felt more for all the characters than I did when watching Tomorrow Never Dies and Goldeneye. There were some good jokes and although this isn't one of my real favourites, it's enjoyable enough if you're a fan of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody Does It Better than Bond...","review":"Pierce Brosnan returns for his third outing as James Bond in what might be the one of the best Bonds made in recent years. Sticking close to the classic bond formula of high action sequences, beautiful women, and exotic locales (and as far away from the embarassment known as TND). Not only does this film contain a great \\"bondly\\" plot, but one of the best bond cars, ranking up there with the Aston Martin DB5 (GDF) and Volante (TLD) and a great closing line which I won't ruin for you. My only problem with the film is the scary resemblence the theme song has to TND's. In conclusion, with 007 you alway know what your getting when it comes to action, suspence and humor. And you know, nobody does it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brosnon - good Richards - Bad","review":"I think Brosnon is one of the best Bond's ever. He is what I envision when I think of what Bond should look like. My only real complaint with this movie is casting Denise Richards as the nuclear physicist. She looks like she just graduated from high school for crying out loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brosnan's 3rd","review":"Ok. This is not Brosnans worst bond. If u want to see which is his worst, look at my review on DAD. Ok, the action is great, the story is great. But I had to give one of Brosnans movies 3rd place and this one just happend to get it. Brosnan looks and feels like he is 007. He is settled down in the role. My FAVORITE bond girl in Sophie Marceau. SHE IS SO GORGIOUS. And one of the few leading bond girls that isent a bimbo or a whining dumb blond. Renard is a cool villin. Just not the best, but DEFINITLY not the worst. This movie establishes Brosnans Bond as a human being. Bond gets hurt and is more vunerable then ever before. I just have one little complaint about this movie that gives it only 4 stars. And that is Denise Richards. Wrongly casted. She is only eye candy. Other then that, Great Bond Movie, and a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"Years ago, I promised myself I would never watch another Bond film. This movie reminded me why. Brosnan looks good, but that's all this movie has going for it. Incomprehensible plot, stupid dialogue, unbelievable action sequences -- leave your brain at the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Bond Film.","review":"With James Bond films you know what you are going to get: Amazing chases, fights and outlandish villains. This film does not disappoint. This is action-packed and exciting. One action scene follows another with brief breaks for humor or intrigue. Bond has the best gadgets we've seen in a while.It's a good formula that it is dangerous to alter. Look at the Timoty Dalton Bond movies. Dalton made Bond a misty-eyed, sensitive and vulnerable soul. Oops! Brosnan's third shot finds him hitting his stride and finding all the right notes. Sean Connery is the ideal Bond, being the first. Here Brosnan rediscovers the toughness and ruthlessness of Connery in \\"Dr. No.\\" He is nearly as suave as Connery and comes close to matching Connery's overwhelming confidence. Bond is a superhero. He's not mere mortal man!This is a must-have for Bond fans. Anyone who enjoys action and international intrigue will enjoy it, too. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thomas Crown Affair.","review":"This movie was great, except they should of used someone younger to play as Pierce Brosnan's girlfriend. Perhaps someone like?......Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Bond is awesome. I saw it for the first time yesterday. I loved Bond and this is everything Bond had to offer plus a lot more. This movie has awesome special effects, better weopons, smarter enemies. I would not think twice about buying this movie. You will not be disappointed !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Bond movie ever?","review":"I watched this film twice after purchasing the Region 2 version. I watched it the second time because I totally forgot that I saw it the first time. It has no plot, no story - no point. Even the Bond girls are annoying at best. I felt sorry that the bad guy (whose name I can't even remember) survived a bullet in the head - better to be dead than appear in this movie. I only wish all the other characters had been shot in the brain too - but the way some of them were acting, maybe they had. My tip for anyone planning to buy this movie is don't, get Tomorrow Never Dies instead - an excellent film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...I'm in a minority but I didn't like this film...","review":"I thought this film, although seeming to have all the right elements of a Bond film, just didn't have any \\"spark\\". Pierce Brosnen is a fantastic Bond so he isnt the problem...and even the story was Bond-esque, so that wasn't it. Adding John Cleese was a stroke of brilliance! He was the brightest spot in the film and who ever thought of casting him in this hopefully reccurring roll was absolutely right on the money! The film seemed overly long to me and there were even a few times when I was sure it was over only to (groan inwardly)find that it wasn't. I rented this at the video store and felt compelled to watch it and get my moneys worth but to tell you the truth, had it been on TV I probably would have switched to a re-run of Gilligan's Island. All the Bond film elements were presant in this film but for me this film just didn't \\"click\\"...wait for it to come on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"The funniest part - Denise Richards trying to act","review":"Were it not for the inclusion of Denise Richards in this movie, I would have enjoyed it a [bit] more. One can usually forgive all the characters that are thrown in a Bond film. But I cannot stress enough the unbearable scenes in which Denise Richards opens her pie-hole; as if reading straight from the script with no feeling. She wrecked the entire film.Not one of the best Pierce Brosnan Bond movies. Especially with the goofy story line of the wacko Renard, who doesn't feel pain. And M, getting involved too closely in the operation, leading to her kidnapping."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is more than enough for me!","review":"This movie has it good with my opinion. Arguably, this is one of, if not the best, bond film ever made. I've been a longtime Bond fan, and this movie is a fine pick-me-up after Tommorrow Never dies and that last Tim Dalton one. The things that caught my eye most were the superb opening scenes, and the non-stop action. The first chase scene is the best of any Bond film (i'm sure others will agree). I went to see it in theatre with some friends and we all loved it. Now i'm looking foreward to buying it as soon as it comes out from Amazon( May 16). So, I give this movie 4 3/4 stars. The reason being, some of the things about the film are unbelievable, such as the likelyhood of James surviving all those fights. But, that is to be expected from a good Bond Movie. So, Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bond Movie!","review":"This film to me is the best Bond film ever! Pierce Brosnan is excellent playing the role once again! The movie has a great story to it and great villians! I think it beats both \\"Goldeneye\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Dies,\\" though those were great films too! Here I am at home counting down to May 16th when \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" is released so I can own it on Video! I highly recommend seeing this film to anyone, definately for James Bond fans! *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"For all the, ahem, 'Bond fans' who liked TND...","review":"...I think TND was a waste of MGM's money, as well as Brosnan's time; it had no *PLOT*, and it was all action, shooting, guns, explosions, I could go on and on. Now, TWINE has a *PLOT* (come on everyone, say it with me: PLOT!), and there is actually *DIALOUGE* (say this one with me too: DIALOUGE!) between the actors, and Brosnan really shines in this one; he really doesn't TRY to be cool, he just IS: I remember reading something in the LA Times that quoted Brosnan saying \\"In this next movie, bring me in to DO something, don't just have people shooting guns at me for 3/4 of the entire movie!\\". So, all the little 'Bond fans' who just saw TND and liked it, have a lot to learn from the REAL Bond fans who have been around a little in the Bond world, read the novels, seen the movies, gone to the locations, etc... All in all, TWINE is by far one of THE best Bond films of all time, and I hope mister Brosnan can keep this pace going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action!","review":"This was a great movie for the start and middle of it but when it gets to the end it just goes on and on and on. I recommend seeing it for the action that's involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Either change, or retire Bond","review":"After about fifty movies featuring James Bond, you would have thought that they would change the formula around at least a little. It's the same old stuff and Pierce Brosan looked as though he was just going through the motions and that only results in a dull movie. I'm not saying that he's bad in his role, in fact, he's the best Bond period! But the plot, action chase scenes, and the girls...it's getting played out. Either change the Bond formula, or end it here.And another thing, pleeeeesssee get a villian that doesn't bore me to tears! Carlyle was promising as the bad guy who could feel no pain, but nothing \\"cool\\" was done with him!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOND FOR SPORTSFANS","review":"Several people have said this is the best Bond of all. That's roughly the equivalent of being the best hockey player in all of Equador or the best ballerina since Mickey Mantle! Are they kidding?If they make another one like this (especially featuring that weenie little Brosnan guy) it will have to debut on local channel 3 in Klamath Falls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No excitement","review":"Probably the least exciting Bond movie ever made. Nothing happens that is worth mentioning. There's a scene with a pipe or something that is good for about 2 seconds. The rest is an unbroken succession of bore after bore after bore. How on earth the filmmakers thought that audiences would be entertained by this is a mystery to me.Robert Carlyle is so unscary he belongs in Sesame Street. Denise Richards is a nuclear scientist (!) who wears tight fitting tops and hot pants instead of the white coat.Director Michael Apted seemed an odd choice to me and he has succeeded in making every single scene as dull and leaden and unimpressive as it is possible.Watch this movie only if you are a Bond fan. If you watch them just like any other movie though...do NOT waste your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"It's the only Bond movie that gave me a headache on the first viewing.

The plot is about an evil business man who intends on launching the first truely international TV news station, but he wants a hot story and top coverage. To acheive this he decides to start a war between China and Britain and capture the events of film before anyone else, mega ratings and mega money. A sound plot that dips in the middle due to the tedious love storyline that dominates most of the screen time, until Bond's love interest is killed off - thew! Back to the action and an explosive ending - just the way we like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boredom, James Boredom","review":"If this latest Bond movie is any indication, the Bond franchise is dead. Everything about this film reeks of mediocrity. The acting, or lack thereof, makes one think of B movies on late at night on the USA Channel. The characters...oops, there aren't any. We get pretty people posing. Action? Not a bit of interesting action to be found in this hackneyed piece of garbage. In fact the action sequences don't even flow well. The director, Apted, needs to turn in his DGA card because this thing had the sloppiest direction of any Bond film in memory. How many times must we see the face of Pierce Brosnan's stunt double? How many boring set pieces will this film go through? Gosh, I feel ill admitting I even sat through this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:One of the worst Bonds, TWINE features (as everyone knows by now) a nuclear physicist named Christmas Jones who is played by Denise Richards, an uninteresting plot, and an overall sense of depressing formula; the villain is interesting but the movie has little else new to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Bond is still worth it","review":"This is the first time I made myself watch a Bond movie with Pierce Brosnan - 'cause usually I don't like him, he is not macho enough to play that role. But I was surprised. Even tough he does look too old and unattractive and lacks charm, he does play pretty alright.The story itself is the usual Bond stuff, and even though you know 007 is gonna get through, the makers of The World Is Not Enough have managed to throw in some really exciting scenes.James Bond movies still seems the only successfull way to combine action, humour and beautiful chicks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The World Is Not Enough - Sleep!","review":"I got VERY disappointed.

The usual Russian bomb threats yada yada yada. Character development is non-existent, the plot is twisted and confused, and the movie depends entirely too much on special effects. The original 007 movies did not need as many special effects because the characters were well-defined and interesting and Sean Connery was fun and amusing to watch. His Bond had just enough evil in him to make him a believable character with a license to kill. Brosnan, a fine actor otherwise, seems more angry than anything else and by this time is just going through the motions and making sure that Rolex and BMW get plenty of exposure. The film contains quite a number of fine actors from the BBC, but they are not utilized fully. And one hopes the writing for future films will be better, otherwise they're simply not fit to be called Bond films--James Bond films!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DVD feature review.","review":"First let me state I'm a huge James Bond fan, I've seen them all. I could go on for pages why I didn't like this film much, and the rating reflects that, but I'll just give a few comments on the DVD extras. First the introduction is too obnoxious and there is no way to skip past it. The very short, 15 minute, 'making of' feature was more like a 'E!' feature from TV with some rather boring interviews with some of the cast and crew. The 'secrets' section was very interesting with storyboards combined with unfinished scenes that showed what the shots looked like before final production. The video by Garbage is very good too. It's a great song although short. The music video isn't just cut scenes from the movie, although it has them, but a whole little story in itself. Finally a big oversight in my book is a lack of English subtitles, although French and Spanish is included. Overall a good DVD production too bad the movie wasn't as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"If id known this Bond would be so mediocre, I would have ordered Goldeneye, even though i saw that Bond installment already. The DVD has some nice features, and the audio was more than I expected, but the movie, as one reviwer put it, does put you to sleep. I hope they continue this movie series, and with PB at that, but i hope they are are able to get back the ambiance that Goldeneye and TND had."},{"rating":"1","title":"007 goes overboard","review":"As much as I like bond films, this is one of the worst to date. Several of the action sequences are flat out unbelievable and silly. The plot is some of the craziest unimaginitive work ever put into a film. I had to force myself to sit down on three seperate occasions to finish this film! If you want a good bond film, definitley steer clear of this title. Try Goldeneye or Tommorow Never Dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"He&#65533;s back!","review":"Brilliant locations, beautiful babes, silly gadgets, best opening sequence ever! James is back bigger than ever with a cool villain, sophisticated love interest and disappointing co-star: Denise Richards although gorgeous looks more like a porno star than an atomic scientist. Pierce (sorry Mr. Bronson to me) is a fine Bond; he really does make him a believable character, handsome and tough with just the touch of humor. It was very poignant to watch as 007 said farewell to \\"Q\\" as we now know for the last time. You know the plot mad person intent to wreak havoc, good guy saves the world, but has an interesting twist that I didn't see coming. I don't think that it is the best but certainly in the top three. I wonder if in the next movie (cant wait already) if \\"R\\" can teach him to leave a building via the door? Great entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"utter trash","review":"this was by far the worst bond film ever. i thought they couldn't get worse than a view to a kill or the man with the golden gun but it did. First problem was with electra charachter(this isn't Greek tragedy she was a villian to get revenge on her father and she was in love with renard\\" what a lame idea for a villiness. the second problem it had no plot. third problem brosnan was just not putting anything to the role. The movie was just pointless loud violent garbage. goldeneye was ok, tnd was good(it had some plot) but this was utter stupidity."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are so biased when it comes to Bond","review":"they think that if it isnt Connery, then its not good. Now I have watched all the Bond films, but not in the order they were released. I saw Dalton first and then Connery, Moore and the others. I saw, as typical, Brosnan last. I have to say, in all honesty, as much as I enjoyed the other Bonds, especially Connery and Moore, I like Brosnan the best. \\"World\\" is not the best Bond film, but its very good. My favorite is still Goldeneye.

Score: 92/100"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst in a storied series","review":"There have been a lot of ups and downs in the storied Bond series, which is to be expected with so many different installments being made. That being said, this is definitley one of the valleys, right down there with Licence to Kill and Moonraker. The plot is terrible, Richards is much better on mute and Brosnan doesn't appear to be given anything to work with. Just because you can assemble a few attractive women, some tech. toys and a madman doesn't mean that you have a Bond film. While Brosnan's reign started strong with Goldeneye and only dipped a bit with Tomorrow Never Dies, it hit the toilet with this one. The best Bonds are more than simply an action film- it needs to be a moviegoing experience. Sadly the only experience this leaves the viewer with is the urge to turn the tv off."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll fall asleep","review":"A sad day for Bond fans. Looks like director Michael Apted and his team ran out of time and ideas, and had to wrap up something -- anything -- to hand over to the studio. Respectable talents and serious money were squandered on this dull, confusing, flat-as-a-pancake film. If it's true that the Bond series has become a mechanical cliche', the least it should do is deliver the goods every Summer. Instead, this one will put you to sleep.A word about the cast. We've seen virtually all of these actors before, and they're clearly a capable bunch. So the fault of TWINO was not in the casting, but in the plot and direction.Over the years, Brosnan's Bond has grown more self-confident and a little tougher-edged, whereas the film production team seems to be getting confused and softer. Perhaps an injection of fresh film-making talent (behind the camera) is what the doctor ordererd to rejuvenate this tired, stiff series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The World is not Enough","review":"I love Pierce Brosnan as Bond and own this on DVD, but the bluray has the fatal flaw of no English subtitles and I am hard of hearing so I couldn't watch this bluray. This really ticks me off!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The World is Not Enough marks the 19th James Bond film and Pierce Brosnan's third installment in the role. Beginning with a slam bang action sequence (one of the best in the series) the film goes downhill from there as the plot gets more and more formulatic, even for James Bond standards. There are a few plot twists and turns that make for wholesome surprises, but in the end The World is Not Enough is one of the most disappointing films in the long running series. Robert Carlyle's (Trainspotting, Ravenous) Renard, a villian who is impervious to pain, is a nice touch, as is the beautiful Sophie Marceau (Braveheart) as the treacherous Elektra King, but the casting of Denise Richards as a nuclear physiscist (yes, you read that right) is one of many low points of the film (even though she looks severely hot in her short shorts and tight tank top ensemble). All in all, this is one of the more disappointing films in the series; the followup Die Another Day is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking!","review":"The action was great. Locations exotic. Plot believable. Charactors interesting, with the exception of one. Chrismas Jones. When did she start her study of advanced nuke physics? In the womb? Good lord! The director should have made her a mute advanced nuke wiz kid. Whenever she opened her mouth, bad lines, along with bad acting, would spill out. The only reason she was in the film was because of her sweat body. Her roll in the film detracted from the films seriousness and, I my opinion, ranks \\"The World is Not Enough\\" as the number 2 Bond stinker right after \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" with George Lazenby. Don't know that Bond movie? Thats because it was so bad nobody will talk about it. They just want to forget it ever existed. Which is what I will try to do with \\"The World is Not Enough.\\" That is if I can't remove the Denise Richards (Chrismas Jones) scenes without destroying the overall plot line. I need to get busy."},{"rating":"1","title":"For 007 this movie is not enough","review":"It wasn't charming as the first ones and, considering how \\"special effects\\" have improved in the past years, the new movie isn't trilling as it ancestors.

What was good about this were the terrific special effects, the complex, modern plot (The USSR is no more) and the music. Bad things: Alas, romance. The lead could not compete with earlier Bond women and being neither a femme fatale or a blushing virgin we are caught in the middle. Brosnan was good in this role, a more serious JB that brought much-needed weight and content to the part."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in the series","review":"I don't know what some people are thinking. The only reason I even bought Tomorrow Never Dies on DVD was for the soundtrack effects and the action scenes. TWINE actually has a somewhat believeable story compared to TND, decent acting and scripting, awesome effects (opening scene), and decent acting (except Richards =). Brosnan has done a good job with taking over the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Held up to expectations","review":"It's always hard for a Bond film to \\"go beyond\\" a Bond fans expectations.

I've tried to endure all three of the Remington Steele Bond flicks--unfortunately, that description best sums them up. Brosnan isn't that bad, per se, and if the handlers of the franchise would loosen the reins and let an inventive writer and director attempt to revitalize and reinvigorate the Cold War dinosaur, he might be a servicable Bond. But this film was SOOOOOOO predictable and unoriginal. Buy or rent Dr. No again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate BROSNAN and love DALTON , but marceau is HOT","review":"This time out, 007 is investigating the death of some guy named King, who was actually blown up inside Bond's M16 headquarters. Bond tries to kill a woman sniper that was firing at him,but she blows herself up too. The opening scene is too long and not good compared to the rest of them. Denise Richards is AWFUL as well as pretty much everybody else in this movie except Elektra King(Marceau)who is one of the best Bond girls since the 80's. I do not understand why we had to go from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan. I mean Pierce was good in the Lawnmower Man, but he just is not heading Bond in the right direction. When Dalton took the reigns from Roger Moore, there was a refreshing little bit of originality and seriousness. MGM cares more about money and box office popularity then they do about doing the GREAT IAN FLEMING'S original character justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond Film Next Only To Moonraker","review":"\\"You could have had the world.\\" \\"The world is not enough.\\" That is a mere sample of the disgusting, pitiful, horrible, dialouge that plauges this weak, boring, formulaic film. What happened to Goldeneye? Brosnan looked promising in his first two features, what happened? Oddly enough this was one of the best rated Bond films in a while. God save the queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Clearly, the makers of this movie wanted to make Bond more visceral and emotional. The best way of looking at the film is as a transition from the suave, elegant Bond of tradition to Daniel Craig's tougher, more brutish incarnation. Too bad the movie was so poorly done. Brosnan does his best with second-rate double entendres but he isn't given much else to work with: the action sequences are forced, heavy, and over-long; the plot is thin; and, no matter how lovely Denise Richards is, there is no disguising the fact that she can't act. The only good part of the movie is Miss Moreau: a rewrite turning her into the central villain would have made for a much better movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buen video de Bond","review":"Muy buen video, excelentes escenas.Si eres coleccionista de las peliculas de bond, esta es una que no debe faltar en tu videoteca."},{"rating":"1","title":"The World Is Enough......To Put Me To Sleep","review":"This movie was so ridiculously lame. You will actually be dumber after watching it. Granted, Pierce Brosnan is a fine actor who is probably the best choice to play 007, but the script was sub-par and plotline was an insult to any human's intelligence.The action sequences were predictable, albeit intense, but very contrived and hokey. The sinister villain was a goof on a weekend pass who wasn't scary at all.And what's up with one of his his love interest's name? Christmas Jones? Give me a break! To hear that was just a capper on an overall turkey of a film. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough. More than enough.","review":"And you thought Roger Moore was naff. He had all the stiffness of an insurance salesman and about half the charm. James Bond is so unhip I'm surprised he doesn't wheel himself around on a trolley and bite the ankles of his enemy. A very dated figure when you put him up against 'The Matrix'. I use 'The Matrix' as a template for everything despite the fact I don't think it's a terribly good film.Bond shows a novel way of getting around the capitol's dire traffic congestion early on in the proceedings. If our present Mayor has his way then he won't get halfway down the street without stopping to pay a toll in the next one. Then after that he'll be stopped again to check his equity card for authenticity after this debacle. Double O severence pay is in order for this tired series. It's making me embarrassed to be British."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the absoulute worst bond film made! The villian has a bullet in his head?

THUMBS DOWN TO \\"The World is Not Enough\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing After Tomorrow Never Dies","review":"I thought TND was among the best Bonds, right up there with The Spy Who Loved Me (Well, not quite). But this one is a major step backwards, although not as low as A View To A Kill, which is doubtless the worst of them all.The plot is boring and far too drawn out. The final payoff is very weak. Denise Richards is a babe, but when she comments that Bond is \\"No Nuclear Scientist\\", she is really taking about herself.Bronson is all right, but some new writers are needed for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Embarrassing Bond Movie Ever","review":"This is simply the worst Bond movie ever, also included, the worst Bond Girl ever - that being Denise Richards. Denise was not glamorous or smart as past Bond girls, essentially if she were left out of the story no one would have noticed. She looked like some chick Bond picked up from the mall, denim jacket included, who just provided unnecessary commentary. The story was disjointed and hopes that it would go anywhere and went no where. M is kidnapped, yeah, that had nothing nor any relevance to the story. This movie seemed rushed to produce and you can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least likeable Bond","review":"Brosnan brings a cold, souless quality to Ian Fleming's creation in \\"The World is Not Enough\\". There is something sad about a 40-ish man who has sex with anyone and everyone. He reminds me of a stray dog running around a neighborhood trying to hump any female dogs he comes across. At least Sean Connery, when he began the role, was in his early 30's, making the promiscuous behavior seem a little less pathetic. Connery didn't take himself as seriously as Brosnan does, either. He injected a bit of humor into his portrayal.I give the film 2 stars because of the excellent chase scene, but I think it's time for a younger James Bond. Let's let Christian Bale, Jude Law, Orlando Bloom or someone else have a crack at the role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bond film ever","review":"It's a good thing that guys like George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan are so good looking because they couldn't get a job sweeping streets in Hollywood based upon their talent.

This movie just goes to show that no will ever make Bond movies comparable to the Connerys. This terrible attempt was not only boring but I've seen better acting from vegetables. As a HUGE James Bond fan i would recommend to see any Connery movie because they are a REAL Bond Movie. What a disgrace to James Bond!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Bunch.","review":"This Bond movie is quite possibly the worst of the entire series. The plot is incredibly lacking, and Brosnan's acting is horrible (unless you compare it with that of Richard's, who has no business being in a movie at all). The only thing this movie had to offer was the appearance of R (John Cleese, incredibly funny man), Q's replacement. After this movie, I am hoping Brosnan will step down as Bond and not do a fourth. He disgraced the series with this one (though I suppose the writers should take most of the blame)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexplored Bond","review":"Infrequently in an action film series does one of its entries attempt to deal with the persona of its hero with equal intensity as it handles its plot. The director of this film tried to show how James Bond develops an obsession for a woman for whom he has become intrigued with, her having been mistreated by British Intelligence, and the effect it has on him. Unfortunately this idea never really comes satisfactorily to fruition, as the essential plot elements are not fully explored. They are forsaken at the expense of some unimaginative action sequences and a protracted additional love interest in the form of Dr. Christmas Jones. All that being said, Pierce Brosnan really has the part of James Bond down to an art and science despite the flaws in the script."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World is not Enough","review":"I'm a diehard James Bond fan, but for my money the best Bonds are (in the following order): Sean Connery (of course); Daniel Craig (Pleasantly, and surprisingly, good as Bond (my favorite since Sean Connery relinquished the role). Closer to the Bond character in the original books); and Pierce Brosnan. Honorable mention: Timothy Dalton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and utterly ridiculous","review":"They better do something to breath some new life into the Bond series because after watching this movie, things aren't looking too good. Pierce Brosnan makes a good James Bond but he can't save this film from feeling like a cheap facsimile of every other Bond movie. Also, Denise Richards is the worst piece-of-sh** actress in Hollywood (even worse than Heather Graham). She deserved every bit of that Razzie award for Worst Supporting Actress of 1999."},{"rating":"1","title":"heres something new","review":"This is the first time I've seen an action movie where the scenes in between the action sequences were actually more interesting than the action! Do we really need to see Bond being chased on skis yet again? Yawn. But the moments where he was merely trading harsh words with the villians were riviting- at least for me. By the way Electra really had Bonds number down, and thats why his cold heart melted a little bit for her in the end (a nice touch), not like Christmas who was just a one night stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as normal...but recommended.","review":"This one is a long one, but most Bond films are.

Now Peirce has the looks and accent for Bond and does it fine ... as for the co-stars ...

I have read all the \\"Ya Ya\\" books. The cover of this latest book looks like it is for or about children; it's not. The Ya Ya books follow a group of very Southern girls who are friends and relatives as they grow through the years. They tell about the fun things they do and the way they deal with each other and life in the South. They are crazy and loveable at the same time, crying, laughing, and doing outrageous things full of Southern comfort - life and drink. This latest book is about the Ya Ya's as mature women who continue to share the best times with family and each other. I smiled through every Ya Ya book, and look forward to reading more from Rebecca Wells."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weeds pulled from the earlier books","review":"Rebecca Wells must have been bugged senseless to write another book. So she dug up all the pieces that were culled from her previous two books and slapped them together with duct tape and sent it to her editor. That's the only way I can deduce that this book came about. It has no flow, it leaves random loose ends, and there is suddenly a \\"plot\\" two-thirds of the way into the book. Is it enjoyable? Enough to rate two stars. Get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vote for strange, not deranged.","review":"Not nearly as good as the first two in the series. There's a bit of feminist hogwash and gun politics at the end which is distracting from the story. I also didn't like the way she made the original YaYas seem a bit on the deranged side."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I loved the first YaYa book, enjoyed the second, and hated this one. It had no story, it resembled a book of short stories but not enjoyable ones. Clearly the author just wanted to make some quick money or something, I can't think of another reason why she would have written this. I had liked and cared about the characters, and in this book I couldn't stand any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an impressive sequel","review":"Add me to the list as well. I was not impressed. Ms. Wells drew us in with Divine Secrets and made us care about the characters so much that we all clamored for a sequel. Unfortunately, after the long wait to hear more, this is what we got. I think Ms. Wells may have been out of good ideas for our beloved characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the insanity","review":"The original Ya-Ya novel was a delight. This one is stretching the first (and second) books very thinly (and badly.)I wouldn't even finish the first quarter of the book it was so boring. Sad.I'm tired of the same characters. Want some new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-Ya's in Bloom does nothing for me...","review":"It's a darn shame! I loved the first two books in the Ya-Ya Sisterhood trilogy, but this one seemed so rushed. The lack of character development was embarrassing. This collection of stories lacked any sort of focus, other than\\" well, here's more stories about the Ya-Ya's and their offspring.\\" The final story, \\"A Star's A Seed A Seed's A Star\\" about a family holiday was dreadful to read. I had to keep referring to other stories trying to figure out who all of the characters were. I wonder if Rebecca Wells' publisher was pushing her to just get it done. If that's the case, I feel sorry for her, but she should have pushed back for the sake of a good story and a great product. This book stunk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe I'm crazy","review":"But I liked it. I laughed and giggled almost all the way through this third Ya-Ya book. I enjoyed the chapter story line even though the chapters jump around and skip decades at a time. I recognized the judgemental Myrtis for what she was and understood her chapter was a way of explaining that her nutty daughter didn't fall far from the family tree.Ms. Wells or her editors needed better proofing of the family trees on the inside covers of the book. I understand how many other readers might not like the book. In fact, I am thankful I didn't read the reviews until after I read Ya-Yas in Bloom. I enjoyed reading it; I couldn't put it down. Little Alters left a bad taste in my mouth and In Bloom turned the bitter to sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing","review":"As a big fan of Ms. Wells' first two books about the denizens of Thornton, LA, I was looking forward to reading more about characters I so loved. For example, I was hoping for some reconciliation of the good Vivi (who loved her kids so much) and the bad Vivi (who abused them and herself). I was hoping for an understanding in this third installment of how I as a reader can love such a flawed character.What I got was more of the same \\"lets be wacky and isn't that fun\\". I thought there was more to all the Ya-yas and their families. There was a tenderness found in the other two books that is lacking here. Not much more depth to the characters is developed.The careless editing will make even the most casual reader cringe.Save your money. If you are hoping to learn more about these lovely characters, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-Yas in Bloom","review":"I waited on pins and needles for this book to come out..so excited that maybe there would also be a new movie. I can't tell you how disappointed I was! I was expecting the younger years of the Ya-Yas. This book started out ok and then went downhill, all the way downhill. The writing was inconsistent, as example: When Vivi went looking for Baylor in regards to the \\"globe\\" she had to make a gin & tonic to drink first, then one to take with her. A few sentences later when she was talking with Baylor, she thought she would hit him, but didn't want to drop her \\"bourbon and water\\". The whole book was like that. Sorry I wasted my money and the next Wells book that comes out, I'll wait for a used paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems like the \\"best of the ya-yas\\"","review":"Luckily I didn't buy this book. I was on the waiting list at the library and couldn't wait to read it once it was my turn. I have had the book for over a week now and have no desire to finish it.Although it's written in an easy to read style, I was EXTREMELY disappointed by lack of originality. Many of the ya yas adventures are recapped and told from a different viewpoint. Some new ones are added, but some of the narrative is so lengthy, by the time you get to the point you don't really care what it is anyway.The book reads like a collection of short stories, with each story being told by someone else. In that sense, if you just want a quick ya ya fix, this is the book for you. On the other hand, if you are looking for an interesting story with a good plot and interesting characters, read the first ya ya book and don't bother with this recap."},{"rating":"1","title":"shelley in san diego","review":"EEEH GADS! TERRIBLE!!! The PERFECT example of an author trying to capitalize on a hit seller... and, the result is AWFUL!!! A giant mish mash of no connection or cohesiveness... just awful! Shame on the editor for even putting this book out... it's just a way to take away our hard earned dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wells' usual laughter provoking story.","review":"It does seem as though some writers are stuck with their characters and in this case, it is just the younger generation we read about. I loved the first Ya-Ya tale, enjoyed the second, but was bored to pieces on this latest. Having roots in Louisiana and knowing how southern girls hang together, I could relate to the first two books, but this one was a terrific disappointment and waste of time. Luckily it was very short and a quick read. Please Ms. Wells do better if you try for a fourth Ya Ya book. One of these days, I will write a rave review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing...","review":"I hate to echo everyone else here, but I have to agree, this new Ya-Ya book is very disappointing. I did find the beginning a bit interesting, learning about how the Ya-Ya's met was fun, but things went from mediocre in the first half of the book to just boring in the second half. I found myself thinking of finishing the book as a chore, a huge turnaround from the joy of reading the first two. I don't know if Wells was pressured into writing this, but it seems like the Ya-Ya well has definitely run dry.The writing and poor editing actually made me cringe at times.How very sad that characters who once seemed so different and new now feel like shadows, rehashing old stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I was expecting a lot more because I loved the first two books so much. I think Wells should have quit while she was ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I loved it!","review":"I just finished this book, and frankly, if you're not a Southerner, maybe you just don't get it. The stories were hard and funny and bittersweet and crazy and precious and very close to home. I don't know anything about Ms. Wells' upbringing, but she's got more flavor in these stories than peas and cornbread. Seems like she's been there! My favorite stories involved Baylor and the \\"code\\" of the men and their hunting. It's all so true. This book made me appreciate my Southern roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya Ya, Bla Bla","review":"I was disappointed in this book especially since Ya Ya Sisterhood was so good. I think the author was trying to add more to the Ya Ya books but it didn't work. It's kind of like a movie part 2 that is bad! Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and a waste of time!","review":"I am disappointed with this book. Although the book is short and should have been an easy read, I could not read more than 2 or 3 pages each night before it put me to sleep. The book is nothing more than a collection of random chapters that probably were cut from the previous two Ya-Ya books. I found myself skimming the last 100 pages, just so I could finish the book. This book is a waste of time and I will not be eager to pick up the next book from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"Did the author simply take the chapters that did not make it into the other two books to create this colossal disappointment? I bought four hardcovers at the same time-this and The Ice Queen, Lost in the Forest, and The Mermaid Chair. I'd recommend ALL of the other three, Lost in the Forest in particular. Steer clear of this one even if you are a die hard Ya-Ya fan. You will honestly wonder if you enjoyed the previous tomes as much as you thought...this is shallow and not worth your $."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad-bad","review":"wish i hadn't bought it. The story is told not shown. characters don't seem to sound the same. writing feels forced and stories don't flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Live Up To Expectations","review":"I absolutely loved the first two books in this series, so I was very excited to read the newest installment. However, this seems more like a collection of Ya Ya stories that weren't good enough for the 1st 2 books rather than the 3rd installment in a series. I am not sure of the point of the collection of stories, which are all sugar coated, and seems to me to totally contradict the message of the 1st 2 books."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTE: This book has no real plot.","review":"This book is full of cute little stories, mostly disconnected from one another. It did not keep me reading because it is NOT a page turner at all.Do not expect ANYTHING remotely as good as the Divine Secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"ya-ya no more","review":"the author's first 2 books were wonderful...just some of the best of this genre. this book reads like a last desperate attempt to squeeze juice from a dried out lemon. did her editors force her to write this? did they read it after she did?I really, really wanted to like it but the magic wasn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaah! I'll never get those three hours back!!","review":"I read \\"Divine Secrets\\" after resisting its hype. I thought I was too above it all to read a fluffy tale about Southern women. I was a snob about it. But that book drew me in, made me laugh and cry, enfolded me like a blanket. And it resonated with me, which surprised me greatly. I also liked \\"Little Altars\\" because I thought Wells was rather brave to explore some of the more disturbing aspects of the Walker/Abbot clan.So, I certainly did want to like this book. But I was disappointed. Like a bunch of loosely constructed afterthoughts, no substance, it bored me. A hilarious word picture or bon mot here and there does not represent a well-constructed novel. The Christmas play at the end--- ugh! I was actually fidgeting in embarassment.Time for the Yayas to hang it up, cherie...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add my name to the others","review":"I won't bother with a recap of this storyline since it has been done by many other reviewers.I would agree, however, with the reviewers who commented that somehow this book does not have the charm and wit of the previous books.It is a shame as this book has been a long time in coming, but it may be time to retire the Ya-Yas or at the very least make them alot more entertaining than in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing......","review":"Just finished Ya-Ya's in Bloom and I must say that it's the most disappointing piece of fluff I've read in a long time. She was too lazy to even come up with new stories, they were all the old ones with different people in them, like the woman who's daughter ends up kidnapping a petite ya ya's kid. She just totally lost the edge and emotions that made the other two books so moving and it just ended up a stupid and extremely corny bunch of drivel...two thumbs down!!!This book is so bad she should be forced to return all of our money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this written by the same author?","review":"It's difficult to believe that this novel was written by the same woman who wrote Divine Secrets and Little Altars. I kept anticipating a turn from fluff into the twists and turns and quirkiness of the previous books but it never happened. This reads like one of those minimally plotted romance novels...without the romance. I'm really disappointed; I was expecting a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"I had been a big fan of the Ya Yas and Rebecca Wells, so it was with much anticipation that I began this latest book. Unfortunately, like most sequels, it was a big disappointment. I could barely finish it. The story line was virtually non-existant; it lacked the humor and wit of the other books; and it was laden with too many random characters and child point-of-view narrations that drove me crazy. The bloom isn't even a bud, but some kind of droopy, dead stem that never quite had the gusto to live. Don't waste the money on this. I did and it definitely wasn't worth it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out good, but went nowhere!","review":"I liked the beginning of the book in which we find out how the four Ya-Ya's friendships started way back when they were little girls. But then the book strays away from all that and into a bunch of boring crap about the \\"Petites Ya-Yas.\\" The rest of the book should have been called something like \\"Things the Petites Ya-Yas Did,\\" because the majority of this book wasn't about the Ya-Yas growing up at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not really enjoy this book.","review":"It started out alright. The stories seemed random but interesting. I kept reading in the hopes that at some point it would all be pulled together and we'd be given a point. Towards the last few chapters I became too impatient and didn't even try to finish it. I lost interest in it. That is something that usually doesn't happen. Even if i don't enjoy a book, I tend to finish it just to find out what happens. I couldn't even do it with this book, as much as I love the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO FAR NOT SO GOOD","review":"This book does not hold a candle to the previous ones. It seems to be going over plowed ground as we say in Texas. I am just glad I bought the book used and saved some money, I am half way through and see no reason to continue. I was very disappointed as I loved Divine Secrets..I thought Little Altars was too 'dark' and had i read it first I probably might never had read Divine Secrets..I don't see a bit of enlightenment in this book..maybe just a 'potboiler'? Cynthia Smith, Johnson City, Texas"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really, really wanted to love it.","review":"...But I couldn't. It gets two stars because it was nice to visit with these ladies again. Like with all of my favorite series it's fun to check back in with \\"friends\\". Ms. Wells, you are a great writer...please start a new series soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO IS THE EDITOR ???","review":"I have found errors in books before but I have never seen anything quite like this. It looks as if the book was written so fast that NO ONE proof read it. I read Blood brother and found a few errors in it, but the book was good and I was o.k. with it. I then read Whispers of the wicked saints and found an error on the back cover, but that book was so incredible that I just didn't care. This book however was a complete joke. The writting was poor and the stories were old and I am angry that this writer thinks her fans are crazy enough to ever purchase anything like this again. Like I said one or two errors in a good book, no big deal. But this was crazy !!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel for Money","review":"This is an obvious case of the author using the loyalty of her fan base to create a sequel for money. I don't like being used, and my loyalty to Wells is over after reading this book. To read a disappointing book occasionally is to be expected, but as another reviewer wrote,\\"Did the author simply take the chapters that did not make it into the other two books to create this colossal disappointment?\\" My thoughts exactly. The charm of the Ya Ya's ended with this one. Don't waste your money buying it or your time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be finishing it.","review":"I was so excited to see this book at my local book store, since I enjoyed the first two Ya-Ya books so much. I started it as soon as I got home, and was immediately disappointed. I kept reading, thinking that it would improve. Wrong! Could this possibly be the same author who wrote Little Altars and Divine Secrets?? Hard to believe. The writing style is completely different - another reader said \\"cheesy\\" and I agree. It lacks the richness of the first two books. What happened to Rebecca Wells from the time she finished Divine Secrets and started this book? Luckily it was 50% off! Maybe I'll be able to get $6.00 for it when I sell it at Half-Price Books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well *I* liked it!","review":"Didn't love it, but I liked it. Not as emotion-churning as the other 2 Ya Ya books, and that's ok. The kidnapping thing was a tad over the top, but then so are the Ya Yas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and trite.","review":"The first novel was magnificent. The second one was pretty good. This one is not worth your money. Wells is trying far too hard to make the characters funny and touching in this book. It comes off trite and cheesy, especially the last story, which is positively smarmy.The portrayal of African-Americans in this book is borderline racist and stereotyped. Southern black people are not half-wits. I half expected one of the black characters to bust out with a \\"Mo' biscuits, mastah?\\"Another reviewer had it right when she called the main characters \\"caricatures\\" of themselves; that's exactly what they are.Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bloom to this story","review":"I wish I had read these reviews before spending money on this book. \\"Little Altars\\" was superb storytelling. \\"Divine Secrets\\" was good, but a bit melodramatic. I'm halfway through this book and bored with it. The storytelling is trite and the characters seem unreal compared to their portrayal in the earlier books.Reading this book is a bit like drinking a flat soda. If you really want to read it, wait until \\"Bloom\\" goes into remainders. Sorry, Ms Wells, it's time to say \\"ta ta\\" to the Ya Yas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tres blah...","review":"I loved \\"Divine Secrets\\" and \\"Little Altars\\" and now I think I will have to re-read them in order to erase the memory of Wells' latest book. As the other reviewers said, there was no substance or depth of character. There were glimmers of the charm found in the other two books, such as Baylor's story, but these were few and far between. The Christmas pageant at the end was excrutiatingly bad. I have to wonder if the author dashed this book off at the publisher's request."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-Ya no","review":"This book has the feel of desperation -- Wells attempting to cash in on two successful previous books, and failing miserably. She recycles many of the anecdotes in the other books, expanding on them unnecesarily. Wells chooses to expand on minor characters from the other books, such as Edythe Spevey -- while ignoring the fate of Sidda and Connor, who finally reconciled and wed at the end of Divine Secrets. More readers would undoubtedly like to hear about the newlyweds, esp. given the turmoil they experienced before. But aside from a few quick mentions, Siddalee may as well no longer exist.Sorry, Ms. Wells, but you should have quit while you were still ahead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya Ya's InComprehensible","review":"Ya Ya's In Bloom reads as if it were all the garbage that had been mercifully edited out of Wells' last two novels, jumbled up and regurgitated. It is rambling and pointless. Just about the only thing that blooms in this novel are the migrane-inducing mid-paragraph POV shifts and bad prose. Don't waste your money!I bought it because I fell in love with her characters from Divine Secrets, especially Vivi and Caro, but sadly this book almost erases that love. Books like this are why bestsellers get a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRES DISAPPOINTING","review":"I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SEQUEL-IT'S NOT WHAT I WAS YEARNING FOR. MOST OF THE STORY IS BUILT AROUND THEMES FROM THE PREVIOUS TWO BOOKS BUT SLIGHTLY MORE DESCRIPTIVE. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF NEW STORY TO SINK YOUR TEETH INTO. I ALSO FELT LIKE THE AUTHOR TRIED TO \\"PRETTY UP\\" PREVIOUS CHARACTERS WHO I FELT WERE MORE REAL. THIS VIVI STILL CUSSES BUT IS NOT THE CHARACTER SHE WAS IN THE PREVIOUS NOVELS. MAYBE WE WERE ASKING TOO MUCH OF REBECCA WELLS TO GIVE US MORE AFTER SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. I FELT THIS WAS A BOOK WRITTEN TO MEET A PUBLISHERS DEMAND AND NOT ONE FROM THE HEART LIKE THE FIRST TWO. WAIT UNTIL THE PAPERBACK COMES OUT TO BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock characters and none of our Ya-Yas in sight","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment that I have had reading anything in a long time.The entire draw of the ya-yas was the fully developed nature of their characters and their believability, even their familiarity.All of that is gone in this book. I couldn't bring myself to care about anyone or anything, and all I was left with was a stunned disbelief that the same author who had written such poetry in Divine Secrets had written such recycled drudgery here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"I actually couldn't even finish this book, it just started to become torture every time I looked at it! And I was moved so much by the ya yas. I felt that these were the imperfect parents no one told you about in books, this book seemed to forget all that and make up new characters to replace the ones I really loved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ya-Ya Leftovers","review":"I very much enjoyed the first two Ya-Ya books, so picked this one up expecting more enjoyable reading.Unfortunately, it's only suitable for Ya-Ya fans who must have more stories of the Walker clan. This book amounts to nothing but left-overs. It appears to be charater sketches that were discarded for use in the first two books. Like the other books it's a collection of vignettes; but this book is more hodge-podge than its predecessors - and doesn't seem to have common plot. The third time Ya-Yas book seems boring; and has way too many characters; - you need the family tree on the book's cover to keep up with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,YOU'LL BE SORRY","review":"WASTE OF MONEY & TIME,2 SO CALLED SEARCHES SHOWED NIGHT VISION IMAGES OF 4 \\"INVESTIGATORS IN THE WOODS\\" CLAIMING TO HEAR/FEEL A PRESCENCE.

The song about Luke's 90210 feet is the one that hooked me. Not so much the lyrics, which are very humorous, but the music got me. I was amazed that I hadn't heard of this band before. I like REM (Micheal Stipe being Smoke/Opal Foxx's early benifactor), I like Kelly Hogan (The Jody Grind/Atlanta connection), and I like Tom Waits (Benjamin's vocal doppelganger). I mean, somebody could have said something to me! Anyway, now I know and you should too. However, this is not smooth music. This will not slide through you like a baby elephant walk would. This is more like swallowing a bunch of bad pennies, and then coughing them up the next morning. Or like that singular hair on my back, ugly and proud. When I was younger I would have plucked it.

In the past I have really enjoyed some of her books like Her Own Rules and Act of Will and also disliked some of her titles like Angel and Dangerous to Know. And I am one of the few people who could never get into A Woman of Substance (Bradford's blockbuster saga which has two other books in the series and was also made into a mini-series). Well, I'm afraid that her newest book is one which I can't wait to finish.

This story has holes you could drive a truck through. The characters are flat, the action non-existent. It's bad! BAD! BAD!Spoiler warning - two quick examples. The entire story is based on two children ages 5 and 10, being best friends. Ain't goona happen. And, in one crucial scene, two dying women are found shot on the floor, and their rescuer(?) calls an ambulance, then makes a pot of tea and sits there for 30 minutes.

And I was supposed to cheer for two characters who fell in love \\"off-page\\"? At least give me something more to work with.As it was, the writing, especially the dialogue, was overwraught and stilted. Who says to someone \\"Come sit in the chair opposite me\\"? Somehow, stage direction became confused with conversation.Perhaps if I'd listened to the unabridged version of this story, I'd have fewer complaints.

The big question is, Why do they keep putting out her stuff? Even her biggest fans seem to have moved on. I know I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past page 25!","review":"The book is simply poorly written. It lacks literary creativity and after reading many cliche phrases such as \\"it was so quiet, you could hear a pin drop,\\" after only reaching page 25, I wondered if this author has ever grasped for new and original lines of thinking.Also, there is a early \\"secret\\" concerning Claire that is discovered by Megan in the first section titled \\"1972,\\" that is so predictable that it makes me believe that either the author wanted us to figure this out or that she takes us all for complete imbeciles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sudden Change of Heart","review":"It is sad when an author gets a multi-million dollar book contract, and manages to create a book that obviously written to meet a deadline. There are a few tricks to make a short story into a novel and it is very apparent that the author needed to use most of them. How many time's do the characters 1st & last names need to appear? If this were a Mario Puzo novel it would be acceptable, but there are only a few characters in this book. Also, do we really need the characters history repeated everytime we are reintroduced to that said character. This is a really poorly written book and I am really sorry I ever wasted my time reading it. You would be better off picking up Danielle Steele's lastest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one.","review":"Is someone ghost-writing BTB's books now? Or did someone ghost-write \\"A Woman of Substance\\"? Almost every book after her 1st have been poorly (swiftly?) written. In this one, she brings lots of today's current issues to the fore, without much detail of any of them; e.g., breast cancer, ebola virus, incest, spousal & child abuse, Nazi-looted art work, bisexuality. Gee, what did she miss? Maybe only the Bill & Monica story! Her dialogue was unnatural (no one speaks like that!), her characters underdeveloped, & a too fairy tale-like ending. I should have known she was going downhill when I couldn't finish even a 1/4 of \\"Angel\\" & wondered if the same author had written \\"Everything to Gain\\" as \\"Woman of Substance\\". I stopped reading her after that one & should have stayed stopped!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed with this book.","review":"This book does not capture the usual style of Barbara Taylor Bradford. Though the main characters were developed well, the dialogue was always too \\"plastic\\" and unreal. People do not talk to one another in that fashion! The plot was also not very well developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed....","review":"As a die hard fan of BTB, I was so looking forward to this book coming out. Tracking it thru a variety of sources I finally ordered it before availability date through Amazon. When it arrived, I settled in with a cup of tea, fuzzy blanket and snuggling kitties. Bummer - unlike her previous novels, this one was \\"air popped\\". Usually filled with sharp images of color, atmosphere, emotion, china/silver, places and characters who are friends, it was like a TV movie version of a delicious book - watered down, too many blank spaces in imagery and complacent characters (except for Megan!). Also,I stumbled on dialog that had contemporary American women in their early 30's calling each other \\"dear\\". Sorry - didn't ring true. Boohoo; I'm so disappointed! Next BTB book? - I'll wait for other readers reviews or until it's available at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does she still get published?","review":"Barbara Taylor Bradford's Woman of Substance was so rich, so well written and so immediate, that the author's first effort made us believe everything that followed would be its equal. This, unfortunately, has not happened. In A Sudden Change of Heart, Bradford's characters are so well-off and so shallow in their daily lives that we do not believe they have the capacity to suffer in the midst of terminal illnesses or remembered past sadnesses. Bradford has steadily gone downhill. Finding myself skipping pages that were so predictable, I imagined Bradford really struggling to get through A Sudden Change of Heart simply to meet a deadline. No agent or publisher would even look at a manuscript like this if the author were not already established as the icon, Barbara Taylor Bradford."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"As a formerly ardent fan of Barbara Taylor Bradford's books I was tremendously disappointed with her latest, A Sudden Change of Heart. I read the rambling, waiting for a plot to develop, but never found it. Several times I thought a story line was developing only to be disappointed. This book was definitely not up to the standard we've come to expect from Ms. Bradford. Too bad. Her early works were delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me Cry","review":"I've read most of BTB's books. When I'm done with them, I donate them or sell them. But to me \\"A Sudden Change of Heart\\" was one of her best and I'm keeping it.Even though I agree with some of the other readers, that the \\"language\\" the characters spoke was a bit antiquated and formal, I really enjoyed the book.I was at a doctor's appointment today, and I started to tear while I was reading what happened to Claire. I had to stop for awhile.The friendship between Laura and Claire is very much alike to my best friend and me. We've known each other since we're 5 & 6 - and we'll be celebrating our 30th anniversary next year - so this kind of friendship does exist.Don't be afraid to buy this book. Try it, you may like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had heard that Bradford writes \\"good reads.\\" If it hadn't been for my curiosity about how she resolved the issues of the stolen paintings, I wouldn't have bothered to finish it. The characterizations were so simplistic. Everyone is so NICE! Doug and Laura split without an angry word. Rosa is so sweet. Megan is saccharine. I'm sorry. It just didn't work for me. The writing was bloated. The \\"lambent\\" lighting put it over the top. I'll shy away from Bradford from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not Bradford at her best ...","review":"I wondered as I read this if Ms. Bradford had written this novel much earlier on, and was able to publish it now after she has reached success with other books. This one is so shallow, so jerky, and so filled with characters who are so wooden that I can't believe Ms. Bradford, who is ordinarily a talented writer of engrossing women's contemporary novels, actually wrote this. What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The main character is nice but boring...","review":"The book did not draw me into this main character.

A little too out there for me - but Kansas is still a classy group."},{"rating":"1","title":"No return indeed....","review":"Altough all the musicians are really gifted, the sound here is so thin, polished, outdates, that I think these great songs deserved a \\"re-recorded\\" album.I had heard great thing about these albums and, before buying it, all I had from Kansas was a live compilation from 1986 (King Biscuit Flower Hour), that I bought due to Steve Morse being in the band at that time, not for Kansas! The sound there is much more heavy and crispy and tight than the original versions (maybe it's just the difference from 1977 to 1986).So, I surely am dissapointed with POINTO OF KNOW RETURN (and what a silly joke this title!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is a GREAT album.

I think its the strongest release I've heard of theirs (which runs from the first through Audio Visions.) This record in my opinion is kind of the genesis (not to be confused with the band Genesis) of progressive metal. It certainly didn't start with Sabbath or Deep Purple. When I think of stuff like Fates Warning, Queensryche, Iron Maiden, I can honestly hear the origins of that style in the heavier songs on Point of Know Return. A great record.

The main change is the shoulder strap. It stays put. I fought that strap daily on the old bag. It has been wonderful that it once i got it where I wanted it, it has stayed put.There were not any lanyard pulls on the zipper as were pictured and as came with the old bag. So, I took some cord I had laying around and made some.

She's all set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as pictured","review":"I received the bag and was curious about the description on the tag that the zippered front pocket includes \\"additional mesh and stuff pockets\\". They weren't there. Looking at the pictures on Amazon it's clear that the interior on my bag is different from the picture. No mesh, no stuff pockets. It has one large pocket, one small pocket (phone) and four very small credit-card sized pockets. It is still a usable bag for me, and I don't plan to return it, but items should be as they are pictured."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to love it, but I don't","review":"Overall the material is durable. I can fit a 16 oz. contigo coffee cup in the pouch. My iphone with otter box fits in the side pocket with flap, but not on the strap. The otter box makes the phone too big for this space. I have tried wearing this a few ways, none are real comfortable. The strap cuts into my neck. I like the size of the bag and pouches. My ipad with otter box fit in the big pouch but made the bag heavier than I'd like. My wallet fit just OK in the second largest pouch. My wallet is a trifold and the width didn't work real great. I didn't want to place it in the larger area's and rifle through stuff to get to it. I'm not comfortable putting my credit card and drivers license in the slots build into the bag. I wish the bottom had a different material to clean after setting it down in various places. I want to love it...but I don't.

Basically I wanted something to carry what we needed, sunscreen, money, tickets, tissues and camera. The bag carried that and had plenty of room for more if needed. The cross body design is wonderful, less strain on back/shoulders. There is also a mesh side pocket that I carried a bottle of water in. There are separate pockets, built in change pockets and a small compartment on the strap to put smaller things, money, keys, etc.. in. I now use this bag as my everyday purse, it is comfortable and sylish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the bag I was looking for...","review":"I knew this was the bag I was looking for after reading the reviews and it's lived up to my expectations. One other thing I didn't see mentioned in the reviews is that the contents don't fall out of their interior pockets if the bag is turned upside down by accident. Also, if I forget to zip up one of the outside compartments while I'm wearing it, the contents won't fall out as I'm moving around with it. These are problems I've had with other bags in the past.

The bag's material is flimsy and light, while the strap is heavy and bulky, made of something like seatbelt webbing, it's really slippery and falls off your shoulder. The bag looks much bigger in the picture than it really is. Not a messenger bag at all, more like a little purse - for those who actually need their bag to carry more than keys and a wallet, the large compartment is not really big enough.

Also, there are questions at the end of each topic you can quiz yourself on and then answers are provided for you to check your response against.

I'd say that would be the main reason to get it. I think other supplements are better at clearing up confusing areas, but the E+E series is the best if you need examples and hypos to practice with. For me, that was a big necessity as our exam was just one long hypo. I tend to get very anxious in exams and I knew I needed a lot of practice to feel comfortable. In addition to old exams our professor gave us to work with, I used E+E and I'm very happy I did. There were areas I was shaky on and this book helped me clear those up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong one","review":"Thought it had information for both Torts 1 and 2 but it only covered Torts 1 which I already took and did fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good supplement","review":"Before I get into the good things about this book, I have all the E+E's for my first year classes and the problem I have with all of them is that they don't cover a lot of the subjects that are covered in each class, which sometimes leaves me resorting to other sources or supplements if I don't understand something, or to help me outline. With that being said, the material is does cover is done very well. The examples and explanations part is very very helpful in preparing for exams, as well as for learning the material, and are the best part of the E+E series (hence the title of the books). I haven't seen any amazing torts supplements out there, but this is definitely one of the better ones.The last chapter of the book also does an excellent job talking about exam writing and explaining the IRAC method. So if you need an extra boost in torts or just want something to reinforce what you are learning in class, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Doctrinal Overview","review":"This book was extremely helpful and accessible for illustrating general doctrine; however, although it discusses a smattering of major cases (e.g., Palsgraf) and other minor cases that may or may not appear in your torts textbook, it does not provide substantial depth for these cases and does not address important dissents (such as Andrews' dissent in Palsgraf), so you shouldn't attempt to rely on it for that purpose. You could easily get through torts without this book, but given the nature of law school curves, why not give yourself every advantage?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a best buy","review":"Ordered 7 of these lights. 4 of the boxes were damaged but the lights do work.

Add to this that the acting was rather painful and the special effects were anything but special and you are left with 1 star.

I'm not going to waste bandwidth presenting my Stills bona fides. Suffice it to say, I'm dumbstruck as to what Stills, his management, his wife, his kids or his agent thought would be achieved by releasing this CD. Treetop Flyer is the one semi-gem in this collection, and I agree with the others who've posted their dislike of the electrified acoustical insturmentation. It's pure Vegas. But gawdamn it, I bought it anyways in spite of the reviews. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice thought, mediocre execution","review":"Had Stills recorded this album in 1970, it would have been a masterpiece, but by the time he got around to recording his first solo acoustic record, his chops were not half of what they had been, and his voice showed the wear of a thousand nights on the road. On the very best tracks here -- such as \\"Hollis Brown\\" -- there's a seasoned, soaked-in-mystery quality that does credit to Stills' former stature. But listen to the unnecessary remake of \\"Singin' Call,\\" which was one of the highlights of Stephen Stills 2. He blows the phrasing, the fingerpicking doesn't have half the force of the earlier version, and instead of sounding like a transmission from a mountaintop, it sounds like a weary recital from a porch. As a longtime fan, I wish this had been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem","review":"I listen to this one over and over. My favorites are the tunes the guitar is really featured on like \\"The Ballad of Hollis Brown\\", \\"Singing' Call\\", \\"Blind Fiddler Medley\\", and \\"Treetop Flyer\\". I don't understand all the criticism of \\"Singing' Call\\" is see in these reviews. It's awesome, it's my favorite tune. His voice sounds younger on that tune than all the others, so it's probably a leftover track from a recording session long ago. I don't see why that's a problem. I like to crank it and listen to those guitar strings buzz like crazy on the killer ending. I also tend to play it along side the other version from Stephen Stills 2 since that one's good too (but I like this one better)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT!","review":"Great guitar, superb picking, great vocals, and pleasing to the ears.

Wow, there were such other good songs on board this album. This is like Stephen Stills best work. A must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Solid","review":"This record has its own sort of charm, and I like most of the music in principle. That said, though, there's something remarkably sub-par about this. To say that Stephen's voice is decimated is a large understatement. On the surface, it has a nice acoustic guitar feel, but once one listens to a few songs, it becomes apparent that something is wrong with the plunky guitar licks. They just don't fit. I love Stephen Still's music, but this just isn't up there among my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"So massively disappointing.","review":"The only problem with this is the recording of the guitar. It is an electrified acoustic run into a board off a contact pickup and is sounds like Stills is playing a block of cheese with strings. And, for me, this is a massive problem because it robs the album of everything it could have been. The sound of a vintage acoustic - and Still owns a bunch of pre-WWII Martins including at least one original D-45 - recorded with a high quality microphone is exquisite (check out David Grisman's \\"Tone Poems\\" series if you want a reference) and it's what this album should be. The decision to record the instrument in the manner here ruins the album. Reviews are subjective by nature so let me say that it ruins it for me, entirely. Anyone interested in this record should know about this shortcoming and, if it isn't a big distraction for you, then you will probably enjoy it as the material and performances are fine. Other than it being unlistenably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Introduction","review":"This little book is neither a good introduction nor clear. To his credit, unlike other scholars writing on the topic of Thomistic moral philosophy, McInerny does not use technical or rare words in which to impress others with his knowledge. However, he writes in question form and somewhat like he is trying to write a work of fiction, not philosophy. His sentences are hard to follow. Again, it is not a matter of depth. He is not speaking over anyone's head... He has kept his ideas simple in attempts to make them available to the general public. However, if one does not already possess a working knowledge of Natural Law, then one is very likely to get confused by his writing style, in which one could get lost in his little scenerios and rhetorical type questions leaving the beginner wondering what exactly the point is. If you are a beginner and really want a good introduction, then I recommend, \\"Thomistic Renaissance - The Natural Moral Law\\" by Rev.

However, this some what limits him in his arrangements. Gary is forced to fill the tracks with a cheap sounding synthesizer/keyboard. This is unfortunate due the sterile and motionless feel of the instrument which sounds like midi computer music. His voice is beautiful and powerful, as it never fails to soar. His song writing on the album is genius. He is a true talent. If you wish to enjoy this fully, I would recommend one of his previous, professionally produced albums.

Peter Greene(Under Siege2, Pulp Fiction)plays another badguy, like we havent seen that over and over again, he really needs to get better roles. Christopher McDonald(Terminal Velocity, Quiz Show)plays Halle Berry's wife and who dies. Things happen and it gets all crappy and once you know it the movie is done with.

The cover alone was enough to warn me about the validity (or lack thereof) of this book. As I have read several books on Witchcraft/Wicca, the first thing I looked at (after the cover of course) was the love spell(s). The spell/s listed actually required you to take the bodily secretions or hair clippings from your intended victim, & use those things to bind this person to you.As a practitioner, I know that this is simply wrong. It goes completely against the principles of \\"harm none\\" and \\"free will.\\" You can't \\"make\\" someone fall in love with you, no matter what anybody may tell you.

I flipped over his voice when he sang on several episodes and thought this cd would be amazing. I had it on my wish list for a long time and my husband finally surprised me with it for my birthday last year.It took me four days to listen to it all the way through and I think I only listened to it the one time. Tony Head's voice is great BUT the music and background vocals are awful. The songs are not well written. Just blah. Listening to the cd I kept thinking if I could find a way to take the music and backup vocals and lower their volume WAY down so I could listen to Tony sing better. The songs might be better than I think but the bad music and backup vocals are so distracting I just can't tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least the Title Was Appropriate","review":"I was truly disappointed with this album.

Anyone who is familiar with the musical episode of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer will agree. Based on that performance, I purchased this CD.What a mistake.

Music for Elevators provides soothing, intriguing music with poetic lyrics that will grab you by the heart and give a good pull. Anthony Stewart Head's voice blends beautifully into the instrumentals creating a package that is exotic and soulful, and that opens up a vacation for the mind. Close your eyes and let this music carry you away. You won't find many moments like this in your life. Music for Elevators truly is music for anywhere and any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique Piece of Work","review":"I found this CD to be stimulating.

Giles from Buffy) Shines","review":"I bought this like most people, because of the connection that A.S.H. has with Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I had heard him sing on the show a few times. But never really heard his range until now. This is one of my favorite CD's and I tell everyone about him to try and get them to buy it. Because I want him to come out with another one. His melodic voice is well suited for this style of music. Which is somewhere between Alternitive and Jazz. My favorites ar #11 \\"Last Time\\" and #3 \\"Owning My Mistakes\\" and #8 \\"This Town in the Rain\\". I highly recommend this album to anyone interested in new styles of music from a great singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for Elevators","review":"I have to say that when I first heard of this CD I was pleased.

Definetly a great CD for a fan of ranges of music. I think what's best about this CD though, great music that it is, is that it's easy to relate to. Many of these songs I related to well... which was a nice switch from the more widely known songs played on the radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Gabriel and Seal combined","review":"I love this CD! I ordered the CD as a lark, but I have been pleasantly surprised! Anthony Stewart Head has a sometimes haunting, sometimes ethereal voice, that is complemented by his choice of lyric and musical accompaniment. Buffy fans will be thrilled with the additions of other cast members, but this is a must for any collection whether a Buddy fan or not. There are hints of older Gabriel in some of the songs and an occasional styling similar to Seal. Although, don't let that fool you, Anthony Stewart Head is no copy cat here.

The musical style was very different from what I expected but it was a pleasant surprise. The lyrics are well written, poignant and stay with you. Overall, I like the CD very much and hope to hear that Anthony Stewart Head will release more music. And, as a fan of all things created by and connected to Joss Whedon, I hope that he'll continue to write songs for Tony to sing and that Amber Benson, James Marsters, and Alyson Hannigan will continue to make guest appearances! It's a thrill for fans like me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprising CD","review":"I orginally bought this CD because i was a fan of ASH's work as an actor on Buffy (BtvS). i knew that he had a good singing voice because of his work on that show- particularly in episodes like 'restless\\" and \\"once more with feeling\\". I was surprised to find out how much i enjoyed his debut cd- it is refreshingly different, melodic with techno beat.The standout songs include:Babies ( the inbetween)Owning my mistakesAll the fun of the FairLast time--written by Joss Whedom and could be part of the BTVS musicalI also appreciated the hidden tracks- bonus songs that include James Marsters (spike) and that amber benson (tara) was back up vocals.The more i listen to this CD, the more i like it and I still listen to it even though i have had it for months. It is a refreshing change from pop tunes and power ballads. I am sure that ASH's fans will appreciate his talents but i can recommend this CD to music lovers everywhere, who want a different CD to add to their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review from Oregon","review":"I was frankly disappointed. Tony Head has such a marvelous voice, as do the other people involved in this CD, and to hardly be able to make out the words on many of the cuts due to the overpowering music, especially the drums, left me wishing I could have heard it before purchase.

If I had never even heard of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" however, I would still love the album as a music fan. Anthony Head has an amazing and rich voice that stirs your heart, though it would be much better suited to an acoustic accompaniment. The lyrics, as well, are stirring and dramatic. Tracks like \\"Owning My Mistakes\\" and \\"This Town in the Rain\\" are pure poetry. The only track I don't enjoy is Head's remake of \\"We Can Work it Out,\\" which is just a little too eerie and melancholy for a song designed to be light and cheery. Non-\\"Buffy\\" fans will appreciate the knowledge that the CD is not in-jokey, neither does it feature extensive work by Head's costars. While I think that going with such heavy electronic sounds for backup was a poor choice, it in no way diminishes the wonder and beauty of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another pretty face","review":"I bought the album on a whim, and I've been pleasantly surpised. Even my 12 yr.old daughter who is a die hard country music fan loves this album. His choice of lyrics and songs show he has a deep sense of the world around him. His voice touches your heart. Although the style is not something I'm used to, it picks you up and takes you along for the ride. Cut #2 \\"babies[the in between]\\", makes me cry, thinking about time away from my own children and #12 \\"one man's rain\\" with it's spiritual veiw of our connection to each other and to the world we live in, is a favorite even with my six year old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC FOR ELEVATORS","review":"I Love the music the words and am a big fan.

The fact that he is handy with his specialty Sharps makes him a dangerous man with whom to tangle. He tends to think while acting, but some things apparently require little thought - like when he thows Marston out the window for the rancher's nasty proposal.

I did not purchase this video labelled \\"blu-ray\\" for the same substandard 2.0 (flagrantly advertised- surround sound? -one speaker in front & one in back?) stereo performance now inherited in with most of my favorite classics!

I'm just seeing snippets between internet surfing and reading. Selleck looks okay, but he just doesn't have what it takes to carry this kind of film. Far as I'm concerned, his show was a bore too. The only memorable part is some disturbing footage of the young lady shooting a pack of dingos and that was painful to watch. The stuff with the aborigines - just the usual pile of Hollywood dung.I recomend this movie for people who are infatuated with Tom Selleck. There seems to be quite a few of them.

No, this is the Sharps 1874 and this is Tom Selleck... both great westerns where the rifle is as much a main character as the people and the vital supporting actor. Both are classic movies. What I really enjoy in Quigley is everything is upside down... where the good guys are the natives, the bad guys are the ranchers and cavalry, and the single shot buffalo gun is the equalizer... in the hands of a good shot.The ending showdown is one of the greatest in westerns. For the first time viewer, let the moment flow... even in reruns it never gets old. The western lives on and the fight between good and evil .. in a foreign land ... is both timeless and universal...

What a SCAM! I received the long awaited item and the video quality was not great, but certainly good, and given the beautiful scenery in the movie we all enjoyed the video portion immensely. My big disapointment was with the audio when I discovered that there was no surround sound on the blu ray. What you get is stereo like the old VHS tapes! I'm sure you'll hear that it's really good stereo, but it's stereo nonetheless. I was shocked since I don't even remember buying a DVD without at least 5.1 surround, much less a blu ray. That's my gripe and now I'm in the market for the real fully functional blu ray of Quigley when it comes out.

But for me it was like attending a boring class where the only correct answer was the answer that the instructor gave...I was missing the *creativity* that is so attractive for me in other photography-books.

(compared to Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson, for instance)2. Most of the illustrations are ugly. I don't know if the author just threw the pictures in it to make the points or I just can't understand the greatness of those pictures. But in my opinion, they are ugly.

They are well written, informative, and candid. When Longstreet disagreed with someone, he states it. If he disagreed with a strategy, such as at Gettysburg, he states it and gives his view of what should have happened. Although this looks like a case of Longstreet trying to say his way would have won, I personally believe he was simply being honest. While Longstreets memoirs can be dry when he talks of strategies and tactics, it is still a informative, entertaining book. I would rank Longstreet's memoirs only behind Grant's, Sherman's, E.P. Alexander's, and Richard Taylor's underrated Destruction and Reconstruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating Typos in Kindle Version","review":"While the book itself is proving to be an interesting read for anyone wanting a confederate view point of the Civil War, I am highly disappointed with the Kindle version of this book. Yes it was cheap, but that doesn't give an excuse for multiple typing errors. I've never had this problem with a Kindle version of a publication. It has gotten to the point where I feel I need to double check everyone's names as they have gotten R.E. Lee wrong at least twice, typing it as B.E. Lee. Did the publisher formatting this even check to make sure it was typed correctly? For the most part, things are okay, but there are enough typos for me to notice and it is becoming distracting from the actual work itself, which defeats the point of reading it.

Mari's new love, Andy, has a great deal in his past that requires a forgiving heart, at the same time he has to discover what it means to forgive others. His struggle is all the more poignant given his choice of work -- in a camp for troubled boys. This latter setting deepens an already-rich story as the backgrounds of the troubled boys are revealed. It's no wonder the author dedicated the book to those who work with such kids. The author is a master of description.

Flash here, there, stop, go, slow down, speed up, insert a loud obnoxious noise, quick everyone talk at once -- it goes on for over two hours. The shot of Pacino in tears on a split screen with a football would have been laughable had it not been so pathetic.

Stone, with his testosterone-driven, over-the-top style, was born to make THE definitive movie about pro football, and this is it. And it's not just about hikes and huddles and \\"big, sweaty mens\\" tackling each other. It's also about race, age, American culture, the stuff of life in general. Great action. Great music. Pacino's \\"Inches\\" speech is the best macho film speech since the opening scene of Patton. (Play it to get yourself going Monday morning.) The distracting, silly, not-authorized-by-the-NFL logos and team names are distracting, but it's otherwise as good as a pro football film can get. It's a guy thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been great!","review":"I found this movie to be awful! The pace could've been kicked up, enabling the movie to flow together more cohesively. The scenes seemed to be disjointed, one minute here, the next minute there, but it didn't alleviate the drag of the story line. While it did capture the feel of the NFL, the uniforms, the people working on the sidelines, the coaches etc. the movie floundered when it attempted to get an important point across. This could've been put together so much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Talent","review":"This film had a few interesting moments, but in the end it was nothing but a raunchy, loud, sensory assault.

The game sequences seemed like they were taken from ESPN's \\"Best Of\\" compilations. And Al Pacino (as great as he is) was unconvincing as a professional football coach. You didn't really see him as a coach character, but as \\"Al Pacino.\\"There were some decent performances from some big-name actors, but the foul language overshadowed much of the enjoyment that could have been had from watching a good sports film. It is simply unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland movie with unlikeable characters","review":"Is it a rule that Oliver Stone can't make a movie under 4 hours? Or maybe it just seemed that way as I labored through this one. The major problem is the character development. Dennis Quaid is injured within five minutes and, I guess, we want him to return to his dominant form-though we are only going on what they tell us. Enter the 3rd string guy-and he starts to shine. His character is unlikeable and that never changes. So when Quaid comes back-you don't want either of them to play.

While the weak story line is pumped up by pretentious screaming and overacting, a not uncommon feature of some oh-so-serious dramas being made lately, what sets this film apart is its incompetence. It is truly startling how poorly constructed and amateurish Oliver Stone's latest effort is. The camera work at times is downright childish. Watching the football scenes becomes painful. How many slow-motion downfield passes can you show in one film? Avoid at all costs. (And keep the kiddees away, this film borders on being x-rated.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of...","review":"This movie was a major disappointment to me, partly because I have trouble accepting anything about football as a \\"serious\\" movie. The plot was innane, the characters so-so and the movie was way too long. It was a real yawn fest. I still can't believe I actually sat through this entire tripe.

I don't know for u guys but is quite embarracing to take your girl to a film like that.

Oliver Stone may be the most overrated director of our generation. The scenes are not realistic at all, instead while watching the movie you feel like you're inside a video game. And Cameron Diaz is absolute horrible as the chick owner. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a music video... not a film.","review":"To me it's hard to believe that this simple and obvious film was endorsed by the master Oliver Stone himself. The film is not worthy of his reputation.And don't stone me but Al Pacino is not the image of football coach. They have a certain personna and presence that Pacino just didn't embody in this film. Nor did any of the great NFL legends who appeared. Come on... Johnny Unitas as a coach. Please. He, Jim Brown, LT (who actually was perfect for this film), and Dick Butkus just didn't fit the mold. Are they all worthy of adoration certainly but from the film's perspective they were out of place.The characters aren't sufficiently developed and the intensity is lacking not to mention the fact that the pace of the film and particular scenes moved entirely to rapidly. Too many images in too short of a period of time.A disappointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cast was all wrong for this movie.","review":"I picked up this movie knowing that during the shooting they had problems getting the talent they wanted...I just didn't think that it would show this badly in the finished product. Pacino was good, but not great...too bad since I'm a big Pacino fan. Cameron Diaz was a waste in this movie... As for the rest they aren't worth mentioning.Unless you're a serious fan of football I wouldn't recommend this movie...It has it's moments, but so does a visit to the dentist...I do give it 2 stars however due to the fact that the directing was excellent, and the cinematography was very well done... Oliver Stone did the best he could do with this movie, but he should stick to what he's good at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This movie is one big, loud contrivance. Badly written, and shot with quick cuts like a TV commericial or music video. And Al Pacino gives another yell-every-line-like-a-deaf-man performance. What happened to the subtle acting of his early career? The only reason I'm not giving it only one star is Cameron Diaz is lovely to look at, and Dennis Quaid in fact does a first-rate acting job in his role, and Jamie Foxx acts well, too.

What I didn't expect was its LENGTHY length of nearly three hours of seeing jolting, herky jerky camera movements and hard-core football images that we never see on ESPN or Monday night football. This is 100% man's flick and then some. Oliver Stone has a talent for telling the raw nature of events in his stories and this one is no exception. I had trouble finding a storyline because of the frenzied editing and vibrant soundtrack. Not everyone will be ready to see such scenes that take place in the locker room where the players unleash their pent-up frustration with no shame. Some scenes may cause head turning, such as one instance where we see full frontal nudity. However, this didn't appeal to me that much, but if you are a die-hard football fan this this flick is made just for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: horrible","review":"How many more football cliches could Oliver Stone have cashed in on? - the player risks his long-term health to play in the big game - the owner who wants a new stadium deal - the owner who threatens to move the team - over the hill coach who wonders if he can still cut it - aging star being pushed by the rookie - flashy player who can't be reigned in by the coach - trainer with questionable morals - out of control team has orgy at party and so on and so onDo yourself a favor, pass on this movie.

Coach Switzer is just one of the many famous folk suiting up in Oliver Stone's quasi-expose of NFL football. The many cameos make this movie fun. Perhaps it's a modern football-as-morality play.

The only bright spot is Jamie Foxx, in a role that lets him run around as an egotistical football player.

It was not good, not interesting, and not appealing.I did NOT enjoy the cinematography. It was out of place, obnoxious, and completely irritating. I remember one scene with Lauren Holly and Denis Quaid that started off promising, but then shot to a smaller screen so that some crap could be shown, too. It hacked me off. The two stars are for the decent preformances. Pretty much the whole cast was good. Although James Woods and Cameron Diaz were not at their best. They still did the job. However, they did not help the movie come out positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every cliche in the playbook -- plus a lousy sound mix...","review":"I generally like Oliver Stone's films, but this was an exception. A loud, dumb, blunderbuss of a movie, it has some decent performances, but a by-the-numbers script. Why does the climax of every sports movie have to come down to the last few seconds/last out/last hole/last whatever? It's the nature of the beast, but it sure does make for predictability. And the tie-it-all-up ending could have come from a 30s Warner Brothers sports biography.Something that was even more annoying than the seen-it-before plot was the sound mix. Stone seemed to be so enamored of his soundtrack music and ambient noise that he let it ride right over much of the dialogue. I finally turned on the English subtitles, and learned that I hadn't been missing much.Rabid football fans might enjoy this melodramatic look behind the scenes, but others should give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"ANY GIVEN SUNDAY was overlong, at times annoying, and had a disposable script. There was absolutely no need for this movie to drag on for almost three hours. If you're looking forward to the football playing scenes, be prepared to be vexed and disoriented. Stone obviously tried to stage the football scenes in a unique way, and there's nothing wrong with that, but his method just didn't work, at many times giving you just very bad views of the action on the field. Not all that is different is good. The plot was nothing too interesting or original either. There are many better football films out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Movie","review":"While this may not be considered a classic, it is a movie I enjoyed very much.

Other movies he's done have greater scattered moments throughout, but I always wind up feeling that his pounding/bigger-than-life/quick-cut/Oliver Stone-y way of making movies is so ham-fisted that he ends up diminishing the impact of what he's trying to say. In \\"JFK\\" or \\"Nixon\\" or \\"Natural Born Killers,\\" every single moment is so HUGE and POWERFUL and SIGNIFICANT that, after a while, it becomes ridiculous.\\"Any Given Sunday,\\" however, is a football movie. The constant POUNDING and EPIC MUSIC and SLOW MOTION and INTENSITY actually makes sense, here. He's not talking about things that require subtlety. He's talking about football.Not a \\"brilliant\\" movie, it's true, but certainly a good one.

With that being said, this movie really wasn't worth it. It had some good action and an OK story line, but the acting on average was poor even some of the stars (Diaz) blew it. The story goes like this, head coach Tony D'amato's (Pacino) team is on a big losing streak. His quarterback (Qauid) due to an injured is replaced by the talented but ego-centric Willie Beaman (Foxx), who only cares about himself and has no thought for \\"TEAM\\". Now the head coach has got to battle with his new quarterback, the greedy team owner (Diaz) and on top of everything else, a team doctor who puts injured players on the field despite the risks of permanant injuries.

You explore the minds and adventures of Howie and Laura as they as stuck together on and island with eachother, marooned by terrible camp children. Alone, the boy and girl reach out to eachother and take of to 'disappear'. This was a pretty good book. It didn't appeal to me as much as it could have, but you may find it wonderful. Either that or you'll hate it. Yes- there was some mature content, but nothing extrodinary unless you are very sensitive. There are some descriptions of a young girl, along with a few vague scenes that you may find inappropriate. I think it's alright for mature readers ages 13+Up. I'm 13, and I had no problem with it, while some other teens I know thought it was disgusting. You make the call. I wouldn't call it uphauling, but then again.. I'm used to Stephen King. Give it a try, you'll love it or hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parental warning","review":"If I could give zero stars, The Goats earned it. I would caution any adult to think twice before purchasing this book for a child. I couldn't believe this book was so highly acclaimed here at amazon. My eleven year old daughter brought this book home from her classroom library. What she read made her very uncomfortable. It embarrassed her. I read it and was surprised that Broc Cole thought his young readers needed a graphically descriptive passage about the nude body of his main character, Laura, by his other main character, Howie. I am surprised any adult that read this book could think it is a wonderful adventure story of overcoming obstacles to share with a young person. I can think of ten books that would do a better job without making a young reader uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coming of Age Story","review":"I read this book when I was 11 years old and I am now 21. I enjoyed every bit so much that I know it word for word. I think the book is excellent for the mature young reader because it captures some issues that most adults would be able to relate to only through metaphors. This promising book includes puberty issues, isolation issues, and issues of social and moral growth. This book is still one of my favorites and I recommend it to any young adult that has ever had to face dilemmas at a very young age. I challenge the young reader to find their similarities and differences between the Bryce (main character) and his companion with themself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth","review":"This book really EXPLETIVE!!!

For homework, we have to write a chapter to add onto the end of the book, and ya know, it really needs one 'cause I think the author, Brock Cole realized what a terrible book he was writing and just, well- stopped.

The Fugitive had pixel problems in all players and the same happened to the unforgiven. the only movie that was OK was The Last Samurai. Then I decided to buy a set that was new, thinking that the reason why the previous one, wouldn't play was because it was used and therefore somehow damaged. Well to my surprise the brand new one had exactly the same problem. therefore I don't recommend this set to any one.

In all the Terminator movies, the sound track is pretty much the star. T2 adds deeper character to the series. Even the bad Terminator has interesting depth and responses to the role.Was the original Terminator a lot scarier? Oh yeah. But the liquid metal Terminator felt like he fit right into the L.A. Police Department. Not sure if that was intended to be a comment on the department but in retrospect that's a lot of what the police can be. Scary and everywhere. No point in shooting back, just try to stay away.Meanwhile the T1000 played by Schwarzenegger enjoys the chance to embrace some of the nicer bits of California, the desert, John as a child, nice bikes.

I bought the pair as they were the best looking (and highest priced) Nike brand headphones. I was let down by how insufficient the bass was on these. My cell phone speaker has better bass! I was excited to run with these until I heard the lackluster sound quality. I don't think the weight of these headphones would've made it too comfortable... these puppies are HEAVY. On top of that, the shape of the actual buds didn't create a good enough seal to drown out any of the surrounding noise even at a sufficient volume. Forget about losing yourself in your workout at the gym with these on. To summarize, I liked how these look and that's about it. No bass and too heavy. Avoid and go with another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy weight but not on bass","review":"I cannot even turn up the volume half way up on my ipod, these things distort the bass so bad, you have to play it @ 25% volume.

But, James Blunt's \\"u'r beautiful\\" sounds great, so u get my point. hip-hop & dance tracks will suck on these. also, i dont understand why they are a li'l on the heavier side, they fit very snugly so thats a plus for joggers. overall, 2 stars from me coz my portfolio of music is equally balanced between rock & rap among others and i am thinking of returning these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nike headphones","review":"Good quality product.

If you are frustrated with the iPod type earbuds that constantly fall out these may be a good choice for you.

After I tightened them (torx t6 screws) they worked well, and stayed put. They are all metal so are quite heavy, about 0.5 oz each - for comparison my iPod Nano 2G weights about 1.45 oz. The metal seems to help with the sound quality, which I found to be very good. They have quite a wide frequency response (8-24000 Hz) for \`phones in this price range. I use them for running, and haven't had any problem with them falling out of my ears, and they're comfortable for me. The wire connection to the earbuds seems a little flimsy, and the wires tend to tangle more than other headphones I've had.

Of course if there is none, then well I guess you have no story. It's all in your tastes, I happen to like magical girl stories such as Sailormoon, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Cardcaptor Sakura.

They show the whole expansion draft, a cool documentary that starts at the beginning and leads all the way to us beating Vancouver in the playoffs last year, and an all-access backstage pass with the Wild including the huge win over Dallas in the first year. Even if you aren't a Wild fan, it is still fun because a lot of these players are now on your teams. The dvd also has the unforgettable overtimes of games 6 and 7 against the Avs last year.

I make enough for a couple of nights and like to put the rest in the refrig. I had been covering my cup with saran, so I jumped at this cup with lid. Problem is, it does not seal. There is a big gap between the spout and the lid. So, the dressing dries out or the dressing (if garlic/onion/shallot) smell permeates through the refrig. It does not seal so liquids will leak out of the spout. It would be good for pouring off liquids from, say, micro'd veggies.The other irritating thing is, I have 2 other PYREX 2-cup measuring cups (I bought this 3rd cup bec of the lid), and the lid doesn't fit them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed by idiots, DO NOT BUY!","review":"OK, the thing does hold 8 cups as promised. The Pyrex appears (I am not an expert) to be second class, but I may be wrong. What is appalling is the design of the spout. If one pours with it the stream clings to the bowl and makes a huge mess. If this thing was truly made in the USA (it says so on the product) it is a scathing indictment of our educational system (design), and of quality control (did anybody ever try this design in real life?). Not worth sending back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is a JOKE","review":"I'm so disgusted with this product I'd have fought to return it after I used it if it wasn't relatively cheap (and I am keen to avoid the hassle of shipping it back etc.).The cover is worthless. It doesn't fit onto the top of the container properly. If I hadn't received the container and top together I would have bet that they were not a match. The cover is supposed to slide down inside the measure cup. Not a chance. Only about half of the cover can fit. There was empty space in weird places too. It's hard to explain (and I know I'm struggling with the description!) but the bottom line is that the cover doesn't work. I highly recommend against this product if you're interested in something with any kind of cover at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for pouring","review":"You can not pour out of this.

I microwave stuff in it too, it is versatile like that.I love the heft of it, because it seems very durable. Of course if I drop it on the floor, I guess it would break - but I am not planning on doing that.I have an 8 cup plastic measuring cup too, but I find that my Pyrex glass one is the one I take out of the cabinet to use.I have never used the lid that came with it.

Green's writing was too simplistic, the plot was too predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional. Because of these faults, I found it really hard to remain interested in following what the main character, Kurt Ford, was planning in avenging his son's death, even if this meant to kill the President of the U.S.If you want to read a good intriguing book with a strong story plot and character development, try the classics from Daniel Silva (The Unlikely Spy) or Ken Follett (The Eye of the Needle)."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateurish and adolescent","review":"It seemed an intriguing premise--a guy so hell-bent on avenging his son's apparent murder that he's ready to assassinate the president. But Green's clumsy prose, shallow character portrayals, and use of gratuitous details make for a deeply unsatisfying book. It is difficult to feel an iota of sympathy for any of the characters (except maybe one poor sensitive oaf who, along with so many, ends up murdered). It's even more difficult to find an ounce of plausibility in the story itself. Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"First book that I've read by Tim Green.

The \\"real\\" bad guy was evident within the first few chapters, the plotting seemed to race along with any regard for buildup or previous action but worse of all, the characters seemed totally unrealistic. The hero seemed to have no grief for his murdered son but kept on with appointments, plans, meetings, sex, etc as if nothing had happened.The trick of killing anyone who could possibly contribute to the depth of the story (agents, policemen, bad girl) was pushed to the extreme. I am glad this was a book at the home we stayed at on the beach and I did not fork over any money."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy writing, poor characterizations","review":"This may well be the WORST thriller I've ever read. This book's interesting jacket drew me to it, but thats about the only thing this monumental catastrophe has going for it. Over a lifetime of reading thousands of books, I've only put aside a handful as \\"too lousy to finish\\" - those decisions were made with 1/3 of the book remaining. For this one, I'm only 17 pages in (10 of them being prologue), and already want every character to die. This writer has managed to throw every trite, hackneyed, overused and worn out cliche into this book.

Mr. Green's writing style was also very surprising for a best selling author. In many places, sentences referenced the main character both by name and personal pronoun, even when the character was alone and the reader knew to whom the author was referring. I really started to laugh at some of the passages about Jill's friendship with Jeremiah, which I thought was an unnecessary side plot. There were many attempts to foster empathy from the reader for the main character, but they didn't work for me. Mr. Green tries to fill in background details about the characters and their motivation, but often times they seem more \\"Oh, by the way\\" references and seem out of place in the middle of action scenes. My overall impression was that the book read like an average movie script that goes straight to video...For readers who like this genre, I would recommend Robert Ludlum's \\"The Janson Directive\\" over this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Gripping adventure, fuel of intrigue.

Avoid...","review":"This knife is nice and lightweight and seems like it is of reasonably good quality. I haven't used it much yet. I did, however, discover that the open handle design is quite flawed. It allows your finger tip to come in contact with the blade on the closed position and I have already taken a small piece of flesh off my finger reaching into my pocket. Also, when folding the knife, it is very possible to have a piece (or if your finger is quite small, such as a young user, a section of your finger) through the holes in the handle which could cause a very serious wound. If your finger were through the frame and the knife was closed with any force it would act like a pruner and lop off whatever was in the blade's path. I would not recomend this knife.The knife I purchased also came with a small utility tool with scissors, scredrivers, etc. and is small, not easy to operate and practically useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh mein Gott!","review":"Only 2 words can describe this song.

This movie just seemed to really suck. While it did scare me (mainly because the only thing scary about this movie was the monster's growl, then you see the monster and feel better) it still stunk of usual smell of B-rated monster flicks. Watching such flicks is almost a hobby of mine, and I'd have to say, in a triple threat match among this monster (whose name is forgotten or not even mentioned), Rawhead Rex, and Grim (from the similarly named film), I'd say Rawhead would go all the way, but going back to the movie, It was pretty cheesey what with all the ho-hum acting, ho-hum story, and ho-hum characters.

Just ignore it and maybe it'll go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, TACKY","review":"Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled.

But, dissapointingly, the effects were the only positive aspect of the movie, although these still weren't overly adventurous. As for the screenplay, I can imagine that the novel on which it was based as having an intriguing, indepth plot. However, the movies script doesn't quite capture the intelligence of this and instead just appears silly. There is some good editing, which helps to keep the movie flowing, especially in the films closing sequences. Unfortunately this is not enough to make up for the movies obvious failings.A horror film that wants to be taken seriously must also have an atmospheric music score to help build suspense whereas, The sound track to Cameron's Closet is laughable and very tedious.If I am to compare the film to others then I guess it lies somewhere between (and far below) Poltergiest, the Exorcist and Carrie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid","review":"I once saw this movie seven years ago and really liked it. Hey, I was young and naive. I recently rented this movie to see it again. I was once again robbed of my money. Cameron's Closet is 90 minutes of pure boredom. The acting is horrible, the monster is laughable, the writing is unbelieveable, I could just go on and on about how terrible this movie is. Cameron is a young boy who has telekinetic powers. He then brings a demon to life through a statue his dad gave him. Then people begin to die. A detective and a psychiatrist begin to investigate.

A great dance album that will still please the more guitar/lead bass rockin' fans of New Order. \\"60 mph\\", is an incredible song on this album. Super catchy bass riff, Bernard's angry yet contrite lyrics, synths, along with a sing-along chorus make this album worth getting just for this prize song.

The fold-out brochure a compete diappointment from Peter Saville, with poorly designed nothingness. The music itself sounds like the band was bored-- very bored. New Order would have let better be ending their legend with the REPUBLIC cd, and retiring for good to Monaco or to their saloon. It's plainly miserable music, sounding forced, contrite and embarrassing for 40-yr-olds to insult their legions of \\"former\\" fans. Don't bother purchasing this one.

New Order has been one of those bands that embodies innovation in music through their distinct sound and lyrics. I was very impressed with 'Get Ready'. Right from the start \\"Crystal\\" just grabs your attention with Bernard's lyrics \\"We're like crystal/we break easy/I'm a poor man/if you leave me/I'm applauded then forgotten\\" and Peter's melody driven bass. The rest of the album has the signature New Order 'sound' written all over it with some innovative surprises. My favorite songis Track 2 '60 miles per hour'.

Unfortunately, none of the things I liked about their previous albums are present.Barney's bitter lyrics and sensitive voice, hooky's droning bass, stephen morris' almost tribal, swelling drums... this album has none of it.The lyrics, first of all, are so bad and just plain stupid that i wince at almost every line. Hook's bass is not too bad, but ultimately doesn't achieve anything. No melody! He just kind of plucks along aimlessly. The drum tracks are uninventive and played out.This album is aggressively upbeat, so if you are into Electronic or other semi-vacuous synthesized brit pop it may be your cup of tea. If you liked New Order for the striking melodic melancholy of previous albums, give this one a complete miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WAIT IS OVER","review":"After many years of hopelessly waiting for new material - WAIT NO MORE!!! If you are a true new order/joy division fan, then \\"Get Ready\\" is an album that you can't help but love.

Didn't I learn from \\"Republic?\\" Apparently not. This album is just not worth it. Bland, guitar-oriented, glossy pop stuff that really doesn't go anywhere. The first single, \\"Crystal,\\" is good in its remixed form. Perhaps New Order will have a triumphant return to the Billboard Dance Charts - I'll give 'em that.

If you are new to the band then buy one of their \\"best of CD's\\"...I like \\"Substance\\" and if you want the newest work either \\"International\\" or \\"Retro\\" are good.

After listening to Joy Division and their later manifestation, New Order, I was pretty confident that England must be a giant New Jersey. Sometimes beauty in these places is hard to come by.Anyway, I guese one of the things artists do is find beauty and share it, which can be a real challenge. I think the beauty that New Order comes up with is derived from the spirits of all those people who grew up in giant appartment complexes. While many of us have to live in a dingy mess, sometimes love and truth make everything worthwhile. There is alot of that on this disk.New Order is pop music, but for me it weighs in like Bob Dylan. It has soul to spare. About 30 seconds into this CD I was hit with that love / truth message and, and it made me feel great.It's my favorite disk right now.G.

Having grown up with New Order, I hated the way both Technique and Republic moved the band away from their rougher, earlier sound and into a more polished, overproduced sound. Well, the signature sound is back folks. This album wouldn't seem out of place as the successor to Lowlife or Substance. As soon as I heard that opening wave of guitar on \\"Crystal\\" I was like, oh yeah. It's such a great return to the early days. \\"Rock the Shack\\" is loud and noisy and just a wall of guitars, it sounds great. So does \\"60 Miles An Hour\\" which is just pure New Order perfection. \\"Someone Like You\\" is a bit more polished than I'd like, but it's easy to sing along to.

After a few listens, I'm happy to report that GETREADY isn't the work of a tired old band trying to cash in on their fan base. Instead its a fresh, exhilarating take on the classic New Order formula. Peter Hook's penetrating bass vamps remain the core of the band's sound, complemented with Bernard Sumner's unsteady, unpolished yet perfectly appropriate vocals and guitar and the intense but not overbearing drum/synth sounds. \\"Crystal\\" is a great first single with its catchy rhythm guitar and an inspired bass solo, but my favorite track is \\"60 MHP,\\" which aspired to win pop music back from the inspid Boy Band and Faux R&B that has dominated the pop charts for the past few years.

It's a blisteringly good track with all the classic elements.Sadly, Get Ready isn't a particularly good album by anyone's standards. No major change in style (no change there!) but to me it doesn't really contain anything but one single and the rest are filler tracks.

Was this just consistent blandness or a better CD than I first thought. I played it again and my jaw dropped. This was darn good. It seems to rival their early work.

If I had not read all of the previous Maggody books, this one sure would not prompt me to become a fan of the series. The murderer and murderee were easy to figure out early on. I felt Joan Hess did not concentrate enough on the quirky characters already established in previous stories. Their endearing pecularities were not explored as in past books. There were many Buchanon names bandied about, but I would have liked more description of them and their kin. The names are certainly unforgettable-\\"Idalupino\\" is my all time favorite!

The premise was a great idea-bring the 90's into Maggody on the cusp of the new century(erronously known as the millenium). The storyline fell short though, and I was able to identify the murder solution before the murder even occurred. Too many new characters were introduced. One of the endearing traits of Maggody is sense of familiarity and character history. I did the storyline involving the \\"porno pics\\" flashing through e-mail.

The edition process, the weakness of the script and the awful performances of all the cast, make of this film, one of the worst ones I have ever seen in years.In case you rent it or buy it, think it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only thing left to do on a plane is finally here","review":"This is obviously a fantasy movie. Its a litle too much to be real of course. But none the less I enjoyed it. It makes for riveted watching although quite scary and DEFINITELY NOT for kids. The snakes look quite real and they are everywhere, and I mean everywhere. All your worst snake fears are realized here. This is a good shock cure for anyone who is scared of snakes. You can see every possible thing a snake can do to you on screen without haveing to endure it. The effects are fantastic. It does leave you with a feeling of \\"too much\\" or what you could call a slight overdose. The best part is that there is not too much melodrama which is really good since it does not have much of a storyline either.To summarize, I would say its great watching for someone who enjoys fantasy with a little of the macabre in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughs on a Plane","review":"The latest in high-concept filmmaking, \\"Snakes on a Plane\\" has more laughs than \\"Airport 1975.\\" Samuel L.

Schlocky visual effects, gratuitous sex and a ridiculous climax make this perfect drive-in fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have rated it one star if it wasn't funny","review":"This is a terrible movie from begining to the end. The plot sucks, the acting is terrible, and the digital snake attacks were awful also. The only plus about this movie is it is comical when the fake snakes kill the people on the plane.

The movie has a great title and I could imagine this being entertaining for 10 minutes as an SNL skit, but as a 1.5 hour movie? Hell no. Even Samuel L Jackson looked bored during the movie! Jackson clearly did this just for a paycheck. Don't watch this unless you are a stoned undergrad and it is super late at night. Dreadful.

But this movie doesn't deliver on its promise. Sure, it's still B-movie-ish, but it's not poorly done. The acting, effects, writing, suspense, etc., all work.So, ironically, people might be disappointed with this movie because it's better than its title might lead you to expect. If you enter with relatively few expectations, you'll likely enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snakes IN a Plane makes more sense","review":"I thought this was a comedy, just the title sounds so humorous. In anycase it's actually pretty good. I have flown in planes before (nothing like the one in this film, this one looked like a fancy bus with wings) and yes we've had plenty of bumpy flights and ran into angry clouds and ugly storms and I am surprised at how easily the plane flew in such a terrible storm. Regardless that's no big deal. The movie was pretty good. All star cast that I am very familiar with. Not a movie for kids or adults who already have a fear of flying eventhough the film is about snakes and not planes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story line!","review":"This was a very good movie as I like action movies.

But in an act of self-preservation, the crime boss facing prison smuggles hundreds of poisonous snakes onto the commercial aircraft in a crate timed to release its deadly cargo halfway over the Pacific. Flynn, along with a frightened flight crew and passengers, must then band together in a desperate attempt to survive. Very impressive movie. I guarantee you that after you see this movie, you are going to be scared of snakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not a good film.","review":"After seeing this movie, I was actually suprised. The movie did a good job setting up the characters and Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as the lead role. The snakes were a little dissapointing and it was easy to tell they were CGI.

Everybody knows that the premise of the movie and the script are horrible...heck, the producers probably wanted it to be this way. The movie wasn't entertaining in the least though. There's pretty much only one scene in the entire movie which might cause some excitement (Bad Mofo Samuel has to turn on the a/c) but that's about it. Other than that people are bitten in various areas and some folks die.To recap...this movie isn't so bad that it's good...it's so bad that it is unbelievably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE SUCKS","review":"I rented this movie over the weekend And it has to be the worst movie of the year. this movie takes forever to get moving and when the snakes finely show up. you can tell the sanks are so fake they are eather ruber snakers or made by a computer. and the acting sucks I thing it's the worst film Samuel L.

He has been featured on remixes of artists like Madonna, Tori Amos and Tina Turner - and he should stick to it. The man can't sing, he can't write songs or lyrics to save his life; he comes off as a middle aged butch homosexual with nothing to say, but a desperate dream to be a rock star. It's a shame he abandoned the projects by now-popular undground artists like Easter Bradford and Kala Azim because even though his production of their music had the same generic house/rock sound, at least they could sing and had something to say in their lyrics.

Both games are poor. The only person who would like this game would be someone who loves to see nothing but charts in a game. This game is terrible because teams and players are made up. So you really don't know who any of the players are, and you don't know if they're any good. If you want to make a trade, you never heard of the opposing players either. So you don't know if you got a good deal or a bad deal. The only kid of person who'd want this game is a person who likes text instead of graphics for the game, enjoys watching players he never heard of, and also likes games that have no sound support.

The Barbie doll Annabel looks like a bimbo, and seeing the Poe puppet pawing and nuzzling her like a desperate high school boy is pathetic. The \\"new age\\" soundtrack is distracting, not complimentary. All the effort here seems to have gone into making scary looking puppets representing death. They look good, but overshadow everything else, especially during the long and exhausting final sequence where death runs rampant over Poe. Way too drawn out, at the expense of the poem itself. And the final image, of more desperate pawing, is laugh-out-loud terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"...odd...","review":"The production quality is fantastic - for those that are fans of interesting animation style, stop-motion or marionettes in particular, it will blow you away.With that said, however, the adaptation of \\"Annabel Lee\\" is odd, at best. It seems to be based on a barely-remembered memory of the poem rather than the poem itself. This interpretation of Poe's work is painted as dark, frightening, and angry... completely bypassing the somber sadness from the original. Maybe just my personal opinion, but the narrator's struggle with inner demons being turned into a struggle with literal external demons isn't in tune with the spirit of \\"Annabel Lee\\". This adaptation is NOT Poe's poem; it is inaccurate and (as in any adaptation of Poe's works that features Poe as the main character) borders on insulting. Incidentally, I don't think this is one to show in a classroom because it's either too strange/violent, or confusingly too unlike the source material."},{"rating":"1","title":"The suckitude was immense","review":"If you are a fan of \\"Rock and Roll Nightmare,\\" avoid this title like the plague.

As he explains on the tape, the words are not what is important, rather it is the experience of \\"being\\". People often describe an advancement in understanding that can occur in the presence of someone who is enlightened. This same benefit or \\"presence\\" can be felt when listening to these CDs. If one is not connecting with the experience, then the words alone have little meaning (and the pauses and laugh can be annoying) which may explain the discrepancy in the reviews so far. If you have read and connected with the book, \\"The Power of Now\\", I cannot recommend these CDs highly enough. If you haven't read the book, you're missing one of the greatest books of this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Power","review":"This CD set deserves 10 stars. I play it again again and always hear something new. It's an essential companion to The Power of Now tapes (which I transferred to CD).The meaning of life, the secret of happiness and lasting inner peace are all here for the taking. If only my ego would let me take it all in. In the meantime, I'll keep listening.Thank you, Eckhart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He's got much better","review":"I've listened to other Tolle audiobooks and this one is very weak. Don't buy this, it's a waste of your money. The audiobook is simply a recording (and a very poor one at that) of a partial section of a live workshop. The content does not flow like his other professionally produced a-books. In addition, the microphone is too close and you hear every breath and guteral sound (very annoying).I really loved Power of Now, but this is junk. Shame on Tolle for hustling his faithful customer base with this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Biography!","review":"John Adams and the American Revolution by CatherineDrinker Bowen is a great biography of John Adams.Ms. Bowen spends a great amount of time on the childhood and young manhood of Adams. She also touches on his great marriage life. This is a book that I enjoyed perhaps even more than DavidMcCullough's biography titled John Adams, though this book was good. I usually stay away from biographies and read more of the reference type books, I'll have to say though that this book kept my interest to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Adams and the American Revolution","review":"I;ve already entered one review which specified that the book I ordered was not the one delivered. Ordered was a hard copy version of a book but what was sent was a paperback version in very poor condition. Let it suffice to say that I expected a hard bound version. That I got a paperback version, with pages yellowed and falling from the binding, and for a discount of four dollars is not what I expected. I hope this review meets the minimum reqirements for feedback. If you order a hard bound book , you should get one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive reference","review":"This book continues to be an invaluable reference for those interested in fireworks and pyrotechnics at all levels. Anyone planning to construct their own pyrotechnic devices should before embarking on the simplest project include this book in their essential reading list. The book is crammed with diagrams, methods and sufficient theory to guide the reader to a perfect safe result every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to see why it's a \\"classic\\".","review":"It's easy to see why this book is the classic that it has become. Although I was surprised that this book was british this had no neg effect; it's also filled with photos from what I believe to be the famousBrocks Fireworks Company of years gone by. If you like fireworks making you will love this book; even if you dont make them but are interested in how they work you will still enjoy this book. The only hole I found in it was when it came to exploding fireworks (noisemakers). Oddly enough Amazon offered this book along with another which nicely filled that hole.(Exploding fireworks by John Donner.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary","review":"I thought these pieces were a bit pricey, and I think the co-sleeper should COME with them, however they are necessary. I didn't get them the first time I had a baby in the co-sleeper and with the bed higher than the baby it was really uncomfortable lifting her out and putting her back in! The next time around I ordered these and got the Co-sleeper to the correct height and it was so much better!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads Like a Legal Obligation","review":"Professor Ray Atlee and his brother Forrest are summoned back to their father's home. Their father is the imposing Judge Reuben Atlee and he's dying. Ray arrives to find the judge dead and to find several million dollars in cash. Should Ray share the money with his drug-abusing brother? Should Ray keep the money? Who knows the money is there and what are they willing to do to get their hands on it?Unfortunately, finding the answers to these questions requires reading the book. And the book is not worth reading. While Grisham once again writes a highly readable, southern inflected legal drama, this one lacks enough plot to justify its 200 and some pages. Simply stated, very little happens and what does happen is belabored and not entirely convincing. It reads, quite frankly, like Grisham is fulfilling a legal obligation to produce a novel.It may be worth noting that this book contains some connections to other Grisham novels, including A Time to Kill."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"As a huge fan of The Firm this book was a disappointment. There are no thrills and no suspense. Spend your time/money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argubly the worst ending ever commited to paper","review":"Deus ex machina...anti-climactic...a let-down...all of the above. Although I often critize Grisham for ending his novels too similarly (riding off into the sunset, never to practise law again...), anything would have been preferable to the way this book ends. To make matters worse, the story is actually halfway decent until the ending. Now you're probably thinking, \\"Why James, surely you jest! It is preferable to have a decent book with a cruddy ending than a cruddy book through and through.\\" I would actually have preferred the book to have been lousy through and through, because as it was it generated just enough tension for me to actually care about the answer to the question the book revolves around. Instead, Grisham picks the worst possible character, the worst possible reason, and the worst possible motives. Look elsewhere...please. 3.5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't belive John Grisham wrote this book!","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books, and generally like his writing, with the exception of one or two. \\"The Summons\\" was one of the most boring, tedious books I have ever read. I thought I would never get done reading it. Did John Grisham really write it???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Again John!!!","review":"I read the Summons in about 3 days. It was boring and the end was even worse than the entire book. I am a huge Grisham fan and I believe he was asleep when he wrote this! He is so very capable of 110% better work. I really did not care what happened to Ray in this book. What's up with Nathan Bedford Forrest...Forrest Gump??? It was not a thriller at all...like I'm used to. There was really no suspense. Usually, Grishman's books are hard to put down. I know that he can write better that this. Try again John!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but a two-chapter story stretched to far too many","review":"Although no author can continually be at their best, this just isn't worthy of Grisham's abilities. The kernel idea of this story is good (judge-father of estranged sons \\"summons\\" them to set his house in order before he dies, unexplainable hidden money, history of brothers.) However, the story unfolds too slowly with little real difference for far too many pages. The characters could have been interesting but aren't fleshed out. The origin of the money seemed thrown in like an impatient throwing in of the towel. Here's to next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better ways to spend your reading time . . .","review":"Enjoying the book hinges on your ability to suspend belief. The reader needs to believe that a law professor would not consider putting cash into bank safe deposit boxes (better to leave it in trash bags in a trunk!); and that his brother, who never demonstrated self-control in his life, would suddenly acquire incredible self-control even when he's drunk.Oh, and then you have to like weak characters and mediocre writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"If you just have to read Grisham wait for the paperback. Even then you won't get your $$ worth. Definately read like the work was rushed out rather than developing that classic Grisham plot that keeps you up all night just to see what's going to happen next.Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it...","review":"I really wanted to like this book. It was an incredibly fast read, due in part to the load of dialog. The story had a good start, but nothing exciting really happened. And the ending left me shouting \\"that's IT?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I thought Grisham had turned around his recent slump with A Painted House, but The Summons is just plain BORING. A cute ending in the last ten pages is not worth yawning through the 331 pages it takes to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone say .... REDUNDANT","review":"It got off to a good start then .... the plot just ran in circles. I, too, felt this was rushed work. And the ending, after making it through all that dribble, was such .... I felt it was a slap in the face... like we were stupid for hanging on till the end. This one, so far, is my least favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Summons is a disappointment","review":"The Summons is the work of a man who has achieved success with his early books because of the commitment that he made to the reader to provide exciting and intellectual thrillers that you didn't want to quit reading. The Summons is the antithesis. It is the writing of a man that has other interests in life and is more concerned about the revenues from the book rather than the quality of the storyline. There was never a moment where I was excited about reading this book. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Cookies","review":"Let's see, I need a new cookie to make a lot of money.

Same Grisham plot, different cover, more money. Foolish me. But I'm sure I will buy the next one hoping for a different treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cookie Cut out copy","review":"There is nothing original or unpredictable about \\"The Summons\\". The ending is obvious from the first paragraph of the jacket summary. Grisham's attempt to capture the mood and atmosphere of the south reads like a comic book version of a Pat Conroy novel, a very poor imitation of the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It seems as though Grisham had a deadline to meet ... and fast. Usually Grisham makes his characters deeper and he is fantastic in the courtroom and with attorneys. However, in this book you receive neither in depth.It was a far-fetched story line to begin with. What was so disappointing was the ending of the book. Again, it seems as though a deadline had to be met and fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the money!","review":"This book has taken a fair bit of flack by reviewers and I feel that they're being a bit harsh on the author. It's certainly a smaller book than he usually writes and lighter in content but I've given it 4 stars for being a smooth and interesting read...not everything has to be heavy and punchy. Ray Atlee, a professor of law at a southern university, is summoned home by his distatorial father, a prominent judge who was never able to astablish a rapport with his two sons.On finding his father dead on the sofa of his living room, Ray also discovers $3 million in notes, packed into boxes. He decides not to tell his brother Forrest of his find immediately as Forrest is a drug addict who would almost certainly kill himself with drink and drugs.Ray then sets out to discover where the money came from and enters a world of big money with all of its attendant risks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Grisham books","review":"I was disappointed by this book. John Grisham is one of my favorite authors and I look forward to reading his books. This one was slow in the beginning and most of the way through. The ending was ok but not great, I felt it was incomplete.The Summons is not as good as his others. This one did not have much in the way of building the characters, the only interesting one was Harry Rex.It did not seem like such an interesting story. So Ray Atlee gets a summons from his dying father and when he gets there his father is already dead and he finds $3 million. He then spends most of the time trying to hide the money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bo-o-o-o-r-r-r-ing","review":"Don't waste your time (or money) on this one. Good fiction, or even passable fiction for that matter, should draw the reader in and make him believe in the characters and the story so that even though the reader \\"knows\\" it couldn't really be true, he buys into it anyway. (Witness the wild success of the Harry Potter books.) In this book, I could never figure out why I was supposed to believe this character would do these things. It's actually too bad, because there could have been a really interesting story about greed and the lust for money; but Grisham never actually gets there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Least Entertaining Grisham Novel","review":"I have read every Grisham novel and always buy them without even perusing them first. I guess I will have to examine them more closely in the future. This book features a sketchy plot that seems to ramble along wishfully looking to pick up our interest with very few developments. I read it to the end, hoping for a redeeming climax, but ....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst ever!","review":"With The Summons, I have read all of John Grisham's books up to date. And unfortunately I had to struggle through this book because the plot began to develop and get interesting after two-thirds had already been read. The first couple hundred pages it's as if you're just reading Ray Atlee's live his life. There is absolutely nothing in there. Then the ending...actually what ending? It was so loosely fabricated that I think Grisham just weaved something together on the spur of the moment then called it quits.A very disappointing read. My suggestion is if you're interested in reading the book, borrow it from the library. Don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as great as other but still good","review":"well of course this book is not close to his real \\"legal\\" novels like \\"The Rainmaker\\" or \\"A time to Kill\\" but still it is great to read and the pages turn themselves. Once you get started you don't want to stop. And at the end you will be surprised because this is his first novel which has real turningpoints in his story.This is a book for everyone who likes Grisham as an author and not only his \\"law\\" books. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great character development, but where was the story?","review":"John Grisham certainly knows how to draw you into a character's life. I could read about the main character, Ray Atlee, all day (and I did), but this story is lacking plot, details... I was very disappointed by the lack of mystery, thrill, and legal expertise usually found in a John Grisham book. The story has many holes, and the ending is (much)less than exciting. When I finished the book, I was actually upset that I had wasted so many hours reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happened to Grisham?","review":"I've loved this author's earlier books, but is he turning out to be like so many who turn out a good novel or two, then, in order to keep the$ coming in, churns out new ones even when they're not worth reading? In earlier novels I have always admired a certain, admittedly far-fetched, logic to the unravelling of the story. Don't look for that in this one. We begin to understand why the protagonist's wife decided to leave him abruptly sometime in the past. His actions are so unreasonable as to stretch credulence. As others have said, it IS a page-turner, and the faster the pages turn, the better. The rather predictable \\"surprise\\" ending just dribbles away to a conclusion, with nothing there. In short, check this book out of the library if you've got to have something to read for a summer trip, but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Mr. Grisham even writing his own books anymore?","review":"The only reason I am even giving it one star is because, for whatever reason, I managed to finish the book. I was tempted to put it aside after many a droning chapter with characters that i could find no redeeming qualities in. I couldn't bring myself to care about Ray, who is pretty much a dud. This book wastes a lot of time getting to any action and I feel like Grisham knows we will buy his books, so why bother making them exciting and intricately plotted as his early works were? In spite of the massively ungood (to be kind)book \\"The Bretheren,\\" I picked this up and am now disappointed to no longer be able to garauntee myself an exciting read when I pick up one of his books with confidence from a rack without even reading the back or any reviews. I hate having to lose an author from my list of favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable w/ unusual twist at end...The Un-Grisham","review":"\\"The Summons\\" is probably the worst book John Grisham has written. Unfortunately, noone in the editing station asked themselves if certain parts of the book were actually believable. The main character seems to always be a sitting duck but still manages to escape harm or robbery everytime. Grisham also did something in this books that he hasn't done before: use a twist at the end to reveal the real perpetrator. This part makes sence but acts like a sore thumb when placed amonth the rest of his work. Let's hope he didn't actually write this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Summons","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books and this one was extremely disappointing! I don't read Grisham for a moral and that's what I got! I kept waiting for something to happen and it just dragged on and on!! I was actually angry at the end. I felt very cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Summons- A real disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed John Grisham's other legal thrillers, but found The Summons lacking.

He is really mailing his books in now and tthis will be the last one I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing for Profit","review":"THE SUMMONS is not up to what we expect from Grisham. Definite feeling he had to fulfill his contract with the publisher and dashed something off. The characters, with the exception of Harry Rex, were poorly developed. The idea of Forrest, a drug addict, turning away from 3 million dollars as a \\"test\\" for his brother just wasn't credible.Hopefully Grisham will wait until he has the time to develop a heart stopper like THE FIRM or THE CLIENT before publishing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow two dimensional garbage","review":"Very poor writing, the characters are two dimensional at best, pedestrian writing, no plot development, no reason at all for it to be a best seller. It would have been more exciting to read John Grisham's shopping list.Do yourself a favor and give the cost of this book to charity instead, and read a cornflake packet.If there had been a 'no stars' category on this review page, I would have awarded it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"For someone who has been a huge Grisham fan for years, I was looking forward to reading another of his legal thrillers. This might be one of the most boring books ever. It never grips you, you reach the last few pages of the books and realize the story has not even begun to be interesting and the book is over. It is probably fifty levels below any of his other legal thrillers. I am not sure if this is even a book or just some ramblings that are the outline and backdrop for a story,"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Time To Kill","review":"How disappointing. I didn't think Grisham was capable of writing anything worse than \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" If this were his first book then I wouldn't be as critical but this just doesn't stack up to his other great works and wouldn't sell if his name weren't on it.I've read all of his books and even appreciated his departure from his legal writing in \\"Painted House;\\" but I can't recommend that anyone read \\"The Summons.\\" Unfortunately, this may be the last Grisham book I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Grisham is getting worse","review":"Whatever happened to strong characters, interesting plots and adventurous happenings.Maybe the fans on John Grisham have been spoilt by his first few books such as The Firm, Pelican Brief, A Time to Kill and The Chamber, but his latest advenure, The Summons, is an abyssmal attempt.As a reader you want the main character to be strong and bold. Not someone who run's away when a brick is thrown through his deceased father's window.Looking back, the best thing would have been for the brick to hit the main character on the head. It would have put him and the readers out of their misery quicker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serial Not a Novel","review":"I love Grisham. However, this book is really only a chapter in a serial.

I would take a pass on this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham is slipping","review":"For fans of John Grisham' books the Firm and other early books, this is a MAJOR let down.

He is the one who should be ashamed"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"I had eagerly awaited this return to the legal thriller by John Grisham. What a disappointment!! The ending was hardly worth the mediocre build-up. Grisham writes amazing descriptions of people and places but in this book, it just goes nowhere! TRY AGAIN JOHN! I haven't given up on you yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't I give it zero stars?","review":"I usually like John Grisham's works- funny, complex characters, page-turner, etc. But this book was so anti-climactic and the characters never really seemed real or interesting. At the last page, I turned to the next page not realzing that the book was over. That's bad. It's not that I felt like putting it down, but after it was over, I was like \\"ok\\". Read this book if you want, but it's far from great- had this been a new author, it might have gotten two stars, as the author would have had promise, but for John Grisham, it's a total let-down, especially considering he hasn't written a legal thriller in a few years. And by the way, this really isn't a legal thriller either, so to let you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an average book.","review":"It seems as though Grisham is trying too hard here. The plot isn't very complete and the ending very unsatisfying. It seems as though Grisham is good every other book and this years hit for him is Skipping Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"No excitement here, a disappointment.","review":"I am an avid reader, and enjoy reading just about any type of book. With an open mind I start a book, and most books I have read captivate me from the first page and hold it till the last page. The Summons did not do that. I was bored from the first paragraph onward. Keeping an open mind I made it past the first few chapters, I read where he went down to Mississippi, found his father dead and found the money, and through the scenes at the diner and some of the funeral or something to that effect. It never got my attention. This is the first book in a long time that I have not completed. And, to close my mind a little, it did not live up to the expectation of a good read from John Grisham which has been painted in my mind by other bookworm friends like myself and my sister."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End ( thankfully ).","review":"Unimaginative and uninspired writing. While it is written the main character agonized upon finding $3 million, I am hoping, but doubting, Grisham suffered similar agony in accepting a fee for this plodding tale. Fleshing out and involving the secondary characters such as the King of Torts or Harry Rex could have made for an interesting plot and ending. Overall, a weak and tiresome effort, perhaps Grisham has hit the writer's wall. This 'coulda been a contenda'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by this one, he's written better.","review":"I found this book to be far from the typical Grisham lawyer-esque \\"can't put down\\" novel. The first half was slow, boring and repetitive. I thought it lacked the character development, vivid description and the interesting plot twists so many of his other books have (Time to Kill, Runaway Jury, The Brethren, etc.). The ending was anticlimactic, but I was so apathetic as opposed to entertained by the story at that point that it was just a relief to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very ordinary","review":"I have read all the Grishams to date, but this was in my mind the most mediocre yet. Yes, it has a legal-related theme, but this book is simply not a page-turner, only becoming interesting in the last 30 pages.Although I have been buying all the Grishams in hard back and reading them all, I'll have to reconsider this with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Summons","review":"Unlike Grisham's previous works, The Summons was a grave disappointment. The characters lacked any endearing qualities; the pace of the book was tedious; the ending was obvious long before the reader reached the end, and the only factor driving the reader to complete the book was the misguided hope that Grisham would manage, at some point, to bring some of his usual sparkle to this work. Don't waste your money or time on this book; look for one of his earlier works if you value a fast pace, interesting characters and an intriguing plotline. Perhaps Mr. Grisham is too busy worrying about screenplays to worry about writing good prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending","review":"An intriguing beginning, however, plot-less, and very disappointing ending. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book for the most part. I liked the way the characters were portrayed, and the way the story unravels as you go along. I have to say that Ray Atlee was my favorite character. Throughout the book Ray's faced with numerous obsticles and he always makes the right decisions, only to lose at the end to his younger brother Forest. I found it disappointing that after all Ray went through, he was betrayed by his brother Forest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had potential...","review":"Plot starts out with potential but does not develop.

(Please!)","review":"This book is a terrible attempt at irony, from a formula writer who has lost his recipe. This is the worst book I have read in years, and I would save you the money and time that is wasted by reading it. It's too late for me, but you can still save yourself!Grisham has written several fine novels with legal intrigue that have great characters, and a driving plots - this is not one of them. This book begins with a death and some unexplained cash with the body. The son finds it, and the entire book is about his attempt to find out where it came from, and how to keep it away from other people. Oh yeah- someone else knows about the money - oooooh. No great twists, suspense, or legal manipulation. Just boring trudging through simple words. It left me angry that I had wasted my time.If you're stuck on Grisham, go re-read the Pelican Brief, The Summons isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Story Teller","review":"Grisham is the most masterful story teller I have discovered in the past five years.

I've been wondering why bookstores around Tupelo have been advertising extremely low prices for the hardback version of this book...now I know why. Could it be the obvious lack of editorial effort (has anyone else noticed the annoying typographical errors)? I thought your wife, et al, read your final copy before publishing? And between chapters, I promise you, no one has forgotten the characters of the novel, so it is not necessary to keep introducing them as if you knew we would put the book down for several days (in disgust) and finally pick it back up to read. I love you John - you're still good for Mississippi even though you left us - but please don't rush to write another novel for whatever reasons - you're too captivating for that kind of racket.

A good summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable, readable, quite forgetable","review":"I can't imagine why a laywer teaching at UVA would have to go three times to a casino to see if his \\"found\\" money was good. Go to any 7-11 or Quickstop and they'll tell you if your 100 bill is legitimate. Why drive around with 3 million in cash in a flashy car in rural Mississippi and not expect the car to be broken into? I was kind of hoping it would be stolen. It would have added something to the story....What's the big surprise? I think Mr. Grisham should go back to practicing law so he can catch up on real life, which is stranger than fiction.It goes to show you that the big name authors can write anything and still get $15 for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Disappointment","review":"Simple plot, simple characters, simple ending. If Grisham had written The Summons as his first book, he would be a full time Little League coach in Oxford, Mississippi. So much pre-release hype. It's a shame that publishers turn good authors into lazy has-beens just to pump out books-for-a-buck. I've purchased every Grisham book, but never again. The public library will be my only investment in Grisham's future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey John - ever heard of writer's block? Look into it.","review":"While Grisham's books have always been something of a guilty pleasure for me, this one insults. What should have been a throwaway short story has somehow been stretched into the literary equivalent of 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall. Grisham's unsympathetic protagonist Atlee has got to be the world's thickest law professor - ever heard of a safe deposit box, dude? The cardboard-cutout characters never rise from their comic book upbringings, and the story goes, well, nowhere worth going. The Accidental Tourist meets bad 1970s detective show.

This book drug on with absolutely no drive. Every Grisham book starts slow but you always know it will pick up and usually it does, I was at the middle of the book still waiting for the book to pick up and drive us to an interesting mysetery and wonderful suspense when i realized it was going nowhere. the middle of the book and i was still waiting! the ending was that amputated that's it kinda ending which leaves you feeling used as if it was written by the writers of a bad soap opera who can't figure out how to end a story line so they decide the character was knocked out and had dreamed the entire thing. I do not recommend this book to Grisham Fans, skip it if you want to remain a fan and possibly pick up a James Patterson book as for now Grisham has lost a fan with this poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real Grisham Fans only","review":"I have read about everything John Grisham has written and this to me was disappointing. The premise was interesting and there were some suspenseful parts. The character development was probably the best part as you did feel that you knew someone just like the characters, especially the family and close friends. The conclusion was empty for me. Didn't feel like closure. If you like narrative around locations and characters or are a Grisham fan, it will not be an empty read but certainly didn't meet expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"ephiany for forrest, empty woods for others","review":"a halting beginning, shallow middle and absent of ending -- disappointing, hurried project from otherwise talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to Grisham Standard","review":"Very disappointing effort from a normally great writer. Clearly Mr. Grisham is under contract with his publisher to spit out a novel every year or so. This pales in comparison to his past efforts. There's no depth to the characters and the story is boring. The ending is not even an ending; he simply stopped writing and submitted his manuscript. But, he ... me in with his name recognition alone. So, I guess it worked from a bottom line point of view. Don't waste your time with this one. Read \\"The Firm\\" again, instead. That was vintage Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Seller? Based on reputation alone","review":"I am so tired of great books being ignored because people spend their time reading trash like this book. So he had a some great books in the past. Does that mean every book he writes will be a good book? Obviously not! This book was boring, unrealistic, and nothing like what I picture a Legal Thriller to be. The title, and the explaination of it's meaning, was really lame. I knew I was in for it after the first chapter. ...I am off mainstream! I will never buy another book by the established writers of the world again! There are too many great works out there to expore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Katy's Review","review":"I loved \\"The Summons\\" by John Grisham! The story begins by introducing Ray Atlee, who receives a summons from his ex-judge father. However when he arrives at his father's home he finds him dead. As if finding his father dead was not enough of a shock he also finds three million dollars, more than the judge could ever make being a judge. The story unfolds quickly as you try to figure out how the judge got the money.To add to the mystery someone is trying to steal the money. Read this book to solve the mystery. Once you start, the story pulls you in and won't let you out until you have solved the mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No real story here","review":"John Grisham is a gifted story teller and has proven it through his great works, like A Time To Kill and The Firm, but it seems as time passes by his stories have become weaker and predictable. Not once did I feel suspense or drama in The Summons. The characters were not developed to make me love them or hate them, I felt nothing for them. Just one simple plot, no real twists or turns, no subplots, just a dull straight forward plot. If you want a good Grisham book, I suggest you go back and read his first works and skip this one all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of Grisham","review":"I am greatly disappointed by this piece of work.

But it just drags on...and on... and on...to a very disappointing and unsatisfying ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low for Grisham","review":"Grisham has been on a downward spiral since the Runaway Jury. Bad plots, boring characters and terrible endings have made me doubt that this is even the same person who wrote the Rainmaker and the Firm. I didn't think he could write a worse book than the Testament, but I was wrong. The Summons suffers from a lack of characters and a lack of character development. Grisham spends more time talking about airplanes than he does about most of the people in the novel. The plot is simplistic at best and it is painfully clear where the meandering story will end up. And the ending was just awful. Not even one of his classic tacked on \\"sailing off into the sunset\\" endings - the book just abruptly ended. Do yourself a favor, skip this and read one of his earlier books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"I've read all of Mr. Grisham and it is almost as if he is two people. His earlier books were wonderful, but since the Chamber he has turned into a different person. I kept waiting for the plot to happen, maybe some real interaction between the characters but all I got was Ray going from place to place to hide money? The last line in the book is how I feel about Mr. Grisham books now, later bro! I suggest that you wait until this book is in paperback because it is not The Firm, although it does have a couple of moments but Mr. Grisham makes sure he jumps right over them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am a big Grisham fan, so looked forward to his new book. I did finish it, but mostly because I had nothing else to read. There are no appealing characters in this novel - not much suspense. I didn't really care who came out ahead.... Don't bother. His earlier books are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The party is apparently over","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books. I think The Firm is one of the best page turners ever. I generally enjoyed most of the others, but I think The Testament was so bad that somebody should have been prosecuted. I also found the Bretheren lacking.And, we come to The Summons. Slow, plodding, takes way too long to tell the story, and when you get to the end, alas there isn't much of a story. I think Grisham has lost it. I won't bite on the next one. The Summons for me was one of those books that made me angry that I had spent time reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Usually I really enjoy Grisham's work.

Wish I hadn't spent the time on this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick and entertaining read","review":"I picked this up as airplane reading for my next trip, but ended up reading it beforehand. I thought this was one of Grisham's better recent efforts. Although one reviewer here thought the ending was poor, I thought it was well done and wrapped up nicely, though it was perhaps a bit abrupt. (Nowhere near as abrupt as, say, Neal Stephenson's endings, however.) If you liked The Partner (probably my favorite Grisham), you'll probably like this one,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham - The Summons","review":"The Summons is not an awful book but it has very few redeeming qualities. The story moves slowly - and that would be okay if it weren't for the poorly developed characters and complete lack of suspense - and I found myself expecting, at some point, something jarring to happen, for the plot to really kick in. And it never did. Even going into the final 100 pages, I hoped that something was going to happen to redeem the time I'd invested in the first 300 pages. There was no payoff. And the ending? Don't get me started. Its as if Grisham, like me, had just had enough and stopped working.I've no doubt that there are better Grisham novels out there. I just sincerely wish I hadn't wasted my time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I have enjoyed every Grisham novel to date, but not this one. I could not get past the unnatural dialogue, fake-sounding names, and lack of character development. I found myself not caring if the main character lived or died. I have a hard time believing John Grisham actually wrote this book. If you have any kind of standards at all, don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best effort","review":"I was very disappointed by the very lame effort put forth by Mr. Grisham. The plot was very thin and repetitive. How many times can $3 million be loaded in a trunk and hauled around? How many times can a threatening letter come, especially when you can figure out in the first third of the book who is doing it? Normally I can't wait to keep reading his books. In this case, I couldn't wait until I got done reading so I could start a more interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Letdown Mr. Grisham........","review":"After eagerly anticipating an evening reading the newest John Grisham novel, what a letdown. Slow reading, no plot and easily predictable pretty much sums up this book. I've read everything by him and this was quite a disappointment. Come on, Mr. Grisham lets have some more great writing like in your earlier novels!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the Legal thriller","review":"Grisham is back to writing what he's famous for, the legal thriller. \\"Summons\\" approaches \\"The Firm\\" in its excitement and near-frantic activity of the main character. But with \\"The Firm\\" Grisham set the bar so high, not even he has been able to match it. I thot the main character Ray Atlee was real, likeable. I found myself asking throughout the book, \\"Who could it be?\\" and \\"What would I do if I were Ray?\\" Altho the book takes you on a ride, the ending is implausible and disappointing.I give Grisham 4 stars because he still can tell a great story. The plot is exciting; the story moves from city to city. You do get a feeling that Atlee is travelling quite a bit to achieve his purpose. And Grisham tells the tale w/very little profanity, for which he truly needs to be applauded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have read almost all of Grisham's books and really enjoyed them.

I could have easily put it down and not picked it up again. I recently finished \\"A Painted House\\" and felt more for Luke than I did for Ray Atlee. Sorry John, seems that since you have started with a new genre, you have forgotten what made your earlier works so great....suspense along with a cat and mouse game thrown in."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just didn't seem like \\"him\\"...","review":"Don't get me wrong... I am a huge fan of Grisham, but I just really disliked this book. I think the very first sign that this book was going downhill was the fact that the title character was far from likeable. In all of his other books, the reader rooted for the lawyer/juror with enthusiasm, but in The Summons you really didn't care what happened to this guy. The anti-climactic ending upset and mystefied me. I guess I just expected a better \\"legal effort\\" after the surprising success of Skipping Christmas and A Painted House."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Straw","review":"That's it! I'm done reading John Grisham. Joining a long line of bad books (The Brethren, The Testament, The Street Lawyer & The Partner) that he has attempted to use his equation and just plug and chug his way to the Best Seller's List, Grisham's latest novel, The Summons, is so trite it represents everything that is wrong with modern American writers. Seriously lacking any character depth, anything along a plausible story line and containing no plot twists which can't be seen three chapters beforehand, this story insults anyone with the intelligence above the average 8th grader.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY SUPPORTING BAD WRITING!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"I've read (and enjoyed) 4 other books by Grisham, and thought this would be a good book to take on vacation. Halfway through I considered just putting it down, but I didn't have anything else to read. The \\"plot twists\\" are fairly obvious. The action is repetitive, moving the money again, going to another casino, etc etc etc... By the end I didn't really care what happened, but was just determined to finish. All in all a suprisingly weak effort from a talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two One Dimensional","review":"The book did not really hold my attention.

Grisham's other books were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not actually a novel","review":"I'd have to agree with a previous reviewer - this would have been a better short story. As is, it's pretty much a one act play, with a few scenes of filler thrown in to round it out.Halfway through the book I realized it wasn't going to be getting any better, but I toughed it out until the end. Not much excitement, and pretty one-dimensional plot. Do yourself a favor and just read \\"The Firm\\" again...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Bad as The Testament, But . . .","review":"The Summons is definitely a disappointment.

I had just gotten home from college and felt like reading a book to start this summer. This, though, was by far one of the worst books I have ever read in my entire life. There is not plot, the ending is not suprising at all, and the most suspense the book gives is wondering if it could possibly stay as bad as it is throughout.Instead of this book, pick up The Partner, which is truly a great book. After this, though, I will never read a Grisham book ever again, and will most likey stay away from pop fiction. Yes the book was really this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment to a long-time Grisham fan!","review":"I have been a Grisham fan since the publication of THE FIRM and this is the 7th book I've read by this usually entertaining author. However, I was very disappointed in THE SUMMONS. I felt inundated with extraneous information and unnecessary characters and I also thought that about of the book was dedicated to promoting Grisham's next novel, THE KING OF TORTS (which actually sounds more interesting than this one!).The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star is because the writing itself was good and I was motivated enough to finish it. I guess what kept me reading was my conviction that the plot twist would be less obvious than it actually was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poorly done, shallow characters and unclimatic ending","review":"I drive a lot so I buy many audio books to enjoy during the long drives. This book is just one of a few really bad ones that I wish I had spent money on something more worthwhile. You have a feeling that the book was hastily put together to make money.

At the book's ending, you'll find yourself asking, 'is that it?'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think about buying this book.","review":"Don't even think about wasting your time or money on this book. I vow to never again read another Grisham book again. The book is dull all the way through and I didn't find myself feeling anything for any of the characters.

It's bad enough the book's plot was full of more holes than a piece of swiss cheese, but for cryin' out loud, give the main character some level of depth! Grisham has been steadily going downstream. I don't think I'm alone in urging him not to sign anymore of those one-book-a-year deals and write something of quality and honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Grisham's latest legal thriller is far from thrilling. I was pleasantly surprised to see it set in Clanton, MS where 'Time to Kill' was set and happily surprised to see the character of Harry Rex brought back. I was disappointed that Grisham made no mention of Jake from 'Time to Kill' and hugely disappointed in the characters and plot of this novel. The story line is very familiar. In fact, I'd skip this one and read, 'A Simple Plan' by Scott Smith instead. It's better written than the 'Summons'. Also, I recommend Brad Meltzer's 'The Millionaires' as an alternative with a similiar plot as well.This book just didn't seem to go anywhere and the ending....well, the ending. It just ended. Just like that.Thanks for reading!~Pandora"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bore","review":"Grisham has committed the ultimate author sin. He has written a totally BORING book. Although I liked the basic premise of sons -vs- father (judge) and even the money plot (although overused) might have been interesting. But Grisham just goes on and on about absolutely nothing. There was almost no plot to this story and his narrative had me yawning away. I will not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Dissapointment","review":"This book was such a dissapointment compared to his others that I feel bad for him.

Recently I've felt less than satisfied, compared to his early works, but I still enjoyed them enough to come back the next time.When I finished this one, however, I had to sit and wonder at how a novel could make me resent that I had spent my time reading it.While the book was easy to read, and while the characters were somewhat engaging, I kept waiting and waiting for SOMETHING to happen. Guess what? It never did. The ending was incredibly weak, as if the book was \\"supposed\\" to be a certain number of pages, and that the author simply decided to be done at that point.

It may even be the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The straight arrow Judge has 3 million in cash?","review":"The judge dies and his son finds the body ( or so it appears):he is the executor of the will.

He spends most of the book tracking down where his Dad got all that money while his brother goes into rehab for thenth time. When someone burns up the airplane he has just bought with partners, the chase becomes serious. For me this law professor is pretty stupid ( he should open a Swiss account or an offshore back account or at least a set of safe deposit boxes) in letting the thugs bully him.The twist at the end is interesting but not too earth shaking...This book is really not John Grisham's best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Read","review":"John Grisham writes another good book.

That said, this book was still disappointing. The plot was thin and uninteresting, the characters pretty character-less. It read like a short story that was stretched into a novel. A single story line, no twists, no tension, minimal character development. These same flaws also made the book read like someone's first novel.Asides: 1) I enjoyed Grisham's choices of surnames, wondering what he would come up with next (Atlee, Mirk, Magargel, Crum, Meave). 2) I hope Grisham's editor will learn which verb to use with the word \\"none\\". And 3) John, as hot as the Drifters were in the early 60s, you will not find their songs on any Motown albums!I hope this book is just an anomaly and not the beginning of a bottoming out (a la Cornwell)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I have read all of Mr. Grisham's books and find this one to be among the most bland.Ray Atlee is sent a letter by his dying father to attend a meeting.

The occasional interesting intrigues, suspense, and eventful encounters will keep a reader quickly flipping pages. What this one lacks, however, is a satisfying conclusion.In THE PARTNER, Grisham's main character, Patrick, lost everything--but somehow the girlfriend,Eva, seemed deserving as he had used her as a gofer, sex object, and particepts criminis for many years. Ray Atlee, in THE SUMMONS, is cheated, tricked and (ab)used by such a lessser antagonist that the reader is disappointed, rather than refreshed, by the ending.I will still buy the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Dud","review":"I love reading Grisham and was anticipating a wonderful read.

Atlee, a rapidly aging judge who lives in his past, summoning each of his sons to talk about estate matters. Ray the eldest of the sons, arrives first and finds his father dead along with a secret stash of over $3 million. Ray hides the money from his brother Forrest. However, Ray soon finds out that someone knows about the money. The intruder seems to know much more than he does.

I hope he does better in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham again and again, the same old!","review":"no more for me! I have read them all. Very slow. Maybe just the fact that I have read too many, but his books seem to go to \\"best seller\\" status before the bookstores get them. Perhaps because they publish enough numbers from the \\"get go\\" to make it a best seller so you buy it. I have enjoyed a lot of his earlier books but the plots get thinner and thinner."},{"rating":"1","title":"So little detail...Admittedly a little Boring","review":"I took in this book in about 6 hours of total reading and as a Grisham fan I anticipated this book being a legal thriller that was full of suspense and had a thick juicy plot. Unfortunately, I was really let down when all I found was a very basic plot without the real \\"thriller\\" part and a disappointing ending (to say the least). There were very few characters and it lacked the \\"warmth\\" build up to Ray Atlee the main character. In other words I never felt very close to him at all which is really too bad since this is usually what makes a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Grisham just cranking them out for the $$?","review":"This book starts with some great character development, building suspense and giving you the impression that you are in for a wild ride. Then it just stalls out for no apparent reason. The end was lame. It seemed like Grisham had a good idea, then lost inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second chances","review":"In the summer I started reading a painted house and I really lost interest. I thought I should give him(John Grisham) a second chance because he really is not known for that type of writing. So I decided to buy The Summons and I am glad I did, it was great and I think everyone should read it. This was an easy five stars for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Met My Expectations","review":"I remember almost flunking an important exam in college because I couldn't stop reading The Pelican Brief to study. WIth two small children, I bought this book to read on vacation because I knew it would be an easy read at the end of long days at the amusement park. I wasn't disappointed.Grisham's legal suspense novels have become too predictable. I enjoyed The Painted House (unlike many of my Grisham-addict friends)and hoped Grisham would continue to pursue more serious writing. Skipping Christmas helped me put the right perspective on the holiday season while providing an abundance of chuckles.Meanwhile, I continue to hold out hope that Grisham will thrill us all again one day. Until then, I'll save his books for my lighter reading needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"S-L-O-W !!!","review":"This one is a real \\"page-turner\\" ... I found myself flipping and skimming because I was so bored!I've read every Grisham novel (and many other authors regularly) and this one is not up to par. After the initial set-up of the plot, you follow the main character as he wanders indecisively back and forth across the country (and about 200 pages) with almost no plot advancement. The plot then finally fizzles to a resolution in the last 50 pages.Just goes to show that some authors can ride their past successes to a bestseller, even if it's a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere (and back) (5 times)","review":"This was my first Grisham novel, and I can't say I'm too impressed. In fact, I'm a bit blown away by this author's popularity. The characters are 1/2 dimensional at most. Other than that it's the same themes repeated ad nauseum - Ray moving money from place to place, a rattling door or broken window, sleep deprivation and a bit of boozing, and the occasional suspicious character, all of which were too obviously red herrings. As a result the ending was far too obvious - for me it had boiled down to whether it was Rex or the brother.The most engrossing part was his tour of a casino security center. I think that says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The summons","review":"Easy read. What u appreciate from this author. enjoy his books.

I have read all of his books and I think this one, to date, is the best (so far)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why I stopped reading Grisham","review":"This book was a waste of my time. The plot was so weak and thin, it was like a high school assignment gone wrong. The characters were caricatures, and not in a good way. The \\"hero\\" if you can call him that, is weak, stupid, and acts as though he has no idea how the real world operates. He constantly puts himself in dangerous positions for absolutely no reason, and blabs all kinds of information that it's obvious he should keep to himself. He also can't figure out how it is he is so easily followed, when a three year old would know by the third time it happens. The brother was a one dimensional character portrayed as not too bright because of his many addictions through the majority of the book but he suddenly becomes a mastermind at the end. It felt like this book was written in a rush, with little attention to detail, and once the number of pages required was met, it abruplty ended. Never will I waste my time with Grisham again, his days are over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow moving, and uninvolving","review":"The novel takes a look at the way money corrupts, and changes people. Ordinary men will cheat, steal, lie and turn violent at the prospect of a large sum of cash.Summoned by his dying father, Ray Atlee returns to his childhood home one last time. When he arrives, he finds Judge Atlee dead on his sofa, and three million dollars in cash in a cabinet behind him. Ray is plagued by a myriad of questions: where did the money come from? Who else knows about it? Would anyone be willing to kill for it?I love legal thrillers, so this was a nice venture back to a long forgotten comfort genre. Grisham's writing is as beautifully descriptive as I remember. Unfortunately, the story moved at a crawling pace, and failed to capture my attention. I couldn't bring myself to become interested in any of the characters, and the ending was a bitter disappointment to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham sticking to his formula","review":"Again, John Grisham has written a book using the exact same formula as the one he used in \\"The Firm,\\" \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" and \\"The Client.\\" The books are all about people on the run from other people who are trying to hurt them. If you like the formula, you'll like the book. If you agree with me that Grisham should develop a new formula because this one's getting old, then skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Summons has roped be back into JG","review":"I can't believe all of the negative reviews for this book. I read all of Grisham's books up to The Rainmaker, but stopped after that. I picked up The Summons on a whim and soon remembered how much I loved his books. I have ordered every one I've missed since The Rainmaker so I can catch up. If The Summons is a bad as everyone says, I must be in for some real treats ahead because I loved this book. The book is a quick read, but I will admit about half way through it seemed to drag for 3 or 4 chapters. However, overall I thought it was great and would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spelling and grammar errors ruined the book","review":"Spelling and grammar erros made the book too painful to enjoy.I feel cheated because I paid hard earned money for a book that the publisher did not bother to have proofed by a human before publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Summons","review":"I have read most of Grishams books and have always enjoyed them to the point that I cannot put them down. The summons started kind of interesting and thriller but by the middle of the book it was quite boring and took quite a long time to finish it. I am surprise no one mentions the Street Lawyer I thought it was terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZ...","review":"What a disappointment! I looked forward eagerly to Grisham's latest legal thriller, but he really let me down this time. Not only did I have a difficult time staying awake while trying to read this book, but I didn't care about any of the characters. Ray Atlee, the protagonist, is uninteresting and unlikeable. Last night I put it down with about 30 pages to go, and I'll have to force myself to finish. If you must read it for yourself, get it from the library and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever heard.

I really expected something more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Summons for Bad Judgement","review":"I was in the mood for a light, easy read and had not read Grisham in a while...boy was I disappointed. Light and easy it was and all those pages to build up to such a disappointing ending. When I think back to how well written, A Time to Kill was, Grisham should have just stopped there and gone back to practicing law or something else.

He must have had something distract him after he wrote the first chapter and never regained his train of thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst Grisham I've read","review":"When I began this book, I was hoping for the legal suspense which made Grisham famous. However, this book did not have much suspense. The entire book was a set up for the last pages--no real suspense or mystery in the middle. The ending was a little surprising, but not really. There had to be a catch (or I hoped anyway). But, there were only 2 credible ways that the book could have gone. With the vague ending, it seems that a sequel may be in the works, but I hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written, But Dull","review":"What a huge disappointment \\"The Summons\\" was. It was a boring plot which kept me reading because I figured it had to get better. This is, after all, John Grisham.

The pace was slow and I had to force myself to pick up the book on several occasions.

I couldn't believe the fluff that is considered \\"thrilling\\". I buy all Grisham novels in hardback because he is one of my favorite writers. From now on, I am waiting until they are out on paperback and I am checking them out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's worst!","review":"Shame on John Grisham for wasting my time. It was a good story, until the end, which leaves you hanging with regard to who is responsible for much of what happened in the book and for what will happen next.

I'm too angry at Mr. Grisham for having wasted a big part of my weekend reading this lousy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can Grisham be so boring?","review":"This book is slower than a lazy southern river on a hot summer day. I would have expected something a little more interesting from Grisham. The main characters, especially the protagonist are morally bereft and unlikeable, and the story just drags along, daring the reader to finish this slow-as-molasses novel.

This one enough so that I decided to warn others about it. Grisham's early works were a great read, enjoyable to the end and satisfying afterwards....Summons starts that way and makes the noble attempt but then seems like he got tired of writing and had to wrap up the book to get it to the publisher to meet a time commitment....Very unsatisfying and not worth the time to read.

I did. BUT, at times I grew tired of money moving around in the same manner, house to trunk, trunk to apartment, apartment to storage unit, storage unit to storage unit and again, then unit to trunk, trunk back into house. Not very imaginative really. The main character flies around a lot, gambles some, is entertained by a rich guy, nothing even sinister there to get excited about. A girl is introduced for no purpose at all really. I stayed with it though, expecting a clever move finally and he'd be on easy street. Not so.

I guess no one is perfect all the time because all in all, this is not a great read. If you want to get it at the library for free, do... but I would not pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"beyond a reasonable doubt","review":"I should have checked the Amazon ratings before picking up this novel.I was looking for a pleasant summer thriller - the kind that Grisham usually delivers. But this one disappoints. The primary weakness is plot. Why does the smart protagonist forget the obvious solution of registering the troublesome money with probate? What possible motive does a money-grubbing lawyer have to give away $3M when the gift can only cause him trouble? And how did the drug-befuddled brother manage the complicated theft without losing the money to his criminal cohorts? The story simply makes no sense.As Grisham often does, he weaves a moral question through this story. Here the idea is that the obvious black sheep of the family just may be morally superior to his alter ego. Unfortunately, the characters are just too shallow (and too deeply mired in an impossible plot line) to leave room for a reasonable doubt about conventional moral judgements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Snore!","review":"Well I had promised myself I was not going to read any more of John Grisham novels... but I got suckered in to reading this one by a friend who highly recommended it (they are now off my highly recommend list...). The back cover had great promise but I discovered what we had was not John Grisham's latest novel but his latest novel length film treatment. YAWN! This will make a fun movie as a book it was boring and slow moving. You didn't come to care at all for any of the characters. In Grisham's other books you cared... CHEERED ON... Darby Shaw, Mitch McDeere, and Jake Brigance in this book there was no hero character for you to care about. It's a shame but they will fix it (maybe) when they make the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"grisham was in a hurry","review":"the summons was the worst Grisham book. it seems like he had to fulfill some obligatin to his publisher and hastily wrote this meaningless, forgetful book. the story is weak. and the ending is obvious. i used to trust the 'best selling list' but after seeing that 'the summons' made number one, i will from now on draw my own opinion on what is considered a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diane who?","review":"If she is an author and gives The Summons 5 stars it's no wonder I have never heard of her.

It might have been his deliberate attempt to destroy his reputation or an insult to his publishers. Let me explain. There are three main characters that do not have characters. They do things that do not make any sense. How can Forrest write a summon, forge Judge's signature, mail it and not commit murder? How does Forrest know so much, forge IRA letter, then ended up knowing so little? This book was supposed to be about a judge who lived exemplary life and his two sons; one good and one bad. At the end of the story we were supposed to wonder who is really bad and who is really good. Unfortunately, the sequence of event does not make any logical or realistic sense so at the end of story I had only one question; Is this really written by John Grisham? He wrote much better stuffs so please spend your time reading other books that deserve John Grisham's name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hero is not a lawyer!","review":"Many JG books are about lawyers being thrust into interesting situations, but the Summons, although it has legal parts, is mainly about a regular person handling unexpected change.

Half way through the novel I simply gave up, acknowledging that I am turning Grisham in for better material. His last ten novels have succeeded in diminishing the value and credibility of his first three. He seems much more capable of producing mediocre, uninspired, sophomoric reading material than producing anything of serious novelistic value. You should not waste your time or money with this.

The father of the main character in this book, Judge Atlee, has a painting of Nathan Bedford Forrest in his study. One can only assume that Judge Atlee being from Mississippi and having such a picture would view the civil war from the Southern perspective. Most of the battles of the civil war have two names, the Northern name and the Southern name. When referring to these battles Grisham has the judge using the Northern names.

I read it to the end because I had my 25 bucks invested, but I could baely wait til it ended. A 50 page short story might have been more appropriate.

As always in his legal thrillers, Grisham takes the reader behind the law and into the South in a way no other author can. On top of that, his prose style is so crisp, so intelligent and reader-friendly that he deserves an award just for that. A very good novel that's definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story lost steam!","review":"I didn't like this book much.

It got very boring after a while, Grisham unsuccessfully tries to build suspense around totally uninteresting characters (The most interesting character, Judge Atlee, dies in the beginning of the book). Grisham can do much better than this. Because his books are usually so good, I haven't given up on him yet and will await the next book. I gave this one two stars simply because it kept me going until about the middle of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what Grisham works are about","review":"The first Grisham book I read. Not what I've heard about Grishman at all. easy read and a waste of time. the plot was weak and underdeveloped. Actually there didn't seemed to be much of a plot that could be further developed. Moral is good. It states that greed will drive one to extremes and an unpleasant life, however it's not worth your money not to mention the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING !","review":"Very well written book, but basically nothing really happens until the last pages of the book. Very slow-paced. The end is ridiculous and very disappointing. Total lack of imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little slow.......","review":"I picked up this book for a cross country flight expecting another masterpiece, alas I did not find that. I thought that the story itself had some potential, but I thought it was very slow to develop. Ray is a great character who has some moral issues to deal with when it comes to the Judge's money, and the issues surrounding his brother Forest. I just thought that the plot poked along slower than his other offerings."},{"rating":"1","title":"bookworm","review":"Another Grisham disappointment: predictable, slow, anticlimactic. It appears that Grisham is simply fulfilling his book contract as he laughs all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at his best!","review":"I couldn't wait to finally read another \\"law\\" book by Grisham. Well after reading this one, I guess the next wait won't seem as long! The character development is poor, you don't feel anything for the characters. The book is very drawn out, lacking any real excitement. I was also expecting a better ending, it was no surprize to me at all!Hopefully his next book isn't so quickly put together as this one seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Grisham","review":"This story moved so slowly. I kept reading just because I thought it had to get good at SOME point. The last 20 pages were interesting, maybe I should have started there and skipped the other 80% of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"John Grisham is an exceptional writer, but his heart clearly wasn't in this book. The suspense Grisham so masterfully created in his previous novels is clearly absent in The Summons. Grisham's vivid character descriptions were also absent in this story. I never developed a clear picture of Ray Atlee.In addition, while Judge Atlee's loyalty to Southern culture and nineteenth century Mississippi was well-established, his charity and sympathy for poor native blacks didn't seem to fit his character. Perhaps Grisham was attempting to portray the Judge as a schizophrenic old man who was tired of living. How else could one explain the Judge's civil right mindedness and also his affection for Nathan Bedford Forrest, founder of the KKK?As an aspiring novelist, I still hold John Grisham in high regard. Nonetheless, I believe he missed the mark on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"John Grisham really lets us down on this book. The plot has possibilities, but he fails to develop it to its potential. After The Testament and The Street Lawyer I thought Grisham would explore in more depth the moral dilemma confronted. But instead the energy went into finding the source of the money and looking for ways to hide it. The greatest curiosity about the book, however, is why Grisham misrepresents estate taxes as he does. Even when considering the modest estate of the father without the hidden cash Grisham leads his readers to believe half would be eaten up in estate taxes. Surely as an attorney he knows the first $1m of the estate is tax free. I had to wonder if he was pushing a political agenda in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money Grisham doesn't deserve it","review":"I made the mistake of reading Amazon's review, and gave Grisham one more chance, after two straight disappointments. It was so shallow Ithought he forgot to finish this book, as he had in his last supposed thriller. If you want to read a book similar to The Firm, read Brad Meltzer's The Millionaires. I think Grisham stole his sub plot from Meltzer, but didn't know how to finish it. Meltzer's keeps you guessing all the way through. I am finished with Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting worse","review":"My expectation may be higher than it should be. I read all his books, but I have to say that his work is getting worse. Although the basic concept of this book is interesting, he couldn't develop it well enough to entertain us. It's way too long to climax...actually, where is the climax? The ending is also very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars would be more appropriate","review":"I read 2 to 3 mystery/thrillers a week, including John Grisham's, and I would definitely say that this book must have been written with $ signs all over it-a quick buck for the author!-extremely disappointing after looking forward to his new book for several months-although, with Grisham, it's either feast or famine,and this was definitely famine-I've read better stories from the 6th graders that I teach-and they're not getting paid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Summons","review":"Who wrote this? This is the weakest Grisham book I have read and I generally like everything he has written. I kept waiting for it to grab me and it never did. And the end where he attempted to tie it all together was .... I was very disappointed. I got the feeling he had a deadline or book quota to meet so he just cranked it out knowing it would sell anyway. To make matters worse I was very disappointed that the publisher would allow a book to go out with so many spelling errors and mixed up words in sentences. In this day of computers and spell check there is no excuse for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope you have a low threshold for boredom","review":"This was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I thought, judging by the glowing reviews, that it would be very good. It is, instead, just a big blah. The characters are boring. There is little action. If you like books that offer nothing but wordy self-debates by dull characters, put your money on the counter. Otherwise, go home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't summon \\"The Summons.\\"","review":"As a Grisham fan, I have read all of his books. Unfortunatley,he seems to be running out of credible material, which is also indicative of his last several books. Although the story starts out well, he uses too many digressions during the story which almost made me put the book down. There is no real tension or drama unfolding. The ending is quite predictable. The book is a real letdown. I hope he starts producing the good drama of his earlier books. He has been on a slow slide downward. I would suggest that you not summon \\"The Summons.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your Money","review":"Second-rate to say the least! We have been ardent supporters who have purchased millions of books authored by Mr. Grisham. To this end, I would expect Mr. Grisham to give us an interesting read. This book was weak...the ending was boring...the characters were poorly developed and overall it was a waste of time to flip the pages. I would like my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved the plot","review":"I read this camping and loved the summer read.

As a novice I enjoyed this and have read a few more Grishams since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superb reading by Michael Beck","review":"Kudos to Michael Beck for making something out of this medicore book. Were it not for his superb reading, I would have given this book 1 star. I'm a huge Grisham fan, but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers....this book stunk. It's almost as if someone else wrote it. There was none of his trademark \\"gripping suspense\\", the story didn't flow very well, and the ending was just terrible (too abrupt, too many loose ends)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even deserve one single star","review":"Wow - what a waste of time! This is the worst John Grisham novel I've ever read by a long way - and I was so looking forward to reading my first in a long time.This book is about boring people leading boring lives. The character development is weak. The plot lurches from one irrelevant episode to the next and, up to about page 250, seems to be a travelogue of Ray Atlee between Virginia and Memphis. It almost seems Grisham had some research left over from another novel and decided he could use it up.I invested about five hours and learned nothing - boy was I mad when I got to the end for the most improbable, contrived conclusion.Don't waste your time reading this. It's so bad it seems someone maybe somebody ghost wrote it for Grisham.Who knows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised at the low ratings","review":"I read this book last year, and it really kept me on pins and needles. It was a book I could not put down. That is why I am so surprised at the lower ratings the book has received. The only one of Grisham's books I could not finish was \\"The Chamber.\\" That was a boring book for me. And I notice that it got better ratings. However, I liked the suspense in this novel. My friends and family also like the book very much. Of course, everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I respect that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great - Grisham fans look elsewhere","review":"(No spoilers) This one had a lot of potential, but ended up going nowhere. In fact, a little worse - the ending was abrupt and didn't really resolve anything.I tend to agree with the consensus here, though I will add that if they make a movie out of The Summons, I would hope they clean up some of the plot holes. There were a lot of little things that could have made a great story - the possible involvement of the mob, the unexplored history of their father's life as a judge, etc.None of these were explored in the book, and actually I didn't really care about the protagonist one way or another.If you're a huge Grisham fan and need to read the entire canon, then just realize this will be a slight disappointment. It wasn't absolutely awful, just flat & disappointing. But if you're new to Grisham, and looking for a good legal thriller, then maybe start elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not believe this was John Grisham","review":"I don't know what this book was supposed to be but it definitely was not worth spending any amount of time on. The characters were unlikable, the story was boring and the ending was ridiculous.I have to admit that it got so laborious that I skipped much and just went to the end. I was a Grisham fan but lately have found his writing to have lost its intrigue. I think I have read his last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't answer it","review":"When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's best but a decent read...","review":"This book just didn't keep me glued to my seat like his first book \\"The Firm\\". Why can't he write like that anymore? I expected something more out of this than Ray's father being given a friendly lump sum from Patton French. I expected more than the entire episode of harassment, deceit and stalking to be performed by someone other than his loser brother. I mean it's like Grisham was building up to something and BAM! he had a day that really sucked, got tired of this subject and just wrote a fast ending. I am really disappointed. Of course his knowledge and description of the law is nice but as to plot, this one wasn't that great. Where's the suspense? It's gone. He seems to be losing his edge. Thank God I borrowed this from the library and didn't pay good money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I've liked the other Grisham books I've read, but didn't enjoy this one, and the ending left me flat. I'll be checking the Amazon reviews before reading any other of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I am a Grisham fan. Most of his books are terrific reads. However this one is boring, boring, boring. I read it two thirds through and put it down. I just kept reading and reading, expecting it to go somewhere, expecting something exciting to happen, and after getting 2 thirds through I gave up. It reads like Grisham was under a publisher's deadline and just started typing, putting in whatever came to mind. The problem is that it never goes anywhere. Save your money and read his other books - Runnaway Jury was great, so was the Testament, the Partner, and all the others I've read. But this one was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is ridiculous","review":"John Grisham should know better... with the publishing of The Summons, he has really hit rock bottom. This book is so a to z formula that is should immediatly be a mass market paperback. I, as a Grisham fan, am sorry that I even read this ~350 page book. It is not a bestseller, it is not a good story, and until I hear otherwise, I will not read a John Grisham book again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and plodding!","review":"After two books(which I did not read) where he apparently ventured into different genres, Grisham returns to familiar territory of the legal thriller with 'The Summons'. The summons are received by Ray, a law professor, from his father, an ex small-town judge. Going home, Ray finds his dad dead but also finds a huge amount of cash and tries to determine the source.While the idea in 'The Summons' might have made an interesting short story, it is too flimsy for a full-length novel and so is stretched too thin. The red herrings are painfully obvious as just that as Ray eliminates suspects who may know about the money and way too much time is spent on this process. Worse, the revelation of the source is anticlimactic and doesn't match the build up. And after taking a leisurely route for most of the novel, the final portions seem rushed with the twist at the end being expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I was looking forward to reading a Grisham novel, so I eagerly leap into the pages of \\"The Summons.\\" By the time I completed the book, I was disappointed with the character development, story line and resolution of the novel. The word that struck me was \\"flat.\\" This book does not have the depth and rapid-fire pacing of his other legal novels. I also found it interesting that this novel, based in Clanton, MS, does not even briefly mention the events which occurred in \\"A Time To Kill,\\" which also took place in Clanton. You would think a person from a law family who was reminiscing at times about his past would have brought up such a momentous event that occurred in his town. The storyline was weak and most of the characters were annoying. Harry Rex was the best defined character and the book was most enjoyable to read when he was on the page. I figured a key part of the mystery about 2/3 through the book. Not fun! No Grisham twists and turns here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was excited to see Grisham had a new book...","review":"I was excited to see Grisham had a new book out.

I can't believe Grisham let this one go to press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Grisham's Finest","review":"This book features the usual Grisham trademarks--well developed characters, interesting Southern locales, and a hero whose life appears ready for a change. These features draw the reader into the book. But once there, the plot meanders into a series of dead ends before bringing us to a predictable and unsatisfying conclusion.This is particularly disappointing to the legion of Grisham fans, of which I am one.I know you're goping to buy the book anyway, and it is a good way to kill some time. But don't expect this to be the second coming of The Firm, The Partner or even Missing Christmas. It's just a lesser effort by this outstanding writer. My prediction---this book will never be made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK WEAK WEAK . . . and did I say WEAK","review":"OK, so the story moves along and for awhile I was pretty engrossed. Then I started to get bored. Then I started to get frustrated. We are led to believe that Ray Atlee, an Antitrust professor at one of the most prestigious law schools in the country, can't figure out how to safely hide some cash? Give me a break. The main character's idiocy alone made me want to throw the book through a window. Another small point, John: How can you assume that your readers are so stupid that they don't understand the basics of estate taxes? One of the early premises of the story is that Ray wants to hide $90,000 from the govt. so that he wouldn't have to pay 50% in estate taxes . . . and his attorney agrees with Ray's concerns. Hello, anyone with the intellectual capacity to read your books knows that there are no estate taxes on estates valued under a certain ceiling (I believe $700,000 these days).

He rattles on and on describing an old judge through 1/2 of the book and then the other half is about how and why that same judge managed to get a fortune in cash. I have no words and no time to describe what a slow read, and boaring boaring boaring book this was. Do not waste your money or your time on this book - that is my advise to you.

Not to spoil the ending, but it was a HUGE let down. He gives many sermons on how bad money is, yet he rakes in millions. There is far too much time wasted on text that only drags the book out, but yet once it is cut out will make for an OK movie. My choice would be to wait for the video, no, wait until it is free on national TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dull Read Best Skipped","review":"This was the worst of the Grisham books. I cannot believe that some people are writing good reviews of this book. Grisham's book was not only boring, dull, anti-climatic, shallow, but also inaccurate in estate tax law.

And this is not just my opinion, but that of several friends who read his books. It's as if his publisher says, \\"Okay, John, where's next year's book?\\" And John sits down & pounds out a few hundred pages. \\"The Brethren\\" was great until it petered out at the end. \\"The Painted House\\" left much to be desired despite being such an acclaimed novel by the critics. And now \\"The Summons!\\" You could care less about the characters; they aren't people the reader can grow to like or care about. But the worst part of the book is that it reads like a 'day timer' or someone's boring diary. So I ask you, \\"Whe-e-ere's Johnny?\\" Did he employ a ghost writer after the first few books, or what? Come on, Grisham. Where's your enthusiasm? Go back & reread your books that made you one of the best authors in the world.

The main character is likeable although a little bland at times. The story had me guessing as to who was behind what. Although there were legal elements in the book it isn't a legal thriller but it was a thriller. One complaint was I wanted more of Clanton, MS.

The very thin plot line didn't get remotely interesting until about 40 pages before the end of the book. But by then, poor John had written himself into a corner. Using a pretty far-fetched device, he tries to neatly wrap up his one, lonely story line. But by then I had already figured out who the protagonist was. I wish he had explored the character of the lawyer with the yacht (whose name escapes me now). I wish I knew more about Forrest than the one-dimensional portrayal given. Oh well.

The story had no depth and a very weak plot to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summon the Summons","review":"What has happened to John Grisham? Usually the writer of intrigue and mystery, \\"The Summons\\" is blatantly predictable and certainly not up to this author's standards.His only attempt at suspense is having an unbelievable amount of money shuttled thruought the chapters (when any sensible person would have found a bank safety depository--but then there would have been no story!) Stay tuned for a sequel as the ending leaves the reader without an end. Let's hope Mr. Grisham is not becoming a \\"run of the mill\\" writer, since his prior publications have reflected his juristic talent and \\"The Summons\\" appears to be cranked out for profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another waste - could have been good, but flops again.","review":"John Grishman are so easy to read, I decided to read this one on the train.

Grisham must have done that with The Summons, although no amount of tuning could fix this debacle. I won't give the ending away except to say that if you have one living neuron left in your brain, you'll be disappointed by it.Grisham and David Baldacci were terrific when they started but some of their later stuff is pure dreck. If an unknown writer copied this into manuscript form and submitted it, not an agent in the country would touch it while wearing a hazmat suit. It's that bad.It will be a lonnnnggg time before I waste my limited reading time on another Grisham novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the critics claim!!","review":"I have always loved his books but all the hype didn't match this novel at all. Very slow reading leading up to a good ending (believe it or not). I was very disappointed in this novel and would not recommend to fans of Grisham because they will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb!","review":"Anyone calling this drivel a pleasent read should have never read anything decent in his life so that he is short of comparing. JG is not a good author; he is so mechanic-but his thrillers are occassionally good for passing time- but this is an insult to readers and the publishing industry at all. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of His Worst Efforts","review":"Grisham is a guilty pleasure for me, and I generally find his legal thrillers to be fast paced, compelling page turners with lots of mystery, action and intrigue. Not great literature, but a great diversion. However, I'm convinced his best legal thrillers are all behind him (The Firm, The Client, The Rainmaker, The Pelican Brief). This book is utterly boring, and none of the characters are worthy of even passing interest. The best character in the book, Patton French, is given only about 15 pages or so. I'll sum this book up for you so you can skip it and read something better (no spoilers though): A guy finds some money. He spends 300 pages wondering where it came from and what to do with it. Eventually he finds out. The end. Even his mediocre books (The Street Lawyer, The Runaway Jury, The Brethren) blow this one out of the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop writing dribble","review":"I used to think the Brethern was the worst book that Grisham ever wrote, but I now think The Summons is. I don't know if he's lost his touch or he's just too busy making money to care--people keep buying his books anyway. There are no twists in the plot, while Ray and his brother, Forrest, are shallow and unsympathetic. When I was whining about the book the other day, my husband asked me, \\"Why do you continue buying this guy's books?\\" I think I keep hoping he'll get his old flair back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I agree with an earlier reviewer. I will not be spending any more money on Grisham's legal thrillers in the future. I, too, was disappointed in his last few legal-related books but after reading \\"A Painted House,\\" which I thought was excellent, I decided to give him one more try. The writing in this book was at a grade school level. I only finished it because I kept hoping it would improve. It did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a complete disappointment","review":"John Grisham really cheats his readers with this latest effort. Actually, he doesn't seem to have put much effort in at all. Throughout the book, I kept feeling that this was nothing more than a short story that he stretched into a novel. With so many other great authors doing wonderful work, this one is not worth the short time it will take to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll have to agree","review":"With the majority of reviews here. The book is dull.All the characters are shallow and unformed (Ray being the worst -- I didn't like him at all).The story drags so badly, when the ending finally arrived, Ijust didn't care.The book has no soul; it's just a moneymaker.J.G. is laughing all the way to the bank. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Being a John Grisham fan I have read every one of his books including \\"The \\"Painted House\\" and \\"Skipping Christmas\\". I enjoyed all of them except \\"The Summons\\". Was John in rehab when he wrote this one? Not much of a developed plot, no character development, and the ending---Going to spend the money on a fancy-shamancy Betty Ford like drug treatment clinc? Who cares? Lame Lame Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Summons","review":"Not Grisham's best. After \\"A Painted House\\" (my favorite Grisham book), I was disappointed. I love it when Grisham fools me with his ending, and it just didn't happen here. A couple of characters were used as throw aways - the Private Detective, and the potential new girl friend (student) were not used in the plot, and were useless characters. I would rate this about the same as \\"The Chamber\\", and \\"The Street Lawyer\\" - below my favorites \\"Runaway Jury\\", \\"The Brethren\\", and \\"The Partner\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertising might pay off.","review":"Grisham is an accomplished story teller. He has a pleasant style that allows you to sit and \\"listen\\" to his narative. However, this book takes forever to develop any excitement or mystery. It is strictly a story for 2/3 of the pages. The balance is predictable, and again not thrilling or enticing in any way. I like the fact that he does not deal in smut or gutter language, but please, John, do something for your money beside living off a couple outstanding novels. If you must read all the Grisham books, wait for the paperback, or go to the library for this one.Harry Smale"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFINITELY NOT JOHN GRISHAMS BEST","review":"I FOUND IT TO BE A VERY SLOW READ, AND AFTER WAITING FOR IT WAS DISAPPOINTING. THE STORY LINE WAS EXTENDED WAY TOO LONG AND THE ENDING WAS A NO BRAINER. READ THE BOOK AND JUDGE IT FOR YOURSELF. IT WAS NOT JG'S BEST WORK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother...","review":"It seemed to me that John Grisham had a deadline to write a book for his publisher and scrambled to put something together. Unfortuntely, what he came up with is disappointing. The book is anorexic, there is no meat to this plot. It lacks substance and character development, and the plot is too simple. It ends abruptly, as if the required number of pages had been met. It pains me to say it, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid ...and boring.","review":"This is by no means an \\"adult\\" novel. Probablya good one for middle-schoolers.

It's been years! The runaway Jury was the last one that captured me. I liked Grisham's sidestep (a painted house). It was a well written book, but nothing I can't find with other writers. Grisham writes legal thrillers, so why is his last book no thriller? The story gets interesting around page 260 and the end is ok, but why must we sit through the motions of burial, lunch and sleepless nights? It's spring, I wanted to fall in love so much, but it's not there, the groundhog saw his shadow (and this book), 6 more weeks of winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fast read from John Grisham","review":"John Grisham is pretty much the king of pop-fiction/pop-thriller novels.\\"The Summons\\" moves at warp speed thru the first 330 pages, and the reader is primed for an intense resolution. For me, the ending was a most unsatisfactory conclusion. It was as if Mr. Grisham either got tired or bored and just ended it. I have had that feeling with a couple of his titles.Still, those initial 330 pages are well worth the price of admission. The ride is better than the destination---and that certainly is not a bad thing---and it is quite a ride.Characters that I found most interesting kept appearing. One more intriguing the the next.His red herrings continued to trick me, as I kept changing my deduction on who the villain was.This is a fast read and would be a most pleasant way to spend a weekend. Reading John Grisham is like eating peanuts---you cannot put the book down until all the pages disappear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tale of Two Losers","review":"I find it hard to believe this book was written by the sameauthor as The Pelican Brief and The Firm. This book, a storyof two sons summoned home by their dying father, is simplyboring. Both sons are disappointments to their father andin life. And the reader is given no reason to really likeeither one.Ray comes home to find his father dead and a hoard of cashhidden in the house. He must decide whether or not to tellhis brother Forrest.

Seriously guys, dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham needs a vacation","review":"I think John needed a little extra cash when he wrote this one. Slow moving, predictable, and generally a long long bore. Gee John, has fame done you in?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"John Grisham is my favorite author and I rush to read any of his books. I enjoy 'law and order' books and his fill the bill. I expected that from this book but it was not to be. First of all, I found the title of the book to be misleading. It is not a summons to appear in court, which I thought, but rather a summons from a dying father to his sons. The next misleading thing was the cover of the book. It shows what looks like the ceiling of a court. Why was that put on the cover of this book which only briefly entered a court? The story was not up to the Grisham standard and lastly, the ending was very unsatisfying and confusing. All in all this is the worst book that Mr. Grisham has written, not worthy of even the one star I gave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall From Grace","review":"The last 2 Grisham books that I have read have made me reconsider buying any more. Between 'A Painted House' and this one, I just don't think I can do that to myself any more. This one wasn't as bad as 'A Painted House' but that's not really saying much because they were both bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Terribly predictable. Started slow, got a little better,then a complete let-down as it went on. Had the ending figured out long before the book stopped. His first books were good to excellent. Now feel that he's churning them out just for the money because there isn't a lot of thought that goes into his later works (this being the worst, yet). I had hopes, but was simply disappointed again."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back!","review":"Finally the John Grisham that gave us The Firm and The Client. No more preaching to his readers, just a good story that's hard to put down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Grisham book","review":"I've read all of Grisham's books, and this is my last! What a major disappointment. Given that his name alone garners millions of dollars in advances, I suppose he feels like he doesn't have to work as hard anymore. This book is pure lazy. It reads like it was written for an 8-year old. No complexity. No layers. Trivial grammar. Overly simplistic plot. It makes me sick that this man gets mega money for this type of work!Instead of Skipping Christmas, Grisham should have skipped The Summons!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"I read this book, hoping that the next chapter would be better.

(A Painted House & Skipping Christmas). What a huge disappintment. This book was a very slow read and didn't get interesting until the last 100 pages and then had a dozer of an ending. I'm beginnging to think Grisham's given us all he has to offer. Oh well, it was fun while he lasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!!! My book is missing the last chapter","review":"I thought that this was one of the most suspenseful books that Grisham has written. However, he is still plagued by those horrible endings. On a positive note, I guess this wasn't his typical \\"Ride off into the Sunset\\" ending.I read the last paragraph (although I didn't know it was the last paragraph), and was surprised when I turned the page, and found out it was the last page.Did he procrastinate this book and was rushed at the end by his editor???John - I am sorry to say I think I like the \\"Sunset\\" endings better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Summons-A Non-Story","review":"I own and have read all of John Grisham's books. I have read most of them more than once, but The Summons is as lackluster a book as I have ever read by any author. There is nothing gripping about it until the very end, when the reader, if he is still awake, doesn't care anymore. There is no character development, no real plot, and it's just plain boring. Nobody can write great all the time, but this is incredibly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great!","review":"Another great Grisham Law Suspence!

This was the first book I was able to sit down over a weekend and read the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't be fooledagain","review":"I thought 'The Painted House' was one of the worst books I have read but 'The Summons\\" tops it. What has happened to you, Mr Grisham? I will not be fooled again. I was a real fan of yours but now have lost all interest. It was apparent soon after the strange events began to occur who the real 'bad guy' was. Why couldn't 'the hero' figure this out for himself? Who else knew all about him? Oh well,I finished the book and tossed it so won't have tolook at it again.......nor will I buy any of Grisham's future writings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham shows us how not to finish a good mystery","review":"This one goes along like a good mystery - not too fast, and not too slow. The hero finds a good sum of unexplained money, and knows that somebody is onto him. It gets very exciting near the end, as he feels the noose tighten around his neck, but then, Mr Grisham lets us down in the last chapter. The book ends in a very unspectacular whimper. Left unexplained were several events, such as: Why the arson events? Why the threat to the IRS? Why didn't the bad guy just steal the money in the first place? Why didn't the bad guy know where the money was, given the extreme surveillance our hero was under (e.g., the photos of his secret storage sites)? Some ... no, correct that... most of the actions done by the bad guy didn't seem to be in his best interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta Make That Payment on the Ferrari","review":"I give this book two stars because it is at least mildly entertaining. You read The Firm and then you read The Summons and you realize that John Grisham has either shot his creative wad or he's become too greedy and lazy to write at the level he achieved with The Firm...in The Summons Grisham starts off with a compelling idea but then seems to lack the will to develop that idea to its full potential. After a great start, The Summons turns into predictable, cliche-ridden boilerplate. It feels like a story that was ginned out in a hurry to meet a contract deadline..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious lack of suspense","review":"After waiting for a new suspenseful Grisham novel, I am still waiting. The Summons was predictable and easy to figure out. It was hard to get into this novel because Ray Atlee wasn't the most likeable character and none of the characters were very interesting or admirable.I kept reading hoping for the story line to improve but it didn't.

After reading The Summons, I went back and re-read A Time to Kill. There is no comparison. Grisham needs to the take the time to turn out a book like his first one.

And when it finally DID end, I wasn't happy.I was so looking forward to Grisham getting back into the lawyer/illegal scandel themes he is famous for, especially after his departure of The Painted House (which I forgive due to a mid-life crisis) and this work just isn't of the calibre of all his earlier work.

There are a lot of discrepancies, which seem to have been overlooked during the research and writing of the book. I enjoyed it, simply because of the author, but know that he has so much more in him.

Nothing new, nothing that really grabs you and say this is the man who started the run on legal thrillers.I miss the depth of character from books like A Time to Kill, the surprise per page of The Firm and the audacity of The Runaway Jury, and yet this book is not bad.

She deserves an Oscar for her appearence."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment for Stockard Channing.","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this film. Stockard Channing is supposed to be a newly-promoted CEO, and Julia Stiles is a young assistant with the firm. While working together in the same city, giving various presentations on behalf of the firm, they end up getting to know each other while staying in the same hotel. Stockard invites Julia to her room for drinks, where she learns that a headhunter she had been using (and who is also staying at the same hotel), raped a friend of Julia's a few years back. Julia supposedly gets Stockard to try and kill the headhunter, but he ends up surviving. It was a completely implausible scenario.... a CEO befriending a young assistant of the firm virtually overnight, drinking in front of her, and then allowing herself to be swayed to kill someone. Not only that, but how often have we already seen films of women taking things into their own hands, and venging the rape of another woman? It was total garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the world was the point?!?","review":"I didn't understand this movie. It started out real slow and never picked up.

If anyone knows if they come in a smaller size, please let me know because then it gets 5 stars. Good news is, the price is perfect and shipping not outrageous.

I'll start off by saying that I really like this game. On the positive side it has a Diablo/Dungeon Seige feel to it, the items and equipment are numerous, and the story is great. But on the negative end at times it can be cofusing as to what to do next, you have to save ALOT or else you will lose your stuff, and contrary to the promise of free on-line play(printed boldly on the box) no such thing exists. I'm sure they will release a patch to fix the bugs, I'm also sure the will make good on their promise of an online game, and hopefully someone will publish a stratagy guide. When these things have been taken care of, they will have a five star game on their hands.

I got to a certain point, and I had zero idea where to go, even with reloading an older saved game and trying again, to make sure I didn't miss some key dialogue.Given that I felt the game would tell you to \\"accomplish A, obtain B,\\" but never tell you where B might be found, or even an inkling as to where A could be begun at, I quit.This game was too much money to be this disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I thought the setting sounded like it would make an interesting change from the standard European fantasy world so I downloaded the demo and tried it out. It ran fine on my system, which meets and exceeds the recommended system profile on the retail box, so I bought the full version of the game. Turns out that while the demo runs fine on my system, the full version won't run at all. Strategy First's tech support has largely consisted of telling me to make sure I have all the latest drivers, I do, and to uninstall and reinstall the game, which I have. The game still doesn't work so they've kicked me up to their 2nd tier tech support who haven't bothered to contact me in over a week.

Now after ordering this tape set, I discover that it was previously released as \\"Companion to Power of Now Vol. 1\\" Nowhere in the write ups does it mention this and it is only written on the front of the package in small black letters against a dark green backround. And guess what, I already have the tape set, \\"The Companion to the Power of Now\\" and so I am out twenty something dollars. To top it off, [Amazon.com] still sells \\"The Companion...Vol. One\\" and for more money, than this tape - its' twin. All I can say is shame on Sounds True and Tolle.

He says that on enlightenment 80 % of his thought processes disappeared. He is a lovely and simple and inspiring guy and I have sent copies of his book to many people, and the CD Even the Sun will Die, but I would love to know why he feels this need to keep saying the same thing over and over and use his enlightenment like so many others to make a buck or two.Is there no other way to be....do we have to earn a living by marketing our spiritual awareness...how many CD's did Gandhi publish....?

Fast shipping too. Great training tool for perfecting a solid swing. I would use this product for kids from six years and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and unpleasant","review":"I was very disappointed with both the CD and the book. For one, the Chinese songs on the CD are English songs that have been awkwardly translated into Chinese - making for numerous, numerous instances of rushed lines and syllables, as well as contracted or dropped syllables/words. Additionally, they're not exact translations, either - the last line of \\"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes\\" (which, in English, is traditionally \\"Head, shoulders, knees and toes!\\") becomes, in Chinese, \\"Eyes, ears, mouth, nose, clap hands!\\"I also found the vocals to be horrendous. The English vocals are fairly standard kid's music fare - annoyingly cutesy/sweet/\\"dreamy\\". The Chinese vocals are, for the most part, a screechy mess.The only reason I gave this item 2 stars is because my son, despite what I think, likes the CD. And, to be fair, the spoken Chinese sections aren't that bad - plus, it's one of the few widely available Chinese language learning products for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, great series","review":"my daughter has the chinese, spanish and french editions. the songs are great. i especially appreciate that the songs are the same in each edition. that repetition makes it easy for children to learn the songs in various langauges."},{"rating":"2","title":"A startling and successful experiment","review":"I'm not much for ambient electronic music, but this soothes me.

I really struggled with stats in college and this book combined with SPSS made me wonder why I ever thought it was so difficult! I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to measure program performance or for those working on a thesis or dissertation that deals with quantitative analysis. However, this book does not break down the stats equation but expects you to have software, such as SPSS to do that for you. It focuses more on interpreting data that has already been calculated with software. The book also details case studies to help you determine which type of process/test to use to maximize validity. All in all, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the book you are looking for","review":"After I graduated with a BS in statistics, I decided to get an MPA. I looked forward to taking a graduate level stats class, thinking it would be an easy 'A.' Then I read the first chapter of this book. I knew I was in trouble. The book is terribly written and is riddled with mistakes (the method of computing a median from grouped data is both confusing and incorrect, for example). Luckily, I have a background in stats to compensate for areas where the book is lacking. I feel bad for my classmates. Everyone in the class strongly dislikes the book, including me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was for class","review":"A quick read but only useful if professor is going to make students refer to the book throughout the semester.

See it if you can't get enough of the party movies, but don't expect anything to have you rolling on the floor with laughter.Edit: well, it's now 2011, and I have no recollection of ever seeing this movie.

I bought this because so many of them said it was funny, yet there was not one laugh to be had in the whole movie. The acting is just awful, and Tara, Lea, and Norm had glorified 2 minutes each and were just along for a paycheck. A truly bad movie. One of the worst and unfunniest movies I have ever seen.

Lovecraft for the stark horror and inspired madness that abounds in his writing. Whenever I go to festivals, I'm often disappointed by the nerdy in-jokes and amateurish filmmaking, which is why this film was so refreshing. And the special effects were great given the low budget. This is now one of my favorites, along with In The Mouth Of Madness, From Beyond, Re-Animator, and the little known Japanese film Uzumaki."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Good Film","review":"This film is very good and one of the few movies I have ever seen that actually gave me the creeps. Very strange. That scene where the couple is walking through the streets on that island and they began to see odd people who look as if they have been taking too much cod liver oil is pretty creepy. Forget about weather you like Lovecraft or not, this is a good movie and should be seen.I don't remember this ever being released in the theater. If it wasn't it should have been. There is another movie called Blood Tide with James Earl Jones, Deborah Sheldon, and Jose Ferrer that reminds me of this although it takes place on a small Greek Island but has a similar story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"Since watching the Reanimator films and loving them, I have taken to reading stories by H.P. Lovecraft and I can only wonder what he would have thought of this movie. While scary and gory, it seemed rather intelectually shallow, unlike Lovecraft's written work. I kind of liked the wimpy hero here as he seemed like the type of everyman so prominent in Lovecraft's stories, however the ending just left me empty. It was contrived and poorly done. Where did the tentacles come from? Dagon was supposed to be some kind of fish god or at least that's what I understood. There may have been some other technical problems like the car starting after the wires were ripped out and gills on people in different areas of their bodies but I could live with that. Sorry, but this one just was not enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fishy Fun","review":"I got lucky and saw this movie at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, a theater that playes cult movies, and this is definately an instant cult classic. The story is about four people who are shipwreked outside a small coastal town. What follows is in truly Lovecraftian. The movie is a little low budget, but makes up for it with creepines and wit. Overall, this movie will be an instant favorite among H.P. Lovecraft fanatics, but does have a few flaws. Most of the dialogue by older Spanish actor is unintelligable. The main character is not immediately likeable, but soon evolves into an Ash/Crawford character. The two friends in the boat could have been dealt with a little more grisly. Aside from these minor points, this is a fun movie with one of the greatest death scenes ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised and Pleased!","review":"A refreshingly good film adaptation of an H.P. Lovecraft story! Based on the short story \\"Shadow Over Innsmouth\\", this movie takes a few liberties with the story (such as changing the location from Massachusetts to Spain), but retains the essence of the Lovecraftian horror.

I can't believe I wasted my money on this trash. It takes more than human beings with fish-like physical characteristics to make a good horror movie. I can't believe that people defend this movie.

The cast were terrific, except that sometimes I found Francisco Rabal's accent a bit hard to understand. And Macarena Gomez must be the sexiest mermaid ever! The scenes in the streets of Innsmouth - or Inboca as it is called here - were terrific, with the shambling half-seen figures in the rain. And the film-makers didn't wimp out with the ending - they basically went with HPL's ending, with Paul Marsh accepting his fate as one of the \\"children of Dagon\\". I also thought the underwater photography and thw music deserved honourable mentions. All in all a great little move, and true to the spirit of HPL.

If you are into rubber tentacles and generously spilled cranberry juice, if Lovecraft stories for you are nothing but a bunch of monsters, then hurry to get this movie. Otherwise, just get comfortable, grab the story and enjoy it in its entirety - dark athmosphere, wonderful language - all that makes Lovecraft's fiction so much appreciated.As for the movie, there is one thought that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling.

It is horrible, quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a fan of less than box-office hit movies, (So to say \\"B\\" movies) but Dagon is by far the stupidest of them I have ever seen. If a movie that makes you actively want the main character to die (preferably the most painful death your numbed brain can come up with) is a movie you want to see, Dagon is perfect. However, if you want to actually enjoy a movie (and avoid a few months of nightmares in witch an irritatingly scrawny likewise pale man is dying), stay far far away from this movie.PS: Only people with great empathy would consider those nightmares, as a normally detached person would be the one killing IP,LSM. (Irritatingly pale, likewise scrawny man)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disapointment!","review":"Being a big fan of HP Lovecraft, and after reading some reviews, I decided to buy this DVD. BIG Mistake!First, The first half of this movie is way too slow. I admit, that Lovecraft stories are not fast paced, but this really dragged. I actually turned it off, and watched the second half the next day.Second, the main character is [not very bright]. He wasn't so in the storie(s). The writing and acting left much to be desired.Third, the added gore towards the end was not needed. I've come to expect this from low budget movies, but its a poor substitute for good writing and acting.I guess, that Lovecraft doesn't translate onto film well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Flick","review":"I can't say much different that other reviewers already have. If you are a Lovecraft or Stuart Gordon fan, or a horror fan in general, this movie is worth checking out. While not perfect, they did a good job with a low budget. My biggest advice would be to put on the subtitles once the old man character comes along. His accent is so bad that you won't understand a word of what he is saying. Also, the chanting of the cultists has some very familiar words if you are a reader of Lovecraft."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top Lovecraft movies","review":"Although it is an amalgamation of several Lovecraft stories, this is by far one of the best in recent memory. There's no real way to describe what effect it can have on you if you are truly open to letting it sink in. Although, on a technical level, there is room for improvement, this is true of most movies out there. The cinematographer understands the mood of HPL's stories, and captures it very nicely. Some scenes appear to be of lower quality than others, but their placement in the movie captures the feel of the moment, which is a technique that is lost to most hollywood directors in this day and age. I highly recommend it to not only HPL fans, but also to those horror buffs that are searching for something more intelligently written."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I think this is the best game.It is a kind of game that would be for the ages 8 ann up.There is some vilance."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEED MORE SAVING OPPORTUNITIES!","review":"Although the age category begins at 6 for this game, my 7 year old (and I must confess, I too) find this game montonous and frustrating.

They told me they'd give me a refund if I sent them back. I returned the cables and was given only a partial refund. After a great deal of effort, I got some more of my money back, but they refused to fully refund me. Fortunately Amazon refunded me the rest of the money after I made an Amazon A-Z Guarantee claim.

We got this cable so we can plug the iPod into it. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it claims, and not much more","review":"Personally, I find it rather appalling that Alpine produces a line of \\"made for iPod\\" head units and then requires you to purchase a separate and rather expensive cable to actually use the features of those head units.However, that's the way it is, and this cable works as described. I see that there is a newer version which allows for control and charging of the iPhones. Oddly, my older cable (which definitely does not have a converter on it) actually allows me to access my iPhone 3G music in the exact same fashion as on my iPod Nano (gen 2), as used with my Alpine IDA-X200 head unit. I haven't checked to see if it actually charges the phone, but it would seem to be the case that it does not, unless my cable is a magic exception (unlikely...)Anyways, it's a cable, it works, and you should probably just buy the newer version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"Bought a car with the Alpine stereo in it that has a mp3 connection.

The single best thing about the book is that the advice is actionable. You can read this book and immediately begin tuning.Coverage is excellent - performance tuning, capacity planning, setting up disk drives, managing cpu, I/O, network, and memory, index tuning, backups, replication, OLTP versus OLAP, etc.For each subject area, the authors explain the applicable concepts and SQL Server tools, and then systematically explain their application using practical examples.Compared to other performance tuning books, it is an 80/20 book. By this I mean that the authors focus on what is most important and then move on to the next topic. They don't get carried away demonstrating how much they know about each concept or go into the minutia of the options of each SQL Server tool.I hope they write more books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tuning bible for SQL Server 2000!","review":"As both a professional database consultant and DBA, I must agree that this is hands down the best overall tuning book for SQL Server 2000.

The connectors and jumper positions are all clearly marked on the harddrive itself. When using the master/slave jumpers instead of cable select, it doesn't matter where on the cable the drive is, which makes for good space and cable management in your case. All the connectors fit easily and securely.This 80GB hard drive is one of the most quiet I've ever owned, which suprised me. At 7200 RPM and with an 8MB cache, it's also quite fast. The speed of formatting suprised me, and with my computer running, you can hardly hear the read/write accesses.All in all, a good drive, and a good buy.

Maybe I just wanted to see something like the cover implied. Maybe I just couldn't relate to the characters, but it just didn't move me. The lameness of chasing this woman seems obvious.Anyway, I may just be biased as I paid the full 20 bucks for the movie. It's morelike a 5 dollar discount bin movie.

Anyone who can sit still for an hour and a half is sure to find this film worth seeing. The under used Jason Ritter and Marianna Palka are so interesting to watch here and although not really a comedy, it will make you laugh a lot of the time.This story about a guy who begins to fall in love with a very withdrawn girl with severe trust issues is not your average love story, but it has a refreshing quality and the two stars are completely engaging. If you like romance films with a little more creativity, then this is certainly worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"The title, cover image and description set the wrong tone for this film. I came across this on Netflix streaming and thought it would be a cute, funny indie movie going by all that. However, it's not cute and it's not funny. I have no idea why this says it's a comedy, and the romance aspect of it involves this guy basically stalking an extremely quiet and clearly disturbed woman, staring at her through open blinds while she watches her soft porn, lying to her to get her to allow him to sleep in her apartment, and then she treats him bizarrely and terribly for most of the rest of the movie while he insists upon trying to make her love him. Towards the end of the movie, the guy tells the girl he loves her, and all I could think was \\"Why?\\" I myself am a quiet introvert, and I like a lot of weird little indie movies, but this didn't resonate with me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I really did not enjoy this movie.

Most of my family members hate stoneware for the reason of it being heavy. Upon first glance to these plates I immediately thought to myself, \\"What will I do with them?!\\" They are really too heavy for seniors with pain in their hands and too heavy to hang as decoration plates on your walls. I had also thought they were smaller in size. I had hoped to impress with the Pfaltzgraff name but stoneware has no practicality for me. I'm sure those familiar to Pfaltzgraff will think I am crazy to return these but I simply cannot find a use for them due to their weight.

The science content was dazzling for the time. I loved it then. Not so much now. I am not re-evaluating based on newer scientific discoveries, but on the quality of the story and writing. Asimov got much, much better, but in this book, the romance is pre high school, and the political intrigue is simple-minded. The story is predictable and the twists are telegraphed. An interesting hint to future sophistication in Asimov's ideas is the Tyrrani overlord, who is anything but a conventional villain.I recommend this to the twelve-year-old of today and suggest that as you work your way down Asimov's bibliography you will find treasures."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one did not age well","review":"The contrast between \\"Foundation\\" (1951) and \\"The Stars, Like Dust\\" (1951) illustrates that Asimov's ideas are much stronger than his characters. Story elements like romance, which depend upon interesting characters acting in a believable manner, are his Achilles heel.TSLD is an adventure story without Asimov's \\"big ideas\\", so the reader is left to dwell upon its small cast of shallow, juvenile, and howlingly anachronistic characters.It is easily his worst work, and can be safely skipped even by ardent SF fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS PRICE!","review":"WTF!

The character development is just enough to give you a sense of their motives and underpinnings, but not so much to make it boring.

I believe this is book 2 in the Empire trilogy, but from what I understand, reading this one first really won't make a huge difference. It hasn't for me yet. Weak points include a lame romance, with the only girl in the whole story, who just happens to be hot. This circumstance is very convenient for Biron - the handsome, fearless, and brilliant hero of the story. Kind of reminds me of another cheesy romance in a more recent popular film about an evil empire.

In many instances you can see small openings in the fiber.Fiber has some oil that helps to collect dirt from air, but sometimes that can also mess up ignition things. Filter build solidly, but the main working function clearly not as good as a regular ( original) filter. I went on other web sites to read reviews about it. Many people impressed by it's solid build, but informed ones all point to potential problems from using it. Bottom line it will allow more air, but at expense of allowing more dirt in to an engine. Following common sense, in industrial settings nobody uses type of filters as K&N; does, in semiconductors manufacturing, in clean rooms all filters are HEPA, and fiber type similar to regular (original) filters. Using K&N; filters might void warranty on your car.Will be returning these today, and will get original ones at third of the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD potty chair for boys MAKES A BIG MESS ON THE FLOOR","review":"My son is 22 months and this potty chair was nothing but trouble.

And yes that did happen in this book, but the story was stretched out, long, and boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they have some time to waist.

This game is pathetic","review":"This is probably the worst game my child has owned. It is less imaginative than I would expect for a $20 game from Disney. Gameplay is way to hard for a 4-5 year old. My 4 1/2 year old boy has enjoyed other disney games as well as the Reader Rabbit series, Tonka Games, and Starflyers games... but when playing this one he actually started crying and hit himself on the head in frustration. At that point I took the helm and realized that the game was very difficult to play. For example... in one game you need to feed coffee to Stitch in order to drive a car, but the coffee bottle is about 80 pixels wide and the target area to click is only about 5 pixels wide and is totally obscured by the bottle icon, making this very frustrating.

Elmore Leonard comes through with his tale of Carlos Webster,Michael Crichton does a nice job with a little story about a man with \\"mother\\" problems, and David Eggers does a nice take on a Hemmingway style mountain climbing adventure.

Being short stories, each piece can be read in one sitting, which is always convenient, but most are so good that you want to jump immediately into the next one. This is easy to do, despite the diversity of the stories and styles, because the themes are all rather similar and have a dark undertone to them. It is great to see how some of the biggest names in contemporary fiction--Stephen King, Michael Crichton, Nick Hornby, etc.--handle the short story format, especially for authors like Hornby who are writing stories unlike those which they usually produce. There were some weak stories included in the book, but they are quick and painless, so it certainly doesn't diminish much from the quality of the book as a whole...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than thrilling ...","review":"A massive disappointment.

The only stories that really caught my attention were the Glen David Gold, the Elmore Leonard, and Chabon's own contribution. Neil Gaiman's story was particularly disappointing. It looked like something he tossed together in an afternoon. The mainstream writers should stick to mainstream stuff. That's mostly what they were doing in this anthology, anyway.So, if you want to read good, honest to God genre stuff, take a look at the Year's Best SF and Year's Best Fantasy series edited by David G.

The collection is the short-story equivalent of a set of academic essays in honor of a retiring scholar. In other words, although the subjects may interest the authors, it seems as though some of them wrote the stories because they were asked to and because they didn't mind having them in a collection with a bunch of other \\"assigned\\" work. If you finish books that you bought (even if you don't like them) because not finishing them is a waste of money, don't buy this book, get it out of your library instead.

To put it more simple, if you are looking for a quality Ninja film then don't buy it, if your are looking for a cheesy Kung Fu film, then this might be right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"There's a lot of books about the history of urbanism around there, but this one is one of the best, because, like other Benevolo's books, have a lot of photos and drawnings and less text, but maybe too less to someone who already studied about urbanism history. But because this it is so far the best introduction to the history of the formation of the cities, for architects or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerrie and creepy, but effective just the same.","review":"Lou plays a cop who thinks the pentagram killer's murders are finally over after he's executed, but really, the terror has only just begun. As he scrambles through LA trying to re-capture the Satanic madman, it becomes clear that this killer has...the First Power. If you haven't seen this film, it's definately worth a look, depending on where you stand with religion. No I'm not a Satanist, I'm a Christian, but I didn't take this film to heart. Anyway, this is another good vs. evil movie that may appeal to some. Final note: ignore the negative reviews from so-called expert critics and give it a look, but a friendly warning: certain scenes and images are very creepy and disturbing, plus if you have a weak stomache, I can't recommend it. It's also creepy enough to create some wicked nightmares. You've been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"I saw this movie on VHS tape over a friend house, back in O' I believe 2005. So when I saw it for sell at Amazon.com from seller goHasting, I just had to buy it on DVD. Plus it was real cheap.

A western, really?But it is a book that hooked me after reading the first page.

Never, ever get tired of this story. Well written, the characters are interesting and colorful. Had to be just what everyday life in the 1800s was like for the cowboys and settlers of the west. Mc Murtry is at his best in this book. If you love cowboying and the old west, and are not familiar with this book , (where have you been hiding?), Buy it and plan to spend several evenings enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is not to love!","review":"Lonesome Dove is a fabulous book, what is not to love in this Novel... it is a classic and it will go down as one of the truly great reads of our time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great American Novel","review":"It's real simple folks. This is the great American novel. Which via mini-series', weekly half-hour TV shows and generalhype we'll grind into pop culture dust. Leave it be; it's one of the best books ever written"},{"rating":"2","title":"My vote for best book to take on a loooong journey","review":"I read some books because I keep turning the pages for the need to see how it ends. Some books I read because I love the writers style or wit or turn of a phrase. Some books I read because I can care about or identify with the characters. However, Lonesome Dove didn't fit in any of these catagories. I would have to label this book as pure and unadulterated entertainment. As I got closer to the end of this 823 page book, instead of reading faster to see how it would end, I found myself reading slower because I didn't want it to end. I felt as though I could read this book every night before bed eternally. I am not a reader of westerns and never will be, unless McMurtry writes them. So if you are traveling from Sydney to Miami in a tramp steamer my advise to you would be: Pick up a copy of Lonesome Dove and your trip will be a whole lot more enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"McMurtry Masterpiece","review":"A western beyond compare. McMurtry describes lives of cowboys and gamblers and the women who loved them. He paints a vivid picture of frontier life. One that was often brutal. You fall in love with these characters and will hold them dear all your life. Definitely one of the all time great reads"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gus & Woodrow","review":"Lonesome Dove is one of the best books and greatest movies I have ever seen or read. I was able to put myself there and experience everything they all went through. I have read the book numerous times, however I am ordering another just to have two copies. I own the movie and watch it quite often. Wow! what an experience it would have been to live then, and go through what they did. I loved Gus the best, he was so cool...Pea Eye, I cried for and felt sorry for him. He was so dedicated to the guys.Woodrow was great..Quiet but a great leader. I just think it is wonderful and will always hold it dear to my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best read ever","review":"Have read this book many times. Love the characters flaws and all. Better than the movie and I loved the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Actually a Very Good Book","review":"I'd never read a Western before, so I figured I would start with the wildly praised Lonesome Dove. Oops.Though it purports to be an \\"epic,\\" Lonesome Dove's vision of the American West only contains about 20 people. They bump into each other again and again in the supposedly vast and empty plains. As an example, every character in the book who doesn't die beforehand wanders into the home of Gus's childhood sweetheart! All roads lead to a remote farmhouse in Ogallala.The action in the book primarily consists of characters being dicks to everyone around them, then getting mawkish when someone dies.However, you do learn the word remuda, which I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lonesome Dove - new 1st edition","review":"I purchased 2 of these books for gifts for very special people. One of the books is perfect, but the other is a Book Club edition and very disappointing. The book itself is much smaller than the other and the quality of paper, printing, etc. does not compare with the other book. I spent a significant amount of money for these two books, same price for each, and feel that I was ripped off with the book club edition item. This should have been identified as such with the description.Unless this issue is resolved, I will never purchase another book other than brand new and current edition from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right size","review":"The book was an awkward size that didn't match the rest of the collection. I was very upset and had to use another website to finish the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"I reaaly enjoyed this book. I don't feel the need to explain the whole story. If you want that, then read the editorial review. If your a fan of westerns, or your in the mood for a great story then this is the book for you. The only problem I have with it is how the author changes from ones persons perspective to another. I got confused a few times from the naration jumping from one person's head to the next. However, you can't beat the storyline, and the gritty characters that are so briliantly portrayed in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome Dove","review":"Absolutely loved it! I have ordered two more books by this author and am sure it won't be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Now that was a good book. Larry McMurtry is an amazing writer, so whitty. I fell in love with the characters; so much that it's been weeks since I read the book and I still can't stop thinking about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern masterpiece","review":"This book, that begins the story, and the ones that follow, are part of a rich - only partly fictional - world that surpasses the Lord of the Rings series in breadth.Although a great author might be able to write a book that includes one or two wonderful storylines, and one or two memorable characters - McMurty goes far past that. Even bit players are entertaining for their idiosyncracies.This one of the best books that I've ever read. You should read it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"I found this book a little slow at the start but I'm glad I persevered. This is a magnificent novel. One of the best I've read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificient","review":"I don't know if this is the \\"greatest\\" novel I've ever read, but it is certainly my favorite. Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae stand as two of the greatest characters in American literature. People who dismiss 'Lonesome Dove' as simply a \\"popular\\" novel are complete knuckleheads. If there was ever a story or characters who better embody the West and the elegiac quality of that time and place, I can't image them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story of the West","review":"Lonesome Dove is the great epic of the American West. Witty dialogue and interaction between characters is interested but not contrived. It makes you feel like you are along on the cattledrive to Montana with Call and Gus. If you read just one Western, read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkable in every sense of the word","review":"This was one of my favorite books of all time. It follows the adventures of Texas Rangers (the law enforcement agency, not the baseball team) Call and McCrae as they gather together a squadron and take a cattle drive north to Montana. The epic journey was one you'll never forget. They run into troubles (wild and crazy Indians, illnesses, a leech-filled river) and colorful characters (prostitutes, other Indians) along the way. I read this in college and it has stuck with me ever since. If you read just one book by Larry McMurtry, make this book that one. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Reveiw of a Great Book","review":"This is a really well written novel of the western genre. Not only did you get to know the characters, but you also got to be the characters through McMurtry's simple yet profound discriptions. When Lorie is taken away by Blue Duck, you feel her pain after riding endlessly for hours and also her humiliation after wetting her self in front the psycotic man. Then when Jake Spoon offers to kick his own horse, you begin to have an overwelming sorrow towards Jake and his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"a romantic adventure that never left me bored","review":"if you read or see any typical western, it will glorify the west and the people who won it, but this book shows how it really was. insects disease friends dying indians attacking and yet this book almost makes the tragedy of the west seem romantic. it leaves you spellbound i found myself staying up past 2:15 in the morning just to finish it and i have to say i was never dissapointed. this book has you laughing one minute and crying the next, with many unexpected turns. sometimes just the description of blue duck made my blood run cold. This is my all time favourite book, beating out les miserables by a long shot id recommend it to all young and old"},{"rating":"1","title":"Longwinded Lonesome Dove Lacks Story","review":"This book takes more than 100 pages to begin - that's where I gave up. McMurtry spends excessive effort in character building, to the exclusion of plot development, yet the characters still seemed rather two dimensional.A long western, winner of the prestigious Pulitzer prize, this book gave false hope of a several days' immersion in good read. Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life In (But Mostly Out of) Lonesome Dove","review":"As would be expected with an 800+ page book, this is a novel about much more than a little town in Texas. The story and characters were much more enjoyable than I expected, but admit that I was a little surprised to find that the story was much more about the sprawling 19th century West than a character study of a small ranching town. And while that might have caught me off guard, I was also pleased with it. The characters and stories diverged and intersected in soap operatic fashion, but McMurtry tied it all back to the excitement and loneliness of the pre-settled West.That said, however, I would be remiss to not point out a major flaw. While there were passing allusions to the plight of Native Americans, the novel too often falls into the \\"American hero/wild Indian\\" trap. This is an unfortunate and unnecessary choice by the author, and it only serves to sully McMurtry's otherwise beautiful writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried reading Lonesome Dove","review":"I tried reading this book after reading a much shorter and wiser novel called Austin Nights by some dude who goes by herocious. Although herocious talks about Larry McMurtry a lot in Austin Nights, Lonesome Dove isn't championed. About halfway through Lonesome Dove, I had to put it down and move on to McMurtry's non-fiction, which is so much better, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor edition","review":"I enjoyed the book due to the fine writing of McMurtry. The paper back edition vas very poor ie type small printing had defects and the format was too small for a 900 + page book. Don't by this edition"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Have Ever Read","review":"What happened to the spare, perceptive author of \\"The Last Picture Show\\"? McMurtry spends nearly 200 pages introducing the characters, then sends us on an adventure with Gus and Call, two faceless, interchangeable Marlboro Men who shoot or hang everyone they meet. The prose is so cliched, the narrative so loose, the characters so murky, that I wonder if McMurtry was just typing. He was one of the most promising young novelists of the '60s, and he ended up writing this hack Western potboiler. A waste of a wonderful talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like this book?","review":"I am a student of the American West with advanced degrees in History and Anthropology. I am also a prolific reader. I'm sorry, but this book is just..welll, awful!Historically the book is off at almost every turn, and the author has a liking for \\"Magical Realism\\". Not familiar? Okay. A character might have a huge chin, nose, voice, etc. or rats might fall inexplicably from the ceiling. Or a man might blow away like a tumbleweed. This sort of device is currently used in modern lit to qualify the piece as literature. Personally, I dislike it. I also dislike historical novelists who refuse to do their homework.Don't buy this expecting another \\"Little Big Man\\", or \\"True Grit\\". This novel bears a far greater similarity to Doctorow. This is not a true historical novel. Be forewarned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent-one of the best books I ever read","review":"Lonesome Dove is one of the best books I ever read. I couldn't put it down and finished it in record time. I have to dock it one star though, because as the book wears on McMurtry piles on too many characters. This is a fault I find with his other books as well. The other problem is the large number of chapter breaks--almost corresponding to commercial breaks for the planned TV mini-series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Western...and adventure novel...period.","review":"Simply put, the best adventure novel i have ever read. I could not believe that i had read 800+ pages...and was so disappointed to see it end. Just fantastic horseplay and violence. Lessons are salient, though simply written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome Dove","review":"I thought it was a good insterting book to read if you didn't have a teacher to put more into the book then what there was meant to be. The book was full of really events that had happen and could happen on a really cattle drive in the old western era. Agian I say the book would have been better if the teacher would have confused the author writting with his own opion of what he meant. Great book to read on your own but not in a school setting, with anenglish teacher. It would be alright to read in a Western Frontier class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel Review","review":"I had seen the movie one hundred times, I believe. I was overdue to read the book and it was in no means a disappointment. The book was wonderful and as promised in great shape. It was shipped in mint condition and promptly. Two thumbs up. Thanks~~A."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read the Preface!","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Seriously, it ranks in my top five favorite books: beautiful writing, amazing characters, exciting story... just don't read the preface until the end. The preface actually contains a HUGE spoiler that put me off at first. So, word to the wise, finish the book, and THEN read the preface if you wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I always loved McMurtry, although I never read his westerns, and I love the miniseries--I watch it every winter. But the book sat on my shelf for 20 years, daunting me by its size. I picked it up recently and I am thrilled that I did. This is truly an excellent book, not simply a genre title. The characters are all well developed, and Gus might be my favorite character in fiction. This is a book that will stay with you a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ENOUGH ENDURANCE TO SLOG THROUGH THIS","review":"For God's sake can't there be any accurate reviews? I only bought it because of the positive reviews but if I'd had even a hint of how slow, boring and uninteresting this was I wouldn't be out 8 bucks now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"I somehow missed reading this book until this point in my life but I am so glad I picked it up now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read","review":"I was getting on an airplane a few years ago, and saw a guy carrying a copy of Lonesome Dove. I asked if he had ever read it before, and was jealous when he said he hadn't. I'm up to eight readings now, and I would give anything to be able to read it again for the first time- to be moved by the longing in it, and delighted by the humor, and surprised by the sudden and heartbreaking violence and loss. It's a little ironic that the author has never written anything else that even comes close to this book. I wish he had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome Dove","review":"Lonesdove is by far my favorite Western. The aurthor has promised to sign this edition for me and it will always be a treasure.This book is for anyone who loves the old West and is a story of best friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best American Western Ever Written","review":"Forget the minseries (which is a noble effort to bring this book to the screen) and dismiss the terrible prequels (although Streets of Laredo is a very engaging and rewarding sequel), on its own Lonesome Dove is the best American novel ever written about the West, the characters, the locations, and many of the scenes will remain with the readers long after they finish the book. It may be the best American novel ever written regardless of genre, truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome Dove","review":"I thought the book was full of adventure and exciting things. There was a lot of events happening that kept a person on their seat throught out the book. I think it will keep alot of readers reading it, nobody is going to stop reading it. It is a wonderful book. My favorite character was Gus because he was always the main character no matter what was happening he was always there. And he seemed to be everyones favorite man through the whole trip to Montana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome Dove","review":"This was one of the greatest books I have ever read. I recommend this to anyone who reads this review. I also recommend the sequels (Streets of Laredo, Comanche Moon, Dead Man's Walk). The order that I think you should read them in is Dead Man's Walk, Comanche Moon, Lonseome Dove, and Streets of Laredo. The only reason I say that is the books were not written in chronological order. It makes more sense to read them that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best novels ever.","review":"A friend recommended Lonesome Dove to me about 10 years ago. It took me 2 tries before I got into it, the beginning was slow, but once the cattle drive got going I could hardly bear to put the book down. The characters are so believable and loveable and even despicable. The adventure and emotions are non-stop. Gus is my favorite literary character ever, I cried inconsolably and thought my heart would break at the end of the book when he said \\"It's been quite a party\\"-what a guy! This book has my highest recommendation, second only to The Grapes of Wrath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a western","review":"Let me start by saying that I hate westerns. I cannot stand them. That is why I was really hesitant about reading Lonesome Dove, despite the awards won by Larry McMurtry. I was blown away! The characters were so real, so alive. I have read alot of books, but I cant remember any in recent memory that made me care about the characters as in Lonesome Dove. Woodrow Call and Gus just jumped out of the pages and grabbed you heart. Before reading this book, I would not even have thought it possible for a book to affect me like this one did. Even after the 800+ pages, I was sad for it to end. If you want to see what affects a book can really have on you, read Lonesome Dove. Dont be turned off by it being stereotyped as \\"A Western.\\" READ IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I has been recommended this book by a friend claiming it was the best book they had ever read.After the first 50 pages I was certainly dubious. McMurtry sets the scene well in the early stages of the book, a place of boredom, particularly for two famous Texas Rangers. However, the boredom sure makes for some boring reading. There was an evening where I nearly gave up but boy am I happy that I kept reading!Once the journey north toward Montana begins, I could not put the book down. The characters and the language are fantastic, particularly Gus.Without a doubt, the most exciting book I have ever read. I could not recommend it more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings chills to my spine.","review":"Most people are put off by the categorization of Lonesome Dove as a western. Lonesome Dove is much more than a mere western. It's an epic of survival, friendship, love, loneliness, and most importantly maturity. You will meet some of your favorite characters here, and fall in love with them. There will be moments that make you cry, moments that make you love life, and moments that are simply timeless. If you think this is a stereotypical cowboy novel you're missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the movie","review":"I liked the movie but the book was better. In the movie they had to summerize a lot of things. They usually included things but it was gone quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it IS as great as everyone says....","review":"Lonesome Dove is one of those books that if you read it cuz you borrowed it out of the library or from someone, you go out and buy it AFTER reading it, to have it in your private library....I am not into westerns but this is so much more then that...A masterpiece novel I could not put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, now here's a storyteller!","review":"There's enough said in other reviews about the contents of this book. This is just about as good as they come - great characters and action and LM paints a great picture of the west we sometimes wish we still had. Arguably the best historical novel in the past 15 years (Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth is close) - one of those that's almost disappointing to finish because you know you'll want more story when it ends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsurpassed","review":"McMurtry, here, has demonstrated perfectly his ability to get into the minds of all Americans of that time period (yep, including prostitutes and murderers) and has shed a new light on the myth of the American West. \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is a lyric soap opera about the basic goods and bads of humanity, and the always-present chance of redemption. It's characters are full-blooded and honest, the writing compelling and aware, and the action remarkably portrayed. As for westerns, \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've ever read!","review":"First, let me tell you I've never liked westerns (except for this one). This book is still one of, if not the, best book I've ever read. I'm not going into the storyline as other reviews have already done that. I'll just mention that the author makes you feel like you're apart of the characters lives to the point that once the book is over a little sadness sets in. When I read this book it held my interest so much that I could hardly put the book down.I'd suggest that you read this book before seeing the movie. The book contains more of the story and, let's face it, the books are always better. Plus, the movie will make even more sense, if you read the book first. That's just my opinion. While we're at it, the movie was excellent in it's own right. If you get a chance to see it, you really should.One more thing, in my opinion, this is definitely not a book for children to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go read this novel!

I've been reading fiction my whole life, and I've never read a novel where I became so involved with the characters and invested in the story. I really envy people who are just reading it for the first time, and I recommend it to everyone- you will too, just wait...Absolutely the best book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonesome Dove","review":"What a great read! Lonesome Dove tells the story of two former Texas Rangers and the cowpokes and one woman who drive a herd of cattle from near the Mexican border in Texas to Montana.

I watched the mini-series and fell in love with all the characters- especially Gus. This epic book is even better with more charcters and adventures. I have read this book about 3 times now and I still cry at the ending. I can't help but picture Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones every time I read the book. Even if you aren't a fan of \\"westerns\\", read this book, it's just too good not to."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Epic","review":"Lonesome Dove--the definitive epic of the American West. I finished the book not five hours ago, and since then, I have not been able to concentrate on any other task. It was amazing. Never have I encountered such intriguing characters. The only word of caution I can give, it is sad at times; expect to be upset. But, trust me, it is worth it. While 945 pages might seem foreboding, you will find that it is only sufficient, and McMurtry could have gone on much longer--I wish he had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Novel of All Time","review":"The best novel I've ever read!

Blind Fear has been compared with Audrey Hepburn's \\"Wait Until Dark\\" but the movie is completely different and Hack makes the movie. Shelley plays Erica, a blind switchboard operator at the inn. She is forced to stay overnight because her cousin can't pick her up until the next morning. She plays a game of hide and seek with three murderous thugs, who robbed an armored security truck for a million dollars. Hack uses her resources against the thugs. Amazingly Hack looks younger then she did on Charlie's Angels 10 years ago. There is a surprise twist at the end but like the other reviewers, I can't be a jerk and ruined it all for you.

It is heavy, bad ergos, and is unsafe.Using the the index finger to open the blade is weird and takes too long to reposition the knife in your hand when the blade opens. The mechanism to close the blade works sometimes and doesn't work. My average is 3.5 attempts to close the blade.

It feels appropriate in my hand, if maybe an inch too short. Now that I've said something positive...This is literally the dullest knife I have ever used in my life. I would have no qualms giving this thing to a toddler to play with. I tried it repeatedly on my arm with what would appear as an intent to sever it. The butter knives in my kitchen are sharper than this. The simple solution to this problem would be sharpening the blade, but I don't think it's worth ruining the chance to return it.

It's lasted so long I forgot exactly when I got it. The only reason I needed to replace it was because I misused the knife and broke the tip of the blade off of it. The mechanism is one of the best I've ever seen and the blade holds an edge very well. I misuse a knife as much as I use it and this one takes the beating and keeps going.

Normally, one has to make allowances when watching older films, for cultural disconnect and production values, but this film holds ups perfectly after all these years.

It is a simple, original story based on a simple, original play, about two ordinary people, one stubborn, proud, and self-relying, and one patient, cheerful, and simpleminded, and how these two people who roiginally had a lot of friction, learn to open up to, and even love each other through one chaffeuring the other. Sir, I get the feeling you don't even know what \\"cliche\\" and \\"vapid\\" even mean.

The acting is what makes this film so good. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors around and this is one of his best performances. Jessica Tandy one an oscar deservedly for her role in the film. The film is however no masterpiece and shouldn't have one the best picture award. In my opinion it stole it from Oliver Stone's masterpiece. Alltogether a worthy movie in every DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no widescreen???","review":"I give this movie 5 stars (It won best picture, after all) But I give the DVD 1 star...Why isn't this movie in widescreen (letterbox) format? ALL best picture winners deserve widescreen special editions with all the extras!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crime","review":"It was criminal that this movie won best film. Films like \\"Glory,\\" which was snubbed by the academy, and \\"Born on the Forth of July\\" were more deserving. \\"Do the Right Thing,\\" which came out that year, was a far superior film on racism than this trite film about a guy driving an old lady around. \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\" is fraught with cliches and vapid sentimentality. Even comedians made fun of it, \\"I'm going to drive you to the WALL\\" (in reverse, high speed). The ponderous dialogue between ole Daisy and Hoke in a moving vehicle didn't measure about to the vastly superior dialogue in a static restaurant in \\"My Dinner with Andre.\\" I sense \\"Miss Daisy\\" got the warm fuzzy award; it was a roundabout way to give an aged actresses, Jessica Tandy, a life achivement award."},{"rating":"2","title":"some gliches","review":"This was a great movie, but the quality of the dvd is questionable, because were some gliches in the viewing and had to fast forward to continue the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful film!","review":"Well you know a movie must be good if it can make you both laugh till you cry and cry till you laugh, and still carry a good plot.

It's a story of love and friendship that transcends any and all boundaries of age, race, or religion. Anyone who isn't reaching for the tissues at the end of this one has no heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, Memorable, Perfect","review":"Not much can be added to the praise of others here, or to the film's enthusiastic reception by the public. I feel that this is one of those rare films that is simply perfect from beginning to end. Even if you don't develop an affection for the characters, and even if you don't care for the story line, it's a stretch to fault this movie in any way. The Special Edition DVD is preferred (not many extras, but those included are worth the effort). After watching my copy 7 times and trying to get really picky with it, I juist can't find anything amiss with Beresford's beautiful production. SO why didn't he win a Director Oscar? Must've been the competition that year, but he certainly deserved to win. Only other disappointment: Freeman nominated, but didn't win. And to think this film was made for less than $6 million, and racked in a fortune and a handful of Oscars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm driving you to the store Miss Daisy!","review":"A great film. I first found a copy at a friends home and after that I knew I had to get a copy of my own. This film is about an old Jewish woman Daisy Werthan, (Jessica Tandy) who becomes too old to drive herself anymore. The film begins with her wrecking her car. So her son Boolie (Dan Aykroyd) hires a chauferr Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman). Some parts were funny like when Miss Daisy thought Hoke had stolen a can of salmon. Some parts were sad like when Idella dropped dead, some were even scary like when the synagogue was bombed. But I really liked the part when Hoke followed Miss Daisy trying to drive her to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with the DVD version","review":"I was very disappointed with the DVD version of this movie! Not only was it the full-screen format, but the picture was just not digital quality. I don't know what WB was thinking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Upconvert Daisy","review":"Tossed the VCR tape. Poor is an understatement.HD TV, HDMI, the DVD version of Daisy is the only way to go provided an HDMI DVD player.Upconvert HDMI is from 480 to 1080 for current large screen LCD HD TV's.Same for Plasma.The result is not HD or Blueray but very good. As good as theatre screen play.Don't miss the hour DVD play providing the background and difficulties of making this movie.Amazing that Daisy acting talent was brought to the screen by equally creative management and production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Driving Miss Daisy Misses Speedbumps","review":"With all due respect to the other two actors, Morgan Freeman and Jessica Tandy steal this movie right out from under everyone's noses. Both people give outstanding performances avoiding the melodramatics. And the score is just as lilting.

When I was growing up, everyone was saying \\"black is beautiful\\". What happened?!) and her son. The movie follows them through the decade of change in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"why no widescreen?","review":"I just have to say that such a beautiful film deserves better treatment on DVD. It simply does not make sense to put out this DVD title in only full-screen format. If WB comes to its senses and creates a better quality widescreen Miss Daisy, I would not hesitate to buy it and give a five-star review. Until then, save your money and buy the VHS version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morgan Freeman At His Best","review":"I purchased this movie some years ago. It was wonderful watching it again. For those of you who are Morgan Freeman fans, you will not be disappointed with DRIVING MISS DAISY. Freeman is brilliant in the manner that he captures the persona of an older 'Negro' chauffeur of the 40's. Assisted by Jessica Tandy, Freeman's character emerges with eloquence, capturing how a friendship evolves between two individuals in the South - one white and a Jew, one 'colored'- who come to grips with racism. This is a poignant story about a man and a woman who over several decades grow to depend on one another. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relationships: Best Expressed","review":"Two people. Entirely different. Yet have something in common. Unable to accept the affinity openly. Unable to hide it too.But good relationships are not discriminated by color, race or sex. Point exemplified. Very well indeed.Morgan Freeman as Hoke, an african-american and the chauffeur for Ms. Daisy (Jessica Tandy), an American Jew who is reluctant to have him as one. Their loneliness and the circumstances lead them to a 25-year long warm relationship. Crafted beautifully, this masterpiece is a drama as well as a melodrama.Expressing a serious problem (racism) in an intended comedy is not a joke, and Alfred Uhry - the playwright has done it carefully and effectively. Hans Zimmer's music gives a boost to the film. Inspite of the four academy awards (including Jessica Tandy as Best Actress), I am sure Morgan Freeman also deserved one for his performance.A must-see if you like dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"This contains the wrong version of the movie","review":"This package contains the wrong version of \\"Driving Miss Daisy.\\" This is not a one-time mistake; I have ordered the movie twice and the case has contained the wrong version of the movie each time, so something must be wrong at the factory.This is supposed to be the widescreen edition and contain several special featurettes, but the actual DVD inside the case is in fullscreen and does not contain the featurettes, even though the DVD case says otherwise. I ordered this from Amazon and discovered the error when I put the DVD into my machine. Amazon sent me a replacement, and the replacement DVD is wrong as well.The actual movie is a terrific classic. It's a shame the packaging is mislabeled. If you want the widescreen version, you'll have to look elsewhere, until they fix it. Order at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Time","review":"As I watched the credits roll at the end of this movie, I sat there stunned! Wondering to myself when the movie was going to actually Start, Much less end? THIS MOVIE WON AN OSCAR? WHAT A JOKE!

Sometimes it seems like it drags in between the action and the real eye popping stuff in the book, but then again it can't be all action I guess.

I have never read any other book/series that reaches out and touches the hearts of all it's readers. I've have had the pleasure of meeting JM in person and he signed the 5 books i owned from the series (that's all there was at the time) after giving a talk to a lecture hall full of students. He shared some of his writing secrets and tips with us and we all learned a lot. It is an experience I will never forget, and a memory i will forever treasure. I recomend that every one reads this book, as it is exceptionally well written and throughly enjoyable. I usually try to read the complete series 2 to 3 (or once 4) times a year. I can hardly wait until the 7th (and suposed final) book is released later this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"This book is only the second in a series of six books, and this one is one of the better ones. It stars five teenagers but the narrator and most important character in Ellie. Not only do the five of them try to find freedom by hiking somewhere else, we are also treated to them blowing one of the streets in their city to atoms. While at the same time the five of them are trying to live with each other without driving each other nuts and fight their enemy at the same time. It's really a pity however that the other four books haven't made it to the U.S. yet. Although I hope they do soon so everyone here will get the chance to read them too. You should always however start with the first book so that some of the events the other books talk about are clearer and so that you get to know the personalities of the characters better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 2 of an Amazing series","review":"John Marsden continues his \\"Tomorrow Series\\" with another fantastic adventure. Another can't put it down til I'm done story. These books should be read in order as this book takes up just after Book 1 ends. These books do contain a fair amount of violence and in this story, Ellie, the main character, spends a lot of time debating with herself whether she should have sex with her boyfriend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful second installment","review":"Ellie and company continue their fight to save their families and their homeland from foreign invaders. This part of the story shows just how creative, tough, and competent young people can be and that they are capable of doing well without adults. The encounter with Harvey's Heroes made me root even more for the teens hiding out in Hell. This book is as well written as the first one and makes the reader pine for the next volume in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part Way through the season and it was removed from Prime","review":"I started watching this thankful it was on Prime.

I'm buying it now to remember the warmth I felt when I was young."},{"rating":"1","title":"A squandered opportunity","review":"With all of the name recognition that Rolling Stone has, it's too bad (although not unexpected) that they didn't do a better job with this compilation. I'm rather sure that for a sizeable number of Rolling Stone readers this will be their introduction to blues, so why give them \\"Bad to the Bone\\" - a staple of rock radio across the nation? Would it have been so awful to leave off Clapton, Raitt and Kenny Wayne - who already have plenty o' fame? This compilation doesn't even really have any kind of cohesive quality that I can see, as it isn't a history of blues, it isn't showcasing new artists or even essential recordings, unless one calls it 'mainly blues-based rock'.It's good that Albert King and John Lee Hooker show up here; one can only hope that those that do plunk down their cash for this will be prompted dig deeper into actual blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help with the CD","review":"This is a fascinating book, and in many ways a real treasure. I only give it 4 stars though, because the CD that accompanies it has no track listing, I can't find one anywhere, and it took 2 hours just to figure out where the track 1 material is in the book. It doesn't start at the beginning, and it skips over a good deal of the text. If someone could post a track listing here, I'd be grateful. If no one does, I will post one eventually, but it's going to take a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handsomely printed musical edition","review":"This is the only edition of this important liturgy of the Coptic Orthodox Church with complete musical transcription, which in itself constitutes the chief value of the book. In addition, the complete text is given in English, Arabic, and Coptic in parallel columns. The binding is attractive and durable, and the layout beautiful. A very minor inconvenience, necessitated by the layout, is the separation of the musical transcription from the text, but each musical passage has a reference to the page where the corresponding text is found.This book is a treasure for anyone interested in the liturgies of the Eastern Churches, or in Coptic language, or Coptic liturgical music."},{"rating":"1","title":"check it out at the library first!","review":"I'm not sure what I was expecting but this book reads like a compilation of old Mother Earth News articles.

I was hoping for new thinking on finding niches in order to make a living, not suggestions that are marginal at best, such as collecting pine cones or working on cars in my backyard and oh yeah, the classic advice; don't blow your cover by buying a Mercedes with cash!

A retrospective of the first several albums released by the Grateful Dead, this box set presents the origins of the band so many still love. From their first recording sessions when they were called the Warlocks (changed at the eleventh hour to the Emergency Crew, due to the discovery of another band already using the name) to the edge of their heyday, this set introduces the listener to the Dead as the world was. Fans should embrace this collection as the definitive representation of the early Dead, when even THEY had no idea who they wanted to be when they grow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT KNOCKED ME DEAD","review":"This is a must have for any dead fan it has everything anyone could want the extra live versions on all the albums are greatThis shows the dead at their best.Garcia's guitar work is amazing and i love his banjo on workingman's dead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead When They Mattered","review":"This is the box set that does the Grateful Dead justice. These are the years when the Dead were a dangerous unpredictable musical force whose concerts were explorations of various musical forms, and whose studio albums spanned the gamut from \\"Anthem Of The Sun\\" to \\"American Beauty\\". This is a wonderful tribute to when the Grateful Dead mattered. This collection includes great early stuff, live material, along with a whole string of great albums. This is the package that best explains why the people who there at the beginning know that there was \\"nothing like a Grateful Dead concert.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to All Dead Fans","review":"The box set itself is not essential to Grateful Dead fans, but the albums definitely are. The Golden Road box set contains 10 albums (12 discs) starting from the Dead's beginning. It is a great deal, I think. If you pay for each album separately, you will probably pay around the same price. And all of the discs are completely filled with bonus tracks and hidden tracks. It seems like a lot of money, but if you do not own any Dead albums and know you like them, then I would recommend this box set to get started. I got mine about a month ago, and I haven't stopped listening to the Dead since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection - Track Listing is not correct","review":"What great fortune we have that the Grateful Dead recorded all those shows.

I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed. While it was a breeze to hook up via optical cable to my Harman/Kardon AVR110 and it was simple to aim the antenna (according to the \\"antenna aiming signal strength indicator\\" I had a perfect signal) it has the same quality as my Delphi SkyFi unit that it replaces. I can't hear any difference between the two. Even with side by side comparison (Polk XRt12 vs. Delphi Skyfi) they sound the same. I wouldn't recommend buying this to replace any exisiting home unit. If you already have XM at home, the signal sounds just as good with what you already have. With all the compression involved in beaming the XM signals to earth, there's only so much any device can extract. You simply can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polk Audio XRt12 Tuner","review":"This is the correct tuner to add to my stereo unit, but a bit pricey when you compare it to the portables out there.

Since there are no problems with the female jack on the same unit (when we use earphones) I think that the adapter may be slightly smaller than it should be.

The influence Don Menza left with Labarbera shows.Don Menza's burning piece \\"Time Check\\" more than amply demonstrates the maturity Labarbera experienced in his seven years with Rich.Manny Albam's Kilaminjaro Cookout showcases Labarbera, John Hoffman's high solo work and that of Keith O'Quinn on trombone.Trumpeter Greg Hopkins treatment of Horace Silver's \\"Nutville\\" really moves and grooves. Listen to Labarbera, Hopkins and Budson burn on this fast-moving latin tinged chart.Hopkins \\"Walt of the Mushroom Hunters\\" is a fun piece for the whole band. With Labarbera on soprano and Budson on piano.Backwoods Sideman and Senator Sam show the tenor talent of Bob Crea (along with Labarbera), who I'd never heard of till this album.Of course, Rich's always pulsating beat that keeps all the \\"fast-movers\\" on Mach 2 speed.A great album for Buddy Rich devotees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I was looking for some old Buddy Rich and thought I was ordering something that would be good to listen to...it wasn't.

There isn't enough of that clear and deep thumping bass sound from this poorly engineered piece of work.The sound of Buddy's drumming is placed too far behind the brass section. No offence to the Killer Force, but it's painful to even crank up the stereo to listen to this CD.Normally, Buddy's drumming is distinct and is pleasing to listen to (i.e. Buddy's Live from Ronny Scott's albums are very good engineered recordings).Buddy's infrequent drum solos are extremely short; approximately less than 10 seconds is his longest solo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Of Vicki","review":"Received CD as stated, enjoyed the music and would recommend CD to others.

The interface is so easy and simple to operate, yet the game is very in-depth. It uses many NBA rules such as the mid level and low level exemption free agent offers as well as Bird years in free agency and trading restrictions, just like the NBA. The game is tremendous for sim fans, and coaching is a blast too. And like another reviewer said, you can import NBA team rosters as well as NBA team logos easily. In addition, there are many online leagues so you can play against other people. The HTML is reliable and nice to look at on a web page.

NBA Live 2001 has a better sim than this game does. First, it takes forever to make it through a season. Second, even if you win the championship, you don't care, because nothing exciting happens. Trades are almost impossible, plus you never quite know how good a player is when you trade for him. There are none of the real NBA players in it, or team names (even though you can edit those). There are not even any player faces, made up or otherwise. Basically, save your cash. NBA Live 2003 is soon to be out, and I'm sure their sim will be a hundred times better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good Guys.","review":"This book is written and aimed at younger readers. The writing is rather simple, yet there are a lot of really awesome pictures from the films and a few tidbits of information that the basic fan may not even know (I learned the name of a new Rogue Squadron pilot). The book is divided into four sections each discussing a different area (the Rebel Alliance, the weapons of the Alliance, etc.). It doesn't take long to get through the book, but one may find they keep flipping back just to keep looking at the pictures.

All of the shortcuts that are on the Windows version of Office are the same on the Mac version. Moreover, once you get used to using it....you'll notice it's laid out so nicely. Graphics are nice and most importantly the projects you create are compatible w/ other Office (Windows) programs.So glad to see that MS took the time to create a \\"suite\\" of programs that are compatible for Macs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a fan","review":"I love my mac, but as a student, I need my projects to be compatible with other students who are using PCs.

I was really surprised at the commonality of the MS Office applications bewteen the two operating systems and the seamless interoperability of the files.

I figured that since I used Microsoft Office for years on the PC, the best bet was this program. While it does do the basic Microsoft Office things, It also runs slow and crashes my nearly un-crashable computer. Also, the conversion between MAC and PC platforms is not very user-friendly, especially when it comes to using Powerpoint. If you only have text, then fine, but any addition of audio or video, you'll have trouble and will most likely have to download some free program to convert your files to PC friendly ones (which then might not play on your MAC).It's not my favorite program and the fact that it runs slow and might crash on me, makes me worry every time I use it. That said, I use it quite often and can't complain about the final product when on my own MAC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Apple be any better?!?","review":"I am a recent convert to Apple and I LOVE it.

I was concerned that the switch would limit what I can and cannot do with my computer, but Microsoft Office for Mac has made the transition much easier, as I have been a Microsoft Office user for years. The Mac version runs much smoother than the Windows version, (as does the entire computer.) No problems with lock-ups, no lost data, and the Mac version seems much easier to use than my Windows version. Very straightforward, yet powerful enough for a full range of use, from simple to very complex.So, for anyone out there thinking of making the switch from PC to Mac, do yourself a favor: get Microsoft Office for the Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kludgy, Cumberson & Crashes","review":"Yeah, the title for this review sounds like a law firm.

Additionally, there are so many (ahem) \\"features\\" that the program has become very difficult to use.

Leg extenders should absolutely 100% be included with this product, not sold separately (especially for a price of $20+). I'll also be buying a more reasonable, sturdy alternative.Also misleading is the fact that co-sleeper instructions (I have the \\"mini\\" model) state that the unit as packaged is adjustable for beds up to 24\\" in height. This really only means that the top of the co-sleeper frame is 24\\" high, NOT the mattress platform. Be aware of this when purchasing.

I tried the cosleeper without it for a week and it was breaking my back to dip down to pick up the baby to breastfeed at night.Giving birth naturally injured my back/hip. It took me 2 months to fully recover. So having the cosleeper at my level really helped me. Plus having the baby within my arm's reach to soothe also added more hours to my sleep, which I desperately needed since I was the only one at home to take care of the baby (hubby had to go back to work after the first week).Adding the extensions does make the bed more shaky, but it's not going to collapse or tip over, especially when the cosleeper is right next to the adult bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"recieved quickly","review":"Gave four stars bc we havent used it yet.

There is nothing on the package or in the description that says they won't fit older models -- they're supposed to fit the mini, original, and universal.Also, as someone else pointed out, they warn you on the front of the package not to use in \\"bassinet mode\\".

OUr bed is really tall, so we need the leg extensions to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsafe, unfortunately your options are limited","review":"These extensions should have been included with the co-sleeper. As it is, the co-sleeper is lower than the average adult bed and the extensions are required if you want your child sleeping on your level. The fact that they sell it as a separate item is pure gouging for an extra few bucks, which is irritating. They are simple pieces of plastic and shouldn't add but a dollar or two to Arms Reach's cost.There are twelve pieces, so you can use a max of 3 pieces per leg to increase it to the maximum height. We had to do just that, and found that the three connected pieces are *very* unstable.It's too bad they charge so much for a poorly constructed set of unstable plastic pieces. What they should do is provide a set of pieces of varying heights, to prevent too many connections to a bed that's holding your precious child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leg Extension Kit","review":"When I originally read reviews of this product I felt very discouraged because a lot of people said that the legs made the co-sleeper unstable. I have NOT had that experience at all. The legs were easy to install, click together, and the co-sleeper feels just as stable as it did before. It is really nice to have these to be able to customize the sleeper to fit our taller bed. That being said (this is a review of the company and not the product) I really feel like this kit should be included with any co-sleeper and/or should cost much less. It seems awfully expensive for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait and see","review":"We didn't end up needing these, so I highly recommend you wait and see if you will even need the height.

This had potential to be a really good story, but for me it never got there. The stream of consciousness voice from all of the characters was irritating. The story had some interesting twists, but never really came to fruition for me. I was hoping for something a bit more interesting, shocking, gripping.

Don't bother.","review":"This book has to be one of the most pretentious and self-indulgent books I have ever read. The author seems to care very little for her reader and just tries to show off her supposed skill with language. In the hands of Nabokov or Rushdie such experimentalism is genius and beautiful. In the hands of Ali Smith it is clumsy and self-indulgent. In fact, this book made me angry. Whatever happened to telling a good story or developing characters? It is as though Ms Smith just spewed up whatever was in her head on to the page with very little thought into how to make her characters complex, give the themes any depth or subtlety, or advance the narrative. And to think she received critical acclaim for this book. Ugh. Bring back Nabokov! I weep at the thought that this is the future of \\"good\\" literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible","review":"This has got to be the worst book I've ever read. How convenient that Amazon lists the good reviews first. That means most people won't read this. However, I'll give my two cents worth anyway. Several previous reviews state this book is funny, it's not! The book has no plot, no ending, and only a very fragmented, mostly deranged stream of thought in between. I can only guess that Ms. Smith was trying to be clever with her rambling list of web sites, use of etc. every few lines and endless droning on about cliches. It all falls flat because it all leads to no where and nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your money for something by a different author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Writing, Too Little Story","review":"More of a technically impressive book than an enjoyable one. The characters are with quirks that are fun to write -- the hyperintellectual daughter always using \\"i.e\\" in her monologues, the son experiencing the world as a math equation -- but that make them feel more like vessels for glitzy prose than actual individuals. The story is weighed down by the writing, and I found myself scanning whole pages to get to the next graf where something, anything, would actually happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Couldn't Finish This....","review":"and as an avid reader and slightly type-A person I allow myself to quit very few books. The hype around this book made me put it on my wish list right from the beginning. I chose to start this book over 3 others I ordered at the same time. Disjointed, completely out of touch with any reality I know, sublte to the point I think the author actually doesn't know what she is writing about. Lots of gratutitous sex. Not shocking just ENOUGH already. I have three teenagers, I am a woman in her early 40's and I have often wanted to escape. Just not with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless gibberish","review":"Don't be suckered in by the jacket hype and the \\"glowing reviews\\". This is a junk book. I bought it, I read it, and I plan to give it away just as soon as I can. It is a waste of time and money. If you LIKE books with no discernable plot, jarring, unreadable and silly writing \\"styles\\" and clueless characters, by all means, pick this one, but don't forget, I tried to warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Accident","review":"I relied on the reviews and bought this book. A new word that means pretentious to the 5th power would have to be invented to accurately discribe it. The author knows words and how to use them but in the end nothing is produced. There is talent here and intrigue to be sure but it is a self-indulgent effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Award For What? Babble?","review":"This was definitely NOT my type of book. I thought several times of just giving it up. I can not, for the life of me, figure out how this book could possibly be up for an award. How hard is it to babble on paper? That is exactly what this author did. There were very few complete thoughts. Sometimes I felt like the author had written this book after drinking 15 cups of coffee. I find no talent in expressing yourself in a continuous stream of unorganized thoughts. I think the book was about a dysfunctional family who is invaded by an odd character named Amber. Why anyone would let a stranger stay with them for as long as they did is beyond me. Maybe a sign of how dysfunctional they really were. Amber does influence their lives in both good and bad ways. It's just so hard to understand the story line and the conclusion with the way it was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"honestly now...","review":"This is an entirely pretentious and immature attempt at intelligent fiction that manages to be cloying at all possible levels. The writing and metaphorical content is constant in its reaching for cliche--is it any wonder that Smith's main trick is to use rhetorical questions? ugh. For a sophisticated realization of the multiple point of view novel, see Julie Otsuka's When the Emperor was Divine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book Club Read","review":"If I did not have to read this for a Book Club I would have thrown it away immediately. It has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Do not spend a minute of your precious time on this bizarre book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i.e., i.e., aeeeeeiiiiii","review":"I borrowed this book from my local library after reading the positive and rather enthusiastic reviews. If I liked it enough I will get my own copy. But, no, I HATED this book. I promptly put this title and its author in my TOP 10 WORST LIST.The writing style is truly irritating and pretentious.What's with the i.e.s? I counted 9 within 35 pages, the author is condescending by explaining what i.e. is.She tends to repeat phrases, constantly writes short, 3 word sentences that made me want to throw the book against the wall (I can't because it's the library's).The story line has potential although a cliche. She could have done a better job but too absorbed with her own greatness.I had to finish the book to see if the story will get better but it did not for me. Right after I finished, my reaction was HUH?, EH? WHATEVER. I do not recommend this book unless you love to scream (in annoyance and frustration) for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably one of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I, too, selected this book for my book club because I was taken in by the glowing reviews and am so sorry that I did. The book had the potential to be a great story, but the author's style of writing obliterated any possibility of this book being anything but a generally bad read.The disjointed poems that are interspersed throughout the story, the repetition of phrases, over and over and over again, the branching off to unrelated subjects in the middle of a thread are distracting, and frankly, annoying. I finished this book only because it will be discussed at our book club, otherwise, I would not have wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tales from the Smiths","review":"Ali Smith is Scottish, unlike Zadie Smith, who is nonwhite and also published a good novel, \\"On Beauty,\\" last year. Ali's novel is quite unusual both in style and content. Taking the point of view of each member of a father-mother-preteen daughter- teenage son English family, she examines the effects upon them of the unanticipated, unwelcome and sudden arrival of Amber, a mysterious woman who possesses gypsy qualities, high sexuality, clairvoyance, and a larcenous heart and who prefers to sleep in her car, an old Volvo. From Michael, a professor of English, the author gives us sonnets, from Eve, a published fiction writer, the psychology of loss and mysticism, and so on.The book is extraordinarily interesting, and the reader winds up rooting for the underdog, always a noble act. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past the first few pages","review":"I am one of those people that sticks with a book no matter how dull, but I couldn't get past page 60 (out of 300). The book was boring and even annoying. I couldn't accept that a family would let a total stranger just move in with them unwelcomed. There was nothing in the writing that made me suspend my disbelief. I'm not sure why this book won awards. I am not a lit major; I just want to read a good story with good writing. This book did not satisfy either one of those criteria for me. I bought it in hardback too. What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These Books are Hard to Find","review":"I love all her books. Very content rich, but they are becoming harder and harder to find.

Unfortunately, all you get is 66 black & white pages (with big lettering) of information which is easily obtainable from websites such as millersoap.com (which is fantastic by the way) and others. There aren't even any pictures to enhance the experience. And, with its premium price tag, you just get the feeling you're being ripped off.

It almost seems like a rushed blog to book. The formatting is horrible for the Kindle, all the lines run together. The book is hard to focus on as the author jumps around so much that it hardly seems she finishes a thought. Also, it seems most of the recipes use Crisco; if you want to stay away from hydrogenated oils look elsewhere. This is not recommended for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"cuttin' heads rocks","review":"over the years i have sporadically listened to john's work. always like his stuff but not so much that i would want to get an album, cassette or cd. But i have this cd and i am glad i have it. if i were to have only one of john's work, this is the one. no regrets on this purchase, except that i can't wear this out like a cassette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets hope he gets back on track with the next one","review":"It has been a real pleasure listening to Mr. Mellencamp evolve musically, but maybe this time he went too far. Rap and other collaborations just don't work here. Don't get me wrong, Human Wheels, Key West Intermezzo and Your Life is Now are three of the best songs ever written (and highly underrated), but nothing on this disc remotely makes it to the level of those earlier songs. Well, an artist as consistent as Mr. Mellencamp deserves at least one miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics again","review":"I love Mellancamp and especially Mr. Happy Go Lucky. That said, like so many artists, Mr. Mellancamp is at his worst when he goes political. It's not the politics that I object to, it's the way the politics seem to generally result in lackluster music. Too ernest, too strident, too self indulgent and too rightous. There is great political music of course, but not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rev. Mellencamp's Sermon of the Week","review":"John Mellencamp has always had messages in his work, but this time, the Reverend Mellencamp sacrifices music on his PC altar. The message is fine (mostly of the can't-we-all-get-along sort), but the writing is about as subtle as a rubber mallet and the music, for the most part, seems like rejected Jimmy Buffett tunes, complete with the faux-soul female backup singers. After listening to the first two songs, the title cut and the first single 'Peaceful World', you almost expect the next two songs to be 'Please Don't Litter' and 'No Drinking and Driving'. Mercifully, Mellencamp diverts his attention to women, love, and sex in the middle of the CD... saving the album at least a little. Mellencamp needs to leave the messages to Bono and Stipe and pay more attention to his songwriting. A big disappointment from a usually solid artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"So PC, so heavy-handed, It's nauseating...","review":"I remember the first time I heard \\"Peaceful World\\" on the radio. Oh no, some old \\"rocker\\" is telling us how to get along with one another again. The song is so painfully didactic, and goes on and on with that tired one drumstick beat. By the third day after it's release I could have thrown the radio out the window.I don't dislike everything Mellencamp has done. I really liked \\"Cherry Bomb\\", but that was a long time ago. The effort on this album is apparent. Nice production, but he's trying so hard to be \\"meaningful\\" that it hurts. I just can't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not make the cut.","review":"I am big fan of John Mellencamp and have all of his recordings but his lastest \\"Cuttin Heads\\" is by far the worst in the last 20years. In the past Mellencamp has had a writing partner name George Green who is absent on this CD and is missed. John is not quite the songwriter when he fly's solo. Often he is very simpleand lacking quality lyrics and on Cuttin this is no exception.Hopefully next time out John will go back to having some help on the songs and i do not mean singing them. Time will prove that Cuttin Heads did not make the cut.Marty Carroll"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"I listened to this 40 minute album over and over on my trip to San Juan, and couldn't change cds when I went to the beach. It is a very upbeat and peaceful listening CD. I felt refreshed and groovy at the same time. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Mellencamp...","review":"John Mellencamp cut through the fog this time around with his new masterful release.True to the spirit of his great eighties albums,\\"Cutting Heads\\" delivers an inspired mixture of the rocking troubadour's poetic lyricism,introspection and superb good old time rock and a few new tricks to top it all off:art above entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music with meaning","review":"This is not a pop album and won't get the kind of airplay reserved for the lightweight schmaltz being generated by many of the Top 40 artists. The racial and political messages woven into the songs on Cuttin' Heads will raise a few eyebrows of those who bought the album without knowing John Mellencamp's proclivity for creating music with meaning. The songs on the album have full melodies and the use of percussion and rhythm adds a punctuation that sticks around long after you're done listening to the album. Mellencamp employs a stable of incredibly talented musicians whose work on Cuttin' Heads is well showcased. The background vocalists add a richness and depth to many of the songs, particularly Just Like You and Shy. Fans of John Mellencamp are certain to snap this up, but it's an album that can be fully enjoyed by anyone who prefers an earthy rock sound generated by someone more concerned with the message than with image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Chords","review":"I am a big fan,and rushed to the store to get \\"Cuttin' Heads\\" the day it came out. A lot of John's music gets better with repeated listenings, but this is not one of them. I come from the point of view that the melody carries the lyrics, so lyrics aside, this album stinks compared to the best of his previous work. Poor John is just flat out of chords. Almost every song is propelled by the same monotonous melody.I,ve listened to it at least five times, and it gets worse every time I hear it. It pains me to write this, but I'm pleading with you John to spend some serious time on your next effort coming up with the melodies that made me a fan in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"In search of good songs","review":"After John's return to form with his 1998 self-titled album, i expected this to be a huge leap forward to the songwriting powersof \\"Scarecrow\\" or \\"Human wheels\\". Apart from one memorable song (\\"Peaceful World\\"), this record has nothing new to add to his work. What happened, John??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I bought this for 3 Euros. Normally I would listen to his stuff first before buying because he can be very hit and miss in my opinion. Big Daddy was a hit for me, a very strong album, not one bad track, 5 stars, but this one is a miss. I was also disappointed with \\"Human wheels\\". \\"Trouble no more\\" was okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing To Get Excited About","review":"Another let down from the King of Rock and Roll - Nothing To Get Excited About - Also, \\"Women Seem\\" was the worst Mellencamp concert song bar none"},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined to become an essential recording","review":"Aside from the eerie photo of JCM that graces the cover of CUTTIN' HEADS, this is his best CD in years. Mellencamp's trademark Americana sound still resonates in these tracks but 50 year old Mellencamp isn't afraid to stripdown and focus instead his own lyric-driven sensibilities. The result is a refreshingly mature sound that is bound to win JCM new fans without alienating die-hards. A true message that doesn't have to beat the listener over the head to get his point across, tracks like \\"Cuttin Heads\\" and \\"Peaceful World\\" are sobering and timely (especially in the aftermath of the Sept 11 disaster.) I bought this disk yesterday and have been listening to it non-stop. Best tracks: \\"Peaceful World,\\" \\"Deep Blue Heart,\\" \\"Women Seem,\\" and \\"Cuttin Heads.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle-aged Teenager!","review":"Long awaited, self-produced worthy follow-up to Lonesome Jubilee. Yes, the attitude is back in the voice and the songwriting is the best since that awesome album from '87.Add Don Gehman behind the mixertable and you've got an album thatleaves all he did in the 90's gasping for air...The titletrack, co-written by and featuring Chuck D, is one of the heaviest songs from Mellencamp both music and lyricwise.And the hits just keep on coming; Peaceful World, Crazy Island, Women Seem and In Our Lives are all pontential singles.Cuttin' Heads was recorded during sessions made both in 2000 and 2001.

Pass on this album if you like the older stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mailed It In","review":"I've noticed a trend in the reviews here. Nobody finds the negative reviews helpful and everyone finds the positive reviews helpful - hmmmm. Also, the negative reviews seem to come from longtime fans. Add me to that list. I've been listening to Mellencamp (Cougar) since I was in college 20 years ago. I bought this CD prior to a long trip and listened to it about 3 times all the way through. It was really disappointing. My gosh, it was almost boring. Maybe those of us who remember the early work are still hoping for a return to the gritty sounds of classics like \\"I Need A Lover\\" or \\"Don't Misunderstand Me.\\" If that's what you're looking for, you'd probably be well advised to stay away from this one.

He discovered the reason 1903 rifles were blowing up; he discovered that the 1906 rifle cartridge didn't go as far as predicted, and he helped develop its replacement; he was involved in early machine gun trials; he was involved in the semi-automatic rifle trials, and the development of the Garand. And he documented it all.Every serious student of firearms needs to have this book. To some, it may first appear to be dated. In fact, basic firearms design has changed little since the 1930s. Hather's Notebook gives excellent inside coverage of a key era of modern firearms design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best","review":"Hatcher's book is probably the most complete compendium of gun facts assembled. Every shooter and gun buff should own (and read, of course) this book. Much of the information here is empirically derived, so while the data are good, the conclusions are not always valid.

I only have one little comment about the new duet with Barry. (This was originally my dream duet!) I am also a big fan of Barry and I think he has such a good and powerful voice, which is comparable to Babs, but I just wonder why he sounds so soft in the new song \\"I wont be the one to let go\\"? It was too disappointing to me when I heard it the first time. He just like a back up vocal for Babs, Did Babs use her \\"power\\" again to suggest to turn his recording volume down?????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD Cover, Average CD","review":"If only the new Streisand \\"Duets\\" cd was as brilliant as its cover. To be fair- the cd is fine listening. It presents a career retrospect of duets that Streisand began in the early 60s. Barbra really began to understand the power and commercial potential of duets after 1978's enormously successful \\"Flowers\\" duet with Neil Diamond. The tracks featuring Kim Carnes and Don Johnson are particularily dated and trivial, but others are just weak songs with weak duet performances (Manilow, and Sinatra to name a few). Thankfully Mr. Gibb, Mr. Charles, Ms. Garland, Mr. Crawford, Mr. Mathis and others brighten the overall project. I too would like to see Ms. Streisand duet with others like Linda Ronstadt, Sting, Tony Bennett, or others on a NEW cd- but thanks Barbra for a sampling of the past- now let's look to the future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a CD find","review":"I came across the album by shear change \\"WHAT A FIND\\".

Her duet with Josh is worth the price of the CD in my opinion, but the other 18 duets are very good too. My favorites are her duets with Celine Dion and Michael Crawford, and of course with Josh.

Overall, the Collector's Digest to Beer Cans exudes the cobbled-together aura of earnest, well-meaning, but ultimately amateurish production. The photographs themselves are nicely executed, though perhaps smaller than utility would dictate. The array of cans represented pictorally and, in a later section, textually, is fairly extensive, though not comprehensive by any means. Certainly, this is a very useful book for the price; one finds, though, that it merely whets the appetite for more thoroughgoing references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even my husband loved this one.","review":"We couldn't keep the grownups off this one.

The pre-programmed phrases worked fine, but when the microphone was turned on to change my son's voice, it was too loud and full of static like a blown speaker. It sounded better if he took it off and spoke while it was further from his mouth, but that is no fun if he can't wear the helmet. We paid almost $50 dollars for this including shipping to get it by Christmas and my son only played with it a couple of times. If the glitches were corrected, it would be well worth the money, but as is, it was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced!","review":"Has gone up over $30 in price.

If I would been aware of this beforehand, I would have not purchased the downloaded version, instead opting for a more friendly Mac book.

This book, presented as a straightforward examination of the NGO's 'Aid-Game' and their complementary 'Aid-Circus', ends up being all the more poignant when it targets Western misconceptions and the Neo-colonialism that has installed itself in the Western media and elites under the catchphrase 'Humanitarian Intervention'. You don't have to believe me - just read this fantastic book, written by a former member of the NGO's international, and find out how and why famines really start and really end, as opposed as what you hear on newspapers and TV. If you wanna know why Black Hawk went down, this is the book to start. If you remember those Ethiopian children you thought you saved by buying tickets for charity concerts, maybe you wanna know the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Thai Dipping Sauce","review":"I bought this while I was in the US visiting my parents.

This is amazing! I use it on everything from egg rolls to prawns to chips. And despite the fact that garlic is my favourite cooking ingredient, I've often come across dishes or condiments where the taste of garlic is too over powering (you can have to much of a good thing).

I use it to help chase out a cold or flu, and it works beautifully. Better still, it's addictively delicious! I don't dip anything in it, I just eat a 1/4 teaspoonful right off the spoon. And I keep wanting another 1/4 teaspoonful! YUM!!!!!! Also, a single jar lasts forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for parties","review":"Thai Chili Roasted Garlic by Wild Tymes is the best.

I purcahsed the 20lb wrap and it says that it is a wrist weight. I believe this is, if not false advertising, then pushing the envelope. There is no difference in the design from a normal ankle weight, you just tie it around your wrist. You would think if it could accomodate the wrist, they would design it so you could pass your wrist through the middle for better support. At 20 lbs, you can't have this slipping all over the place on your arm which it does. So, as a wrist weight it gets 0-1 stars. As an ankle weight, it is what it is and gets the job done. I'd give it a 3 if they sold it as only an ankle weight and didn't try to make it more than it is, but 2 stars for misleading marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy workmanship and poor design","review":"I purchased two different pairs of these: 1 pair of 10lb wrist weights, 1 pair of 20 lb ankle weights. Both pairs are leaking the steel shot that makes them heavy. Both pairs leave black dust on the floor. I am concerned about lifting these over my eyes and face due to these leaks. I must sweep the floor after each use to clean up the shot and black dust that they produce.I can not tighten either pair to the point necessary to keep them from sliding and twisting without putting extra layers of fabric (socks, etc) underneath.I have only owned these for 2 months or so and I'm already shopping for replacements. I would NOT recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT a wrist weight.","review":"This is purely a case where a vendor figured they sell one item as another by simply calling it something else. I'm a big guy (6'2\\", 200 lbs) and I couldn't begin to wear these as wrist weights. They slide/flop/spin/etc. all over the place. They ARE great ankle weights, securely fastening and staying in place. I wear them on training runs with a weight vest. Originally I had bought them to wear as wrist weights while running as 10lb. per arm wrist weights are pretty much impossible to find. Without a thumb hole (which would allow you to stabilize the thing), they just don't work. So, as an ankle weight 4 stars. As a wrist weight? Hardly. This vendor needs to check their marketing practices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"Very disappointed Kitchenaid fan. This spatula is not only too large and poorly balanced, but also broke recently when dealt some routine cooking abuse. Snapped right at that pretty narrow neck.

And when the pan isn't slick, the extremely soft and flexible edges become a disadvantage, as they're not good at scraping off anything that's really *stuck* to the pan.It does clean up easy, and it doesn't yet show any signs of wear, I just don't find it especially effective to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'D GIVE IT NO STARS","review":"What a mistake KitchenAid made when they designed this turner.

His three best albums, however, were recorded during his seminal \\"Island Years.\\" These three albums were Fear, Slow Dazzle, and Helen Of Troy. Helen of Troy is possibly the weakest of these three, but still remains an incredible album. Cable Hogue, My Maria, and Sudden Death are all stand out songs. The best on the album are I Keep a Close Watch, Pablo Picasso, Coral Moon and Leaving It Up To You.

I am in the process of replacing the second one now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not switchable from motion to dusk-to-dawn mode","review":"Mine did not come with the switch to change from motion to dusk-to-dawn mode and it's super sensitive. Any wind will turn it on, which means pretty much all night long. Too bad I didn't install it until a few months after purchasing it or I would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sensitive","review":"I live in a very windy area and even on the least sensitive setting with the motion detector pointed towards the ground this light will activate. That isn't the problem. The problem comes when it activates and you have it on a 1 minute timer, but it never turns off. The problem is sporadic and is tied to the wind. If the wind is very high, then the leaves, brush or whatever seems to be triggering the light and having two flood lights on most of the night is not only a waste of power, but it probably annoys the neighbors as well.The light itself is nice. It fully iluminates the yard and nobody is going to hide in the shadows with this light on.Motion sensing is the way to go. At least it turns off some of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"the cover falls down with the potty inside. there is another brand that has magnets that stick the potty to the cover- makes much more sense.

The bolts do not fasten down tight so the whole thing is wobbly. The three piece seats do not stay in the upright position for my husband to use the toilet. The toddler seat is the only thing we like. If you can put it on a toilet specific for that use and you don't care about the look of it being too short, it would be fine for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"New and improved?","review":"I recently bought this and wanted to note that I think the manufacturer has been reading the reviews and made updates. The package I received said to take the bolts off of your existing seat, but the hinges had bolts already permanently molded into them. It also has a small tab below the front of the child potty to keep boys from spraying on to the adult seat. So far my child, who previously was skiddish about sitting on the big potty, has loved it and I've had no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both stunning and beautiful","review":"Easily of the the best fantasy novels in English. Characters, plot and world building are all handled with a master's touch. Fantasy doesn't get much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a great book.","review":"My mom gave me this book to read, and when I started reading it I thought it was pretty good. The problem came up when I got about 2/3 of the way through. It seems as though Kay had a great idea and started spending lots of time on it, and then hit a deadline and abruptly gave up on getting a good story finished and instead focused on getting it out the door. There is so much that he could have done with this, and it ended up being very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This book is perhaps a great of Fantasy writing. It is sutbly written, but it contains such a great political and passionate backround. The people in this struggle to undo a terrible horror of losing their name, an anchor for their whole country, must use nothing but their minds, their feelings and their hearts. As things careen farther and farther out of control, as the story twists and turns in its many lovely parts, it is also a love story, a simple fact of acknowledging what the body knows but the mind can't accept. This is one of my favorite books of all time, and I rate it right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird and Far Pavillions. I loved this book.-Kirsten"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 4 books I'll always take","review":"If I was stranded on a desert island forever, I'd want 4 books with me. The first is \\"Lord of The Rings.\\" The others are \\"Tigana\\", \\"Song for Arbonne\\" and 'Lions of Al-Rassan\\". To me, GGKs books are sheer miracles --- but watch out ! He doesn't write to entertain, he writes to make you weep ! His books pierce your heart with the sheer beauty of language-- and the lines between joy and pain get blurred. And you are never quite the same again. Incidentally, I'm desperately looking for GGK fan-clubs etc. on the net. By the look of the comments on this page, mine wasn't the only heart pierced !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most beautiful book I have ever read","review":"This is an exquisitely heart-breaking novel, and it makes me cry every time I read it. It is the genious portrayal of the the complexities of character, both good and evil, that are present in all people, and the moral dilema of a woman torn between love of a man and love of her country. Beautifully characterized and very well written, Tigana wins hands down as my favorite book of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the 10 best fantasy books I've ever read.","review":"I admit that I hadn't been able to finish a fantasy book for years when there was a time that's almost all I read. All the plots recently seemed simplistic and rehashed. However Tigana restored my faith in the genre. A fantasy book that makes one almost cry for the the \\"evil sorcerer\\" is amazing. I'm still thinking about the book's images over a week later. No, its not a perfect book (and it could have been with one more rewrite) and it is overly gruesome at times (the death-wheeling image more than made its point the first time) but not since Ursula LeGuin have I been so entranced by the image of a world and by the choices made and consequences borne of the inhabitants. Read this book if you love fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast page turner","review":"If you like not knowing what will happen next in book, if you love strong characters, if you want a book you wish you could read faster and wish it would never end than this is the book for you. Mystery a lot of different characters that are well developed, and magic that does not overwhelm the story. Guy g Kay is fantastic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but great to end","review":"I read this book for the Sword and Laser podcast and it was great. The first few chapters were very slow but when I got about 100 pages in, the whole book came alive. I finally got where it was going and why I should read it. I still prefer the world building of Jacqueline Carey but this was so well done. I did not expect how some of the the characters evolved but as I look back now, it all makes sense. The last sentence just ripped out my soul but it was well written and the plot never went exactly where I thought it would go which is a good trait for a book to me. If you can get a copy of the book from the library, you should definitely try it out as it is worth pushing through to get to the full story. Tigana, I will scream your name through the world!!! (that makes more sense once you read the book, I promise.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story but maybe a bit overdramatic at times?","review":"Kay's book was wonderful. I had been searching for a one novel fantasy and having a hard time at finding one when I ran across his. If you want a great story without purchasing four and five books just to find out what happened-Kay's book is great. It's also marvelous because it has the depth and feel of a trilogy or a series but is still a single novel. The descriptions and intrigue are wonderful. Perhaps, due to a sense of today's loss of deep values, I don't understand some of the drama in the book. At times, things seem too dramatic to the point of silly...or maybe it's just that I don't understand such emotion. Either way, it's a great book, worth the read, perhaps not second to Tolkein but up there in the ranks of great fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adventure for everyone","review":"I loved this book it had everything you could ask for romance, adventure, mystery and wonder I recomend everyone to read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A darkly beautiful book","review":"I have nothing to add that hasn't been said, but when it comes to a book like this, I feel I have to respond.. This book is disturbing, haunting, and strangly beauttiful. It also was one of the first fantasy books that didn't try to simplfy the issue of good and evil. A book that makes you love the \\"Enemy\\" even when you know he has to be killed, is a work of ginius.The book raised the question of identity, freedom, love, revenge and their affect upon society. I won't pretent that I understood all the issues raised. But at least I felt they were there, and dealt with in their complex, vibrant form"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written","review":"After reading the other reviews I am apparently very much in the minority, but I found this book to be not well written at all. I only got through the first 100 or so pages and then gave up. The book is full of tortured prose which lectures us for paragraph after paragraph about the protagonists' feelings, reactions, memories, etc. The author also has an annoying habit: when the plot calls for a character to say something clever, he or she comes out with something fairly lame, but the other characters are dumbstruck with admiration. After this happened for the tenth time I finally stopped reading in frustration. Reading this makes me long for Ursula K. LeGuin, whose understated prose *shows* you what the characters are thinking and feeling rather than *telling* you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I had high hopes for this book, especially given all the positive reviews here. However, I found Kay's writing to be incredibly tedious, the characters one-dimensional, and the story rambling. I was really trying my best, but I got halfway through and gave up. Maybe I'll take a break and try to clear my head with Saberhagen's Empire of the East, a much better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should be: Don't Bother","review":"Very predictable, slightly cheesy, tedious, no real character development (I absolutely did not care about any of the main characters). This was one of the worst fantasy books I've read so far and it makes me hesitant to pick up another one (Although Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrel gave me hope). It would be better to reread some great books (JRR, Little Big, De Lint, etc.) and not waste time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Kay Change for the Critics?","review":"For me, all of Kay's work after \\"The Fionavar Tapestry\\" (trilogy) has been an *intense disappointment*. I've heard that some critics charged him with the \\"heinous crime\\" of being a Tolkien wannabe... perhaps in response to that criticism, he felt compelled to change his style? Sadly, in doing so, he seems to have lost the incredible beauty and eloquence of expression which characterized the \\"Tapestry\\" series. I am extremely disappointed with _Tigana_, as well as with Kay's subsequent works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tigana is one of best works of fantasy fiction around.","review":"Tigana was the first book by G.G. Kay that I read. I was immediately hooked by his fine writing style as well as the magnificent characters and the plot itself.Kay spins a tale about countries trapped in conflict, one of which has been erased from memory by a magician's spell: Tigana. The story follows the lives of several characters who become entwined in trying to end the reign of an evil ruler and thus restore peace to the world, as well as restoring Tigana to memory.As with Kay's other books, Tigana has historical overtones from our world. Readers will see aspects of several different cultures including Greek, Italian, and Arabic.Kay is a magnificent writer, perhaps one of the best in recent times. This is a great book to introduce readers to his writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tigana is one of Kay's best works.","review":"When I started reading Tigana, I had already read the Fionavar Tapestry Trilogy; I admit that I was biased. I was prepared to love this book at all costs, even if it had been terrible. But even if I hadn't already read the Trilogy, I would have still LOVED this novel. A lot of Kay's other books' plots are very complicated, but not so for this one. It starts off quite slow, but once you're into it, you won't be able to put it down! Now, I'm not the emotional type, but I did cry several times throughout this book. Kay describes his characters so well, you feel as if you know them personally. You'll laugh with them, and cry with them. When I had finished reading it, I just had to sit back and say to myself, \\"WOW!\\" And so will you, once you read it. If you're into an in-depth Fantasy novel, I TOTALLY recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart read","review":"A good read that wasn't completely brainless. This book departed from the ordinary and made interesting social commentary. I would have liked a more clearly defined, awesome hero, but to my pleasant surprise, the book isn't full of cliche archetypes. The lines between good and evil are so blurred you won't know who to root for and I swear to god that you will be tricked into feeling sympathy for both sides. Also, the fantasy that was involved wasn't there just for the sake of being weird. It was an instrument. Definitely read this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book","review":"I read this book years ago and wish that there were more like it, more authors like Kay (love all his stuff).This summer my fiance was looking for something to read and though he never seems to like anything but books about marine snipers and WWII, finally took my advice and tried this one. He could not put it down. Now he wants to read the other Kay books and has ransacked my bookshelf for them.The book is gorgeous, will leave you touched and looking forward to discovering his other excellent novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no better single volume fantasy","review":"Guy Kay's Tigana is a moving, haunting work of prose that continues to resonate with you long after you finish the novel. The premise and goal -- freedom fighters seeking the rebirth of their nation -- is far different from the typical sword-and-sorcery fantasy motif; as are the portraits of the heroes and villains -- they are not stark black-and-white images but all have varying shades of grey. The language Kay uses and the settings evoke an emotional attachment to the action in the book. The book receives four stars only because of disturbing sexual encounters between two of the main characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Adventure Story","review":"It's good, very easy to read, satisfying and predictable, well written. Maybe about 100 pages too long! I liked the book but can't understand all the hype about it. It's not like the author invented the wheel or anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated: Not in Tolkien's League","review":"I can't believe the number of reviews of this book that try to draw comparisons with LotR. Not even close. Don't get me wrong; Kay is a very good writer, but it's ludicrous to draw this particular comparison. Can you imagine incest as a major plot point in Hobbiton?Other readers have lionized Kay for writing his characters with shades of gray. In this novel, this attempt centered around two characters whose merits I could never accept. I realize that he wanted to keep them \\"real\\", but I couldn't buy his attempts to make Brandin \\"tragically understandable\\". Nor could I ever justify Dianora's love for him, given her past and his continued reprehensibility.What I was really looking for was a great fantasy that I could share with my teenage son as we had LotR. This was certainly not it. If what other reviewers write here is true: that this is one of the best fantasies around, maybe I should stop looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does a book so bad have to be so long?","review":"Over-dramatic, self-indulging, and downright boring.I am writing this review for all of those who are about to make the mistake of reading this book. I already have.I absolutely hated the characters. Why? Mainly because everything is a matter of life and death. Everyone is ever so eager to sacrifice their lives, fight to the death, and swear life-changing oaths. Its typical bad fantasy.Kay does have the power of vivid description. Unfortunatly that has gone to his head as his novle is several hundred pages too long. A lot of the sideplots in the story end up being irrelevant or uninteresting. I finished the book only because I was too stubborn to quit after investing so much time in reading it.Please, there are much better fantasy novels out there. This one is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally, a fantasy novel that emphasizes homosexual sex","review":"And consider how many fantasy novels you've read and at the end have thought, pretty good, but where was all the homosexual sex? If that's your bag, then this is the book for you. Fantasy? No, not in the LOTR or Wheel of Time or Song Of Fire and Ice or Malazan or Black Company or Mistborn or Amber Chronicles or Name of the Wind or Belgariad or Shannara or any other great fantasy books kind of fantasy. But definitely the homosexual sex kind of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tigana","review":"This is my favorite book of all timeThe book is beyond words to describe, so heartbreakingly beautiful. And the character Dianora is so wondefully written and complex. This book makes you think about love and loyalty. Trust me; read this. I feel sorry for those people who don't like it. I recommend this for the sensitive at heart and those who believe in true loveI also like Juliet Marillier and Jacqueline CareyI HATE plot driven books, books involving really \\"out of this world\\" dragons, witchs, etc. I don't like cheesy books but books that make you think and touch your heartIf anyone has any books that fits this list or \\"gets\\" what I'm saying please please please recommend some other booksThanks! <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty Full!","review":"I started reading this book based on the librarian's recommendation, with no expectations at all. I found myself spellbound."},{"rating":"1","title":"very predictable","review":"Why are people so enthusiastic about this book? It is average at best, with a very predictable plot and setting. The worst aspect of the book is that the main characters are poorly drawn, presented as simplistic, unidimensional, and often highly unpleasant people. The only reason I bothered to finish reading it was because it was pouring rain outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and beautiful fantasy","review":"THE GOOD: This is definitely one of the better fantasy books that I have read. He creates a very rich and immersive world, you really feel like you are a spectator to the events. Every detail and subplot is seamlessly woven into the larger story, there are no insignificant characters. Overall, this is a book that will stay with you and is worth reading.THE BAD: The author falls into a common trap for fantasy writers. His female characters are unbelievably flawless. Every last one is beautiful, enchanting, and horny. I wish that the women in the book were more natural and realistic, instead of the typical fantasy babes. This is the only aspect of the book that keeps it from being 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting all the way through","review":"Despite a slow start, once the players are clear, their personalities, experiences, and behaviors become both individual and intertwined in a story that keeps moving forward across time and space. This world is well visualized and is well worth the time investment. I listened on Audible and Simon Vance does a great job with the voices.A wonderful fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!","review":"I don't have much to say as most of it has already been said by other reviewers. I just want to urge anyone who is a fantasy-book reader to buy this book. You will definitely enjoy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine outing from Kay","review":"I have read a few of Kay's novels so far and all of his characters invoke a sense of empathy from the reader that I think only a few other writers can emulate (i.e. Martin). Tigana is another fine book from Kay, and though in my opinion it is not as good as a 'Song for Arbonne' the author nearly effortlessly is able to promote feelings of loss, despair, passion and love all at once in the reader that make this book a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Guy Gavriel Kay has made it into my book as one of the most depressing authors I've ever read. There's no book of his that I've made it through without crying. Multiple times, usually. Not that this is a bad thing: on the contrary, most of my own writing is tragic, and Kay is one of my favorite authors after Tolkien.Tigana is yet another rich, fantastical world that Kay has managed to create. It is a land that has lost its name because it killed the son of the man who was invading it, who then laid a curse on the land that none but the people born in Tigana would remember its name or even be able to hear it when said. This is the story of how years of hope and pain have brought a band of people together to join their Prince and to reclaim their land and their pride. It truly is a beautiful story, and it left me weeping very much at the end. Guy Gavriel Kay does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must read!","review":"Tigana is one of the most amazing books I have ever read. Not imbued with too much magic, it is a tragic and at the same time joyous epic of love, revenge, hate, adventure, and personal growth. The characters become as alive to the reader as a long time friend.I have read this book 4 times. Don't let the size intimidate you. I laughed and cried (many times) each reading. The story never gets old, and the characters are always fresh. Absolutely unforgettable"},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant Classic!!!","review":"Not many books find their way to my prestigious \\"I'll read you in another five years\\" shelf. But Tigana easily qualified for that honor. In fact, Tigana stands alone on my newly inaugurated \\"Amazing book I'll have to read again and again\\" shelf. I wouldn't want to tell you what this book is about, for I don't want to spoil for any prospective reader.

I would think that it was my OS if it wasn't for the fact that I've encountered the same behavior on the following systems: Windows XP, Windows 2000, Mac OS X 10.3, and Mac OS X 10.4. All behaved the same way.I bought this drive so that I could quickly transfer large files between computers; however, I didn't count on spending 10 minutes attempting to get the drive to be recognized.

I purchased the Lexar Media 256 MB JumpDrive for my husband about two months ago and he hasn't stopped praising it--works great on both home and work computers with absolutely no problems. What impressed me, however, was what he confessed to me about a week ago. Seems he accidentally left it in his pants pocket the first week he had it and it went through both the wash and the dryer (perma pressed cycle, of course)before he sheepishly retrieved it without telling me what he'd done.

It works flawlessly on all of them, and never causes any problems.The two small caveats are these: I can't find any easy way to add a password to the disk, which leaves me a bit uncomfortable-- I've already misplaced the drive a few times. I've found it every time, but still.... And on a Mac PowerBook, the shape of the drive means you cannot plug in another USB device (like a mouse) and use the drive. The ports are quite close togther, and the drive's slightly bulbous shape means there's no room for two devices side-by-side.

It cannot be read by either a PC or on a MAC.I asked the company for a replacement but they want the original drive back (with all my personal information on it) before they will replace it. THIS IS A PROBLEM. Who wants to send their personal data to a bunch of strangers? I bought this to use as a backup to my other drives, and to transport information. If I have to back up my back up then that is not gonna work.I would recommend avoiding this company's products and go with one of the other brands, like the intelligent stick.All they had to do was replace my device and I would have then destroyed the origingal (which doesn't work) and returned it to them. They will not allow that so...I'm not buying another one from them.MS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got it replaced, NONE working!!","review":"I got one last year and it quitted in a few month.

Where the write protect switch is on his model, mine just has a small hole. I suspect that maybe some early models had a write protect switch, but the one I got today definitely does not. (Lexar never claims this model has a write protect switch).The small whole exposes the circuit board, allowing dust, pocket lint, liquid, etc., inside. (At least in principal....) This is very annoying...I'd really like to have a write protect switch, and bought this because I thought that it had one.Otherwise it's nice so far. I echo other reviewers' that the clip on the cover seems superfulous. The drive is also a little large to be on a keychain. It is nice that the keychain is attached to the base of the drive though. This means you can't easily disconnect it from your keychain, but also means that it will be harder to lose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"I had a really bad experience with this jumpdrive. My original stick gave up on me in just 4 months. It just stopped working. The replacement died from a power surge within one week. Unfortunately, Lexar doesn't replace damaged jumpdrive so I have to buy a new one. From my personal experience, I highly recommend against this flash drive. You may be more lucky, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love everything but the cap","review":"As a grad school student I am constantly working on different machines. This drive has become a permanent fixture on my key chain. It's fast, reliable, and requires no driver for windows XP.A few of us around the department started off with them, no everyone has one. I cannot stress how much faster and easier it is to use it over a Zip Disc or CD/RW.The downside is the cap and lack of extension cord. Some of the other manufacturers include a USB extension cord (in case the USB port is on the back of the computer)... but you can buy one fairly cheap. The biggest drawback is the tiny cap - which protects the USB connector. Mine broke within weeks (but help up after super gluing it back together), and they can easily get lost.Other than that, this has been a godsend. I use mine daily and have yet to have a problem. Some of the cheaper one's can have memory loss problems, so spend the extra $10 and go with a name brand... like Lexar or any of the other big companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most useful hardware I have bought in years","review":"I tossed out my zip drive after I started using a jump drive.

The TV button must be used for TV but the other 5 buttons can be used for any device. I had a TV, 2 VCR, 1 DVD and a TV/VCR combo programmed all in about 5 minutes and almost all of the function worked on my devices.

It basically starts off where the 12th of August left off, even containing information about Buford's death (which I believe was caused by foul play).

The running vocabulary list, which lists a word three times before dropping it, was very helpful, though it seemed as though the last definition listed as a possible translation for the word was the most appropriate one.

I have never had one rust, at all. The surge is 100% stainless steel, and would have to be abused BADLY!! to rust.All that being said the Surge is now my multi-tool of choice (which is saying a lot since it replaced the Wave II.) With needlenose pliers, 2 knife blades, scissors, file and saw that can be swapped, awl, bottle opener, flat screwdiver, and a bit driver that can be used with a multitude of bits this tool will get you out of any situation you may find yourself in.I wholeheartedly recommend this tool to anyone who is in the market for a multi-tool. If the Surge's size is a bit much for your tastes go for the Wave which is another 5-star Leatherman product which is just as useful and weighs 4oz. less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leatherman surge","review":"The leatherman surge hands down is one of the best multi tools I have ever used in my life, Iam confident it will be one of the top tool I'll ever use in the future..."},{"rating":"2","title":"it has a okay quality","review":"this is my second surge that i bought.fist one i abused it and everything broke and i liked it. i have bought the second one but to be honest the second one was the worst one.first it was so hard to open,the the pliers broke and became useless in less than a year.i have emailed the coustomer service as it has 25 years warranty but it seems it just a word but nothing else and till now i am not getting any respond.i am addint this line as i got a refubrished once i sent my broken one to warranty service.it look just like brand new and i am happy with the waranty serviceLEATHERMAN TOOL GROUP ,INCWARRANTY SERVICE DEPARMENTPORTLAND,OREGON,USAP.O.BOX 20595"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great multitool","review":"I've been wanting a leatherman for a while now and the Surge seemed to be a nice fit.

I followed the directions to the letter and the pasta turned out perfect and delicious the first time!! The instruction book comes with several wonderful recipes, I used the 'Egg pasta' recipe. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, as previously mentioned, the extrusion is VERY, VERY SLOW!

It kneads and pushes the pasta through different sized discs, depending on the shape desired. Two major drawbacks, though. It is very heavy, so make sure you store it in an easily accessible place, and it is also time consuming to clean. I suggest you use it several times in a row to familiarize yourself wth all the working parts. Then you won't feel overwhelmed each time you drag it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Excellent Gluten Free Pasta","review":"Easily makes gluten free pasta. Some reviewers state that it is slow to extrude but really it is no slower than the pasta machine that I owned previously. Really, if it was fast, it would be difficult to keep the pasta from sticking to itself anyway. I expected really loud but the noise is not bad at all, about the same as my kitchen aid stand mixer. Would totally recommend this to anyone that is interested in making their own pasta, especially gluten free pastas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this machine!!","review":"My husband purchased this machine a couple of weeks ago.

I followed the directions to the letter and it was not allowing the pasta to flow out to make the noodles correctly. Again, could have been me, but if you are new to homemade pasta, this is a horrible machine. It also stopped working on me during the first use so I returned it. I ordered one of the hand crank machines with a motor on it, which I am sure will be much easier and full proof than this machine. Also, the instructions tell you that the machine could stop working if you get any flour down in past a certain part -- now tell me how you are suppose to keep flour that gets in any crevice possible out of the area where the dough is suppose to flow out of the machine? Too risky for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pasta Maker","review":"I bought this for my mom for her birthday because she wanted to try one of these pasta makers since she has been hand cranking our pasta with the same maker since I was a kid. I went through several reviews of different products before settling on this one to give her. At first she was not to thrilled about it but now she likes using it a lot. The only thing about it and I would not even call it a problems is, you REALLY have to read the directions or it can become a bit confusing. My mom was a bit overwhelmed at first with it but. once we got through all of the kinks it is really easy to use and takes a lot of time and effort out of making home made pastas.

I liked that I could make a hearty, all egg, semolina flour pasta with the CTC. The Lello requires bleached flour at all times, either 100% or at least partially with semolina or other flours. Plus, all flour must be sifted and weighed. As an experienced pasta machine operator, I am familiar with the different and certain consistencies that seem to work best. The Lello seems to require a more moist yet lighter dough mix, with smaller coagulations. I had a difficult time getting the mix to fall into the 2nd stage auger for extrusion. While I feel that the Lello may make decent lighter and basic pastas, it failed at making the heartier, all egg, semolina pasta that I enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your dough!","review":"we are very dissappointed in this machine. once extruding, the dough leaks from the side damper. we have yet been able to extrude a full batch because the gluten developes and disables the 'drop into the extrusion hole' design. this is a significant design flaw.

I never want to forget Eccleston's perormance. Had he continued, the series would have been every bit as good, albeit in a different direction. He is the least quirky, or most \\"normal\\" of all the Doctors I am familiar with and that leant a level of believability to the character. He's almost the \\"superhero space alien next door\\".

Much to my dismay I viewed right up to scene 30 where Jett Rink comes by to the Benedict place to brag about his oil strike and then the dvd immediately went on the to special features. I tried to get it to go to Side B for the rest of the movie, but it get going back to the beginning. I searched all over on the second special features dvd but there was no movie to be found.

A stunning disappointment in DVD!","review":"GIANT. A stunning disappointment in DVD!I have been a fan of Giant for many years, and have seen the film many times. I had looked forward to the DVD re-issue, anticipating all the benefits of DVD quality and presentation. What a disappointment this disc has been! Although the blurb for the set describes the film as being transferred from \\"revitalized film elements\\" it is, as far as I can tell, nothing more than the same video tape that was used for the laserdisc version several years ago.It is NOT a new digital transfer, and it is NOT anamorphic. Detail is appallingly bad for a DVD, color has been hyped up but surface texture is poor. Zooming the picture to fill a 16:9 screen produces picture quality hardly better than VHS. It really looks no better than the laserdisc, and it is a crime to have lavishly re-issued this set without a new anamorphic 16:9 compatible transfer. This is one for the resale bin immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"an american movie classic","review":"words really cant describe what a great movie experience thisis.... not only does this movie encapsulate the american dream, butalso comments on problems with society of the era with many stillbeing relavent today. after seeing this movie, you'll realize justhow bad you are getting ripped off at the theatre today with most ofthe current releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie, but very poor restoration work","review":"I bought this DVD with high expectations having first seen this film as a child - and should be giving it a five star rating. But I was extremely disappointed upon viewing the DVD which contains some of the worst edge enhancement I have ever seen. Hence the two star rating. In many scenes people and animals have glowing neon-like halos surrounding them! How can this film be said to have been restored??!! It would seem the Studio was in one big rush to get this DVD onto the market and had I been aware of this awful transfer, I would never have bought it.Older movies than Giant have been restored to pristine quality - take a look at Spartacus as an example. So, Warner Bros. please go back to the drawing board with this film and restore it the way it should have been done in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than VHS","review":"I love this movie and watch it once a year and every year I am reminded just what a bad job they did building this version. Colors are way off, picture is stretched from original aspect ratio so all the characters are short and wide. I have watched this on a very high end projector, 47\\" LCD HD flat screen and 27\\" CRT. It looks best on the smaller screen because of the lack of detail and poor color rendition. Don't buy this DVD if you still have the VHS. A competent production studio needs to overhaul this movie by returning it to it's original aspect ratio and correcting the color in a BLU RA version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Not Pleased","review":"I was disappointed with this order.

It's a marked improvement over both the laserdisc transfer and the Canadian DVD release a couple of years ago. Both those transfers suffered from extreme graininess, poor color, and lack of definition. The recent transfer is as clear as a bell - finally doing justice to George Stevens' masterpiece. And the extra features alone are worth the price of admission, featuring interviews with many cast members. The only debit I find with this release is that the only English audio option available is the simulated stereo remix done several years ago.I can be very fussy when it comes to DVD transfers (see my other reviews).

It had some great characters to be sure, but the narrative was just a collection of unrelated events--an extremely LONG collection of unrelated events.

And Dad learns to tone down his racism a little bit, but not too much.It's really a three star, but I'm taking off an extra for sheer length.

And of course it has no basket people! It's a practical stroller which meets all the expectations for what it was made! And the price is unbeatable!I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase.

The only good thing about it is that you won't be sad if you leave it somewhere. The \\"restraints\\" don't restrain at all. My one year old twins barely stay in it so when we're in a store they can reach very far to pull down all sorts of things. (not safe) The stroller barely fits through regular door ways - and I mean barely fits. It does not maneuver well at all and is difficult to stear. The \\"adult drink cup holder\\" snaps off when struggling to go through doors and I don't have to describe what a mess that is. I'm just lucky I don't drink hot coffee; otherwise I would be suing the manufacturer for burns to the children. There is no storage. The \\"saddle bags\\" can hold a few small things but you should only use it for things you don't mind the children being able to reach. This stroller is not only a nuisance, it has potentially dangerous features, so please don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I have a 2 1/2 and 1 1/2 year old and I don't care for this stroller. The main issue is that there are no shoulder straps, it only has a belt strap so both kids like to try to stand up while they are in it. Based on that issue alone, I would not buy this again.On the plus side, it is relatively light, as double strollers go, and that was the main reason that we purchased it. It's light enough that I can lift it in and out of my trunk without my husband's assistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good pictures, mostly a let down","review":"This large picture book had some interesting photos of true cowgirls, but mostly it was just old 1950's artists' reditions.

The best part of this baster is the cleaning brush to clean other stuff. This oval mouthed baster sounded so great, but it WILL NOT hold hot liquids. It spills, pours out and is utterly worthless as a baster. Yes if you hold the oval horizontal is doesn't spill AS FAST as if you hold it vertical, but it still pours out.

There are some good songs on here but they are desperatly in need of someone to arrange some decent music and some less monotonous singing. I mean, even if Drake and Smith sounded like they were on 'ludes, there was a certain complexity to their music.

Well, this book brings back the memories of my schooling, trying to hit 500 words and I am finished at 300, so I go back adding words to lengthen the work when it really only needed 300 words to get my thesis conveyed. My advice is to consult the Occupational Outlook Handbook at your local library, it is dry but it gives better statistics and info. This work suggested no night careers I would be interested in, the interviews are not useful and this book could really be conveyed in much less space if all the filler and obvious information meant to fill space was cut out, I cannot help but speculate this author had a page limit imposed by her publisher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to be consumed for a while and then thrown away","review":"After '95 all of Anna Vissi's releases have been nothing but shallow bouzouki-dance music .

The first piece, Frank Nuyts give me your bunch of fives, is really great. That 2'17 is almost worth the money. The middle of the CD is dominated by a twenty minute work for organ and percussion which can either take you back to silent movies accompanied by organ and sound effects on a welcome visualisation trip or bore you to tears. It is curious that tracks 13 and 14 don't make it in with the list of the rest of the tracks on the back of the CD. Maybe the label skipped the editor to make the CD cheap.

I LOVE that there are two small straps inside that hook onto my dogs harness. My beagle has learned quickly that she can't leap out. What would have made the stroller perfect would have been for the inside of the stroller to be a few inches longer. My dog can't stretch out and has to lay curled up a bit. Also the basket under the stroller is a bit hard to get at. It is perfect for a dog bowl and a bottle of water. It will not be convient for personal items, as would be a child's stroller.On the whole I would absolutely tell a friend to buy this stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bible for automation and show control industry","review":"A well dog-eared copy of the first edition has been in my tool kit / computer kit for the last couple of years.

Yeah right. This is a painfully thin and disappointing \\"guide\\" for movie buffs--or more specifically fans of movie \\"buff\\". Precious few items of value here unless you're still a VHS junkie. Only a handful of the films listed are available on DVD which makes this book outdated. Even more disturbing are the listings featuring children naked. YUCK! What kind of audience do these people have in MIND? Who cares if this or that is \\"glimpsed\\" or a \\"brief shot\\"? And needless to say a lot of these titles are out of print so why bother?

Wish there was the patriotism today with movies supporting our troops. This is a movie about a family involved in a war, their contributions and courage in defeating the enemy.

I mean Christianity in a movie?Highly recommend this movie for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mrs Miniver is a looked-over treasure","review":"Most people haven't seen this movie even though it won the Best Picture Oscar in 1942. It is very very touching and may move you to tears! It is slow and calm as most movies go by today's standards, but it is absolutely beautiful. Greer Garson is a gorgeous actress and Walter Pidgeon has that manly quality that resembles Patrick Warburton of modern days. It's suspenseful and sweet and definitely shares a message about war and family and country. I just love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than you expect","review":"It is hard to tell of the importance of this movie and skip the details. Yes the technical stuff may not be that interesting in a review like, after first choice Norma Shearer rejected the title role (as she refused to play a mother), Greer Garson was cast. The meat of the story is the action and interaction of family members. Add this to plausible plot twists and you come up with a movie that had a unique view of the sacrifices they endured during WWII. This is not some cardboard war propaganda film.I would say to me the most moving sections were, the outcome of the Miniver Rose, unexpected war casualty, and of course as results the final church scene.Random Harvest"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mrs. Miniver","review":"I always enjoyed the movie , however there is practically NO sound on this cd...big disappointment:( I maybe should have returned it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted with the sale and the product, Thanks.","review":"A brilliant depiction of family life in England at the beginnings of World War II.

I do feel it is a very good beginners book for using the latest version of this software. JASC Software has made tremendous leaps to improve this program and with a few exceptions this book covers the software in a concise manner.On the downside, I was extremely disappointed in their not covering a few topics that the advanced web graphic artist would need, and those were Alpha Channels, Adjustment Layers, Actions, and Masks. .

You get so into the lives of these characters that when the story is over it's like saying goodbye to an old friend and the hug goodbye last not quiet long enough! It is a hard goodbye. The great thing about her writing is when this story is over you run into another old friend as soon as you turn the page and start another one of her stories. I was sad to hear of her passing and the world has lost a great writer.

I was very disappointed. Not anywhere up to Maeve's usual standard. Some of the stories barely get started and then they end. In fact, I was contemplating not bothering to finish the book but I pressed on in hopes that it would improve. Some of the stories towards the end of the book are better. Having said all of this, I still would heartily recommend any other of Maeve's books. They are all quite captivating. Just don't read London Transports first or you may not want to continue to read her other books and that would be a shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"London Transport by Maeve Binchy","review":"This book is typical of Binchy's wonderful insight into people and the warmth, knowledge and humour with which she writes.

When you try to slide the turner between the food and the pan, all you end up doing is pushing the food around the pan. Frustrating. Purhaps the silicone is so soft that a sharp edge is not stiff enough to hold up. Someone needs to rethink the use of this material.

Our dog is a loving, docile pet, but regularly growls if we try to take it away from her...we give her 1/3 of a bone after each dinner meal.

Much like his magnificent (and far more recent) tome, From Dawn to Decadence, this book captures a picture of history as revealed through people, places, art, politics and all the various components of humanistic experiences.Barzun provides the reader with a glimpse of the place of music in American society in the late 1950s. In some areas, his criticisms are blunt, but even-handed. He does not vilify academia or popular music, but is not afraid to point out their limitations. He asks the reader to be aware of pedantry in all its guises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, Very nice quality","review":"I fretted about ordering these after reading some of the reviews. I am delighted with the quality. The color, as reported by many, is not as pink as the picture indicates.

Very dark and mysterious. In modern times, the end of this story probably seems predictable, but I think Collins was ahead of his time, and I'm sure that people reading this story in the 1800's never would have guessed what \\"the secret\\" really was. This story itself is so interesting that it doesn't really matter whether or not you figure out the ending. It's the journey that really counts here.

Unfortunately, this treatment was designed to expand the author's use of adjectives rather than substance. If you read carefully, you will find the tidbits of heart-felt emotion, but you would be better off to spend your money on a book that doesn't make it so difficult to connect with authenticity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!","review":"Woman alone is the journal of an aspiring writer, reflecting the pains and beauties of life in a secluded family farmhouse. Burdick's writing is genuine and her subjects are real. Every bird she mentions, emotion she feels, or scene she accounts is written with such sincerity, it feels as though the reader is sitting beside her. You do not need to be a woman to be touched by this book. As a man I found it inspiring and pleasurable, unable to put it down. Like all of Burdick's work, after reading it you know that you have just read something special and great. Woman Alone is undoubtedly a classic waiting to be discovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU CALL THIS A MOVIE?","review":"People like me who've seen the first one know that this one was nothing but a money making ploy by the movie producers & people at the company.

There's never any indication of where functions being discussed are found, how to interpret the constantly shifting barrage of hybrid computer hardware/technical recording industry/made-up control name terminology, or... really, anything. It's useless. Several of the keyboard commands don't work, the icons are impossible to interpret, and there's no way to guess what parts of the intricate interface are active and which are merely display.

I picked it up at Toys R Us when I got my daughter's new carseat for our new Subaru. In fairness, it does keep her feet off the back of my seat, but it never fits nicely against the seat back. It's always turning to one side or the other leaving a gap between it and the seat, sometimes even getting in her way when she tries to climb into the car. The string that ties around the back of the seat never far enough back on the driver seat, either.That pocket up at the top isn't very big. I never put anything in it because there aren't many things that would stay well. I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rips easily!","review":"I purchased this for my new Envoy Denali which had shape similar enough to the seat protector for it to do its job. My daughter liked to rip her socks and shoes off to grab at the net bag with her toes. Within 2 or 3 days, she had this ripped. I will purchase another to try to flip the bag to the back.

It worked great for about 3 weeks, but at that point, he gave it one last kick and one side of the top attachment broke off. It isn't worth repairing and I am getting one that's made a little better. (I will review that when I get it, but I am trying the Mickey Mouse toy holder sold on Amazon.)If your child isn't quite as energetic in the car, it might be fine. But if your toddler doesn't do a lot of kicking, you're probably not shopping for this type of item. I wish they'd make items like this to last.

The seat cover is supposed to spring open and lie flat against the back of the car seat. Because of the way it was packaged, the cover was sprung and stuck out from the seat several inches. Also there is no way to secure the cover to the bottom of the seat, so my four year old just kicked it out of the way and put his dirty feet on the back of my seat. The material is very thin and it seemed cheaply made. I returned the item the day I received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is a piece of %$#@!","review":"Broke/ripped in 3 days!

This could have been such a nice product, but it is not practically made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 months of use-Bad Customer Service!!!","review":"The ties on this item broke off after only 3 months of use. Very cheaply made. I purchased this item at a Toys R US but could not return it without a receipt which I had misplaced. They wouldn't even do an even exchange...I tried calling the makers of this product directly (SunshineKids) which was a waste of time because although they have a one year warranty, you have to show proof of purchase.

If I forced that corner down, the opposite corner would just pop up instead. I tied it in place possibly every conceivable way, but it kept coming untied at the bottom anyway, and would not stay still. You know that wire and thin material manufacturers use for things like pop-up tents and cheap hampers? This is like that. My 2-year-old seemed to think it was a fun game to try to kick it off.Anyway, I recently gave up and threw ours away. It was more trouble than it was worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't stay attached to the seat!","review":"I purchased two of these because my 21 month old has taken to kicking the seats while we're driving.

It just can't withstand the stregnth of a toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"This seat protector was easy to install and covers the entire back of our truck seat.

Godspeed You Black Emporer is more interesting, both texturally and structurally; this music tends too often towards pure minimalism, and in a very tedious way (straight 4/4 meter and descending minor scales). Also, the tracks with singing are very ill-advised; the vocalist sounds like he's trying for Wayne Coyne's goofy fragility, but with this music it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty awful","review":"sorry but this disc is boring and pretentious, the musicianship and production is average to bad, and it is a waste of your time and money. i'm obviously disappointed in this cd. i initially didn't like it, but i gave it a chance, listened to it a few times more and it just got worse. it is a chore to listen to, the simplistic music combined with the annoying arty noise and speaking parts force you to hate it after awhile. when they try to add in some singing it just gets funny/unbearable. sorry again, i don't like giving bad reviews but some of the reviews i read of this cd gave me a really really wrong impression and i just want to provide an alternative viewpoint. if this music changes your life you are in sad shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"really not worth it","review":"\\"Eric Musall\\" hit it on the head: it sounds like Godspeed You Black Emperor minus the interesting parts. I'm sorry to say it, but this album is just boring. There are none of the gradual crescendoes of GYBE, or for that matter, anything much at all. Even without all the comparisons, The music of ASMZ is still ugly and souless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad to believe!","review":"My command of the English language is inadequate to accurately describe the complete lack of musicianship present on this disc. It's not somber or depressing or minimalist in nature, it's boring, bland, and inane. It fails to engage me at any level.I've been listening to indie for years and I despise anything pop so don't accuse me of only listening to accessible music. These days, I'm used to discs with one or two good songs and then a lot of filler, it's the nature of the beast. But this one has no redeeming value at all. This is truly the worst disc I own. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy for fear of insulting him or her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"I think this is the best SMZ recording. The vocals on the track 'Movie (never made)' just crush me every time. The melody is catchy (!) - weird, I know, but I have caught myself singing it to myself whilst pottering around in the kitchen...not what you'd expect from ASMZ, but there you go.I disagree with the reviewers who paint this CD as gloomy and depressing. None of the band's CDs could be described as *cheery* but this certainly isn't morose by any measure. The violins drive the music in a solemn way, always guiding and inspiring, showing us the way to our tragically broken souls. I love it, it probably contains the most heart-breaking music I've heard, and over the years I've consistently come back to it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecstatic","review":"This album is phenomenal. Musically trimmed down compared to Godspeed You Black Emperor. Some of the most beautiful music I've heard, haunting and bereft of hubris. I don't mind the vocals but the only part I don't care for is near the beginning with some of the sound effects or recording noises at the beginning of the album.All in all, I'd consider it one of the best albums I currently have and recommend it to those who can sit down and allow themselves to truly listen to the piece. A piece which should be enjoyed in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite ASMZ","review":"This is ASMZ's first album, and in my opinion their best. It is the most like GY!BE, epecially with the strings and background voices and samples; most like \\"lift your skinny fists...\\" to be more specific. What I like alot about this album is what made it hard to get into when i first heard it, and that is the reoccurence of similar melodies. The whole album is like one long song that revisits certain parts. Even though most of their albums seem to be concept type albums, this ones music really reflects it. The vocals are alittle rough in the beginning, but they grow on the listener. But all in all i like the emphasis on the strings the most, which is also one of my favorite aspects of Godspeed. Never a dull moment with Efrim."},{"rating":"2","title":"very sober, very sad","review":"I've come to believe that this entire CD is, in fact, a musical eulogy for this poor fellow's dog.Don't let that fact make you avoid this CD.If you're reading this, you already know this is a Godspeed You Black Emperor! side project, and it fits perfectly within that spectrum.If you've ever lost an animal you were very close to for a number of years, this CD will squeeze tears out of you.Minimal instrumentation, sober introspection.This entire CD was recorded in the month of November and it shows.Lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different world","review":"\\"He has left us alone, but shafts of light sometimes grace the corners of our rooms... \\"comes from a man belonging to a civilization more advanced than ours; comes from one of the most empathic human hearts. After I listened to the album, I read that it was dedicated to Efrim's dying dog Wanda. Some of the reviewers here who otherwise loved the music expressed their, to put it mildly, wonder how such music could have been inspired by a mere dog. Easily, if one goes a little bit beyond one's human arrogance and recognizes that animals are our equals, albeit being different. I felt as if I was intruding in this beautiful world shared by Efrim and Wanda; the music is that intensely private and it does not surprise me at all that such exquisite outpour of love and anguish can be expressed for one's best friend, be it a human or a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Westerns, 3 of them \\"spaghetti\\"","review":"The titles on this set are:THE LEGEND OF ALFRED PACKER (1980)TRINITY MEETS SARTANA (1972)JOHNNY YUMA (1967)GRAND DUEL (1972)Nice selection of movies, so-so dvd quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"review of zoids: battle legends","review":"I have not played this game but I do know that this game is alot like the Japenesse zoids Gamecube Game that I have.

A must have for any zoids collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok...","review":"The only good part about Zoids: Battle Legends is you get to customize your zoid. The battle mode is way hard for a beginner. Even if you spend all the money they give you in the game, taking on two opponents at the same time is very hard. Having a partner in the game is hard too. You have to make sure hes helping you. If you dont control him too, he just runs around and you get beat up and lose. I would not recommend this game.

A real time game with zoids. I was a zoids fanatic about a year ago(yes im a kid) and this game is based on the series. The bad things?

I was surprised to see how little content was amassed by Cleary. The Analects are a rich source of insight, and this book simply does not do it justice. Some of the passages chosen I would not have put forth either, considering the nature of the book's purpose. A lot of space is wasted, which could have contained many more of Confucious' truths.On the other hand, I do think that this is an excellent place to begin your Confucian search. If you just need a little prod or poke of his truths, then this is a nice, concise handbook. Nothing, however, can be substituted for the full Analects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sally Goodin","review":"I'm not a big fan of bluegrass, no, not at all, but this band's rendition of \\"Sally Goodin'\\" is MORE than enough of a reason to purchase the CD.

It is worth having the album just to have the Richard Green version of Orange Blossom Special. This is probably the best rock/bluegrass version of OBS ever recorded. Richard Green's riff in the Lowell George classic \\"I'm Willin\\" is also reason enough to have the album. The album simply titled Seatrain has other very good tracks. Too bad it's packaged with their Marblehead Messenger album which I believe is an inferior work. But the purchase is well worth the price to have Seatrain on a cd.

I heard the Orange Blossom Special track on satellite radio, decided to check them out. After reading reviews by the likes of jerseytomato, I thought how could I go wrong. Wasting twenty bucks is how I went wrong. There are MAYBE two or three songs on the whole of these two albums that didn't make me ill from being so saccharin and loaded with empty drivel. Maybe in fond memories of a 70's drug-induced haze someone can force themselves to believe this stuff is good. There's a reason these guys never made a big name for themselves. This one's ending up as a white elephant gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is a waste!","review":"Boy does this CD suck. After 2 listens, I remembered why I didn't buy the LPs when they were first releaded. They are both so inferior to the original SEATRAIN album released on A&M and now available on Edsel. The original band with Roy Blumenfeld, Donald Kretmar, Andy Kulberg, Richard Green and John Gregory on guitar and vocals was far superior. With Blumenfeld, Kretmar, and Gregory gone this band is less than average. Why they would remake Out Where The Hills, and As I Lay Losing is beyond me. My advice...if you want to know what SEATRAIN was really all about, get the Edsel CD and try to find The Blues Project -Planned Obsolescence which was the same band(Verve Forecast). I wish I could give minus stars for this one! Heck, I would give this away if there were any takers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...

I figured they were of the same callibre, so I clicked on the 'order both' deal figuring I've scored big time. Well to put it short, this album sucks bad. Funny enough, the linear notes conveys such a surprise of the fact that this group never made a scratch on the surface of fame and recognition. Well this album couldn't highlight this point any stronger. Straight up wack and not even close to the funked out rock of Mashmakahn's debut album. Be leary of Amazon's recommendations, I think it's an sly way of pushing crap that can't sell along side stuff that does sell.

These are not those performances. They are very close, but slightly different. It's as if the real performers rerecorded the songs to carefully copy themselves. Or a different take from the same session. As nostalgia, which is one of the reasons I bought this album, this rates a zero.

The audio quality is mediocre (at least compared to many digitally remastered albums I have) and for this genre, The Band, did it better. Too much fiddle mixed up front.

I found the writing to be just o.k. and the characters not compelling enough. This could have easily have been a novella instead of a short book. At times Marea the main character seemed self-destructive and not likeable. I just didn't like the unfinished feeling of the true intent of the story for Marea to find herself and figure out her fathers mysterious death that supposedly infulenced her past and somewhat current lifestyle. Also the sex in the book was illplaced and illneeded- it didn't help the book. If you are a Wenner fan then obviously you like her style and this book.

The best part is that it is a true story, and the descendants of the sailors and Tahitian who joined them still live on Pitcairn to this day!If you are a Charles Laughton fan then you must watch “Witness for the Prosecution�?with Tyrone Power and Marlene Dietrich.

I felt that times this story went off the track of what it was trying to say, about what happend on that fateful voyage and why things turned out the way they did.

The colorized version seems livelier, but there are several historical flaws. The most serious demonstrates how the film was caught up in the artifical morals of 1930's censorious Hollywood. For example, we are expected to believe that British sailors, impressed from the lowest levels of British society, and able to have sexual intercourse on demand with any of the Tahitian maidens, never exposed their navels to public view!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bligh, what a meanie","review":"Great movie, I felt it was a bit slow at times.

Laughton's Captain Bligh embodies cruelty itself as he terrorizes, tortures and flogs the poor souls toiling under his command, Clark is noble and true to his morals, even as he forsakes his country in order to stand up to the tyranny of the mad ship's captain. This film is magnificently made, filmed in black & white that's as crisp and clear-cut as the plot itself... Best of all, though, is Gable at his most dashing and magnetic -- if you've ever wondered whee his star appeal came from, then check this film out. (For an interesting contrast, try out the 1962 remake, with Marlon Brando, of all people, taking a cool turn at the Gable character...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good showing","review":"I had to watch this movie for a class and I have to say it was totally worth it.

Reminiscent of the \\"For Dummies\\" series, this book is valuable for beginning users of the program as well as being useful for intermediates. Garrigus is a knowledgable writer, and has written articles for most of the well-known music magazines, including Electronic Musician and Keyboard. His style is intelligent, witty and eminently readable. Most of all, the information contained in the book is very up-to-date (as of June 2000), and he gives you full info on staying up on the latest program updates.

The problem with this book is, the questions are not the type of questions your going to ask someone unless you need a lot of help using your computer. But that's not the biggest problem I have with the book. The Major Disappointment with this book is 75% of the book is Fiction. The book is written with the Author receiving calls on a Fictitious TV Talk show. Ultimatly I was expecting it to be like a VB6 FAQ, but it in no way resembles that. This Book gets Zero Stars!

This album just proves that he can do much more than just act. It's hard to believe that so many people in America have overlooked Hasselhoff's musical talents. Probably the most exciting track on this album is the Night Rocker [Extended Blaster-Mix]. The first time I heard this song I fell in love with it. I probably played it 20 times over and over again. I just close my eyes and dream of being behind the wheels of KITT from the TV show Knight Rider. I can smell burning rubber with the wind blowing in my 80's feathered chest hair while gently touching the turbo boost.

The first track, 'Night Rocker', is a fantastic opener and will have you rocking around the living room whilst pretending to play guitar and flex your pecks.

I've got to make an exception for Dwight Trible. With an Andy Bey-ish delivery and extraordinary vocal control, Trible, sporting a rich baritone, is the real deal. Combine his rare vocal talent with very tasty and understated instrumental accompaniment, and you have a disc to be contended with.If you're like me and don't particularly like jazz vocal, I suggest you think of his voice as an instrument of uncommon emotional range and precision, not paying attention to the lyrics, which, though serviceable, seldom reach anything approaching profundity. If you are predisposed to vocal jazz, you will hardly find a more accomplished singer than Dwight Trible.

I don't even want to finish the book. The book annoys me to no end. Servants will really stay on with no pay out of loyalty? They allow the spoiled boy rule the roost? Has the author no imagination to think of a better plot? I wish I had never bought the trilogy based on reading a couple of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely AWFUL!","review":"I've read a lot of Philippa Gregory and always wonder afterward why I do. \\"The Favored Child\\" is just awful! It's dark, depressing, incestual, demeaning, violent, abusive to animals as well as people, and just plain terrible. Do NOT waste your time or money. Luckily I got this at our library, but plan to put the same review on their website. Read Karen Harper for really GOOD historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Miserable","review":"This book did not live up to Gregory's later book, Meridon. I don't know about Wideacre because I haven't read it yet but reading The Favored Child made me not want to go back to the first book.Julia is just an idiot. I felt really bad for her but she kind of just screwed herself over throughout the entire story. And nothing good ever came out of all of her struggles.It left me with a really disturbed, and unsatisfied feeling. I do not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Julia is a wimp","review":"This book made me angry. Very angry. I don't like people who let themselves be victimized and thats exactly what Miss Julia did. After the rather incestuous first book, this book was just another disappointment. I had had high hopes for this trilogy. Happily, though, the third and final book, Meridon, has a genuine, strong female lead instead of either a crazy, plotting witch, or a pathetic, weak country miss. Jst skip this one and read Meridon."},{"rating":"1","title":"unlikable","review":"The one fatal flaw in this book is its characters, ecspecially richard. What drove me to hate the novel was that the one bad guy, who i hated from the very first pages of the book, consistently got away with his evil deeds without being punished or killed until the end. I don't mind telling this audience that he dies...all though potentially good the author made me hate it. In my opinion an author is able to make the reader dislike a character for a short period of time, but for a novel as long as this one, a character cannot be despised as much as richard is for the whole novel without driving the reader insane, and as in my case does not drive the reader to totally and utterly disliking the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I suppose that if you read this book by itself, it would be tolerable, but after reading Wideacre, it only seemed like a weak echo, the same story being played out yet again at Wideacre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Read everything Phillipa Gregory writes - Book was the second of three in a triology that began with Wideacre - Book was excellent - (and I thought I already wrote a review on this book!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THIS AUTHOR BEFORE SHE WRITES AGAIN!","review":"I swear, I just can't stand it. I read \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" and really liked it a lot -- I was so pleased to find Philippa Gregory and looked forward to reading all her books.But I just tried to read \\"The Little House: A Novel\\" (read 1/3 of it) and then THIS stinker (read the first 30 pages) and I have decided that P. Gregory just got lucky when she wrote her historical fiction about Anne Boleyn.The plot of \\"The Favored Child\\" is unbelievably trite and ridiculous. The characters seem to have been kidnapped from a Victoria Holt novel (gag). The dialogue is stilted and goofy. My only wish is that I could give this zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Author Read Too Many Romance Novels","review":"I read the Wildacre trilogy and was very disturbed by the sexual content and discriptions. You NEVER see this in other books depicting this era - except in trashy romance novels. If you want to read classy historical novels try Taylor Caldwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictively Infuriating!!!","review":"I have become a fast fan of Philippa Gregory, starting first with The Other Boleyn Girl before beginning the Wideacre trilogy. I cannot put them down. In this second work I find myself sad for Julia Lacey but infuriated with her at the same time. I want to jump into the book and strangle her for her stupidity and weakness but then check myself on the time which her character lives. You cannot help but pity little Julia and hope that she will summon the strength of her mama/aunt Beatrice, the Wideacre witch, and break from the intolerably cruel rule of her cousin/brother/husband Richard and give him his just desserts. I cannot wait to learn how it all ends. This trilogy makes great summer reading. A MUST READ!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"Unfortunately for me in this case, I am unable to put a book down once I start it. I grabbed this book quickly in an airport bookstore, because it was a long flight and I liked \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\". Once I was about halfway through the book and flight, I realized what a mistake it t was. A previous reviewer compared this series to V.C. Andrews, and while I didn't pollute my mind with reading either of the other books in this trilogy, I was forcibly reminded of reading \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" as a youngster by this book. Being a tiny bit familiar with English mythology, I could see the denouement coming from a hundred pages away, but thought that it would be too trite for Gregory to actually use such an obvious plot device. Use it she did.I found this book to be misogynistic, and even worse-annoying. I was mad at myself for having read it, and mad at Gregory for writing it. I threw this book away rather than chance anyone else picking it up at a used book store or library."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLECH!!!","review":"It's bad.It's painful to read.I think Gregory enjoys torturing her characters a little TOO much.I read pretty well until about page 450 or so, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I skimmed the rest. I HAD to see what happened but I didn't want to actually READ it."},{"rating":"1","title":"She loved him??????","review":"I bought this book because I had read and enjoyed some of Phillipa Gregory's historical novels. This one did not fill the bill for me. As a supposedly independent-thinking woman of spirit, I found Julia to be incredibly naive. Love is not an emotion that any female could possibly feel after being raped - especially after suffering abuse since childhood at the hands of her brother / playmate / husband. I found her characters to be either psychotic or dazed by all that laudunam (sp) they took. After reading THE FAVORED CHILD, I have no desire to read the first or the third in this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sequel to Wideacre lives up to its predecessor...","review":"The Favored Child - the second novel in Philippa Gregory's Wideacre trilogy - is just as good as its predecessor, if not better. The book opens when its narrator, Julia Lacey is twelve. Julia wants more than anything else to be an ordinary girl - yet she is haunted by shadows of the violent past that haunts her homeland, Wideacre. This novel reintroduces readers to the world of passionate and madness that is the Lacey homestead. Characters from the first novel come back (which will delight any reader of the first book) and the theme of history repeating itself is introduced more than once... and in more than one way... For any reader who loves compelling stories - especially historical fiction - this is the book for you! Impassioned, sensual, entracing... it will keep you hooked til the last page... and doubtless send you running to by the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another terrific read","review":"I couldn't wait to begin this book after finishing Wideacre. Iwas not disappointed. This book was as enjoyable and engrossingas the first book in the triology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst book so far!!","review":"Have read Gregory for years. This is by far the worst one by her. The climax was vile in nature, not to mention the hard to swallow reading of Julia's abuse, time and time again. After reading the ending, not only would you want to slap her silly, you'd want throw her off a river too!.This is definitely one book that I would not recommend reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favored Child Review","review":"I enjoyed the second book in Phillipa Gregory's trilogy immensely and couldn't wait to start the final book in the trilogy which I have now started. I have loved all of the books that I have read by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating","review":"Sequel to Wideacre, following the exploits of the wee baby children introduced at the end of that book. It continues fully in the train wreck fashion of its predecessor in a \\"Dear God, can they get anymore inbred? DON'T ANSWER THAT!\\" fashion. Seriously. I thought Wideacre was twisted. This is worse because you see the hope and an actual, plausible way out of the madness, AND IT GETS THROWN AWAY! And I gape and shriek and wail and gnash my teeth because, seriously, how stupid can you be?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Annoying","review":"I'm not one to place a book down, especially after reading more than half of it. But after reading page after page, waiting for this intelligent yet ridiculously stupid girl to wake up and realize what's going on, it's a bit annoying. Save yourself and don't even START the series. It kind of sucks you in, making you read all the novels even though you know you'll regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"thoroughly hated this book","review":"I have to say I couldnt finish this book, mostly because i threw it across the room a few too many times. The abuse and willingness to take the abuse the heroine endures is not only impossible to read, you cant even feel sympathy for her anymore. I'm insulted as a human that an author would think i would enjoy reading about a character who is so spineless and stupid as to let herself be treated this way. It is well written, but you will hate the 2 main characters. Its hard to empathize with a heroine who cant stand on her own 2 feet and get a life, and a villain who has no depth or subtlety to him whatsoever. I will say I loved the queens fool and the other boleyn girl, that is why i picked up this book, so beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving and Hating","review":"This book has many twists and turns in the book. There is a lot of irony and sinful secrets. It has a great plot although Richard, the male antagonist of the book, was so hateful and evil. I really despised how he treated and stole away Julia's life. He toyed with her feelings and destroyed everything she worked for. Julia has a lot of flaws, but in the end she always wanted to make everything right. Personally, this book made me cry and felt miserable but at the same time loved the book.If you love English history, and the difference between social class, I assure you that you would find this a unique and hard-to-put down novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fine scholarly biographical survey of the man who created the widely known Pulitzer Prize","review":"No Ordinary Joe: A Life Of Joseph Pulitzer III provides a very fine scholarly biographical survey of the man who created the widely known Pulitzer Prize.

Those older versions are probably still in use somewhere; if you have administer such an outdated network, this is difinitely the book to get. It also includes two 3.5-inch micro floppy companion diskettes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely Read","review":"A well paced and interesting read. Conquerors Road is a gripping journey through events at the end of WW2. Importantly, many facets of war journalism are discussed, and this is extremely pertinent in the current political climate. To the younger reader such as myself it gives a great impression and sense of the time and events of WW2, and with this the reader can get a good perspective on the recent events in Iraq and especially issues around their reportage.I really liked the flow of the book, which is understated and progressive - it was difficult to put down. The events unfold naturally, and the distance between 1945 and the present is greatly reduced.There are some strong descriptions about conditions and the depravity which occured in the war, and these have a lasting impact. The book is an effective window to the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is very impressive...","review":"I first heard \\"Collective Heart\\" on a local radio station one evening driving home from a friend's house. I thought I was hearing a strange new Kate Bush song but something told me it wasn't quite my beloved Kate...but very close! I loved the track instantly and bought the CD as soon as I could find it. (her work is difficult to find...)I think \\"Down, Down\\" is one of my favorites. My imagination goes on a strange course when I hear it and I start to coreograph dance to it(and I'm not even a dancer!)It's colored blue.Her music is very dreamy. It transports me. The lyrics are very intelligent and poetic. She influences me to sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO talented","review":"It is amazing that Happy is not more popular by now. Everyone I have played this CD for loves her voice, she has an amazing range. A true artist who writes her on material and self produces as well. A lot of talented musicians also worked with her here, brilliant instrumentation. If you like the sound of this one, try Equipoise and Warpaint as they have a lot of similarities. If you go further back the CD's get a little simpler, more acoustic and a little darker.

Will Smith is a legend and I have been looking for this CD for 10 years, but never thought I could get it on Amazon. I will treasure it forever, my favourite music of all time. It is so cool, sexy and you can actually hear the words he sings, unlike other artists. Men in Black is a supreme example of what high end music should be, you can dance and listen, the real people would relate to it, I am sure. He is a true star and an amazingly talented vocalist."},{"rating":"2","title":"First-rate rapper, but disappointing production","review":"One of the most successful and, more importantly, lyrically respectable rappers, the multi-faceted career of Will Smith should understandably make a lot of other rappers jealous. As the \\"Fresh Prince\\" half of DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince, he rapped his way to one of the definitive summer anthems in history, the aptly-titled \\"Summertime\\". Unfortunately, like many other rappers, both talented and not-so-talented, he has a fairly intense craving for samples, and to that end, he uses too many great songs that were just fine as they were, and makes no effort at all to hide that fact. On \\"Men In Black\\" which borrows from the classic Patrice Rushen hit \\"Forget Me Nots\\", he even has Cheryl \\"Coko\\" Gamble of SWV singing to the tune of it in a very Rushen-esque voice. As I said before, though, I do have high regard for his rapping ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da Best","review":"Will has always done a good job acting, but singing is his best talent by far.

Oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for you, and tasty too!","review":"When I first picked up the book and read the description, I confess I had some trepidation that this would be a book that was going to be \\"good for me,\\" much like raw carrots. Much to my delight, Song of the Crow was as shameless a page-turner as a Michael Connelly mystery, and as intricately constructed as a Napolean pastry. Yes, it's good for you, too. The prose on virtually every page could qualify as poetry; there are images that have not yet left me since I finished reading the book. But the literary conceit of having a crow as narrator, which I initially thought would be clunky and false, manages to feel seamless and true. The narrator crow and his family are as three-dimensional characters as any human could be, maybe more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good live band","review":"Haven't listened to the CD yet, but I've seen these guys in concert around Cleveland.

To really appreciate the sutras, one has to practice Yoga assiduously. Each time you read the book, you feel that you are peeling away one layer of meaning to discover another one.From the way B.K.S.

I have a whole new respect for Patanjali's genius and his audacious adventures into the spiritual dimension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well intentioned","review":"Mr. Iyengar's translation and commentary on the Sutras is heavilly weighted and biased by his lifetime focus on hatha yoga. As a result, his commentary has neither the completenes of Satchidananda's \\"Yoga Sutras\\" nor the insightfulness of McAfee's \\"Beyond the Siddhis\\". But it does shed a different light on the sutras that can be appreciated by most of his yoga followers.Barring his leaning toward arcane yogic language, the book is well written and easy to read.

Towards the end it kind of jump to excitment but that's the only reason I give it a won because it starts to have some stuff that gets you interesting in the book. Brennon goes off and sleeps away from he people he was camping with and walks up sleeping on Coyote Run's skull.

At the end he finally learns to break free from others' expectations, and his own inner demons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I thought that \\"Rumble Fish\\" was okay. It had some exciting parts, but not a very good storyline. I think that S.E.Hinton is a great author, but this wasn't her best work. I thought this book would be more like \\"The Outsiders\\", in the elements of many plot twists, and the brotherly love that was clearly shown in outsiders, but Rumble Fish just didn't have it. It's about a fourteen year old kid who looks up to his big brother, but his brother barely notices him. They live with his alcoholic father, and the Motorcycle Boy always leaves. However, they never say why Motorcyles Boy takes off. It wasn't a bad book, I finished it in a day, but that was mainly because I kept thinking, just a little more and it'll get better. Well, some people might like it, but I don't recommend it; it depressed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rumble Fish","review":"Ages 12 and up. Rumble Fish, by S.E. Hinton is one of the greatest books you'll ever read. Rumble Fish contains the main character of Rusty-James. The story is told through his eyes and through his point of view. This book has many details that you will find interesting and that will leave you into reading more of S.E. Hinton's books. Rusty's rolemodel the motorcycle boy had left, he then realizes that he had came but, this was during a fight. Rusty, the motorcycle boy and Steve go on a day drinking, but there is more than meets the eye because as soon as the motorcycle boy leaves, Steve and Rusty get into trouble. Throughout the book your will encounter themes but one and the most important theme in the book is helpness. All of S.E. Hinton's books will surprise you, therefore you should like this book; I know I did. It was a very interesting book to read because S.E. Hinton writes a creative book just like Rumble Fish.

I read Taming the Star Runner, and I was disapointed by this- Hinton did not do well. The ending was not a surprise at all.

Do yourself a favor and just don't read this book- save yourself the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"desperate reading","review":"The worst S.E Hinton book ever. I felt more compassion for Freddy vs. Jason then i did for the characters in this book. Motorcycle boy was a spokesmen for medication. His bipolar gave a new divination of metal illness.

I thought the photography was down by spike the rugrats dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book wasn't that great","review":"I don't think the book was that great because it was really slow and unexciting.

That is my reveiw with Rumble Fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"Honestly, I hated this book. This book had no perpose at all.The plot went no were,and even if it had, I doubt I would have cared. Rusty-James, Motorcycle boy, and Steve have no depth,you don't see them as any more than this: A dumb gang leader wanna be,a motorcycle stealing drifter/loser,and a scardy cat. The book caught my interest in the beganing chapters,but later on became hopelessly dull. I read this book hoping it would be as engrossing as \\"That Was Then, This is Now\\",and was endlessly disapointed.

Hinton's most touching story is Rumble Fish. It is about a teenage boy named Rusty-James who is living the glory days where gangs were organized, and there were Rumbles everyday or so.(rumble is a gang fight).He wants to live up to his brother's street fighting and being the most respected dude in the city. But what Rusy-James doesn't know is that his brother is not what people think say he is. For example, Motor Cycle Boy appears to be tough, but he really is not a tough guy. Rusty-James sees a sensitive, caring brother trying to live a tough life. However, Rusty realizes his brother's true nature only after tragedy.Rumble Fish is one of Hinton's best novels, and the movie is outstanding. I recommend the book because the life depicted in the story is just as pertinent today as in the 70s when Hinton wrote the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Aire Christmas","review":"The Mannheim Steamroller Christmas CDs are almost the only ones we listen to.

John Smiley's unique and different approach is a easy method to learn by and to keep your interest. My only dissapointment is the lack of information on the ADO control, where he sticks primarily to the DAO control for database programing. Just so you won't be disappointed you should be aware of this situation. This is a factor in using Access 2000 databases which would have to be saved a version that the DAO control can recognize. I suppose there will always be changes and updates. I believe John's Web Site will be posting information on the ADO control soon.

For example, \\"Why do you call it the default?\\" Barbara asked. \\"Well, I said, \\"this is the appearance of the toolbox.\\" It takes a lot of thought processing just to figure out who is talking and the \\"I said\\" gets extremely annoying after awhile to the point where you just can't stand reading it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic but educational","review":"While I learned a fair bit from this book the writing style was contained too much non-value-add dialog. The book could have easily been 30% shorter or contained a meaningful discussion of ADO.I paused before continuing and took a drink of water.Regardless, I would recommend it to someone who was seeking an orientation to database programming in Visual Basic and had little or no programming background. If you have a programming background or are seeking sufficent depth of knowledge to write professional code this is probably not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Beginners or 'Teach Yourself-ers'","review":"After getting my feet wet with John Smileys 'Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6' I very much wanted more. 'Learn to Program Visual Basic Databases' was the most logical choice. It continues a project started in the VB6 book so there is a nice continuity right away. On the surface it may seem a bit wordy since it is based around John Smiley teaching a ficitional class. The whole point of buying ANY Visual Basic book, to me at least, is to actually LEARN Visual Basic. We can't all afford or have the time to take Visual Basic classes at the local college or online. If you want to learn Visual Basic on your own time and feel confident about what you are doing I would recommend any of John Smiley's books. You can always get more advanced books later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing You Can't Do","review":"John Smiley has a writing and teaching style that continues to keep the readers attention and explain in detail what it is that you are doing.

It's awesome. Why? Because implementing database access (SQL and such) within your program gives you so much more to work with. Only drawback was Access2000 and DAO. Whole book is on that and it doesn't workout without some tweaks. Thankfully, John has posted solutions on his website. I also learned so much in the first 3 chapters about DAO that I just decided to do ADO anyway and it isn't much different. He does such a good job on DAO that ADO seems easy to implement. Maybe a second edition would be in order. Great work, awesome teacher and I can't thank him enough for his brilliant works. Truly a book that is useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn to Program Visual Basic Databases","review":"John Smiley's book is supposed to be an introductory level book for novice level programmers. At the time it was written, I'm sure it was. However, the book is written around Access 97 and a lot has changed since then. The code simply will not work without patches, work arounds and lots of digging. It takes far more than a novice programmer to figure this one out. It defeats the purpose. If you don't like frustration, find a more recent book.."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent guide to the novice database programmer","review":"John Smiley is the quintessential teacher for novice VB programmers, and this book takes you to the next level. Many VB books and classes for beginners barely touch on databases. \\"Learn to Program Databases With Visual Basic\\" will give the background information, and some practical experience, through the lab exercises, to be a complete VB developer.

I recommend reading John Smileys \\"Learn to Program in Visual Basic\\" book first since this book starts were his first book left off.

I guess you could say it is mentioned when he states that he won't be using ADO in this book, rather the older technology of DAO. It looks like a good book for beginning VB6 using DAO, but that isn't what I was looking for.Don't buy this book if you want to learn ADO techniques in VB6. I haven't yet found a good \\"BEGINNING\\" book for ADO in VB6 but I am trying out \\"Beginning Visual Basic 6 Database Programming\\" from WROX.

The war was very cruel, and many things that happened were not good, but our men were fighting for the freedom of men--not just the Vietnamese, but the whole free world that was being threatened by Communism. I think that the way our soldiers were treated coming back was disgraceful, and I'm thankful for a movie like this that actually portrays them as the heroes they are.

Nothing about this film is accurate to the vietnam war. This movie should make every vietnam veteran want to jump out the window!!!! If you know anything about this war you should be laughing to tears during this movie...... its pathetic that they even made this into a dvd... NOT WORTH BUYING AT ALL... i think that the only hollywood vietnam movie that isn't a total embarassment would be GO TELL THE SPARTANS... Green Berets is trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic of American Right Wing Propaganda","review":"Words cannot adequately describe the depths of moral and political depravity to which this film goes in its attempt to re-write the shameful history of our entanglement in Vietnam. Its simplistic, reactionary sanctimony, trite cowboy dialog and racist portrayals of Vietnamese characters could almost be regarded as camp if this worthless piece of celluloid did not also have a darker purpose--the glorification and promotion of an unjust war in which America had no business being involved.If you want the real story of what happened in Vietnam, read \\"The Winter Soldier Investigation\\", published in 1971 by the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. In it you'll read true accounts, by soldiers who were there, of atrocities committed by American troops in the name of \\"freedom\\". They set the record straight. This film deserves to be roundly condemned for its defense of our role in the Vietman War.

It was lambasted by critics, but in a very interesting sign, sold out at the box office. It plays today and while it is heavy-handed, there is little about it that rings untrue. The soldiers do not swear, complain or bastardize their uniforms like the actual guys did, but their patriotism and military professionalism was the real deal. The Communists they fight in the film are shifty little pissants.

North Carolina topography, obviously hosed-in water, rigid filming, poor acting (anybody remotely Asian-looking will do for a Vietnamese), and dialogue that I have heard 1000 times, and pretty lame action.People just need to honest that this film lacks redeeming qualities, its interesting as a period piece, but couldn't we be using this printing material to reproduce a better movie?

The film has a lot of wrinkles, in plot, dialoug and special effects, but its got a big heart and displays a deep appreciation for American's soldiers, a genuine concern for the people of South Vietnam, and an unflappable love for freedom. Call it corny, right-wing, old fashioned, cliche or any other liberal bromide you can conjure up, the simple fact remains that people will be watching and enjoying this film for a long time because... (a) it stars John Wayne and (b) its a reminder that not everyone in the U.S. was a flag-burning war protester during Vietnam; a false image that today's liberal baby-boomers have been screeching for far too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally funny, with one great battle scene","review":"This may be the goofiest war movie ever made, an attempt to do a WWII-style flag waver smack in the middle of the Vietnam War. Simplistic and cliched beyond words, badly directed and acted, the central part of the picture is, nevertheless, worth the price of admission. A long, sustained night attack on a firebase is memorably staged and shot. Seems a little clunky now, but no one had ever seen anything like this when the movie came out. The rest is laughable, especially the mistakes: Wayne parachuting out of plane without hooking up; smashing what is obviously a Mattel toy M-16 against a tree (see the curved \\"magazine\\"?); and, of course, the classic ending where the Sun sets in the East."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vietnam movie for the whole family","review":"Something for everybody, not too bloody & the language not very offensive.This is a DVD that you turn over & play both sides, which wasn't very well marked.

For example, Wayne repeatedly uses his rifle to gesture toward someone, a flagrant mistake that a recruit with one week of training would not make.

THE GREEN BERETS (which takes many liberties with the superior novel) is Vietnam as it should have been (in the eyes of the pro-war hawks) but in retrospect, it appears to depict some alternate dimension. The conflict is broken down into simple black and white terms. Godly Americans helping their Godly Freedom Loving South Vietnamese defend their freedom against the Evil Atheistic Communist North Vietnamese.Unfortunately, the anti-war films that followed it also seemed to take place in some alternate dimension. Evil Imperialist Americans deliberately napalm-bombing the Poor Vietnamese Peasants while American Boys got Killed in Large Quantities For Nothing.Fellow Americans, lets encourage Hollywood to at least once, try and depict the conflict in Indo-China as it really was."},{"rating":"2","title":"The green berets is a masterpiece","review":"The green berets showed the way that things really were during vietnam.

Although it tends to favor the PC in its diagrams (I run on a new iMac under OS 9.2.2), with a little imagination you figure things out rather quickly.Often times the explanations of functions are a bit winded and made to seem much more complicated than they are. (For example explaining every tool in the different Tool Bars...the Eraser is for to erase...) However, the book does go in to detail about the heavier side of Cubase-the more advanced \\"stuff\\". It is a great supplement to have along with the Cubase manual, and far easier a read than megabytes of PDF file."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for More","review":"I bought this book hoping to find some interesting tips and insights into the use of Cubase, i.e.,things not clearly explained or missing from the Cubase documentation.

Walter overshadows Bogie as Howard, the grizzled and wise old prospector. Former cowboy star Tim Holt provides solid support for both men. The movie is notable for John Huston's use of veteran Mexican actors who speak (and carry) the film in their own language with no subtitles whatsoever needed to understand the proceedings.

The blu-ray version of Treasure of the Sierra Madre is excellent. Details are crisp, and the contrast is strong. There are about half a dozen moments scattered throughout the film where the quality goes bad, looking like an unconverted DVD. But these only last for a few seconds each. Apparently, they did not have good source material for those few scenes. Otherwise, I was quite pleased. The sound is okay, but not great. Dialogue is fine, but the soundtrack hisses a bit, and the punches in a couple of fight scenes sound very weak. Apart from these quibbles, this version is well worth owning.

His portrayal of the wise old prospector is SO OUTSTANDING!! A performance which earned a much deserved Oscar.Of course we all know Bogart's work but I've always thought this is his best movie as well as Tim Holt who did a LOT of westerns (some OK some not so much) but brilliant in this movie.All three give their best performances in this picture which is basically a tale of three prospectors who get lucky and then fate and greed intervene. Absolutely brilliant acting by this trio.The story itself has a good moral and shows us how man reacts to fortune and fate in a realistic and believable way. The music is outstanding as well. It is a bit predictable at points and may have left a few too many scenes on the cutting room floor, but it is a solid and entertaining classic film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Taking a Bus Trip with Someone who Smells","review":"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. The dialogue is inane, the acting wooden. This is just a lumbering, poorly photographed piece of derivative drivel, full of grunting extras scampering around in animal pelts and more dank, trash-strewn sets than I ever care to see again. Humphrey Bogart overacts, and this is an understatement. He chews up so much scenery he probally got indigestion when filming was done.

But thats my opinion but am more into rpgs, sports, and action&adv., games am not all into man to man combat."},{"rating":"2","title":"13 more days for DBZ b2","review":"This game is so going to rock!! It has all new characters from the buu saga and their will be fusion(cooool) But I was mad when I found out that story mode was taken out but i'm sure that you all know that. If you don't know you have to round up a team of three characters and you find the dragon balls but it is harder than that you have to fight the others in order to get the dragonball.My favorit thing is now when someone fires a death shot like a super kaamaahaamaa wave now you can shoot it back at them by rotating the analog stick but you still can't fly at freewill. also you have to train under Master Roshi to try to defeat the Red Ribbon Army then move on to King picclo you can fuss any two charaters I want too see Cell and Freeza there will be some new charaers like Trunks Goten u know. \\"ALL OF YOU PEPOLE THAT BE HATING ON THIS GAME YALL JUST DON'T KNOW\\"may the bantha share peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fighting Game","review":"Well while budokai 1 had its draw backs, number 2 will blow it away.

If you watch the videos of www.ign.com you will see you have to push some buttons, You dont have to push all of them to get a fusion, EXAMPLE: Lets say i push Square, Circle, Triangle and Right i might get Gokule (Goku+Hercule=Gokule) or if i push something different i might get Vegetto (Goku+Vegeta=Vegetto). Sadly story mode is removed... But we got Dragon Mode this is how dragon mode works, Lets say i pick Vegeta and i have to fight Raditz (Either for a dragonball or elimination) Before i fight Raditz, on the map below Raditz's face it will show a circle that means i have to beat him once. Now if i fight Kid Buu then i might have to beat him 6 or 7 times. The controls are the same, so know need to flip through the instructions!

So what if they dropped story mode, dragon world is way cooler. You get to choose from 29 characters not including fusions. The fusions are Vegito, Gotenks, Gokule, Tiencha, And last but not least (drum roll please) Kibitoshin. There's also a new mode called Babidi's spaceship.

Noteable mentions include: Chocolate Factory, Heart of a Woman, I'll Never Leave, You Made Me Love You, Forever, Ignition Remix and Snake. I have to admit that before I bought the CD I thought that Kelly might be too busy handling his legal business to really do his thing on this album....but I was wrong. He seems to have really tapped into his passion on this piece.

It was even used as an unnamed sample in an essay stating the problem with small publishers and first time novelists. Paul Lonardo has talent, no doubt there, but it's raw and needs refining. This book should've been left in the fabled writer's trunk as a learning experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong first novel!","review":"A very fine first novel for Paul Lornado. This novel is rich in characters and has a strong plot. The twist and turns of the storyline make for a page turner. The struggles in Caldera are our struggles.

But, I figured I'd give it a try. After finally getting a copy of the book, I had a difficult time putting it down. The story flows along easily, yet holds the readers interest. You think you know what's coming next, but that's where you get fooled. There are just enough surprises throughout the book to keep it interesting, but yet not confuse the reader. And believe me, when you're just about finished with the book, and you think you know the ending, be prepared to be surprised. For a young, new writer, Mr. Lonardo has done a wonderful job.

That's not only dumb and unsubstantiated, but it's offensive, as well. Then she starts talking about several gawds and out-of-body experiences. At that point, she just starts sounding like a creepy nut ball.

How could someone as open minded as Huffington be so judmental and discrimintory against athiests? I was shocked, her point being that an athiests life will never mean anything without belief in a higher being. The quotations are so upsetting and damning to athiests that she sounds so much like the evangalicals she detests than they do!! She is practicing the discrimnation she so passionatly fights against. I believe she is the one is who full of fear, the fear that maybe there is a possibility that God does not exist. This chapter completely negates the book and its message.

She apparently feels it is an \\"us against them\\" world with respect to men and women and most of her advice is geared towards overcoming gender bias. In some ways, it felt like I was being lectured about life on my grandmother's sofa and I'm guessing that is because she meant it as a bit of a legacy for her two daughters. Ms. Huffington has a big chip on her shoulder with regard to organized religion, her political rivals, and men in general.

He assured me that maybe 1 in 200 caps had a problem. He then added that the 10509 cap was being re-designed and the new version would be available in maybe 6 months. Based on the current problems with gas prices, theft (siphoning), and his statement that \\"1 in 200\\" had a problem, I bought one. TRUST ME .. It doesn't work at all!!! Called him again today and explained the problem. His response was \\"I told you we were re-designing it and you went out and bought one anyway?!\\" Now, if they knew the thing didn't work, why are they still selling it??? I'm out $22.00.

However, I found out that the cap will come loose and can be removed with just a little bit of jiggling, even after turning it clockwise several clicks to tighten and lock it. The loose-fitting cap caused my check engine light to come on. I had to reinstall the factory (non-locking)gas cap to get the light to go out.

That said, I'll only touch on three points others haven't. (1) There are some instances of period humor that are interesting; most show the negative foundation of so much humor. (2) The movie portrays both sides of period bigotry - Grannie's comments about Hoosiers and other groups are hilarious at first, until you realize what she's saying - what she has said - about people who are basically nothing more foreign than next-door neighbors. (3) Several instances of an older gunfighter teaching a younger, or gunfighters who are peers, discussing professional technique, constitute an unusual feature of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my go to movie","review":"I have always loved the Outlaw Josey Wales, his role in this movie made me feel good.

I read the book gone to Texas and I happened to know how his life went from bad to good again. That's why he is my go to feel good movie. He has a small sense of humor and my son and favorite part in the movie is; \\"Buzzards gotta eat, same as worms!\\" I just love him. He leaves us with lines that we remember always.

With fantastic cinematography, writing, and marvelous actors, you will not be disappointed with the story as well as the comic relief between Josey and Lon Watie. My favorite part is the sobering dialogue between Chief Ten Bears and Josey Wales near the end where they meet at the Comanche camp. This discussion between potential enemies is marvelous and the actors display their craft so convincingly in making this not just a talk on horse back but conveying messages about life that anyone can understand. This is truely a classic western but even more so a classic drama which highlights a great ensemble cast. This is a film that has revenge, love, hardship, and peace all encompassing a great 2 hours.

Eastwood once again establishes himself as one of the best actor/director in the Western genre. He has told a story about men trying to live together even though their ideas and values are completly different. Also the film is about what happens when these men come to blows over their respective differences. The film is about how one innocent person gets caught up in the fight and losses everything that is dear to him. Now he has to avenge the ones he lost. This is better that The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, but not as good as Unforgiven.

There is also the quintessential Eastwood attention to detail for informed nitpickers. One of the few Westerns that shows how the Civil War and its aftermath helped to set up tensions in the Old West. Chief Dan George nearly steals the picture as Josey's sometimes guide / sometimes charge. One of the few Western pics where cap and ball shooters like myself can see their type weapons in use. Very sympathetic and multi-dimensional characters with native Americans played as fully realized people and with dignity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Nice Surprise","review":"This was one of those movies I added to my cart just to meet the 25-dollar limit so I could get free shipping. I've never been a huge Clint Eastwood fan, at least as far his directing is concerned. Certainly not a bad filmmaker, but nothing truly exceptional in my view. This movie however, was quite a surprise! I don't know exactly why I like it so much, but I can honestly say I was caught off guard. It has the darkness and grit of \\"Unforgiven\\", but still maintains the charm and sweetness of the old classics like \\"The Searchers\\" and \\"Rio Bravo\\".

In this story, Eastwood is a man fighting a lost cause against an unbeatable foe intent on his demise. It is him against the world. The individual raging against leviathon to the very end. In the end, perhaps too late, the fighting must end and he must make peace with his past and himself. Interspersed through the story is a light love interest (not the sappy near-X-rated lust of most modern movies) and some great humor one-liners, \\"Hows it work on tobacco stains?\\", that will keep you laughing despite the sad tale. For historical accuracy on the Missouri guerrilla war with a great plot as well, also watch Ang Lee's underappreciated \\"Ride With the Devil.\\" But for the classic Eastwood action-adventure, you will want your own copy of Josey Wales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 10 stars!","review":"What can you say about Clint Eastwood's westerns except, great!

Chief Dan George is the sole redeeming factor for TOJW. HIS performance makes this movie worth watching now and again, but as a whole, this movie is only worth 1 viewing. By the way, Philip Kaufman(sp?) started out directing this movie, until Clint decided he wasn't cutting it, and literally took control. From that moment forward, Hollywood adopted 'The Eastwood Director Rule', specifically: \\"That no member of the set or crew may replace a director once that director has already been put in place\\".

This initially put me off a little, having been weened on other self-teaching motifs. However after the 3rd Chapter I actually recognized myself as learning the topic and retaining the concepts. I plan on buying some of his other VB6 books, if only to see if I can mine knowledge there that I have been unable to in other VB books. I do recommend this book, as it broaches fairly new and deep VB6 programming concepts/topics in a friendly and non-threatening manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visual Basic Objects Mysteries Unveiled!","review":"Well, he has done it again. Took a confusing concept and make it seem like child's play. Objects can be scarry for beginners. But John has shown how it needn't be. He unveils practical uses and needs for Objects and how they can provide efficient, clean programming.This book shall remain a reference book forever in my library. He makes so much sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish","review":"I really do not care for the style of this book. In a VB book I do not give a hoot about how cold it is in the morning or that \\"we\\" had to wait for class to start because another student couldn't start his car. I found myself irritated that some of Professor Smiley's good ideas were lost in setting the scene or character development. If I want to read a novel, I will buy a novel. When I read a \\"Technical Manual\\" get excited enough by new ideas that I don't need to be amused by witty banter. I would recommend this book ONLY if you have not read any technical book or you need to be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish Moby Dick, either...","review":"Anyone who has tried it knows that that book is wordy- and so is this one. The author uses a fictional programming class to set the stage for what he is trying to teach- with fictional students, and lots of fictional dialogue, as well. This results in a very LONG read for little information. I just couldn't get through it, a shame, because the guy probably knows what he is talking about.I prefer a text that you can get the information without trudging through lots of extra garbage. Smiley's style of writing is not for me. 2 stars is generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable indie...","review":"Great soundtrack and photography. London as you don't always see it.

We watched it with my younger brother on our pull out couch and to a couple of 8 year olds, it was terrifying! I can understand why so many adults will not appreciate this movie for its scare factor, but I purchased it based on my childhood memories and hope to create some of those memories with my own daughter. Not to make a tired cliche, but they really don't make movies like they used to, especially horror movies.

It is understated--not over the top gory. It has a vaguely familiar premise; however, the acting is solid and the mystery is well-handled. This is an okay film for older pre-teens. Little ones (under 12) may be bothered by the hints of violence and terror. It is a good soild film.

I bought it hoping it was the original version of the film (which would rate about 4 stars) but it wasn't and I would like my money back! Why Laloggia felt that the first, more sublter version needed to be re-done is beyond me. This cut basically hits you over the head with the \\"pc\\" added stuff about the black janitor at the school. The movie is no longer a tight little horror movie but is trying to be something akin to \\"to kill a mockingbird\\" which it ain't! Too bad directors are ever allowed to touch their movies more than once (yikes! Spielberg!!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gem","review":"Every once and a while you find a little film that never got much mention and you fall in love with it. This is one of those films. There is a great sense of nostelgia in this film which adds to its charm. Writer/Director LaLoggia put a lot of his heart into this very personal film. This turned out to be his masterpiece and it was a shame he did not stay in the film business with his talent (he made only 3 or 4 films total in his career, this was his second film). Here is a great mix of drama, suspence, mystery, and horror. It's kind of a ghost story and kind of a coming of age story. Looking at it now years after first seeing I still get a tear in the eye and lump in the throat, and I still get exhilerated by a couple classic horror scenes. Do youself a favour and see this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"lady in whit","review":"This movie has lots of little things to overlook but it is my favorite ghost story movie.

This is just a book. It will be okay. John Peel did his best to sort out a VERY confusing history spanning 35 years and dozens of writers. Some things were well done, others I would have done things diffrently. That's OKAY. If you have a better idea, write a Who novel yourself. This was a book that read quickly, and had fairly unique charecters. Again, I have read better, but it was very enjoyable Who. Everyone tends to agree that the interludes were well done. I would like to have seen more of them as I found them splendid. Again, a almost great Who novel by an author who always does his homework.

From the first page your drawn into the story which is fast paced and full of intense intrigue and battlescenes which should have been used for the new series of doctor who becuase this is such a good dalek story. The best thing i loved about this book is seeing the arch enemies of the daleks the thalls a group of aliens that should have been in the new series of doctor who but, for some reason were not even mentioned. You have davros as well new types of daleks and hurrah the dalek prime! the writer of this story knows how to write a good story and he really has written a marvelous one here. So i strongly recommend reading this book if your new to doctor who and if your a fan of the classic series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Ol' Civil War!","review":"The story that most Dalek fans have been waiting for. Unfortunately, the author seems to have gotten confused as to who exactly he was writing about. Peel's portrayal of the Dalek Prime and it's motives, just seemed too human for a Dalek.The portrayal of the Doctor was fine, albeit rather generic. The quirkiness that Paul McGann enthused his portrayal of the Doctor was gone from this literary rendition and left the entire feast of the story somewhat unpalatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves This","review":"This was a Christmans present for my son who is a die hard Green Day fan like me.

(Thunderpuss 2000 Fiesta Club Mix)(6:13) - This is a really wicked remix. Not only is it pefect for clubs, it's also got the whole latin flavour in the background music over the drumbeat.

The background music over the drumbeat, in this case, makes this song sound, as it suggests, 'dirty'. A shorter version of this (3:16) is also available on the 4-track 'I Turn To You' Austalian single.3. (Eddie Arroyo Long Dance Mix) (8:07) - Another good club mix. While not as good as the first two and longer, it is still a cool song you can get up and dance to.4. (Eddie Arroyo Down-Tempo Mix) (4:20) - This is a really nice remix.

Not only does it take up less space in the utensil drawer but by retracting the blade it stays much sharper. Besides being practical, this tool is fun to take out when guests ask if they can peel the potatoes. The looks on their faces when you hand them the retracted peeler is always fun. And once they get their hands on it and start pushing the button to quick release the blade, everyone spends the first few minutes practicing their quick draws. A fun and practical tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and works well once it pops out","review":"I liked this and have used it for the last 3 or so years. This is a potato or carrot peeler where the peeling blade will retract into the handle and stay there until you press the button to make the blade pop back out. The peeling blade will not pop out sometimes, but if you shake it while continuing to press the pop out button - it eventually pops out. Once out, it peels like any other peeler and works well. Not sure if there is any other benefit to a pop out peeler other than the fun factor as I get a laugh here and there when I pretend this is a switch blade, or something evil. Cleanup is a breeze. Just wash under the sink with water, or stick it in the dishwasher, but expect it to fill with a little water if you do that. Not a problem though, I just shake out the water and put in the drawer and it's ready to go when I need it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"Like pretty much all of Dr. Barclay's books, the Letter to the Hebrews makes the Bible verses that are so difficult to comprehend easy to understand and beautiful.

It's a marketing ploy that does more harm than good in this instant.Nearly any soundtrack that Isham touches is enjoyable.

Big step down from Proper's previous superb Western Swing anthology: Doughboys, Playboys and Cowboys: the Golden Age of Western Swing. A few good pieces but for most part both songs and playing are undistinguished. They might be hard to find, but perhaps there is an obvious reason for this obscurity. Also, as a previous reviewer has noted, many of songs are Western Swing only by broadest possible definition of term.This is the fourth 4 CD set of Western Swing music Proper has put out (besides Doughboys, etc. the other two showcase Bob Wills and Milton Brown). Could be by now bottom of barrel is being scraped. In any case, the result here is ordinary music. Don't invest your money in this box set; buy Doughboys, Playboys and Cowboys instead.

The blood, well, it's LB and pretty alright for what we are dealing with.However, I did laugh alot with this film.

If you want to see a good kung fu movie see: The Victom, Drunken Master, Iron Monkey, Fist Of White Lotus, Enter The Dragon, Tai Chi Warriar, The Invincible Armor, Snake In The Monkeys Shadow, Jet Li Legend, Fearless Hyena, Drunken Master 2, Thundering Mantis, So Close, Chocolate, Hero, Ong Bak 1 & 2, The Protector, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, House of Flying Daggers, Azumi and a large number of Jet Li or Jackie Chan movies.

First, to it's credit (or more specifically to the credit of Dragon Dynasty) the film is restored really well and has a great picture.What I don't like is that nearly every fight scene, of which there are many, are implied martial arts. It is edited in such a way that you really don't see a whole lot of action. What you do see is simple, and disapointing. The story is decent for a kung-fu film, but compared to other Shaw Brothers classics, especially their earlier releases, this leaves much to be desired.If you are looking for some great martial arts, this is probably not a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chang pei-pei is the WOW-man","review":"The beautiful leading lady in this film is really the only reason why I like this film, I feel that without her this honestly would have been a 2 star movie for me.Her action scenes are pretty impressive in terms of kung fu film making and look realistically convincing to a certain degree. She just nails it, its the kind of performance that is worthy of the sort of praise Heath ledger got for his role as joker In The Dark knight, and I really don't feel I'm over-exaggerating when I say that.But the rest if the film seems kind of poor sometimes especially towards the end where it gets weird.Its like the last half hour or so is a completely different movie altogether.So do I recommend it, If your into flawless performances from actors in film you should check this out to see Chang Pei-Pei, other than that I say just catch in on the internet somewhere or skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only if you are a fan of the genre","review":"I agree with everything the other reviewers have written - this IS a classic and it DID establish many themes we would see repeated over and over in the succeeding decades. But I also agree that this is not a film a casual viewer will enjoy. It is fun for a student of the genre to see \\"the very first bar fight\\" but not for someone who enjoys Steven Seagal. It's fun to see \\"superhuman stunts\\" but they pale compared to today's Dragon/Tiger effects. And as was pointed out these are actors- you're not going to see \\"real art\\" such as with Bruce, Jackie, or Jet (or even Chuck). If you own lots of these movies and just love to watch them then by all means buy this one- it IS great fun to watch.

The character of Robin Hood is irrelevant, and annoying, as portrayed by Kevin Costner, who only does well in baseball movies. In any event, there were no Moors in medieval England, and the character of Friar Tuck has been changed to represent Hollywood's contempt for Christians.

It's a two -sided DVD, which is fine. But what's weird is, instead of putting the movie on one side and the special features on the other, they put the special features on side one with half of the movie. The movie actually stops half way through and instructs you to flip it over so you can finish watching it!! This is definitely a major downside. It's a great movie, so if you haven't seen it yet, I would strongly suggest watching it at some point. But if you're planning on buying it, you might want to wait until a different DVD version comes out, so that you can avoid having to get up in the middle of your movie to flip it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Hood","review":"This film is a \`90s version of the classic Robin Hood story, with Kevin Costner starring as the good-guy thief. Costner is joined in his efforts against the murdering Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan Richman) who once again proves why he makes an excellent villain. Richman won best supporting actor in the British Academy Awards for his excellent roll.Along with Morgan Freeman who plays a philosophizing side kick Azeem, and by Nick Brimble, who plays Little John (anything but little). After Robin barely survives a watery skirmish with Little John, the two become allies and Robin joins forces with Little John's band of robber thieves to overcome the evils of the Nottingham sheriff.You don't really have to be a die-hard Robin Hood fan to enjoy this movie. The film has a few flaws and stretches the historical aspect somewhat but it plays out well with plenty of action, adventure, humor, and fun.Robin Hood Price of Thieves was directed by Kevin Reynolds and produced by Warner Studios."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good effort at the Robin Hood tale...","review":"Kevin Costner does a good job as the returning prodigal son to find England in a political uproar, but he seemed to accepted into the outlaw's band as their leader a bit too easily.If the goal of the casting director was to cast someone who could play the most distasteful Sherriff of Nottingham possible, they hit the mark. I just don't see the sherriff that way. In my mind he was more of a functionary under a liege lord.Where was the connection to Prince John? Where was the nation-wide conflict between loyal and disloyal royalty?This is a good action adventure, but not the best telling of Robin Hood around.

It's a Flipper!!Halfway through the film you have to turn the disk over to play the other side (a 'feature' noticeably missing from the technical details) which whilst not life threatening is certainly annoying.However, if you like a good movie that you can escape into and leave the real world behind then this would do for you.(relates to the DVD version)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor blu-ray transfer","review":"Five stars for the movie and two for the blu-ray/HD transfer.

Breaks my heart that Flynn will never get an Oscar for his ability, and some of the present day actors could not compare to him and they still rake them in.

Great a strong female character, Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick? Hey, the wise token ethnic character.(Sorry Morgan,you were good, but unnecessary)Christian Slater?

He works best alone, in close up, with his inner thoughts casting shapes and shadows on his face. This is why \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and \\"Field of Dreams\\" were such successful films. Interacting with other actors he becomes at best mediocre. Put him in green stockings and get him to gallivant around Sherwood Forest speaking with a stupid English accent he hasn't broken in yet, and he looks like a complete dork.

The low points of the movie are too numerous to mention, but I'll start with Kevin Costner, hopelessly miscast as Robin Hood. Even local dinner theatre actors can summon up a decent English accent- Costner doesn't even attempt one. Instead, he deadpans his way throughout the movie, a sad omen of the rapid decline of his once promising career. Morgan Freeman does a credible job of breathing life into a multicultural stereotype- the urbane, civilized, enlightened Moor, lightyears ahead of ignorant, hypocritical Christians. This stab at political correctness fails- the myth of enlightened Islam, in Spain or elsewhere, is only a myth. In reality, the Moor would have tried to kill the infidels.Avoid this movie at all costs- poor acting, political correctness, and other flaws too numerous to mention ruin the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Genuinely Stupid Edition of Robin Hood","review":"I find it hard to believe that anyone liked this version of Robin Hood.

Starting in the 4th century for King Richard's crusades take us to a captured Locksly who, of course manages to break free from his captures to make his way home to England to carry out revenge for his murdered father. Alan Rickman hits the spot as the Sheriff of Nottingham. I have loved this movie since I was 4 years old and 15 years later love curling up on the couch with some popcorn to watch it on a weekend in."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my worst DVD","review":"I found this to be the worst DVD I have purchased. The picture is very dark and grainey. The extras a text only, but informative. Another problem that it is one of two DVDs I own (the other being \\"Gone with the Wind\\" that requires me to flip the DVD over to continue the movie. The makers of this DVD should be ashamed. They took what good be an all-time favorite Dvd and did it cheaply. I would recommend waiting to see if they fix the problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is good, format is not","review":"I really like this movie but was extremely disappointed when I watched it and realized that you had to turn the DVD over half way through the movie. I thought that buying a DVD would take away the hassles of two VHS tapes that longer movies have. Also, I have another DVD that is only five minutes shorter and you do not have to turn it over. I was very disappointed at this and would not have bought the DVD if I had known."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great love story","review":"O.K., so what if the movie wasn't completely accurate, and who cares about Kevin Costner's accent. It was a great movie and I thought a wonderfully touching love story. A must have for any of you hopeless romantics out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood favorite come to life!","review":"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves was my first DVD experience on my home PC and brought cinema to a new level for me. The video and sound quality were unbelievable. The only annoying aspect of this DVD is that the user needs to flip over the DVD during the middle of the movie. The movie itself was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined the entire story of Robin Hood","review":"Anyone who has ever read Robin Hood knows that it has that same humorous quality that the Three Musketeers has. The stories are always light and fun with plenty of action. This rendition is aweful. It doesn't even make a very good historical portrait. How many times does someone have to throw their bow on the ground. It took upwards of three months to make a long bow. Kevin Costner has an incredible ability to take a fantastic story and destroy it. Next time maybe he should read the book first. It's almost as bad as John Wayne doing Ghengis Khan."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD let down","review":"This dvd skipped, the volume dramtically fluctuated through out the movie. The disc actually stopped playing half way through the movie. Watch out! Do not buy from this seller. Buy a new dvd if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating DVD","review":"I like this movie overall but the DVD itself is rather frustrating. Half of the movie is on one side of the DVD and half the movie is on the other side. It is only an hour and a half to two hour movie. There is no reason that the view should have to put up with that. Movies of greater length have the feature in its entirety on one side of the DVD. I do not recommend this particular version of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Alan Rickman's Movie","review":"I give this movie two stars but Alan Rickman's performance five stars. I have heard for many years that the only reason to watch this movie is to catch Alan Rickman's performance. Boy, is that the truth. His character is so alive compared with the rest of the cast (except for Morgianna, who was also good). This is a pretty standard script, one could guess what would happen at every turn. Kevin Costner is so hit or miss with his movies, and this was definitely a big miss for him. Morgan Freeman is truly wasted. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's character is tough girl one minute and screaming helpless girl the next. The writer's could not seem to make up their minds regarding what they wanted her to do. I found myself fast forwarding to any scene with Alan Rickman in it. He is completely over the top, hilarious, horrible and sympathetic. You feel the movie let down when he is not on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Satuday Night Action Flick","review":"The plot is extremely predictable (But, its Robin Hood everyone knows this story), with several one liner zingers. But, for the type of movie it is I would say it is a fun movie to watch with family and friends on a Saturday night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Hood: Prince of Theives","review":"I have never owned a DVD movie that I had to turn over to the other side of the DVD to watch the rest of the movie. This movie was a waste of money! It makes me wonder if this is a black market or something else. This is nothing like any movie that I own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now It's Even Longer??","review":"I'm not one to launch gratuitous slams of Kevin Costner and I've enjoyed most of his stuff but this movie takes 'interminable' to new dimensions.

It has a solid plot and good acting, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't include the Bryan Adams music video...","review":"Considering that I've actually seen DVDs selling for a ridiculous [amount] here, the price of this one is quite reasonable for DVDs sold in North America (you can get top quality DVDs in China for [money]). However, the ones who put this DVD together didn't do everything for you. For such an excellent movie, you don't get much on the DVD. You have to flip it over, because half the movie is on one side and half on the other. And, unlike the VHS, this one doesn't include the Bryan Adams music video of \\"Everything I Do\\", one of the Top 5 selling singles of English Pop Music in the 1990s. The resolution, though pretty good, is sub-standard for DVD and the sound gets distorted if you turn up the volume. An excellent movie but a bad DVD release."},{"rating":"1","title":"this DVD is horrible","review":"First off I want to explain that I am reviewing this edition on DVD. I am not rating the story, directing or production. The image quality is as bad or worse as a VHS. The worst part about this DVD is that after about an hour into the movie, you have to eject the disc and turn it over. Yes, the rest of the movie is on the other side. VHS isn't even that bad. Warner Bros is ridiculus for still manufacturing this ancient DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 words for Mr. Costner - Dialect Coach","review":"This film is only saved by the performances of Morgan Freeman and Alan Rickman. Micheal McShane is good as Friar Tuck, but underused. One thing that folks around here have neglected to mention is that Costner starts out the film with a light British accent, which he loses about 5 minutes into the film. Costner probably refused to have a dialect coach. Robin Hood is an English character, and it might have done Costner some good to actually challenge himself for a change.In my opinion, Errol Flynn is still the definitive film Robin Hood. Also, the British series 'Robin of Sherwood' is a marvellous version of the Robin Hood story, with much better acting than in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Flipper!","review":"My reveiw is not about the movie itself. The DVD is a flipper. After watching the movie most of the way through it you have to get up and flip the disk over to see the rest of the movie. dont waste your money on this one until they re-release it dual layered."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD does not work!","review":"This DVD only plays until chapter 17, about half way through the movie. There is no way to skip or fast forward. There are no more available chapters in the scene selection menu.We decided to buy another copy, because we thought we received a defective DVD, but the second copy had the exact same problem.

Maid Marian is Ninja Woman the first time we see her, but in the attempted rape scene, all she can do is scream \\"Robin, Robin!\\" and throw a candle at the Sheriff. Historical inaccuracies abound. Ditto all that has been said (all true) about Costner's accent. Stick to The Adventures of Robin Hood (Flynn in tights still comes off as far more masculine than Costner every thought of being), or the Disney Version (it has a few fun songs by Roger Miller instead of that abrasive Bryan Adams tune. Beautiful production, lousy script). And why did they have to add a Ceasearean, Celts, and Robin's illegitimate brother? They didn't think the script was convoluted enough? Brightest moment: Sean Connery's return from captivity. Too bad they didn't rescue Richard a little earlier; maybe he could have saved this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This product is HORRIBLE!

I am of the opinion that kids need to get back to these classic heroes. But not by watching this lousy movie. Go get the Howard Pyle or Roger Lancelyn Green retelling of the story. Or better still, read the original songs and poetry about the Merry Men of Sherwood. Or read some \\"Green Arrow\\" comics. Anything is better than this tired movie. I fell asleep several times rewatching this movie recently - and believe me, I really TRIED to like it - having been in a \\"Robin Hood\\" fever and all.Mix in Kevin Costner's half-hearted, tired performance and American accent with Morgan Freeman's unnecessary Muslim advisor to the Merry Men(?!?) and Alan Rickman's cynical portrayal of the Sheriff and you get a movie that you wish was never made in the first place.

Never mind that Kevin Costner's performance as Robin Hood won't make anyone forget Errol Flynn. The rest of the cast is great--especially Alan Rickman, and this particular take on the story is very entertaining. My problem is that whoever designed the DVD version must be related to the woman who designed the presidential ballot in Palm Beach County!! Whoever you are, having a movie divided by two sides went out with LP albums and laserdiscs! Sure, there are DVD's with material on both sides of the disc--in most cases, it's two different versions of the same movie. It can be be widescreen/pan & scan or original version/director's cut. The point is that I don't know anyone who enjoys getting up in the middle of a movie to flip the disc over--that's why laserdiscs never enjoyed a lot of popular acceptance! It would be nice if this movie could be re-released on a DVD that is not designed like a butterfly ballot!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, hate this Blu-ray transfer","review":"I saw this movie when it came out in theaters and have enjoyed watching it since. I have been looking forward to owning the Blu-ray version of it. One word describes the quality of this \\"High Definition\\" release, terrible. It feels like I'm watching a DVD.

I have never encountered that before. All my previous orders with AMAZON of NEW CD's or NEW DVD's have always been Superb, except for this one. There was no label on the DVD, and the movie looked old and not crisp at all. I thought something was different but I put it on anyway and at the middle of the movie after the scene where the obesed priest is kidnapped and taken to Sherwood Forest and Lady is about to see Robin Hood taking a bath in the waterfall, then kaput. It ends! What!? Never have I ever experienced this, not even when I have bought used ones. It was very disappointing. I am sending it back today in hopes to receive either Full REFUND OR another NEW DVD of the sam movie Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, with Kein Costner. I love all his movies.

I do not recommend the DVD. Do like a previous review suggested and buy it on VHS if you must have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptively re-released DVD","review":"I bought this because the extended edition DVD/blu-ray was disappointing compared to the theatrical release, with key lines of expository dialogue being clumsily cut out, making the newly added footage nonsensical. However, although the packaging for this theatrical edition is new and advertises a new DVD, the DVD is clearly from the awful earlier release. The problems with the old release is that you are inexplicably forced to eject and flip the disc halfway through the film, which is also presented in the horrible non-anamorphic widescreen format- both of these limitations are almost unheard of. The new packaging in this release claims that it is an anamorphic format, and this is the first DVD out of thousands I've purchased that has ever brazenly lied about that. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Hope that a theatrical edition of the film is eventually released with a decent transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big let down....","review":"A big fan of the theatrical release. I wish both versions of the movie were on the disc. Sometimes these movies are edited well from the start and that has been the case with this movie. It wears a little long and has some pacing issues that the original did not. Some of the edited scenes drastically effect the movie and I felt in a very negative way. I have the original version on DVD and will continue to watch it rather than this one. On top of that their is very little in extras on the bluray. Just some different commentaries.

Alas, this DVD is poorly-done in almost every way. The movie is split halfway through--you literally have to flip the DVD over to see the second part of the movie, although nothing tells you so or prompts you for it--the Supplemental Features are disappointing (and frequently error-laden), and there's truthfully no reason to buy this DVD if you have the VHS already (or a poorly-recorded copy from off the air).

Costner does well when he plays the all-American type, but he is truly awful here. It's not just his lack of a convincing English accent (although even a college drama student could do a better one!) but he is just not convincing as a swash-buckler type. Pierce Brosnan, for example, would have made a much better Robin Hood. I also disliked the way that the Christian worldview and church were portrayed, as backward, anti-science, ignorant, and hypocritical. This was done in 2 ways- by portraying Friar Tuck as a worthless drunkard, and glorifying Morgan Freeman's Moslem character. This is truly a distortion of history, and took the movie into the realm of political correctness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wifes favorite.","review":"We upgraded from VHS because she likes it so much and we were hoping that there might be some entertaining stuff on the extras, but nope, just some pics of the movie and words written in about the movie and Robin Hood in general.

As regards the wonderful documentary about Robin Hood the extras are unnecessary and irrelevant. The so called \\"vintage\\" interviews should not be added. It seems that the producers have dug up all they have and just filled up the DVD just as an excuse to cash in on a few bucks. The extended scenes were clearly taken out in the original movie to add pacing to the movie. Hence the added scene slowed the picture down. The movie on the other hand is fantastic. Brilliantly directed! Alan Rickman is ALAN RICKMAN. There is no one who can play a villain you love to hate. The man is \\"vintage\\"...what the producers called \\"vintage\\" is but to me [fluff].

I thought it was lousy, then years later I watched it again and noticed just how funny Alan Rickman and Micheal Wincott were in it as the villians. The \\"why a spoon\\" dialogue is truly brilliant (well, almost). Alan Rickman really dominates this film with his hilarious performance. He looks like he was having lots of fun.

Big spectacle with little or no brains behind it. I do like Little John (Nick Brimble) and his wife Fanny though.

Great a strong female character, Morgan Freeman as Robin's sidekick? Hey, the wise token ethnic character.(Sorry Morgan,you were good, but unnecessary)Christian Slater?

Costner's accent was horrible, should have gotten a British actor to play the part. The plot was not at all that good. It was more Hollywood than Robin Hood. I am sad I bought it. It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Control in Manufacturing","review":"Tried a couple different copies of this movie and both stopped after 1:14:32 worth of playing. The second half of the movie was not on the disc. Should take all of these off the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fauly disk","review":"I received this dvd twice. The movie on both the original and the replacement stopped playing part way through the disk. Apparently, Amazon received a faulty supply of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD would not work","review":"Apparently there is a bad batch of DVDs for this movie. I ordered the first one and it played until a certain point in the movie then jump back to the scene selection screen. Sent back to Amazon got replacement. Same thing happened. So decided to order from another vendor. Same thing happened with their movie too. I know it is not my dvd player because all my other movies play fine plus I tried playing Robin Hood dvds on my other player and same thing happened. So now I have two bad dvds and I am out about 10 bucks. Afraid to reorder for fear of getting yet another bad dvd from this defective batch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished disc","review":"Not even half of the movie was on the DVD. When I was watching the movie, the disc suddenly stopped and jumped to the main menu. When I looked at the scene selection page, not all the movie chapters were available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three times defective movie ordered","review":"Please review my movie before sending out to me, I love this movie, but I never get to finish seeing it. It finishes at the 17th chapter. I always miss the best part of the movie. It would be nice to see the whole movie when its not defected."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot rate it because it did not come. I have heard nothing from the claim I filed.","review":"This product never came. I have heard nothing from the seller in spite of emailing 3 times. I have heard nothing from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"irrepairable","review":"Like 7 of the 8 other reviews, this product broke with no way to repair it. For the price and apparent sturdiness, it is just one big failure and is to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Stars!","review":"I purchased this corkscrew only one month ago, expecting it to be a lifetime lasting product. WRONG! The corkscrew broke off while we were opening a bottle ~ the screw coming off in the cork, remaining beyond repair. What a horrible product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"KitchenAid please open our wine as your cork screw won't","review":"We used this cork screw for about 1 month before the screw broke off in a cork. (It wasn't even a hard plastic cork but an actual \\"cork\\" cork.)You would think they would make these with a better quality steel screw.Shame on you KitchenAid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile for prime time","review":"I had one of these wine operers for a couple of weeks. During that time, it worked fine and delivered ease and power to opening wine.Then...crack...the screw part broke off in a wine cork while I was opening the 22nd bottle. Alas, the time that I could have returned it was over, so off it went into the metal recycleables bin.Get something with a stronger cork screw attached to the levers.This is not the one to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best parents' stories in one volume","review":"Every time an issue of the La Leche League NEW BEGINNINGS magazine arrives in my mailbox, I read every page because I love to hear other parents' stories. This book was wonderful to me since it took the best stories from many older issues and pulled them together in one place. What's best is that although the book is older (1987), everything is still relevant. Breastfeeding is still about more than nutrition, and loving guidance and other mothering still make for strong families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video!","review":"Very informative. Takes a look at what the Bible has to say about these end time signs related to the times we are living in right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda a waste of money... but OK","review":"I bought Watches 1, and I really liked it. I really enjoyed seeing how UFOs and other things that are happening a lot today, seem to portray the soon return of Jesus Christ. The entire video was pretty good but, sadly what I just said, I really mean about Watchers 1... Watchers 2 seemed to me, to be basically a replay of Watchers 1, with a little more stuff added. I am glad I bought the very cheap download version from Amazon, to me, the DVD price would of been a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrorists Among Us","review":"Was not impressed. The movie \\"Obsession\\" was much better, covered more ground and had better research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs sounded better live than on CD","review":"Living in the Buffalo area, 54-40 has performed many times in what has become their home away from home, and they have consistently been a great and energetic live act to see. The last show that they played here was free, and they showcased more than a half-dozen songs off of their newest disc, all of which sounded great and made me anticipate hearing what I believed would be their strongest disc in years. For some reason, the studio versions of what sounded so promising live do not transcend well on disc. The CD itself is very straight-forward and rather \\"lost and lazy\\". There is certainly nothing new here, and many songs resemble past hits that were done way way better in their original form. Perhaps it takes a few listens to have it grow on you, but as it is now, I would have to say that there is not one song that holds a candle to previous 54-40 staples, like \\"Casual Viewing\\", \\"Since When\\", and \\"One Gun\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks!","review":"Excellent music from this great band....The first six songs really grab you, with select others seriously growing on you as you listen...I have a six CD changer and this one gets all the airplay, I rate it really good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth what it cost","review":"This is a pretty good CD only because of \\"Easy To Love\\". I don't think the CD is worth $28.00 and some odd cents for one song. All the other songs sound the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"misrepresented","review":"this is not a fogger as advertised! it's more of a spray. i was looking for an outdoor fogger such as the indoor foggers BUT FOR THE YARD. after spraying the foundation----i did not have any to spray the yard and noticed that i still had a cricket chirping later in the day :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a review!","review":"I just wanted to freshen up on my Algebra.
