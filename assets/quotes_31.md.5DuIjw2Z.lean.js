I realize what it is, and what it isn't. It is an opinion of the author with scholarly information and references to back him up written so that most of us could easily understand. It isn't for hard-core believers who might find heresy in the open questions the Bible text presents. The author doesn't force his view or opinion, merely asks the questions, provides some evidence (or lack thereof) and leaves the reader to decide what to think.If you a self-taught person, this book is excellent. If you need someone to help explain things, it helps. If you are one who needs someone to think for you, this isn't it.I simply love the context it puts things in as it really explains our humanity in this biblical equation.It comes down to faith - period.If you read his other books, you'll enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Know Much About the Bible","review":"Book seemed very well researched and the inserted bits of humor were delightful My wife is enjoying it also........V Parrett"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Part of a series of books about pretty complex topics.

While I did learn a little, and enjoyed parts of it a great deal, I get the very strong impression that the author would not be pleased that I believe the Bible is inspired.If you read only this book, you will come away thinking that every word in the Bible is contradictory and can be disproved by science or history. I thought I was going to learn about the Bible, not the author's blatanly biased views or the views of the anonymous \\"scholars\\" he continually cites."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Don't Believe Much about the Bible' is a better title","review":"Having read Kenneth Davis' other works, I really looked forward to reading this book to get his insights on the Bible. What a disappointment! Don't Know Much Davis doesn't have a clue. I don't understand why he wrote this book, since he obviously doesn't believe in the Bible. My only thought is that he wants to discredit it. The only thing more discouraging is the positive reviews written by the secular audience that is obviously deceived if they think this is an authoritative account of the Bible. If you are a Christian don't waste your money on this book. The title 'Don't Know Much about the Bible' was truly divinely inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody that needs to study a little more","review":"This book is very misleading right from the start, the subtitle is \\"Everything you need to know about the Good Book but Never Learned.\\" The author then proceeds to do nothing but ask question upon question and then throw out some possibilities. Most of these possibilities are worded to do nothing but cause confusion and doubt for a student just starting out trying to learn what the meaning of the Bible is all about. If there is one good thing to say about this book, it is that for those of us Christians that want some practice taking a barrage of questions about the Bible, this book is good practice. I'm quite astounded that people think that these \\"valuable insights\\" are not taught in today's churches. If they aren't they should, that much I'll agree with, but honestly, nothing new here. Mr. Davis needs to stick with the Civil War, or do a little more studying."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I'VE READ IN A LONG TIME!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Davis' book. It answered so many questions that I had about the Bible and gave me a lot to think about. I just couldn't put it down and look forward to reading some of his other books. A definite must read book for people of all faiths. His witty style and upbeat tempo will keep you interested all the way up to the end. I give it two thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Writing Style. I've learned a lot.","review":"This book is an excellent survey of the old and new testaments. The writing style is engaging. Skeptics will enjoy the book, but so will anyone who wants a review of most of the main ideas in the bible. The biblical contradictions are interesting to read about. But even fundamentalists should read the book to better understand the historical meaning of certain biblical events. The idea that there are so many different versions of the bible would seem to make it difficult for people to believe in a literal interpretation of the bible (as well as to believe in a bible code), yet this does not take away from the mystery and beauty of the biblical tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all!","review":"The title of this book could not be more appropriate. If you Don't Know Much about the Bible when you start it, you will find yourself in that same condition when you finish. The reason is evident to any reader who starts off with a rudimentary understanding of the Scriptures, the title also describes the author. His other books may or may not be wonderful. I have no basis on which to decide. But this work is superficial. It has some interesting facts and conjectures, but no substance or grounding in Biblical scholarship or any scholarship for that matter. If you want to be entertained, it might do that. If you want to understand the Bible, get a good, modern translation and read it for yourself. This book is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Biased Book - Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book is terribly written and is not worth the time or money. Kenneth Davis writes with no desire to explore both sides of the Bible. He ignores historical and archeological evidence supporting the Bible and uses obscure, little known, and controversial books for his support to try and discredit the Bible. One small example, Davis acknowledges the historical writing of Josephus (a Roman historian during the life of Jesus Christ), even mentioning that Josephus mentioned Jesus in his writings. However, Davis blatantly omits the fact that Josephus wrote that Jesus rose from the dead and that his followers were called Christians. This is just one example in a book that totally ignores most of the facts supporting the Bible's accuracy. As one reviewer put it so accurately \\"An aply named book. The author truly does not know much about the bible.\\" Don't waste your time or your money, especially if you are looking for truth from reputable sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook Review","review":"Because there were no footnotes to refer to (being an abridged audio version), I am not sure how documented the author's research is in the print version, but I am fairly certain he relied heavily on the pronouncements of the so-called \\"Jesus Seminar\\". This gathering of clearly \\"progressive\\" (read: liberal) biblical scholars has little cachet with traditional Christian thinkers. They are charged with the undermining and distortion of time-honored Christian thought and beliefs.The author makes frequent use of innuendo, half-truths, and as mentioned in other reviews, selective and incomplete scholarship. This work cannot be considered a serious attempt to further understanding of biblical history. It is an obvious and blatant effort to deceive and distort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural man trying to describe the spiritual.","review":"1 Corinthians 2:14-16 \\"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritualy discerned.

He is quite on sided and doesn't objectively supply all facts relevant to an issue.

The author has no credentials to write such a book, and it shows. Since when does a book on history or geography make one a theologist? All he does is tout his own biased views and attempt to ridicule and tear down that which Christians and Jews believe.I would definitely recommend avoiding this book. Unless you are a liberal or an atheist and want to \\"feel good\\" about your lack of belief in God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is Davis qualified to educate you on the Bible?","review":"Was this book written to \\"educate\\" people ignorant of the bible, or to make money? The main problem with the book is Davis's lack of explaining his stance on such issue as, biblical inerrancy. Many interpretation and explanations biblical scripture are unfounded and stated as fact without apposing views presented.What bothered me is the book and the web presents basically no information about Davis beyond his occupation. If this book is read to understand more about the bible, ultimately the Christian Religion, one should understand the position of the author.If you \\"don't know much about the bible\\" I suggest reading the bible, and attending a church where the bible is studied! If the bible is the foundation of the Christian religion, it must be read as that, and not as a literary work. For the beginner of biblical study as supplement to reading the bible I suggest R. C. Sproul's and Robert Wolgemuth's book\\"What's In The Bible.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Author misses the whole point!","review":"Relishing the details, the author ignores the majesty and message of The Bible.

I have never been a bible scholar and I consider myself a moderate Christian. I bought this book because I was uncomfortable with the emphasis on what I term radical Christianity. Don't Know Much . . . can be read cover to cover as a great, plain-spoken history book. It can also be used as a reference for Bible research. I have done both. It is a completely enjoyable read and I am grateful to have more facts, which have helped me reconcile my personal beliefs about Christianity and also science and history.

Were this book to be presented to me as a history (or literature) thesis project, I would give it an F."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star is WAY too many!","review":"A truer title for a book has never been penned! Mr. Davies, rather than performing his own research, has relied upon generally discredited theory from the 19th century to shamelessly peddle a book to the generally uninformed masses who are seeking a higher truth. The theory upon which this book is based is known as \\"Form Criticism\\" and has been soundly shown to be the \\"bunk\\" that it is by numerous middle east archeological discoveries of the 20th century. After reading this \\"work,\\" I read an extremely well-researched WORK by Josh McDowell, \\"Evidence That Demands a Verdict\\" Volume II. Anyone foolish enough to write or purchase \\"Don't Know Much...\\" should also read the book from McDowell. How enlightening true scholarship is when viewed next to Davies' book. At least I can credit Davies with an insightfull title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Mr. Davis needs to do some more research","review":"My guess is that it must have been extremely difficult for Mr. Davis to remain unbiased when writing this book. While he is able to theorize based on other teaching about specific events that occurred in the Old Testament, he fails to use the same kind of reasoning when it applies to the New Testament. It seems that there is no mention about the actual translation of the biblical text referring to fulfilling the Messianic Prophecies nor does he examine the original Hebrew text concerning the writings in Isaiah or Jeremiah. Nor does he give any clear explanation about the miracles Jesus performed or theorize about his resurrection. I think if you cannot separate yourself from your core beliefs, your definition of \\"the truth\\" remains to be questioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Dont Know Much About The Bible","review":"I hope that readers who are turned on by this book will be sufficiently titillated to make a serious study of the Bible. Then, perhaps, this book will serve some useful purpose. Otherwise, it is just entertaining to the uninformed and irritating to those who have already bothered to learn something about the Bible. One reviewer praised its absence of apologetics. Apparently, Davis feels no need for apologetics, but simply opts for sweeping pronouncements without bothering with footnotes or references to his sources. One example; declaring that ancient Hebrews practiced child sacrifice, so one need not be suprised at Abraham's willingness to offer his son as a sacrifice to God. Hebrews only engaged in child sacrifice when they had succumbed to the depraved religions of their neighbors or captors; those Hebrews who worshipped Abraham's Yahweh, the one true God, abhorred human sacrifice as an abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bible stories and history from a very cynical point of view.","review":"Davis uses this as a vehicle for communicating his own biases and intolerance for different faiths and viewpoints. Interesting that someone with such an obvious contempt for religion would choose this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infomative and Fun To Read","review":"To all of you who swallow whole whatever you hear about the \\"Truth\\" I challenge you to read this book with an open mind. It will educate, amuse and enlighten you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rated M for mature audiences...","review":"Mr. Davis' book is surprising and thought-provoking, two things which can be uncomfortable when applied to religious tradition. This is an excellent book for people who want to learn more about the humanity of the Bible and who are mature enough in their faith to exercise critical thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHANGE YOUR PARADIGM ABOUT THE WORLD'S GREATEST BOOK","review":"As a bible student, I always appreciate a new perspective about the world's greatest book. Kenneth C. Davis's work lets us all understand some vital points of this book. I will not mention them to you, but you will browse some of these in the other reviews. You will learn some interesting points such as - Who was the first people? Why are their two accounts of Adam and Eve? You will definitely enjoy these fine points he makes. This is among the best books ever written about the bible without getting into heavy doctrine."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it...no disrespect intended...","review":"Kenneth C. Davis has written a very enjoyable and easily understood explanation of the Bible. I didn't find it offensive or disrespectful in the least. In fact it helped me understand alot more of the Bible and eased so many of those burning questions in my mind. Using humor and the ability to break down the mystique it can help people appreciate the Bible more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and at times humorous...","review":"Davis tries to inject some humour into a serious subject which makes for interesting reading.. especially to someone who is reading the Bible for the first time. It can generate interest and yet provide background information on Biblical events, and really, it is up to the reader to believe his version of the events cited. It has generated enough interest in me to again read the \\"original\\" version - the Bible itself - to really understand what he is writing about. Overall, it may not be authoritative, but I have never read the Bible in the way it has been explained by Davis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent popularization of biblical scholarship","review":"A fascinating, unbiased, and easy-to-read analysis of the bible, unhindered by any presuppositions about the divine nature of the work.An emphasis is placed on understanding the biblical stories in light of current scientific and historical knowledge and against the backdrop of the legends, ideas, and understandings of the ancient near east. Biblical literalists will not be entertained, but the layman with an interest in how the bible came to be and how it influenced, and was influenced by, the people and places of its time, will find this book a delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly superficial","review":"Davis gets two stars for his sheer volume of work, but as a serious examination of the bible, this book cannot compare to Isaac Asimov's Guide to the Bible, published in 1981. Davis' analysis is completely superficial and often just relies on summarizing plot lines. Any thoughtful commentary is often quoted verbatim from other, more authoritative sources. His habit of dropping irreverent one-liners (\\"How do we know Moses was a real man? Lost in the desert for 40 years, he wouldn't stop and ask for directions?\\")throughout the text is particularly annoying. If you're looking for a serious scholarship, find an author who takes the bible seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasinating information","review":"This book is chock full of information that confirms many stories in the bible and corrects others. It questions the unquestionable and gives good insight. It is written extremely well and holds your interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"He really doesn't know much!","review":"It's on thing for the author to say he doesn't know much about the Bible, but then he goes about proving it in his book.The premise had potential and the hype surrounding the book made it sound like a fresh take on the Bible--much needed these days. Unfortunately, it just doesn't deliver. I've never been so anxious to get to the apocalypse. By the time I reached the book of Revelations, I was ready for the Second Coming.Definitely browse the book at a store before buying--even if it's on the discount table."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for people who are gods unto themselves","review":"Don't buy this book if you love the Bible or want to find out what it has to offer spiritually. This irreverent, materialistic approach is everything BUT what \\"what you need to know.\\" Davis is an historian and a geographer (and no doubt an excellent authority in his field). However, for him to analyze the confusing parts of the Bible from a human point of view is like a third-grader claiming that college is where you go to get away from your mother. Buy a book by someone who is receptive to the Bible's inspiration if you want to find out what it can do for you. Buy THIS book if you want an excuse to believe that millions of people are kidding themselves about feeling uplifted and inspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Research Yeilds Poor Results","review":"Don't Know Much About The Bible is aptly titled, because the author obviously does not know a lot about the Bible. Kenneth C. Davis presents a series of complex Biblical issues and tries to distill them into neat little packages in one-sided arguments that can be explained away by any first year seminary student. Do not waste your time with this book if you are looking for an introduction to the Bible because you will only go away with a lot of misinformation. The argument that Jesus could not have been who He said He was because it was foretold that the Messiah would be from Bethelehem, and the author's assertion that since Jesus was from Nazareth, He couldn't have been the Messiah is a good example of faulty logic since Jesus was born in Bethlehem, thus making the prophesy relevent to Jesus. This is one example, and there are many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book missed the boat","review":"While I enjoyed Davis' history books, his treatment of the Bible misses the boat (to put it in Noah's terms). While he states some of his finding are controversial, that's not a license to print pure poppycock (such as comparing Genesis to Greek mythology.)It's as if Davis is more interested in looking for controversy instead of simply telling a wonderful story. He does cover the main premises of the Bible very clearly and if he had just stuck to that it'd be an A+.I was going to send this back but want to keep it as an example of how not to study the bible. If the bible is real stuff written by real people (who are at times, real messed up) then I'd have to say Mr. Davis \\"don't know much about the bible.\\" Instead, I'd suggest \\"The Message\\" by Peterson (available from Amazon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse translation I've ever read","review":"I am a Spanish speaker and have read the Poema del Mio Cid many times before, however I wanted to have a copy of my own. The translation is probably the worse I've ever read. The beautiful Old Spanish poem is turned into modern Spanish prose eliminating the poetical feeling to the work.Whole sections are paraphrased affecting the real meaning of those parts. Besides that, there are many misspellings and other grammar errors.The formatting is another thing that is terribly inconsistent and confusing, changing sometimes within the same page, which sometimes makes it hard to know if what you are reading are comments by the author or by the characters.The historical analysis is not bad, but it is also not the best.My advice: get another copy of the Poem, this edition does not make any justice to one most important Spanish works of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have CD!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this CD a year ago, with the sole purpose of adding Can't Find the Time... to my CD collection. I knew nothing of their other material. This album is filled with excellent tunes. Great vocals, great orchestration... you have to try this CD. Every time I hear it I discover a new favorite. Right now my personal favorites are Never In My Life, Door Knob, Lovin' You, Walk Away Renee, Love Over Here...there is hardly a cut I don't like.I was so desperate for any additional material by Orpheus that I recently purchased their complete 4 cd compilation. This does not add much value to this collection as most of the additional songs are strictly Bruce Arnold and Steve Martin (nothing against Bruce- but the additional songs are a different flavor).It's a shame they did not stay together for more than 3 albums!If you like The Left Banke and The Zombies, you will probably like Orpheus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Charlie Andrews Got It All Wrong...","review":"This is a great compilation with a superb track listing.

This \\"water and Spirit\\" baptism doctrine is a confused misreading of the New Testament. Neither the New Testament nor any of the Church Fathers taught this.In the guise of freeing his readers and followers from a \\"works righteousness\\" gospel, he instead burdens them with a quirky correct-belief-according-to-Paul-C.-Jong gospel.What other confused Christianities can we expect to come from the East?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus did not receive the sins of the world at His baptism!","review":"Jesus could not receive the sins of the world at the time of His baptism.

Jesus took the sin of the world upon Him on the cross. He did this when He said,\\" My God, My God, why hast thou foresaken Me\\". Jesus needed to be without sin as the perfect sacrificial lamb or it would have all been done in vain.

If you are on the fence about buying this book,hesitate no more! Buy it now! The ideas in this book are original, yet the writing is so smooth that you are 40 pages into the book before you know it.The main charactor, Jim, is someone with whom everyone can relate.Unlike some books charactors, Jim does not suddenly evolve from a guy working at a 7-11 into a major political force or brilliant military strategist.He reacts in a way that is realistic and understandable,yet not boring. In a strange world with limited communication skills, he makes mistakes, cries, and sometimes sulks,but never totally loses hope - the same way many of us feel about our own lives.If you do not yet have this book for your collection,consider your collection incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"To avoid confusion...","review":"I agree with all- this book was fantastic and the lack of sequel is a real shame.

There aren't that many war films out there and it was nice to find one that had the production design to set the film properly in war-torn Europe, allowing for some geographical mistakes. A couple of scenes were a little far-fetched, but it's not a WWII documentary, it's a film for entertainment. Certainly a lot better than many of the lower B-grade war films made by US companies in the late fifties. More than worth the $1.00 I paid for it in the DVD bin at Dollar Tree. If you see it there, get it. How could you go wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"Absolute waste of time. One of the worst movies of all time regardless of genre.

Do yourself a favor and do NOT see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Drop falls into the gutter.","review":"At first I was excited about this movie, hoping that it would blow me away like Saints and Soldiers, yet I found myself let down. The opening backdrop on Market Garden and use of real footage was excellent. However despite the intense beginning the movie fizzled out. A confusing story line was the biggest let down, it kept jumping back and forth without proper explanation or time for the viewer to understand what was happening. I was annoyed that the SS Major in charge wore the uniform of an SS Major General, with poor collar insignias. The end was weak, but not horrible. However I would have written the script very differently and found some technical, costume and historical advisors who knew what they were doing. Overall I'm not really happy with the movie and will be passing on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying message","review":"My husband bought this and this is his review: The movie was barely ok, such as a low budget hastily filmed ridiculous plot movie is.

I should have been paid to watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst war movie ever","review":"Who or whom ever managed to finance, cast, produce and distribute this movie deserves an award. That person could sell ice cubes to eskimos. I thought War Kill with George Montgomery was the all time stinker of war movies until I saw this trash. Michael Madsen must have been really broke to have agreed to be in this film. His appearence was made even worse as his hair was dyed black and I don't think he was wearing a helmet liner as his helmet sat so far down on his head. The allied uniforms were wrong, the plot was lame and the casting, with few exceptions, could have been better accomplished with a dart board. Coral Beed was nice to look at, but that's where the good part of the movie ended. Use the time you might have spent to watch this movie doing something more pleasant, like getting a root canal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Drop ... hopefully long and far!","review":"Unquestionably and without doubt, one of the worst WWII movies ever made. The only good movie Michael Madsen has made in recent memory is KILL BILL. Billy Zane, I don't think, ever personally added anything but poor acting to any movie, including decent movies like ORLANDO, SNIPER, and TITANIC. Cannot understand how producers/directors of movies as bad as this are successful in acquiring funding. A terrible waste of resources. Avoid this one; Turner Classic Movies certainly will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized Plot","review":"This movie is supposed to take place during Operation Market Garden in September 1944, when the Allies tried to get across the Rhine in a serious of three major air assaults. The lack of background to set up the story and cohesive plot make this story very hard to follow. The characters are not introduced in the traditional sense, so you struggle to follow along.Billy Zane's role was a real mystery. He was a British glider pilot without an accent. Was he a Canadian? The Americans, led by Michael Madsen, are played as inept and follows the European template for how to portray Americans.This movie tried to be a cross between Kelly's Heroes and Bridge Too Far. It failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What ever happened to good WWII movies?","review":"This reviewer has been watching WWII movies for over 40 years, and this movie is without a doubt the absolute WORST I have ever had the displeasure of watching! I don't know who Billy Zane and David Madsen owed favors to but I think it is safe to say that the favor has been returned in spades! This movie is so flawed that I don't know where to begin. It looks like it was filmed in about a day and a half. It is lacking in plot, storyline, continuity, etc. Even the slightest attempt at a believeable concept was not attempted. I doubt that even Speilberg could salvage such a piece of crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot Fizzles...","review":"This WWII action flick obviously made with a low budget shows promise at first. Using some crafty photography incorporated with a gritty opening battle scene, keeps the viewer on edge. The stage is set competently enough for a Dutch treasure heist.About a half hour into the movie, silly dialogue and lousy actingmar the whole plot. Michael Madsen's role as an American commander is so insignificant that there is no doubt that his career has gone south. This movie makes \\"Kelly's Heroes\\"(The ultimate WWII heist movie) seem like Oscar material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly done, no plot, lousy uniforms, historically garbage.","review":"Looking at the box art and reading the desription, I was expecting something like maybe an updated version of Kelly's Heroes. This is a long way from Kelly's Heroes. This is a great example of some pinhead producer with a decent budget making a pathetic movie. The uniforms of the characters involved are horribly innacurate and in several instances look like they were made out of construction paper - I've seen better in college drama club plays. The plot, if you can call it that, is bloody awful and completely unbelievable. The only thing I kept wondering through this whole movie was \\"how did they get the guy from 'Titanic' to agree to be in this train wreck?\\" Avoid this one like a bad rash, this could well be in contention for the \\"worst war movie of all time\\" award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't know whether it was comedy or drama","review":"This film would have made a poor, but not terrible, drama, had they elected to play it straight. But they didn't. They made it part comedy, so what you get is a very odd, confused film that doesn't know what it wants to be. You don't know whether you're supposed to laugh or cry. Mostly, you just fast-forward.Others have commented on the lack of historical authenticity, but one thing they got right was the look and feel of the German machine guns. Those German machine guns had an incredibly high rate of fire that was well in advance of anything the British or Americans had at that time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie, Bad Story, Bad Acting .Historically inaccurate","review":"I am a WW2 Reenactor that loves war movies.

I bought the book thinking it was something I could read and study at home. That is not what it is meant for. There are many references to class handout materials and audio tapes that I don't have. As far as I can see, the handouts aren't sold seperately on the website (they are bundled with the book) and I can't seem to find where there are classes in my area.I took great offense to chapter 2 of this book where the author outlines her view of the history of pain in childbirth. She basically blames Christianity and the Catholic church. I just didn't need to pay money to be insulted.There are many exercises that I can practice at home (so its not a total waste), but I have no idea if I am doing them correctly as the book is not meant to stand alone.I have yet to give birth, so I can't comment on the course's effectiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Med free for me thanks to this!!","review":"Because of this book and a hypnobirthing class I took, along with the help of God, my husband and hypnobirthing instructor (and a great doctor and labor nurse) I was able to deliver my daughter without any medication and very little intervention. She was turned around so I did have horrible back labor but they said I was still \\"limp as a ragdoll\\" and they couldn't tell I was in pain. I spent most of the labor in the shower in the birthing room at the hospital. (My labor broke at the beginning of labor and so I was in the hospital most of my labor but they were great about catering to my wishes -- due partly to a three-page birth plan!). I was able to be so relaxed and I have no doubt that it helped tremendously! This book is very well written and easy to follow and remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great techniques helped me labor drug-free...","review":"I'm grateful to this book for giving me a couple of excellent relaxation techniques we were able to use during my labor, and for the positive outlook it lends to our increasingly tech-dependent birth system. It's not quite as helpful, thorough or organized as the hypnobabies.com home-study course, but as an introduction to self-hypnosis in birthing, it's valuable. I should stress that your support in the birthing room is the most important thing... everyone attending needs to be in agreement w/ your decision to go natural because a little negativity or doubt can really affect a birthing mother and stall labor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably works better w/ the CDs and classes","review":"My sister-in-law referred this book to me. She also took the classes with her husband and listened to the CDs, which I did not. I barely made it through this book. It was just too cheesy and hippie-ish for me. I'm sure if I would have been more committed to this child bearing method and had taken the classes, I would have found it much more useful, but just by itself, it didn't do it for me.My sister-in-law had her baby doing Hypnobirthing last week and she and her husband had a great experience.

Her playing sounds almost perfunctory, disinterested, lazy. The orchestra does a fine job, but since this concerto is all about the soloist, the performance sucks.Breiner's 8-piece suite based on Chinese melodies from the Silk Road is disappointingly banal and nothing more than an album filler.I only give this CD 2 stars because the concerto is so beautiful.

As long as something readable is produced on a topic with popular interest, all is well. Only real philosophy and science are left behind. To put it simply, Churchland is an incompetant philosopher who knows very little science; but he appears to be more interested in philosophical questions than even the greatest philosophers and uses more scientific jargons in his writings than the best scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for every artist","review":"This book does not show you how to draw in the least bit. It is very vague when it comes to how the human anatomy works when it comes to muscle structure and movement, it does not walk you step by step through drawing a figure. What this book does explain that is helpful is perspective and that is about it. If you are a beginner or even a novice, this book may be good for reference by looking at his work, but the reading and looking at the different poses he presents is mundane and boring beyond belief. I strongly disagree with anyone who lays claim that this is a Figure Drawing book.

Imagine someone writing an art book like a novel. Don't believe me well take a peek at some of the pages. All the chapters are exactly the same a drawing, with a paragraph explaining what you see.Before you ask I did peek at the pages and I had hoped that as the chapters went, it would have better explanations. What I expected to learn is symmetry like how big should the shoulder be in comparison to the head, same with arms and legs.

It is a old edition, but still. the b est for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Figure Drawing Book","review":"This book is filled with very good illustrations of the human figure. It mostly concentrates on the male figure seen on the cover. The figure that is used throughout the book is very muscular so expect the same figure to appear on every page. This book shows you perfect examples of the foot, hand, head, chest and any other body parts. Worth adding to your art book collection, you will not regret this purchase. I am a fine arts major in college and I use this book to refer to the human figure in action, the drawings show the figure relaxed, flexing and jumping around. The drawings are all black and white and come with a description of what the figure is doing and why certain parts of the body do what they do. Very detailed and great depiction of the male anatomy."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for the feint hearted","review":"Mr Hogarth might be a brilliant art teacher but he 'ain't no writer'! This is not an easy book to follow an often the illustrations (as marvellous as they are) are hard to interpret against the relevant text notes - reference pointers get lost within the body of the image.However, having said that - I find this book an essential part of my library and reference it all the time.

Amazing book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Reference Tool","review":"A figure drawing book that exaggerates some structures in order to teach, featuring superb illustrations of how movement affects the body; there is no pull or relaxing of muscle that goes unannotated in this book. Hogarth's Dynamic Figure Drawing is less about drawing from step-by-step shapes and lines, and more about anatomy- how the form interacts as a whole. A bit more appropriate for those who already have some background in drawing than those just beginning, but undoubtedly a useful tool for the beginner as well; you can never go wrong with such well noted and illustrated reference material. Hogarth also covers the changes of the structures according to perspective, though notes on the face and hands are less in number than those on the body as a whole. However, there are books from the same artist, on dynamic hands, and drawing the head as well, so if you find yourself needing more guidelines for those structures, there are resources for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern-day Michelangelo","review":"Hogarth was referred to as the \\"Michelangelo of comics\\" because of his complete mastery of drawing the human form.

They are SLIGHTLY better than the old, bent beaters with the popped rivets that I was trying to replace, but they are not really a suitable replacement.

Rutland's subtitle, \\"The Founding Father,\\" makes it clear what this book is about: Madison's participation in the creation and passage of the constitution and the Bill of Rights. Although it does cover most of his life, the focus is definitely on Madison's role as founding father.The book deals with the major issues of Madison's political life, often in too minute detail, but does not satisfy the biographical aspects of his life. There is absolutely no mention, for example, of Madison's birth date, or even the year he was born in! Further, the book failed completely to engage me. I set it aside for weeks at a time before I finally finished if off, despite its modest size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. A book with this kind of title & a ghost on the front should have some spooky stories. It read more like an encyclopedia. Things were listed in a boring, plain way, & most of them had nothing scary about them. I learned a few interesting things about Mammoth Cave, but could have gotten that from a book about the cave. The few stories that were at all spooky, were told in such a bland manner, just a few sentences stating the main points, that it was impossible to feel anything from them. If you're looking for Mammoth Cave knowledge, get a book on the cave. If you want scary cave stories try \\"Tales of Dirt, Danger & Darkness\\" by Paul Stewart. If this book had told the spooky things in a \\"story\\" manner, some of them might have been interesting. But most of them were too short to really be a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours I can't get back","review":"This is easily the worst film I have ever seen.

Somehow, the film becomes more confusing with repeated viewings.

The GRAVE NEW WORLD album video is interesting, definitely worth seeing. It DOES contain some cringe-worthy dated imagery but as an historical document is of interest nonetheless.

These are trite and banal poems that do not ring true or sincere. Frost seems distant from both his poems and the reader. What he has to say is obvious and unoriginal. How he says it is on the level of a hallmark greeting card at its best; at its worst, it is no better than a limerick. Posthumous revelations about his horrific cruelty to others and his shrewd creation/manipulation of his celebrity image as the New England farmer-poet only confirm that there was something seriously wrong with this man and his poems that an earlier generation missed.

Although my niece understands basic counting, I felt her loosing interest as the game progressed and the numbers went higher and higher, approaching 100. Not many preschoolers can comprehend such large two-digit numbers. I'm sure she'll grow into the game more as she ages, so for now we just adjust the directions so that they're at a level that maintains her interest.

The security locks for the bikes and the car bring peace of mind when parking around town with a loaded rack, and the folding features are great.The best improvement I think that could be made is the bolt which tightens the rack down through the hitch.

The manufacturer says that, if I send them the unit, they will refurbish it and give me another 1 year warrantee. That's great... but what are my tenanats supposed to do for the week (or so) that the unit is at the manufacturer? The regrettable solution was to remove the N210 and replace it with a tank type water heater.

Add Joee to the list of freestyle/dance artist who have distanced themselves from the genre.

Even with Joee's exceptionally soulful voice, I can't get a groove with this album. None of the tracks are even good dance songs. Since I thought in the beginning that this might not be an all freestyle album, I at least expected some good dance tunes. Angel is the only track that would sound decent in a club but it is backed up with that really tired and played out euro disco beat. Although I was disappointed with this album I hope it will be a success and turn the U.S. onto Joee helping to put him on the map as one dance musics greatist singers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The ring came in good time and the silver is shiny.

In reality it had a greater lag time, much slower overall actual speed (transferring network files and internet use with a laptop, a desktop and an XBOX 360), and less range than the WRT55AB. Also, when paired with the XBOX 360, the WRT330N can not satisfy the network demands for streaming video, which the 55AB does fine.

There are mediums, ghosts, abusive parents and grandparents, betrayed lovers, cheating spouses, ego-riddled writers . . . and in spite of them (or maybe because of them) the books illuminates the spark of pure humanity in its central characters. The gardens and fountains become characters in their own right, to the point where I was drawing maps and schematics inside my head.

Good stories like this are hard to find.There is one thing I would have liked,and that is a better description of the gardens which are the setting for the story, or a picture or map in the front of the book.

Of course it doesn't sound as good as a carefully produced studio CD so if that bothers you don't buy this DVD. But if you have an appreciation for live music and how incredibly talented this band is, then this DVD is a great addition to your collection. I was fortunate enough to see this band last year. I really hadn't listened to them before the show but I have been a diehard fan since. The drums are flawless, the bass is stomach-wrenching, and the vocals unbelieveably powerful.

This book was slow. I felt like I was struggling through the whole novel to find something I liked. The characters all felt like dead weights to me. They were boring and I couldn't form any emotional connections to any of them. When I had about 75 pages left I ended up skimming to the end to see what happened to the characters. I don't know why, but this book just didn't do it for me. I couldn't get into it at all. I am a big fan of romance/fantasy type novels too so I thought this book would be great. I'm not sure what type of person this book will appeal to, but most of the other reviews are positive so it seems I am the odd one out here! :) Anyways, I wouldn't reccomend it, but if you want, go get a copy at your local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is a great item.

After visiting Jamaica and going to so many of the places depicted in the video, however,I treasure it even more. It captures so vividly the spirit,the rhythm, and the absolute magic of Jamaica that Marley evoked in his music, as well as the essence of the man himself. Now, every time I watch it, I cry. The music has even more meaning to me now, and the importance of this man's legacy to his land and his people is driven home so much more pointedly. Having visited the mausoleum in Nine Miles and seen how beautiful and well-maintained it is by the Rastas there, there is nothing more poignant than seeing it's beginnings on this video.

Note that the 12v input uses a separate circuit, so if your fuse blows you may still be able to make use of the AirStation with the 12v plug in your car.Hopefully in a future model B&D; would:1.) add a circuit breaker on this unit's panel in place of the internal fuse2.) make the one or both of of the air hose and the 120v cord slightly longer3.) design the storage for the 12v cord such that it doesn't obstruct use of the switchUntil then, I recommend buying a manual floor pump instead, else spend a little more and buy a small industrial air compressor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as advertised","review":"This inflator might be okay for bicycle tires and light duty small tires, but it does not work with larger inflation jobs at all, especially jobs requiring inflation pressures above 60 lbs psi.

Do NOT buy this unit if you expect to use it regularly on car or truck tires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuse is a major problem","review":"I had my Air Station for a little over 2 years...enough time for the warranty to run out. It worked fine, and I didn't use it very often until it just stopped. I suspect it's the fuse as I've heard from other reports over the internet. I called their repair center, and they said it's not repairable. I have an older inflator from another company, and I've used that for at least 10 years.

I typically use it for filling bike tires in my garage. It has worked great so far. The only problem is that the plastic overmolding around the nozzle is extremely tight on a valve stem. This causes it to \\"stick\\" to the valve stem when I try to remove it after inflation. It has resulted in me releasing all of the air I put in the tire when removing the nozzle on several occasions. Quite annoying, but I think If I just scrape or drill a little material out of there it will be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed with little use","review":"I bought this in 2008, used it about 20 times (on 120VAC power) to fill bicycle tires - it worked fine and then in 2012 it failed.

I dismantled the unit and checked - the internal fuse was blown, but that was because something else in the circuitry was blown out. Had to toss the unit.

Its gauge has a knob that you turn so that once it reaches a certain psi, it turns off automatically. This is great because you don't have to stand around watching it to make sure it doesn't over-pressurize whatever you're pumping. The gauge is also illuminated for nighttime use.Now for the drawbacks. Unless you're pumping up a bike tire or something small, this pump takes a long time to pressurize. Also, the wall outlet cord that comes with this pump is ridiculously short, around a foot and a half long or so. Also, the tube you hook up to whatever you're pumping is really short too, probably around as long as the cord.Overall, however, this pump is great for its price and I'd recommend it if you have an extension cord and no need to pump something up quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk! 3 failed units, all after only 2-5 uses","review":"Great points: 1) Works on both 12V and household current. 2) Stops pumping at selected pressure.Bad points: 1) Stopped working after 2-5 uses for 3 of these inflators. 2) Black & Decker sends you a free replacement when it fails the first time, but requires you to mail the 2nd and subsequent failed units to their service center.

I had a previous Black & Decker inflator that lasted twenty years and it worked and functioned very well.Many pumps priced at up to the cost of this Black & Decker ASI300, and now on the market work only by plugging them into cigarette lighters, in fact I have yet to find one that plugs in to A/C.I haven't been able to find any brand of pump that would function as well as my old Black and Decker or I would quickly return this ASI300 for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this only if you want to test Black and Decker's return policies","review":"I have found this product to be inferior in every way. Loud. Slow to fill tires. Awkward placement of the on/off toggle. Short power chord. I could forgive all of these short comings however, if it could do just one thing; fill more that 10 tires without blowing a non replaceable internal fuse. The first time it blew B&D sent me a new one without question. The second time it blew they said since they already sent me a new one the first time, I would have to take this one it to an authorized repair facility and I would need an original receipt to do so. I can't find it (of course) so now I have a big orange paper weight. Read the other reviews, this appears to be a common problem. If you do buy this make sure you keep your receipt in a safe place. You will need it often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and extremely slow","review":"Extremely loud when running, and extremely slow regardless of the item you are inflating. You have to literally cram the hose and wires into the storage compartment in order to get them inside, then you need to worry about pinching a line or cord when you close the cover. The hose attachments fit nice underneath but none of them fit air mattresses or the larger air holes. Also, the AC electrical cord is SO SHORT that it is almost impossible to use this product without an extension cord, which defeats the purpose of its compact design. Skip this item and spend a little more money on a better product. Sorry Black & Decker, you normally make good products but this one is lousy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"May be ok for bike tires but that is about it. Tried topping off my motorhome tires with this unit and never finished. Both the 12 volt and 120 volt pump stopped working. Very disappointing. Also seemed to act erratic at times as mentioned in other reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"verastile husky product","review":"This is a great product at a good price. I bought it as something that can operate at 110 volts for use in my garage for bike or car tires (high pressure), or on my boat at 12 v for inflating a dinghy (low pressure). Its powerful pump may be a bit noisy for a few minutes, and the built-in 110v power cord is quite short, but this is a small price to pay for such a versatile device. My garage has plenty of extension cords, and I appreciate its sturdy compact design. Its dial-a-pressure and automatic shutoff is quite useful, and I'm not concerned if the gauge may be off by a few psi; I always slightly over-inflate my tires, then release excess pressure and use an accurate tire pressure gauge for the final dial-in. Highly recommended (so far -- I haven't had it long enough to break anything.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"BLACK & DECKER AIR PUMP","review":"SO FAR, I AM WELL PLEASED WITH THIS AIR PUMP. IT HAS A COUPLE OF FEATURES NOT FOUND ON OTHER AIR PUMPS I HAVE USED. ONE IS THAT IT CAN BE USED WITH EITHER 12 VOLT DC OR 110 V. AC. THESECOND FEATURE I LIKE IS THAT YOU CAN SET IT ON THE PRESSURE YOU WANT AND IT WILL CUT OFF AUTOMATICALLY AT THAT PRESSURE. TWO FEATURES THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE PUMP IS TO PUT THE ON-0FFSWITCH IN A MORE ACCESSIBLE EXTERNAL LOCATION. IT IS NOW HIDDEN IN A COMPARTMENT BEHIND THE 10 V. DC CORD. THE SECOND CHANGE NEEDED IS A CARRYING HANDLE. RIGHT NOW THE ONLY WAY TO CARRYIT IS TO PICK IT UP WITH BOTH HANDS.

It is soldered in, and not replaceable by most people. Mine just went with a little less than a year of occasional use.

Since he was always borrowing ours I knew that he would love it and he did! It arrived within four days after I placed the order. The air station has so many uses. It is great for inflating tires and childrens toys. Because it is small and compact it is easy to handle. We have one for several years and use it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compressor","review":"I purchased this product about a month ago and have been very pleased with it so far.. My favorite feature is the automatic cut-off which allows you to set the pressure, attach the house, turn it on and then it automatically shuts off when it achieves the preset pressure. I work midnights and when the days are warm, and then the temp drops during the night, I lose air pressure in my car tires. It is very convenient having this compressor in my trunk. Today, I am buying three more for my kid's cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubby loves it!","review":"I purchased the pump for my husband because all we had was a hand pump to pump up our bicycles. This pump is so easy to use...just set the air pressure, push start and it fills the tires quickly and shuts itself off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This thing isn't good. Just buy a real compressor. You have to set a dial to the pressure you want, plug it in, and it goes until that level is reached and cuts off. No way to just press a button and air comes out. I regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product with an Achilles' heel","review":"I liked everything about this unit until the internal fuse blew on it after 3 years of occasional use. As another reviewer states, you can replace it easily enough if you're willing to crack open the unit and solder in a new one on the circuit board, but if that doesn't sound attractive then consider yourself warned. A shame really; everything else about it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"good until it stops working.","review":"This unit works as advertised initially but not when plugged into car power supply after 20 or so inflations. I used it to inflate a slow leaking tire on my vehicle and to inflate my son's toys occasionally.

The pump works as described,shutting off at the preset pressure. I did check it with an external gauge and it seemspretty accurate. The only con so far is that the on/off switch can be a little hard toget too. But this is a minor annoyance. Like with most pumps and gauges you might loosea little air when removing the valve connection.

The fuse has never blown once.Overall I have to say it was a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price, design could be better","review":"I got this one because Amazon offered a big Thanksgiving discount. Before buying it, I knew this product has fuse problem according to online review. Once I received it, I upgraded the fuse based on the instruction someone put on internet. So far it works fine for me. I'm satisfied with the whole qualtiy within this price range.Pro:*Low Price*Can use either Ac or Dc power*Mobility: compact, convenient*Enough long Dc power cordCon:*Pressure monitor is not accurate, it automatically shut off before reaching the desired pressure level. So you need to set the dial higher than your desired pressure level and a pressure gauge to verify that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still working good after over a year.","review":"The pump works great, it is noisy and vibrates but it functions without moving around and always fills the car tires up consistently. The only problem is the gauge used for the auto-shutoff functionality is inaccurate. I usually have to set it a few pounds higher to get the pressure that I want and verify it with a tire gauge. However, it consistently fills the rest of the tires to the same pressure so the guage does work consistently, just not accurately with the number written on it. This has been a very minor issue especially since I usually fill it a few pounds over since I usually leak some getting it to disconnect from the tire and getting my tire gauge to get a good seal for a proper reading. I recommend this and intend to purchase another for a family member for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"For the price, it's excellent. I gave it a 4 because of the short power cord. I liked the preset pressure cut-off feature and also the back-lit dial. It also gave a reading very close to the actual pressure gauge. Even though the pressure markings are in increments of 5, it's still quite easy to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what he wanted!","review":"This was a Christmas present for my husband, who was very pleases with this ite.

It works fine. I like that you can set it to the desired pressure and walk away from the machine to do something else. I've had two flats lately; I think that has has already paid for itself.This will go with me when I travel.. I think that this along with jumper cables and a very basic set of tools belong in any vehicle.It could take 15 minutes to inflate a fully flat tire. Thats small potatoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have around the house and while traveling","review":"This sure beats running to the gas station and fiddling with their equipment that hardly ever works. I've had my Black & Decker for a few months now and love it. It is light, compact, and easy to use.Some negatives - loud, hard to read the exact tire pressure on the gauge, and it is a bit slow.However, for the price this is a great product to have around the house and to take on a trip. I'm very happy with it, it is a solid, good performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Piece of Junk","review":"Purchased brand new, mine crapped out on me after a grand total of three uses.

Like several others reviewers, my inflator died in the middle of adding a couple of psi to a set of tires. Since this is something that is not user repairable, I have to take it 20 miles to the B&D repair center so they can order a new one under warranty. This is particularly annoying because this one was a replacement for my original one that had the same problem. I'm seriously considering just buying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome design","review":"The system is designed in such a way that you have to pull the 12v cord out of small storage location to get at the power switch. Therefore if you are using the 120v plug, you have to pull out the 12 volt cord anyway, and it just kind of flops around. The power switch should not be buried in this little cubby hole behind the 12v cord. Oddly, the 120v cord and the inflation hose are very short, just like in the picture, which means you have to place the unit very close to power, and right next to whatever you are inflating. Poor design. Otherwise, the inflator blows things up as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"This item is way over the cost, I had gone camping and had brought along a small air compressor that I purchased for 9.99 at Big Lots. After 1 hr my air mattress had enough air to sleep on it. First thing I did when I got back was to look for a new air pump. Based on the reviews, the description and the name (Black and Decker) I purchased this one. Tried it the same day I received it, NOPE same amount of air being pushed out as the cheep 9.99 one. Still took over 1 hr to blow up the mattress. Returned item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - But Needs Small Improvement","review":"This compressor works very well. It is portable, has a built-in pressure gauge and auto-shutoff feature. But it could use one small improvement. The location of the on-off switch is awkward. You have to pull out the DC power cord to access it - even if you're using AC. Then the DC cord has to be re-stowed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well 3 times","review":"I used this moderately 3 times over maybe 6months, and on the 4th time, it cut out just as I turned it on.

The dials are also supposed to be illuminated for night use, but i havent had the opportunity to use this feature yet.For the price, it cant be beat. No more running to gas stations for refilling tires for me.. what a hassle that was!I gave this machine 4 stars instead of 5 because of the size of the cord compartment.

This inflator is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great so far!","review":"I purchased this product yesterday, and have only inflated three tires with it so far, so I will update this review if anything changes...but so far I love this Black&Decker; AS1300 Air Station inflator. It is easy to use straight out of the box, and it inflated the tires to 45psi in about 3 minutes. I used it on a couple of trailer tires and a spare, and the unit turned off automatically at the preset psi, which I found to be accurate. I suggest setting the machine slightly higher than the desired psi for the tire, then you can use a precision tire gauge to bleed air out to the desired pressure.I know other reviewers have found this unit to be delicate, and short-lived, but so far it has paid for itself (I paid $39.98). Without it, I would have had to remove both of the tires from the trailer and driven to a gas station to have them inflated. With this unit, I easily filled the tires in the driveway.

Overall, I have found this little unit a great alternative to dragging out the air compressor hose for little jobs or taking along on those weekend camping trips.

Airing up my truck tires to 80 psi from about 25 psi is an all-day job. This unit is not designed for that level of air pushing. And today I fried it by running for about 15 minutes to pressurize some plumbing for a test. It didn't make it to 100 psi before smoke started billowing out and the unit quit.

After the 5th time it stopped working. The problem from what I have been able to discern is a blown fuse that is soldered inside the unit. If you Google this product you will see that this is a very common issue and many owners have experienced the same issue some repeatedly. Since I can't use this anymore to fill up tires I am going to use it to fill up the inside of my trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works until the internal fuse blows","review":"This pump was useful for a while. I bought it to fill up our car tires and because it could run on AC or DC from the car. Buyer beware that it has an internally soldered fuse (read that as not one that you can replace). After a few uses the fuse blew on mine, and after looking at posts about how I might fix it by soldering a new one into place, I decided to save the time and get a Slime branded one instead. It turns out that the Slime one is quieter, and it has lasted for over a year longer than this B&D model. Only downside to the Slime pump is that it only runs on DC from the car, but that hasn't been a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I used this unit two times before it stopped working. The unit would light up as if it was functional, but not pump air. I adjusted the pressure sensor all the way o the right (highest setting). I tried turning the unit off/on and got the same results. I unplugged the unit thinking it would reset the pressure sensor, but when powered on the needle showed at 0 while the pressure sensor was at at the max 160psi. I had read reviews that the AC side would blow a fuse, so I tried the DC power, same results, gauge lit up and showed the needle at 0 and the pressure sensor at 160. you would think for $50 the unit would last more than a couple of days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 15 seconds!","review":"The product worked for ~15 seconds then died.

Lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality. Broke after a short use.","review":"The unit works great when it works. However, it stops working after a few uses. Checked couple 1-star comments. One had disassemble the unit and found the fuse good. I had disassemble the unit. The AC input of the transformer has open circuit. Most likely, the input is burnt after an inflation of an air castle. The DC input still works.

Having to listen to that thing for 20mins minimum in a camp ground or house is taxing on the nerves.

Bah!The idea of this machine is convenience - which it doesn't provide because of its poor electrical design and complete lack of reliability.Apparently some of the units work OK, but I suspect that these are units that are mostly used for very low pressure work. If you need to pump something up to more than 40 psi I suspect that most of them will fail. Too bad B&D; rates this thing for 160 psi.

Setting the psi and letting it do the work makes inflating items pretty painless. Everything that comes with it either stores inside or attached to the bottom of the unit and that makes it easy to store and pack around. Now the less-than-perfect stuff...Firstly, the AC cord is about 18 inches long, so you'll need an extension cord to operate it in most situations. Not a problem if you are prepared. The biggest negative is the included DC cord which is only 10' long. I called B&D support and the best they could suggest was to get another cord or two and hook them end-to-end. Instead I searced Amazon.com and found DC extension cords up to 25' but I bought two 15 footers. They haven't come yet. We'll see if the fuses hold out when hooked in series.

I purchased one of those after returning this Black and Decker item.

The setting for the amount of air pressure needed is another nice feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"I have only used the Black & Decker ASI300 Inflator once so far. It was easy to use even for someone like me who is not very mechanically equipment inclined.I did need to use an extension cord to be able to reach from the electrical outlet to my inflatable object.A handy good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product good value","review":"The pressure gauge seems to be fairly accurate but not detailed enough for exact pressure shut off. The air station needs a handle of some kind it is difficult to pickup and move to the next tire. The dual power ability is a big plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working","review":"This thing stopped working after 6 minor inflations. I had read others had this problem, but I decided to roll the dice. Black & Decker and other companies in the USA should stop putting their name on Chinese junk.I took it apart to see if there was a fuse inside that may have blown. No such luck. Removing the bottom panel reveals two electric motors, an ac/dc transformer, and a small circuit board. My guess is that a transistor or something on that board is what seems to fail for many people. I would not buy it again if given the choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuse blew after third use.","review":"This seemed like a great product to fulfill my need for a compact air compressor for my bike tires. However the fuse blew after my third use and is not easily replaceable. I will be contacting Black & Decker for a refund. I would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk Stopped Working!","review":"I purchased the Black and Decker ASI300 Air Station 7 months ago and I\`ve used it about once every two weeks to top off my car tires. Just last week it wouldn't work when I plugged it into a wall socket to fill up my car tires, so I tried using the 12V car adapter and it too wouldn't work. After reading several reviews that said it was a bad fuse, I disassembled the unit and unsoldered the fuse from the circuit board to check the fuse for continuity. The fuse was fine but the unit still wouldn't work after re-assembly. My recommendation is that you stay away from the Black and Decker ASI300 Air Station Inflator and spend you money on something more reliable.Sincerely,Joe M."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE!!!","review":"First off, I did not purchase this from Amazon. It was purchased from Lowe's. I'm writing this review for anyone thinking about getting the B&D; ASI300 Air Station Inflator. One word.. DONT!I bought this inflator for the purpose of keeping my tires at the proper PSI. I used it one time to inflate all four tires of my car. The noise was acceptable, I didn't think it would be quiet. It took forever to get to 37 PSI, but once again acceptable for the little inflator. I started in on my spare tire and that's when the inflator made a pop sound and would not turn on again. I figure a fuse inside of it blew. I spent $50 to inflate four tires one time. UNACCEPTABLE! I returned it only 3 hours after purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"$3.81 to top off each tire","review":"About a year ago, I bought one of these. I topped off the tires on my family's two cars. Yesterday, the TPMS warning on my car lit up. I used this again to top off my tires. On the fourth tire, about a second after I started it, I heard a little popping noise and it stopped working. This might just be a blown fuse, but there's no easy access to check/replace it, and no mention of how to do so from the manual. Tech support is only opened M-F 8-5 eastern time, so I'll have to wait to find out.So far, this pump has been good for topping off 11 tires before it failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Luck?","review":"I just picked one of these up at Lowe's. Everything else I've ever bought that was made by Black & Decker was great, except this. I tried to fill an air tank I had which maxed out at 150 psi, I set the dial to 120 and let it run. About 10 minutes later it shut down, which it should do when it reaches the desired psi setting. In this case it had reached 85 psi and shut off. The unit smelled and felt very hot. After letting it cool, I was not able to get it running again. It may have blown a fuse, I'm not sure, but in either case it should not have gotten so hot and shut off well before it hit it's own limits. It looked like a nice unit, very handy, and good reviews found here which is why I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I bought this product 2 years ago for car and bike tires. It works ok, but is very loud and slow. It takes about 10 minutes per car tire, and that is just to raise about 5 psi each. The noise is so loud that you need to set the pressure and then leave the garage, unless you put on hearing protection. I did like the auto shut off feature. I could have lived with the slowness and the noise if it were not for the fact that they keep breaking. The first one broke after about 1 and 1/2 years of use. The replacement only made it about six months. They just stop working. I am done with Black and Decker. (Come to think of it, I have never had a B & D product that worked very well....)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY. INFERIOR PRODUCT. VERY SHORT CABLES.","review":"Vastly inferior to its predecessor product. Very disappointed. Can't understand how the same firm can come out with a product so INFERIOR to its predecessor.

DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product from B&D","review":"Here's the short and sweetPros:1. Works well, looks good as well2. Low noise and vibration (In my experience)3. AC & DC powered4. Cords stored inside the unit in a compartment5. Carrying handle6. Auto shut-off featureCons:1. Very hard to fit all cords back in the the unit. ( I thought about cutting off the AC cord with a pair of pliers to make room)2. Handle at the back is awkward and fingers kept pressing against the power switch.3. AC cord very short and the DC cord is not very long either4. DC cord has to be removed from the compartment and plugged in the back each time.5. The plastic top does not appear sturdy and the edges of the compartment's lid are somewhat sharpI guess I was expecting better from the brand and for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased With The Unit","review":"I purchased this to provide a source of air for my tires along a road trip spanning over 3300 miles each way! I just completed the first leg of the trip, and was very pleased with the performance of this unit. It's small enough that it does not take up much room at all, and this means a lot since I drive a very small car. It would add 5psi to a tire on my car in about 30 seconds. I did not find the noise level to be that loud, and the fact that it comes with a generously long cord for plugging it into a cigarette lighter port it was easy to ensure all 4 of my tires stayed properly inflated. Would recommend this to anyone who is often on the road or to anyone who just tires of having to find a gas station and quarters to work their air pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed for heavy duty use","review":"Don't waste your money! I took delivery of this unit and the next day it was in the trash. I purchased this pump because the literature describes the pump as being able to deliver up to 160 psi. We have G rated tires on our RV that need 125 psi. The first time we attempted to top off a tire the compressor blew something inside and began leaking. I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance good, usability terrible.","review":"The only pro to this pump is that it pumps like a champ.The cons are:Smooth exterior, no handle, relatively heavy and therefore easy to drop.Extremely short air hose and AC power cord.Cover for the short hose and AC power cord, but no cover for the DC power cord, it comes unraveled in the trunk.The power button is located inside the DC power cord storage area so you either have to take out the DC power cord to get to the power switch or you have to try to force your fingers into the compartment to get it to turn on.Useless \\"industrial\\" add-ons of faux nuts which are just little plastic pieces that fall off."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"Great while it lasted, inflated my car and bicycle tires, 32 and 100 psi respectively, just fine and the automatic shutoff was reasonably accurately, compared to my tire pressure gauge.

Cords too short and on off switch in awful place . Terrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts out, doesn't work","review":"This thing has some sort of pressure detector that says it will stop inflating when there is enough air in the tire, basketball, etc. But it's worthless because it cut out 3 seconds after I turned it on and then wouldn't turn on again.Worthless--I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction","review":"I didn't use this compressor very frequently, maybe once every couple months. It annoyed me that the tube and attachments didn't fit correctly in the storage compartment, and that the power cord was not long enough. But after having this for around a year (and using it a handful of times) it just stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if only it worked.","review":"I love the design and concept of this pump, however, the fuse will blow very easily, then the whole thing is trash. My husband is an electrical engineer, so he tore the thing apart and added a new fuse, twice, but it still keeps blowing fuses! So, as nice as it is, it's really just an expensive paperweight. Stay away! I'm looking for a pump now that will actually do what it's supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Air pump","review":"The Air pump works great. I finally had the chance to use it and it inflated the tire to the proper pressure and stopped after you set the amount it should be. That's good. I could walk away from it. It is powerful too. The hose is a bit short. It could be about 6 to 10 inches longer. This is one of the few pumps that works on AC and the accessory plug in your car. So it is a very good purchase. I would really rate this at 4 and half stars and almost 5 just because of the short inflator hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor durability","review":"I've had 2 of these, and both worked great, for about 2 months or so.

It works well and shuts off when the dialed in pressure is reached. The switch to turn it on and off is quite awkward and the DC cord needs to be pulled out to turn it on and it toggles one way for AC and the other for DC. It's also hard to see what you are doing as it's in the back of the unit. It should be in front by the pressue dial."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not last","review":"It worker great a couple of times, then it quit when I was filling up a tire.

The first one failed after a couple of uses - it started leaking internally. Today my replacement failed - started making a different sound that sounds like something is stripped inside. I'm using it to inflate tires to 60, 72 and 80 lbs - so I'd say that's likely the problem. I guess I need to get a 'real' compressor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This unit is terrible; don't buy it","review":"I got this as a gift, otherwise I would have returned it. The AC power cord requires an extension cord since it's ridiculously short. It cannot be used without an extension cord at all. The product design is terrible. The on/off switch is located inside the unit behind the DC power cord, so you have to pull that out even if you want to plug it into the wall. The unit is supposed to inflate to the PSI you set it to - that did not work properly on mine. I basically had to set it all the way up to max PSI to get it to pump up the tire on a baby stroller. Finally, it's incredibly awkward to handle. I'm surprised they didn't put some sort of handle on it. Black and Decker used to mean quality; this thing is terrible. I hope it breaks so I can buy a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase Other Brand","review":"Anyone considering purchasing this product should save your money and buy a different brand.

Using the a/c power, the d/c cord has to be removed from it's storage to get to the on switch. Very inconvenient! The a/c cord and the air hose should both be about 6 feet longer. Who wants to get out an extension cord every time they want to plug it in? The coupler on the air hose is very flimsy, cheap and can't last long. The previous model air station was so superior to the new one and it was made in the USA! It was a/c power only but had long cords and hoses and wrap around storage for them. The switch was easy to get to. That thing was used almost daily, like any other home appliance. New one needs re-designed again to be much more user friendly, and made with better quality materials, such as a metal coupler and re-in-forced air hose.

I asked for it - by model number - so nobody to blame but myself. I was surprised to find the power cord is only a foot long - if that! I don't know about you, but I rarely park that close to an outlet. Even if I did park right next to one, the outlets in my garage are high enough that the compressor would have to hang from it's own cord. It would not reach the floor. Maybe building code varies from region to region, but outlets in my garage were part of new construction - not added by the owner incorrectly.This will work fine for the person looking to inflate an air mattress/sports ball. There is no reason you could not do so indoors - using an outlet just above the floor.

It's a little more simplistic than the blue one and a little less dynamic and complex than Pinkerton (which by the way is their best). Granted, they have drifted slightly moreso into the realm of pop music , but unlike other certain extremely bitter reviewers, I don't think an appearance on TRL is necessarily bad - I pay more attention to the music of the group and not the image. The album is relatively enjoyable; its catchy. It's good to listen to in a fun environment, such as hanging out with friends, or driving, but if you're looking for substance and dynamics in your music, check out Pinkerton. Not too much deep thinking going on in the lyrics, and most of the guitar solos simply follow the melody of the words exactly. But nonetheless (and to be redundant one last time), it is overall not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why?

The day I found out that they would be on \\"TRL\\", I knew something was horribly wrong. And there was. The Green Album is uninspired, bland, and completely out of vein with all of the other beautiful work Weezer has done. \\"Hash Pipe\\" is the best song on this album, so that should really put it in perspective for you. I really, really hope that Cuomo and Company redeem themselves with a good album after this (preferably like Pinkerton). Old and new Weezer fans will be disappointed by this not-even-30-minute long album, but maybe the mobs of teeny-boppers will find some joy in it.

This album, to me, sounds like Weezer was just desperately trying to recapture the profitability of their debut, only now there's no substance left.

I heard Weezer was putting together a new album, so I got out my copy of 'the blue album' and listened to it from beginning to end, and what a great and ORIGINAL sounding record it is. As far as this album, its not as great as 'the blue album' or as far out as 'Pinkerton' but it stands out, almost like it compliments their previous two releases.I would say it's fairly impossible to recreate the magic that came from 'the blue album' but they have definitely got the hooks and catchy songs this time around, sprinkled with simple guitar riffs and laden with really great lyrics.If your a Weezer fan or even just a music fan, pick this album up, not to mention the other two albums.

Evolution Shmevolution, I say. This cd is a masterpiece of hip, surf tunes, and is totally worthy of the Weezer name. It is a bit on the short side, though, but don't worry, the cd is like a quick hit of prozac, and boy, is it good.The best songs, I think are Photograph, Hash Pipe, Island in the Sun, and the best, O Girlfriend. Buy this album, no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than my dreams had hoped for!","review":"They've done it... again! Weezer returns with an album so catchy, singable, and fun that it will be hard for anyone to resist. The album contains pure and simple rock, a welcome alternative to the mass of crap metal out there. \\"Hash Pipe\\" is a fist-shaking, head banging anthem to, of all things, drug addicts. \\"Island in the Sun\\", if released as a single, WILL be number ONE on the the charts, it is so musically excellent. It has a soft riff and well timed \\"yeas\\" that are irresistable, along with a heavier, shoutable chorus. The rest of the album glistens with melodic rock songs about love and life, harkening back to old Weezer favorites like \\"No One Else\\" and \\"In the Garage\\". While you won't hear much of anything that resembles their deeply fan adored Pinkerton songs, the album does have a distinct feel different from their first album. It is hands down THE must-buy album of rock n roll this year. Thank god for Weezer."},{"rating":"1","title":"In it for the GREEN","review":"Well, this album looks to go at least platinum probably. They'll lose most of their credibility beyond their die-hard fans, and probably lose a somewhat significant chunk of their fanbase. But hey, look at the bright side! They'll gain it back with all the teeny-boppers and trend-followers from the MTV audience! Sorry, but this album just isn't Weezer to me. It's a homogenized, commercialized version of what they once represented: good rock music. I guess there is a glimmer of hope for a good album after the success of this one, but I wouldn't be too optimistic about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"28 minutes long, and the second half of the cd sounds the same. All the songs follow the exact same format, verse chorus, verse guitar solo repeating the verse, chorus. Unlike their other CDs this is unimaginative, rushed, and overall crappy. I want to throw it out of my window but I'm afraid someone will pick it up and have their ears infected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can anyone say sellout?","review":"This album was terrible. Enough said. I hated it. They have moved away from teh weezer of the Blue Album and Pinkerton to this utter crap that was made to try and relive their legend of the 90s. Sorry, but after they lost Matt Sharp, they lost their touch. You can't have teh same music without the originals. Well, at least they got rid of Mikey Welsh and replaced him with Scott Shriner, who is taking the band down the road of Nu Metal and 80s rock. That isn't weezer though. Weezer is weezer, the deep lyrics of Pinkerton ad the fun of the blue album is no more, and now they are shallow and insecure. Sorry to dissappoint you, but they suck now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This has definetly been worth the five year wait.Weezer return with a stunning new album and prove they are one of the best bands of the 90s and now 00s.

(I still can't stop listening to Pinkerton and The Blue Album 'God Damn those half Japanese girls'I think Weezer have such an honest following is because they are so hones, from Rivers lyrics to the stunning guitars. There is just something real and authentic about the way these guy play music.Standout tracks - all 10 (and if you are in the uk an extra one)Buy it now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer 2 sucks!!!!","review":"Easily the worst Weezer album.

Things went from good to terrible in just a few years. How sad. Has anyone heard the so-called \\"single\\" \\"Hash Pipe?\\" It's not even a decent song, let alone a single-worthy track. And \\"Island in the Sun?\\" Talk about hokey. I hate the part where they say \\"hip hip\\" or \\"hit hit\\" or whatever. How stupid! Can't they write real lyrics instead of just saying nonsense crap? Everything after \\"Pinkerton\\" sucks. Trust me. I am your master. I've given up on Weezer and so should you.

My 18 year old brother keeps telling me that At The Drive In, The Dismemberment Plan, Fugazi, and Sparta is real emo. Well, all of those bands are stupid ripoff bands with lame lyrics.

I had heard hash pipe being played to death on the radio, and although it didn't remind me of old weezer, it had a hook u cant deny. So i bought the album shortly after it was released, and popped it into my car. I was so shocked when nothing else on the album had the rough rock sound of hash pipe, instead it was all smooth polished pop rock. I was so dissapointed that i almost never listened to the album ever again. But then i played it over again, and again... and i'll be damned if that thing isn't still in my car. Although i now skip the last half of the album, those first 5 songs put me into a better mood, just like the old weezer did. Each album is different, take em each for what they are... pure weezer genius.

Until they actually heard the album, that is. That Rivers Coumo denounced Pinkerton and proclaimed the Green Album their greatest so far is a view he will live to regret. The Green album is decent according to the precedents set this year with all the PapaStaindVayne garbage, but the generic lyrics and repetitive riffs are mind-numbing at best, especially when compared to Pinkerton."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Weezer album","review":"I became a little concerned when I kept hearing bad things about the new Weezer album, but I decided to go with my instinct and bought it. Well I am glad I did, because Weezer did a hell of a job with this one, and though it is only 10 tracks it will completly satisfy any fan new or old. The whole entire album is honestly 5 stars which I can rarely say about most new albums put out by artists I used to like. Standout tracks include \\"Don't let go\\", \\"Photograph\\" (with a kind of \\"Buddy Holly\\" feel to it), \\"Hash Pipe\\", \\"Island in the sun\\", \\"Knock- down drag-out\\", \\"Simple Pages\\" & \\"Glorious Day\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing that hasn't already been said","review":"This is a great power pop record, way too short, but great for driving and singing along to"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop, Rock, Weezer","review":"Weezer have always had a poppy feel to their music, whether you want to admit it to yourself or not. The poppy hook has always been there and that is part of the genius of the band. Their new album is slightly poppier, but still has the weezer sound. The weezer sound however, has changed. After losing their bass player his music influence, and trademark falcedo voice are both missing from the new album. Overall its a great album. A band has to evolve with time, as much as we liked the old weezer we need to love the new one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer has yet to release a bad song, but....","review":"The songs on Weezer's desperately awaited 2001 s/t album seethe with all the liberating pure rock and roll emotion of their past efforts. It is NOT a rehash of the blue album, it is far too mellow to be called such. However, the album receives four stars and not five for the lack of two major elements that rounded out the tunes of 'Ole Blue into 10 of the greatest rock songs ever composed: the screaming, heartfelt, and perfectly brief guitar solos and the soul-seering tear of River's vocal WAILS, such as appear at the end of \\"In the Garage\\", \\"Only in Dreams\\", and \\"the workers are going home\\" part of \\"My Name is Jonas\\". I think most of you know what I'm talking about. This is a great album that lacks some of the intricacies that would make it even comparable to blue...however, still HIGHLY recommended to all. Weezer now has 3 unbelievably cool albums under their belt. Hallelujah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer go a little more mainstream,","review":"But the die hards will still enjoy. The album stil has great songs, but there exists a lacking of builds ups and 8 minute songs such as only in dreams).

Singer/songwriter Rivers Cuomo seems to have completely removed himself emotionally from the music he's producing, and it's a shame, considering how great the first two Weezer albums were. Sure, they were a little immature as far as content, but every song had a heart and infected listeners like some glorious plague. This is a totally heartless album. \\"Hash Pipe\\" and \\"Photograph\\" are saved by a little bit of humor, but most of the music and lyrics are extremely bland (lyrics for \\"Island in the Sun\\" and \\"O Girlfriend\\" are outright embarrassing, considering Rivers isn't 15 years old). It's too bad Cuomo didn't challenge himself a little bit more, and it's too bad that fans had to wait almost 5 years for 28 minutes of soulless fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want it, you can have it...","review":"I am a long time Weezer fan, and I like every Weezer CD. Like most fans, my favorite Weezer CD's are Pinkerton and The Blue Album, but for me, this one and Maladroit aren't that bad either.I like this one a little bit better than Maladroit. This CD is definitely their poppiest and brightest CD yet. You can just look at the titles and see that (\\"Smile\\", \\"Glorious Day\\"). But even though it's quite poppy and peppy, it's not pop from your average boy band. This is Weezer, so you'll still hear a little hard rock in there (\\"Hash Pipe\\").My favorites are \\"Don't Let Go\\", \\"Crab\\", \\"Knock-down Drag-out\\", and \\"Glorious Day\\".Yeah, you probably remember \\"Undone\\" and \\"Buddy Holly\\" from 1994. So go ahead, re-introduce yourself to Weezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Album:Mediocre for Weezer,Still Better than Most Music","review":"Okay- so Pinkerton is the best Weezer album, pretty much everyone agrees on that - this is a more pop-like album for Weezer and the songs aren't as great and memorable as some of the ones on Weezer's other albums, but still they are a great band and compared to other bands this album is pretty good. If you are a new Weezer fan, I would suggest you start with the Blue Album or Pinkerton, but the Green Album deserves a listen, too. It is great to see how the band has changed and progressed, so any Weezer fan should have this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fall of self-absorbed nerd rock","review":"The changing lineup known as Weezer was first introduced to a post-Nirvana era in 1994, playing the role as the cute, nerdy fuzz rock band you couldn't resist. Then after the departure of Matt Sharp (who could have made him want to leave? hmm...), the quartet went from a poppy Pavement rip-off (Self-titled, Pinkerton) to a grungie Roy Orbison (the Green Album). This third effort to squeeze whatever money they could from fat Hot Topic chicks with pig tails was the most bland and incomplete garbage to ever come from Cuomo's indulgent brain. They could've done us a favor and performed a mass suicide on TRL, but instead chose to continue the poison onward with Maladroit (a name coming from a fan that Bell proclaimed as \\"smart\\"). I was once a religious man, but these last couple of albums have made me question if there could be a God, and if so, why does he hate me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell were they thinking","review":"WHAT IS THIS! Weezer did not make this album. after making 2 amazing albums they come back after hiatus with this pos. Every song is a cheesy radio song (which is kind of weezers trademark, but these have no edge), the guitar solos just mimic the vocal pattern, this album is just not rockin. if any other band made this album it might be half way decent, but a band as respected as weezer can do much better than this. If you dont own any weezer albums, dont buy this one. The green album does not do this amazing band justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"weezer - matt sharp = unintelligent pop.","review":"weezer's original self titled album, aka the blue album, is a timeless classic. their sophomore release, \\"pinkerton\\", didn't quite offer what their debut release did, but is still worth purchasing. the latest in the self titled collection, aka the green album, is a pathetic attempt at an album. all of the songs lack the substance that the earlier material contained. and to make matters worse, the disc is shorter than a typical 30 minute teeny bopper television show that a newer weezer fan would watch. how can any band release an \\"album\\" that is less than 30 minutes and not think it an insult to their dedicated fans? matt sharp's departure from weezer after \\"pinkerton\\" has proven nothing but disastrous for the band. if any former weezer fans reading this have an unfulfilled desire for the intelligent pop rock we knew as weezer, look into matt sharp's current project, the rentals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer is dead","review":"Therer was once a time when i too was ecstatic at the thought of another weezer album. Haveing had the pleasure of seeing them in their prime, i considered myself quite a weezer addict. And for those of you who do not believe that Pinkerton is an amzing album, you obviously have no idea what you are talking about. So then the green Album came out, and what a great day it was for us all. But by about the third time through on my car stereo i realized this was no blue, and definately no Pinkerton. I could not believe what Rivers had done, and he could loose total conciousness of who he is, in a total quest to be a cliche rockstar. If you like Blink 182 and that other rubsish, by all means buy this album, but if you are really looking for some real music that doesn't have the same sound song after god damn song keep looking, becuase you are not going to find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"i remember when this album first came out: it was my sophomore year of high school, the cover was blue, they had a different bassist... oh, wait a minute...this cd is not the band's best work. \\"hash pipe\\" is a relatively catchy song. however, if you have heard that track, you have heard them all: simple pop songs with just enough guitar bite to retain credibility, vocal melodies cleverly disguised as guitar solos, you get the idea.this disc is not as refreshing as 'the blue record' was and its not as punk (for lack of a better word) as 'pinkerton'.weezer played it too safely this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Let Down","review":"I was anxiously awaiting this album and rushed to get it. Unfortunately, it lacked the depth of the previous 2 albums. The songs were short, very short. This album is done before I commute to work everyday. After reading that Rivers Cuomo had 100 songs written I found myself asking, \\"Why ten songs, this short and this uninteresting?\\" Crab is an interesting track. There are no real standouts on this record. Nothing like other songs such as THe World has Turned and Left me Here, My Name is Jonas, or Pink Triangle, Tired of Sex. The record seemed to fall into the rut of Blink 182 and behaved as if the attention span of the average American listener was only 2 or 3 minutes. Sorry guys this album just was not up to snuff. If I were you Rivers, I would jump back into the studio and release a few more of your other tracks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy pop songs...but talent? No.","review":"It seems like everyone in high school who shops at thrift stores likes Weezer. Sure, Cuomo can write a catchy melody that gets stuck in your head, but catchy does not equate talent. This is no better than the rest of the mindless pop/\\"nu metal\\"/\\"punk\\" crap you hear on the radio every day. High school kids who shop at thrift stores, wear horn rimmed glasses, and have those ridiculous bowling shoes listen to Weezer because they think by listening to a band that doesn't get played on the radio all the time, it will mean they have good taste in music. These types of kids all dress and talk the same, they're just as much a clique as the Abercrombie crowd. Go ahead and try to convince yourself that Weezer has talent, but if you do that you might as well start listening to Britney Spears because they're both in the same ever growing boat of horrendous popular music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer's best album","review":"I've sampled nearly all of Weezer's albums, but this album and Maladroit were the only two I felt compelled to buy. This album delivers ten songs that sound very similar to one another, the only real difference being song tempo. The standout tracks are definitely \\"Hash Pipe\\" and \\"Island in the Sun.\\" Weezer's best album to date, better than Maladroit and surprisingly better than Make Believe.

The only reason i bought this was beacause I liked the song \\"Hash Pipe\\" which is the one and only good song on this stupid CD.I'm really glad there's only 10 songs on this CD because they most likely would have [been] just as bad as the other 9.I can't see how people like these guys. If people go arounf saying \\"These lyrics are touching and they're so uplifting\\" well gues what?????? YOUR DEAD WRONG!!!

Well, I got it and well, it .... Obviously after the commercial failure of Pinkerton they were under heavy pressure from thier record label to recreate their self-titled debut (blue album). That might explain why they had to rewrite songs several times and keep pushing back the release date because the label wasn't happy. Well, the record industry wins again!!! Weezer has now created an album as mindless and safe as the latest N'Sync album. Boring pop songs that you've already heard a million times with the same wo-wo chorus. This to me almost sounds like a collection of B-sides (but not as good as most Weezer b-sides)."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 28 mins long???","review":"Some catchy tunes, all the songs blend into each other and before you know it the CD is done!!! less than 1/2 hour of music.These guys could be really great, there previous albums prove that.This seemed like a project that Weezer rushed out to get something on the shelf so we wouldn't forget who they are.

Where were the sweet guitar riffs of the Blue Album and the clever lyrics and complex arrangements of Pinkerton? Maybe I'm way off base, but Rivers Cuomo is a clever guy and I don't know if he would write songs that have no meaning. His record company was not happy with the sales of Pinkerton, ignoring the fact that it was a masterpiece. Could he have written these simple (yet still entertaining) songs as kind of a frustrated \\"here's the music YOU wanted\\"? This is purely speculation, as it's impossible to know what he was intending, but listen to Simple Pages and Glorious Day and think about it. This album gets better every time I listen to it, and no matter his intention there are some incredibly catchy melodies that are refreshing compared to what is selling millions of records today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent c.d.,but alittle on the short side","review":"After 5 years of patiently waiting Weezer has released a new c.d. But is it good? YES! Every single track is freaken awsome, Photograph,Hash Pipe,Island in the Sun, and O'Girlfriend were a few of my favorite tracks. The Green Album to me seems reminisant of The Blue Alblum,the way the songs sound is awfully simulaur. And the single Hash Pipe has it's own sound diffrent than the two albums before it. Even if all the songs kick a**,it still too short,in fact that's the only reason it didn't get 5 stars. It takes 5 years to release a 10 song c.d.? I don't think so. And it's only 28 min. long.

My favorites are \\"Photograph\\", \\"Island in the Sun\\" and \\"Simple Pages.\\" But all of the songs are cool.

If you liked Pinkerton, you probably won't enjoy this one too much. Pinkerton was really a completely different style of music than Blue. If you liked both (like me) you'll enjoy this album, but will still look forward to some more Pinkerton-ish songs coming from weezer (i hope!).If I were Rivers, after \\"failing\\" with Pinkerton I would be more reserved about returning to that type of music, which is why I don't think it's likely we'll see (hear?) more pinkerton-ish music for a while. :((9"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I am a big Weezer fan, and have been looking forward to them regrouping for the new record.

Now little more than bubble gum rock from from a bygone era. But there are little gems in this otherwise mediocre offering. Hash pipe comes to mind with it's quirky vocals, and for some reason I think Island in the sun will appeal to all you Trashcan Sinatra fans out there.Smile is reminiscent of an Oasis B-side. Other than that, the tracks basically come together template style. Three chord, simple lyric music has been overdone overmuch as of late. I still enjoy this album because it's not challenging in the least. A simple listen when simple music is in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overly bashed album; listen to the MUSIC people!!!!","review":"Weezer had taken a hiatus after their masterful second album, Pinkerton. That album was much harsher than their HUGELY successful debut. This comeback effort is more in the power-pop mold, and despite what the \\"cool\\" hipsters think, that's a good thing. This is a fun record, with a sunny sound that stands out from today's sludge of generic woe-is-me bands. The songs are there, the vocal melodies are great and the lyrics are cool (as River's always makes sure they are). The formulaic guitar solos are the only slight knock on this album, but they're not BAD, just not too original; they basically play the vocal melody over again. Hash Pipe and Island In the Sun were the hits, but O Girlfriend, Glorious Day, Photograph are all great too. This album top to bottom is awesome, a huge step on the way back for the Weez. Don't believe the hype and feel the summer love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight Weezer doesn't cut it","review":"Nobody loved \\"Weezer\\" and \\"Pinkerton\\" more than me, and that's why I can say wholeheartedly that \\"Green\\" (or whatever we're supposed to call it) sounds like a bunch of dumb kids imitating Weezer. It has none of the intelligence, imagination, and wry wit of their first two albums. In fact, all it does have is Rivers Cuomo's reedy voice and the wall of guitars. Where are the riveting guitar leads? The neck-snapping shifts in dynamics? The delicate guitar intros and intervals? The intricate vocal arrangements and harmonies? And most of all, the sincerity, the warmth, and the passion?Green leaves me cold. Light and poppy, with no guts at all. Serious Weezer fans may as well pass this one up and wait until Cuomo starts getting serious about his songwriting again, and stops worrying so much about what his fans think. Teen angst. Get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Shock","review":"Being a Weezer fan since the day I heard the blue album, and a diehard since I heard Pinkerton, Weezers return to music in the form of \\"Weezer(2001)\\" was an exciting prospect. Although I did not believe they could top their masterpiece(pinkerton), I expected at worst, a strong effort from a great band.I got far less than that. Instead I received 30 minutes of emotion-derived, boring, simplistic, radio-friendly songs from a band that USED to be good. I can only hope this is rock bottom for weezer, and they will rebound from this atrosity. Songs like don't let go, knock-down dragout and glorious day show how unimaginative this album really is. While I believe the album has some solid songs(Hash Pipe and O' Girlfriend) they are heavily outweighed by the generic sound the rest of the songs have. Simply put, don't waste your money(although you don't have to worry about wasting your time, its only 30 minutes long after all)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhh..... Well..... Its..... Short......","review":"This album is brought down by really only one factor: it's too short. I waited 5 years for not even 28 minutes of Weezer. I mean, I like the songs, they may not be as good as the stuff on The Blue Album or Pinkerton, they're still quirky and well-written, its just the album (as a whole) fails somehow. I know I'm restating what 724 others have said, but it's so true, and the direction Weezer went in after this album dissapointed not only me, but old fans of Weezer and critics alike. Have a wonderful day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst album ever","review":"After 5 years i think everyone was expecting a lot more but Weezer just couldnt match the myth that they had become. there are some good songs on this album but nothing too amazing. actually the songs on this album are kinda forgettable and bland. i would get maladroit over this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Heck of an album!","review":"Weezer's third album is a collection of 10 catchy pop/rock tunes. I would say 9 out of 10 of the songs are awesome the only track that doesn't stand out as much from the others would be \\"Knock-down Drag-Out.\\" While all the rest are amazing. \\"Don't Let Go\\" and \\"Photograph\\" demand to be sung along to. You can't stand still during the hard rocking \\"Hash Pipe\\" and you can't help but mellow out to the smooth \\"Island in the Sun\\". \\"O Girlfriend\\" is also one of the finest tracks Weezer has ever produced. While this album is not the exposed raw nerve that was Pinkerton and does not feature a lot of super personal lyrics which Weezer fans have come to depend on, it is a fine fine rock album. I would say it's about 30 steps above every other album that will be released this year. It's already my #1 pick for Album of the year. A must listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess a Harvard degree in music isn't worth very much","review":"After a four year wait, and after hearing \\"Hash Pipe\\" for the first time, I was really excited about getting the green album. The song was heavy and edgy and it seemed that the band was really moving into a brand new direction (following the change from the peppy blue album into the the rawness of Pinkerton).I was so disappointed to find out that \\"hash pipe\\" was the only song that stood out as the \\"new\\" Weezer sound.Many tracks sound too similar and get boring despite the album is only 30 minutes long and the drums aren't too exciting either.I still think that Rivers is an awesome guitar player, but the green album is mostly mediocre.And what's with the dumb '10 song only' trend? After being away for so long, the band should have put at LEAST 13 or 14 tracks to give the fans their money's worth for paying the price for a full LP, not an over-priced EP."},{"rating":"1","title":"take blue album, remove thought and charm.","review":"this album was INCREDIBLY, STUPIFYINGLY disappointing. to call it bland and pointless is almost too nice. here we have a man who has written hundreds upon hundreds of songs in the last 3 years, who has written some fine melodic pop-rock in his day, and this is the BEST he can do? i mean, when the only song that stands out of the blandness is \\"Hash Pipe,\\" it's clear something has gone horribly, horribly wrong.this all may sound harsh, but honestly - who told rivers [cuomo, the singer/songwriter/guitarist of the band] that he could write an album of filler?painfully bad lyrics, empty melodies, absence of emotion and charm - that about sums up weezer's \\"green album.\\" at least we know they can't get any worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"El Crapo","review":"This album defies logic. It is weezer - yet is stinks. Do not listen to all the brainwashed \\"5 star 'cuz it's weezer idiots\\". This album has two good songs (Island in the sun & Hash Pipe). The rest of the album rots. If you do not own PINKERTON - go and buy it - if you have a sensitive bone in your booty - PINKERTON will touch you and rawk you - this green album is VERY STERILE. The next album better be better than this offering - otherwise I won't spend my hard earned dough on this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Semi-...Good","review":"I think that this cd compared to the first cd is kind of lacking, mostly in the time it takes up.. it is a very good cd but a little more mellow than what i was jonesin for.

Go out and buy it. dont get your friend to burn it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"I really don't know how any Weezer fan can really say this is a great album. There is nothing here that comes close to the previous records... I realize being a fan means sticking by your band no matter what is released, but don't believe anyone who gave this record more than two stars... every song has the same formula... verse, chorus, verse, chorus, then solo that mimics the verse...followed by the final chorus... this album is so predictable and i'm disappointed that the talented rivers delivered this cop out... i'm a huge fan of the band and look forward to the next album... there were quite a lot of songs written during the last five years, why they chose these 10 B sides is beyond me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of bland...","review":"I thought the bad reviews were likely wrong because they were all written by pop-hating music snobs. They weren't. How many words is this now? Aaand done."},{"rating":"1","title":"CATCHY BUT UNINSPIRED","review":"The rhythm guitar is nothing but random noise, every solo just mimics the singing melody, and the only songs that don't sound alike are the singles. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the blue album, Pinkerton, and Make Believe, I think this is utter garbage, and any critic who liked this must've been smoking something serious. Most of the album is just mish mash and noise. TERRIBLE!! Actual rating 1 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Solid, Catchy... but not up to Weezer standards","review":"I've listened to this CD through about ten times now and, like the other Weezer albums, it gets better every time. But when you look at the amazing blue album and how insanely infectious those songs were, and then Pinkerton, which people who actually own (instead of just heard once and dismissed) agree is even better, you have to expect a lot from the green album. And frankly, it just doesn't deliver. It's really good, don't get me wrong, but can it match the sublime beauty of Pinkerton? No. No frenzied guitar solos to make you jump around playing air guitar. No anguished screams to imitate. What it comes down to is this: the green album lacks the vital energy that characterized the blue album and Pinkerton. Maybe it will just take more listening before it takes it's place with the rest of the Weezer repertoire, but I have my doubts."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the wait","review":"not Weezer's best work. Lacks the poppy craftsmanship of the first record. It also lacks the power and intensity of Pinkerton. What happened? Matt Sharp left. Perhaps Rivers and the guys are getting complacent, but this record fails to rock, and it failed to get stuck in my head. Buy Pinkerton if you haven't already. I'll be looking for an improved 4th record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyous Little Record.","review":"I've had this CD for several years and am only now taking the time to mention it but the Green Album is an even and invigorating release. It's short but it raises your blood pressure a little bit with every listen. I find it arousing and elevating which are emotions that all of us can use in the course of the day. I'd have to rate it slightly ahead of Maladroit on the Weezer scale--a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuckey!","review":"This is a terrible piece of [junk]! The only good songs on it are Island in the Sun and Hash Pipe. The bass player [stinks], Rivers [stinks] on lead guitar. JUST BUY THE SINGLES!

This will turn away those not already familiar with the Weezer brand of rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of 2001","review":"Perfectly crafted pop gems.

The Green Album is bad without anyone's (except maybe River's) help.it almost seems as though the weezer think tank got together and thought, \\"hmm. Pinkerton was beautifully produced with exciting instrumentation and thoughtful lyrics but it only sold half a million copies. new plan! lets make a boring, uninspired album with the most hackneyed and emotionally devoid hooks we can come up with! it'll work, it's just gotta!\\"congratulations weezer, you did it. brainless teenage girls worldwide salute you."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL LETDOWN","review":"Damn you Weezer! Why abandon all the musical growth you present on Pinkerton, and replace it with THIS POPPY CRAP. Its the blue album WITHOUT THE CATCHYNESS!!! every song drags you to the next one, no tempo or mood changes at all... The new bass player sucks too. He plays every damn song EXACT the same notes as the guitar. I saw Weezer on the green album tour, and was not impressed too many Green album songs - NO PINKERTON SONGS AT ALL, and a lot of songs from Maladroit wich also sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"this is a terrible album,it's like they weren't even trying,i didnt expect much from the first single hash pipe but i figured i'd get this album on vinyl just for whatever's sake cause i had just gotten a turntable. this is a completely unredeeming release, it's all filler, incredibly short and just boring. pinkerton rules and the blue one rocks too,you don't want this, believe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst collection of music released by man:","review":"This is an incorrigible, pitiful excuse for a modern rock album.If you want personality, depth, good production, and lyrics that won't unintentionally inspire laughing fits, look elsewhere.

My little brother could come up with a riff that's better than Hash Pipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited all these years for a disappointment!","review":"I am sorry, but weezer aka weenier is much more about portraying an \\"image\\" than they are about music.

Weezer Green Album=daiben"},{"rating":"1","title":"28 minutes of the same songs","review":"only 10 songs? 28 minutes? And the same price as most other albums. This one was not worth the buy. Much of the songs seem productively hurried as if studio time came into account. With the exception of three songs: Hash Pipe, Island in the Sun, and O Girlfriend, the rest pretty much put out a passive sound. Sounding the same one after another. Making the 28 minutes feel like and hour and half. After patiently waiting for this album, it has fallen short of everything and these days, with MP3's and free downloads, one or two songs can no longer carry an album to sell.Other albums released this year that are worth buying are Linkin Park - Hybrid Thoery, Incubus - Morning View, Stone Temple Pilots - Shangri-La Dee Da, and Staind - Break the Cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"say it ain't so","review":"Ok, I certainly agree with a lot of reviewers, as well as my frinds that this album falls way short of what a highly anticipated album should be.

Every song is so finely crafted and the sound is truly the best. How does a group come along and just make wonderful mucis like this? Some days I have played this CD more than once in a row, as in like three times in a row! It's incredible to find music that is so good these days. I like most of the music on the radio, but sometimes its fun to fine music that is not played o nthe radio, but is still good. This is truly the best out there!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bland","review":"This CD has to be the most bland record out there right now by a band that knows better. A very big disappointment.

I thought that Pinkerton was a great CD, but it just wasn't as good as the Blue Album. In the Green Album, Weezer has gone back to its roots.

Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer 2001","review":"With the release of the so called \\"Green Album\\" comes some disapointment. After five years of waiting there is finally a new Weezer cd. This newest album is probably just as good as the other two but I was expecting more. At times its a little too pop but there are some great tracks. The major flaw is the time at 28 minutes. I will definitly recomend this cd but the other two are definitly better.

I first listened to Weezer after seeing the Buddy Holly video on MTV. Liked that so much I bought the CD. Loved that. That and Collective Soul's new album \\"Hints, Allegations...\\" were all I listened to for a while.Then Pinkerton came out, and I bought it without knowing anything about it. I was still very impressed. Moodier, but still resonated with me.Then green came out, and again, I assumed that I would love it. I had heard \\"Hash Pipe\\" on the radio, and wasn't impressed with it, but figured that the rest of the disc would be better. Well, it wasn't. I can't put my finger on it (although many others have), but it just isn't the same. I mean, Pinkerton was different than blue, but it all sounded like there was a continuity at work. Green just sounded like they stopped caring. I listened to it a few times, then put it away for a few months. Then I listened to it again. Dang, that thing is bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whee!","review":"I really liked this album. =) It's not really my thing, normally...I'm more into metal.

It seems that alot of people favor their first two albums more, so I'll look into buying those sometime, if I can. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This CD might pass as four or five stars for other bands, but I think Weezer fans deserve more after waiting five years for this album.After the amazing Blue Album and the brilliant (though highly underrated) Pinkerton, the Green Album feels like a step back for the band.Most of the songs are just catchy melodies with lyrics empty of meaning and all summed up in a quick 2-3 minutes (where are the \\"Only in Dreams\\" songs?). The few decent songs: Hash Pipe, Island in the Sun, Smile, and O Girlfriend, are mediocre compared to what Weezer is capable of.However, I think that the real problem with this CD is the lack of emotion in the singing and lyrics that made their previous albums so unforgettable. Another big problem is the absense of bass player, Matt Sharp. I never realized how much I missed his great falsetto until I listened to Pinkerton again a few weeks ago.I'll probably always buy albums by Weezer, but I sincerely hope their next effort is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I'm sorry, but I had very high expectations for this album, as the Blue Album and Pinkerton are two of my favorites of the 90's. This one just left me flat. I know they tried to go back to something like their first one (even with the same producer), but they didn't come close. These songs just have no heart and soul, especially compared to their previous efforts. I know it's really not fair to compare them to their past cd's, but it's impossible not to do when they've fallen off so much. For what it's worth, \\"Simple Pages\\" is a pretty good song, but without it I would have given this cd one star. In a sea of soundalike pop/punk bands, this makes out ok, but this is a far, far cry from \\"Undone\\" and \\"Tired of Sex.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell happened?","review":"seriously, this album is a huge disappointment. i am a huge fan of pinkerton and the blue album, and this just ... in comparison! rivers supposedly wrote hundreds of songs while away; well, you could've at least put some of the good ones on here! i can only say i like \\"don't let go\\" and \\"photograph\\". otherwise, these seem like quickly put together songs all made from a mediocre riff. i'm sad to say it is the most disappointing album i've heard in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh...","review":"weezer's first album was brilliant and creative...this is pure drivel...it's very, very generic and very short...the songs are entirely unoriginal and smack of every other band that's out there today...this is just a poor effort..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!!!!","review":"I have been a Weezer fan for a long time, and I can't believe that this is what they give us after 5 years.

I am very happy that Weezer is back, but I am upset with this album...let's hope Weezer works to their potential on their next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer - Green Album","review":"This album is very difficult to comment on. Although when compared to most of the trash that can be found on the radio, this album is a true savior - it is very below par for a Weezer album. Previous to this album, Weezer was much more raw, while maintaining a certain pop feel, with of course - great lyrics. The Green Album though, brings now a cleaner, very calculated and composed Weezer. Every song follows the same basic format, down to the guitar solo (every solo follows the vocal melody). Now, I cannot in good conscience say that this is a bad album, but I have to say it was a disappointment. Aside from the negative points that I've mentioned, the album has a number of great aspects. The vocals, harmonies and melodies are incredible. Rivers' is continually growing as a vocalist and will undoubtedly carry this band through to rock infamy. Anyone can love this album, even if it will never be considered a classic. 7/10Fore reviews like this and more, visit bigtouchin.com!"},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest w. album","review":"Wow.... this record really rocks.

I know I may sounds cliche but this is the most dissapointing album I have ever listened to. After the excellent Blue Album and the even better Pinkerton I must have expected too much because most of this album is complete garbage. Lacking is the melodic bass of Matt Sharp, the raw sounds that were so key in the first two albums, and most importantly good lyrics. If Rivers thinks I wanna listen to a song that contains the words \\"open your heart and let the good stuff in\\" then he might as well just have his band play instrumental pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"A damn shame","review":"I love Weezer. I have the blue album, pinkerton, and countless bootlegged cuts and rarities. The GREEN album sucks. The best thing about Weezer is that they somehow tuch you. The Green album is completely shallow.What happened? Is Rivers on Prozac now? What happened to teh cool riffs and the surprisingly deep lyrics? It's just depressing. I'm gonna go listen to El Scorcho."},{"rating":"2","title":"A streamlined version of Weezer","review":"This Weezer record is streamlined. It's like an early Beatles record in many respects: the songs are very short, the melodies are simple, the guitar solos do nothing more than copy the melody line of the verse, and the overall production contains no rough edges. But to listeners who've enjoyed Weezer's previous records, it feels like a step backward. Weezer has always been a band with a lot of quirky charm and charisma, and a big part of that charm had always been those rough edges: the quiet-to-loud dynamics within the songs, the guitar solos inspired by Rivers' days as a young metalhead, the occasional weird background comments, etc. The songs on this record are catchy and kinda fun, but they lack many of those elements that endeared us to this band in the first place. Overall, this record certainly beats most of what passes for alternative rock these days, but it's also a bit of a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment 101","review":"Weezer returns with a more polished sound and less energy than either of their other two releases. The Green Album is by far the worst of the three Weezer albums. Tracks like Hash Pipe and Island in the Sun are average, but it seems that Weezer was trying to return to the \\"pop-rock\\" formula of their highly successful debut album, but here they just don't pull it off. Weezer definitely needs a more raw and rough production sound to display their power. The band has toyed with disbanding over the last couple of years and after hearing this I can honestly say that I would have been happier if they did. Their legacy will be Pinkerton and the Blue Album. Only hardcore completists should buy this. Also check out any of The Rentals cd's with ex-Weezer bassist Matt Sharp, it's some cool nerd rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is bangin ;)","review":"Well Well.. I have to say that I was soo stoked when I found out that weezer was going to have a new CD.. waiting for the day to come and buy it I have to say I was extremely impressed after listening to all of it.. Who cares if weezer is \\"geek rock\\".. b/c I think they are AWESOME!! I actually think they don't get as much credit as they should. I think every song on this cd is great.. the only reason I rated this cd a 4 was b/c I think it's to short.. it seems like right as you start listening to the song it soon ends which is a bummer.. I do think that even though \\"pinkerton\\" didn't get that much credit that is also an amazing cd.. and if you don't have it..

They made wonderful pop music with an equally wonderful rock. The band continued to do this with 2 albums. In the course of that time, other people thought, \\"I want to sound like them!\\" So many people tried to copy the weezer sound and was heard as a weaker version of the original. Somewhere along the line weezer lead singer Rivers exclaimed, \\"I'm so greatful for these bands that want be just like us, i think i'll return the favor and try to sound like them!\\" Thus, the Green Album is born. An album that sounds like a band trying to sound like a band trying to sound like Weezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good new Weezer album but WAY too short!","review":"I've loved Weezer since the Blue Album and have waited for years since their last album for new material. After seing them in concert about a month ago, I was pumped for this release. It seems that Weezer has tried to get back to their roots with such pop wonders as the opening \\"Don't Let Go\\" \\"Island in the Sun\\" and \\"Glorious Day\\". It's also has rockers like the radio hit \\"Hash Pipe\\" and closes out with the retro sounding \\"O Girlfriend\\". I would have given the album five stars but it is only ten songs and turns out to about 30-minutes. A long time to wait for such little material. All in all, if you like Weezer and the Blue Album, you'll love the Green Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"weezer-here it again for the first time","review":"this disk kiks as* not only does it hav the hit hash pipe but it also includes 9 other song just as good if not better most of wich are in the style of there older song buddy hollyjaKob andeRson"},{"rating":"1","title":"weezer's got me green","review":"i have to say that this is a very disapointing album by far. with the green album most songs are pretty boring and dull, however they do have some excellent weezer of old on here.

I don't think weezers done, if you want a great song look around for Jamie by Weezer, that still has to pop up on a Weezer CD, its one of the best songs they've written recently"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Effort","review":"The first few times I listened to the album the only songs that really jumped out at me were \\"Hashpipe\\" and \\"Island in the Sun\\". After getting used to the unusually short disc (the total running time is less than 30 minutes), however, I started to get into the music. I am not a musician nor do I have any experience in the music industry, but I know what I like and this CD definitely has a good overall vibe to it. If you are looking for a genuine, straightforward rock and roll record (something that I believe is sorely missing in the music scene today) then Weezer won't disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"This CD is very good melodywise but the lyrics don't really make sense in Hash Pipe and some other songs, but really it is not the lyrics it is the melody. So this CD is really worth getting. It's funny and entertaining. It's Grundge rock and calm rock, so it is worth getting for the music collecter and listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sunday afternoon music....","review":"Weezer's new album is just....relaxing. It has poppy melodies and lyrics that don't make much sense at all, but it is relaxing and great to listen to and a sunny day when you are bored and just want to hear something non-political or with any real message at all. I don't have any of the other Weezer CD's, but the catchiness of this one will probably drive me to buy the band's other two releases. My favorite song is Island in the Sun, I could go on forever about how nice, laid back, and relaxing that song is. All the other songs are really good also, but Island is the msot relaxing in my opinion. I reccomend this to just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Back","review":"Weezer truely has a sound of their own and this albulm is a long awaited sequel to the blue albulm, and well worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solded out","review":"Weezer's Green Album is terrible. Gone are the days of Pinkerton where music meant something to this band. Rivers sounds like he is whining throughout the whole album and the lyrics are meaningless. The true Weezer is dead. They have solded out. Now we are left with terrible \\"hip\\" songs like \\"Island in the Sun\\" and \\"Hash Pipe\\". I hope all the teeny boopers out there are happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer's back...better than ever!","review":"Even as i listened to this album the first time, I knew it was incredible. The second and third times were even sweeter. This album is one of the best i have heard in a long time, and thats saying a lot for a kid that buys CDs almost every week. Any fans of alternative, emo, or pop punk will love this album. It is more along the lines of their original self titled album than Pinkterton, but slightly darker and moodier. The tunes are melodic and catchy and you will be hummin' along in no time. I can, without hesitation recommend this CD to any rock fans. This album was worth the wait"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is good old Weezer at its best. It strays away from the sounds of Pinkerton and goes back to the melodies and good sounds from their self-titled debut. This is a very good CD; I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilled Again","review":"I am thrilled to report that Weezer's third album is on par with the first two. I've had this CD for a week now, and I cannot stop listening to the entire thing. The CD has a fine collection of tracks that reflect the band's diverse style and that utilize the wide vocal range of Rivers Cuomo. The songs are all catchy in their own way, and the transition between hard (\\"Hash Pipe\\") and soft (\\"Island in the Sun\\")is beautiful. The Green Albulm is a little lighter than Pinkerton, which seemed to have a darker edge to it. If you do not own all three Weezer albums, then I suggest you begin investing. The Green Album is amazing. I hope you enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"=w=","review":"Upon first popping this cd into my stereo, I was expecting a rougher edge, continuing their trend from Pinkerton (which I personally thought was brilliant). I was a bit surprised when I heard how clean and melodic these songs were. I have listened to this album straight all day long, and I love it just as much as their other albums and I've come to the conclusion that Weezer can do no wrong. Rivers Cuomo's emotions come out perhaps better on this album than on the previous ones through the music, lyrics, and voice influction. The only semi-complaint that I have is that the entire album is only like 29 minutes long. But it is an intense 29 minutes, so don't let that stop you from buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big mean GREEN machine!!","review":"I bought this cd knowing that every other weezer cd was great but I had heard that this was the worst one which I totally disagree! This was much better than maladroit but cannot beat pinkerton and the blue album especially. Anyway, the best songs on this album were Dont LET GO, PHOTOGRAPH, HASH PIPE and ISLAND IN THE SUN. These were great. Dont get me wrong the other ones rock too! So if you are a weezer fan or not buy this cd. Buy it especially if you are in question of buying it. Also buy the blue album, (the best one)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no talent","review":"It's absolutely horrendous. Anybody with this preference of music has no taste. If I had the option of giving it zero stars then I would have. Seriously people!!!! Get some sense in ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for Weezer","review":"Along with a small handful of other bands (notably Dave Matthews Band, No Doubt, & Red Hot Chili Peppers), Weezer is one of the very few mainstream rock bands that still matter. Compared to the tuneless sludge (Creed, Matchbox 20) and disposable trend-rock (Sum 41, Blink 182) that has been invading the radio waves over the last five years, it is so refreshing that Weezer returns to show rock bands how it's done.Weezer has always gotten the most important thing about rock music right - have great songs. This album, although considerably short by today's standards, has great songs - fun, direct, and full of life. From the blunt rock of \\"Hash Pipe\\" to the upbeat \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Knock Down Drag Out\\", Weezer gets it right on every song. \\"Island on the Sun\\" is the album's highpoint - a beautifully understated song.Pick this album up if you want to be reminded of a time when every song on a rock album was catchy, fun, and most importantly, well-written."},{"rating":"1","title":"NANANANA","review":"All of the songs on this album sound somewhat similar.. Most of the songs have the melody of \\"na-na-na\\", \\"la-la-la\\", etc...I really like weezer, and this album is a mockery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer Reigns Again!","review":"What a great feeling to have another Weezer album around the house! Enjoyable as all the rest, while not my favortie it will definately fill the void for Weezer lovers everywhere. Island in the Sun is Grade A prime Weezer, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP!","review":"Oh my god.DO NOT buy this album unless you have money to throw away.If you are like me,you might decide to pick this cd up because \\"Hash Pipe\\" was so addictive.Well,unfortunately,you won't find any other songs on this album of the same style.Melodically,the best songs on this album are \\"Hash Pipe\\"(nice singing,but in a quirky way;kinda cool,unusual lyrics) and \\"O Girlfriend\\" (infectious,dreamy). A couple others are catchy,but get old quickly.This is the type of stuff you'll hear played at a jr. high school dance;musically puerile,but very get-stuck-in-your-head-able.I admit,I'll probably be singing \\"O Girlfriend\\" until the end of time,but frankly,there are simply not enough good songs here for the album to be worth more than a few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I first heard of Weezer when I saw them perform at the NBC TV show Saturday Night Live. Then I heard my friends talk about the band saying that it's pretty good. I then listened to the album and I wan't dissapointed. Weezer can produce some pretty good music. My favorite tracks are \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Hash Pipe\\". Minus one star for the length of the album. Maybe if Weezer could write longer songs and make some more music, they can improve. This band can crank out Real Music from their guitars and percussion. It's a good album but it's only 30 minutes long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Album kicks butt","review":"I really feel Weezer is growing musically. They prove their staying power over today's one hit wonders with this album. I can't wait for the next one! Don't walk, RUN get this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocracy at its best- or worst","review":"This album was definitely a dissapointment. Weezer is my favorite band ever, but this album is just average. I fell in love with Weezer two years ago, when I purchased Pinkerton and the Blue Album after hearing \\"Tired Of Sex\\" and remebering Buddy Holly. The Blue Album is a pop-rock masterpiece that I loved instantly, but it took me awhile to get into Pinkerton. But Pinkerton is their best, in my opinion; I love the hard guitar riffs, amazing drumming, and the angst-filled magnificent lyrics. But back to the Green album. The songs sound so alike that it is almost comical, and the relaxed, boring dumming and guitars put you sleep. The lyrics are mindless, radio-friendly blather. Don't get me wrong; it is okay, but just okay. I think until they come back, I'm gonna go listen to Pinkerton."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressive","review":"This was my first taste of Weezer's music. Many people I know are huge fans of Weezer so I decided to pick up the green album and I was very disappointed. Although I love the single \\"Hash Pipe\\" the CD never quite had enough to want me to listen to it repeat times. I have since listened to the blue album and pinkerton which i absolutely love. So if you don't have any Weezer albums I would definately recommend the older stuff before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst weezer cd by far","review":"After pinkerton it's hard to follow up with something so good, and they failed miserably. this album is the same boring pop song over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is another Weezer cd","review":"Aw man.Sigh. Weezer has sinned against Rock music. This cd was bad. I have nothing else to say except that I'm thouroughly disappointed. Wow, i mean they made two incredible albums and then they just, I don't know what they did but this cd nearly brought me to tears. Tears of anger. Anger because it sounds so bad. For shame Weezer, forshame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Incredible!","review":"As I drove in my car, I listened in awe. Rivers Cuomo is a genius. I went back to class having every song stuck in my head after hearing them just once! The Green Album is a perfect mixture of the classic Blue Album and the emo-spawning Pinkerton. I've been waiting for this cd for 5 years and I can definatley say that I am not dissappointed. I've listened to the Blue Album for all seven years that I've had it. Not a month goes by that it's not in my CD player. I can already tell that the Green Album is no different. This is going to be a classic cd that should be in every one's collection as soon as possible. I'd mention some songs but every song is equally as good as the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little twist, but yes, it's weezer...","review":"This album is a definite must for alternative rockers. I would say weezer fans but I know the true ones already have it spinning in their CD player. I loved it. But that's just the thing: it took 30 minutes to listen to it. I listened to the whole thing already and have it evaluated in my mind. I WANT MORE! But yes, buy it. It's worth it. My only complaint is the songs need to be longer. I want the almost 5 minutes, like from the Blue Album and Pinkerton, not 2:30 every track. My favorite songs are: Don't Let Go, Hash Pipe, Island In the Sun, Simple Pages, and O Girlfriend. Go get it while it's on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"after 5 long years...this is what we get...","review":"OH MAN...ive waited 5 long year for this cd.After 2 masterpieces weezer has failed.this album just misses the mark.there arent really any strong hooks on it.dont get me wrong.its not a terrible album.but it aint good.its dull.on both of their previous albums there was not 1 bad song.this has loads of them.its... alt-rock.this is junk that bands like nine days or sugar ray would put out.a big disappointment.one more thing...the album clocks in at 28 minutes!5 years and 28 minutes is all we get!!!!rivers cheated us!we should at least get 35 for the long wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint by Numbers","review":"First of all, let me say that I have always been a BIG Weezer fan. That said, I think this new album is total... . \\"Hashpipe\\" is a good, idiosynchratic, power-pop tune that reflects what the band is capable of. That track, however, is this disc's only saving grace. The rest of it is emotionless, predictable, and boring. Rivers Cuomo wrote some depressing and bizarre songs on \\"Pinkerton\\", but that's what made them endearing. On this outing, he abandoned any sense of creativity. They are now denouncing \\"Pinkerton\\", and saying that this new record is the record they REALLY should've made--but just remember, they need to convince you to buy it. I reccommend copying \\"Hashpipe\\" from someone, and saving your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want more!","review":"Weezer's Green Album is great. Nice relaxing, not over-the-top old school sounding rock. Just good listening. However, it's soo good, AND SOO SHORT it leaves you wanting more. So look for a longer Weezer CD and then if you want more, go with this.Favorite Song: Island In The SunYou'll find yourself doin' the little \\"hip-hip\\" in it--really good music that its popular because of it's replay value and great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever return to color-based stardom...haha","review":"The Green Album leaves something to be questioned. Those who longed for the authentic in sync emotional bellows on the Blue Album might have been only slighted disappointed of Pinkerton. Yet it was a great album. Nothing too grandiose, not to simplistic, just genuine Cuomo. I guess many of us had expected a return on Weezer's 3rd album, and our own anticipation was destroyed by our ideals that a genuine \\"punk rock\\" group shall forever remain the same, even within the harsh faces of stardom. Even the standout tracks such as Knock Down Drag Out, Photograph, O Girlfriend, and Island In The Sun lack the same formula that had gave Weezer such the success they deserved before. Personally, I have gotten past the groping and maintained the relationship between my c.d. player and the Blue Album for some time now. The emotion's forever lost, but who knows? Maybe Maladroit WILL provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Pinkerton is my favorite album of all time. After waiting...and waiting... and waiting for the next album, I found the poppiness and lack of meaning in the album to be a disappointment. However, there are a few gems on this one. It irks me that the same critics that hated a masterpiece like Pinkerton will love this. I want my Weezer back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened to weezer?","review":"I loved the blue album and the songs I've heard from Pinkerton. I was really looking forward to hearing this album. I've played this album over and over in my car and at work and at home in hopes that something would grab me from this album. But really, it just sounds like rotton music. What happened to Weezer? Maybe they just need Matt Sharp back. I'm going to sell my copy of the green album and go get Pinkerton instead.And really, where did all this hype over Weezer come from? They weren't even this popular when their music was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"pump up the jam","review":"on an island in the sunthis cd is the onethe best of all weezers pastlisten to thisyou'll have a blast!!this is my favourite weezer cd and it could just very well be yours too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"=w= weezerific album =w=","review":"i looooovvvvvvvveeeeeeeeee this album....a great piece of weezer writing...it is a very very cool album i think everyone should get"},{"rating":"1","title":"As far as post Matt Sharp Weezer goes..","review":"I am not a Post- Matt Sharp Weezer fan, but this is and Make Believe are the least sucking out of the late Weezer albums. But seriously, The Blue Album and Pinkerton are all you need of Weezer. If you crave more Weezer- esque material I suggest you turn to The Rentals, that dog., and Fairview (if you can even find them on here anymore, I haven't really kept up but their first CD is really good). All of those bands are not as good as old Weezer, but better than anything Green album on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backwards...","review":"There doesnt seem to be any other way for me to sum up this album. The songs are very catchy, but become stale and repetitive and theres a surprising lack of clever lyrics and originality. What disappoints me the most i think, is that this is the only Weezer record that I would classify as \\"geek rock.\\" Weezer have always been superior to the bands that emulate them (Ozma, for example), because they focus on the lyrics, and not style, a quality that they seem to have discarded for their latest release(compare the covers of the blue album and the green one). If you want a real weezer album, get pinkerton. If you want to wear 3/4 length rock shirts and glasses you may or may not need, then this may just be a perfect fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREEN IS BETTER THAN BLUE, WORTH THE WAIT","review":"Weezers latest effort again self titled \\"Weezer\\" is better than their first effort.The first single \\"Hash Pipe\\" is a great rock/pop song full of melody, hooks, great production value and vocals.\\"Hash Pipe\\" however is different from the rest of the album which in my opinion is reminiscent to the Beatles in their later years of the early 70s.The lead vocalist sounds very much like John Lennon especially in \\"Don't Let Go\\" and \\"Crab\\".The album is a strong effort through out with other standout songs as \\"O Girlfriend\\", \\"Smile\\" and one of my favorites \\"Island in the Sun\\".Weezer has come back strong with an album worth the 15 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this cd. Stick with pinkerton and blue","review":"this cd sounds nothing like weezer except for photograph and island in the sun. Knock Down drag out sounds like a blink182 song.

And promptly returned it. Three months later I was convinced by a friend to \\"give it a second chance.\\" Two weeks (and more than a few *painful* listens) later I returned it again. Why?Because this is an unemotional, flat, uninspired, commercial record.The blue album was interesting and fun; pinkerton was masterful and sweeping--but shallow-minded popular critics panned it. Unfortunitially Rivers appeared to care what they said and ran away. Now he's back, but in such a hollow, cheap, mass-produced format that it isn't worth owning. Ganted some rabid people will cry out \\"but it's still WEEZER!\\"-- though they fail to see that it's not the weezer with talent, with grace, with candor that we knew.sigh... if you want good, interesting, and intelligent reviews (much MUCH better than mine) go to pitchforkmedia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about a \\"walkthrough\\" album.........","review":"Sounds like the band showed up for recording a little drowsy every day. There's about ZERO emotion conveyed through the record. VERY flat. It's a pity that Pinkerton was largely ignored because it blows this album right out of the water. Can you say \\"pandering to the masses\\"? Almost sounds like someone forced them to make this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disapointment to real Weezer fans everywhere","review":"Pinkerton was an intensly personal album, let's leave it at that. But because it wasn't identical to the Blue Album, every one hated it. Pinkerton didn't make much money, that much is clear. So, because of that, Weezer went back into the studios and managed to gain tons of empty headed fans while losing all the originals. The songs on this album are identical, I still can't tell them apart and I've had the Cd for a year. They're poppy, repetative and more like a boy band than any rock band ever should be. They've not only lost their melancholy edge, they've completely abandoned everything Weezer stood for. In closing, I'd like to say, DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM! Mark my words, if you do indeed buy this album you'll be wasting your money. Instead, go out and buy Pinkerton, because well, to be blunt, Pinkerton is a thousand times better than the Green Album ever could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Greatness","review":"With their new Green self-titled album, Weezer has returned to greatness. They again capture the smooth tunes and memorable lyrics that made the Blue album a modern classic. This time around, things are admittedly short, but even half an hour of this quality of music is pure nirvana. Favorite songs on mine include Phonograph, Crab, O Girlfriend, and of course the first single - Hash Pipe. Actually, all the songs are great and anyone who is a Weezer fan, heard Weezer, or just stumbled upon this should immediately purchase this CD. I only took off one-star because of the length of the album. I don't want it to end, why couldn't it be longer!?! I guess that's what the repeat button on the player is for . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"the blue album was excellent. pinkerton was better, one of my top 5 albums of all time i think. the new green album was about the most disappointing release i've ever had to suffer through. 10 songs that all have the exact same structure. 10 songs with guitar solos that mimic the vocals exactly. this sounds like an album that took a couple of weeks to put together. i would have given it one star except for the fact that it's catchy, but being catchy does not redeem the fact that it's unbelievably weak music. i would rather they had not released another album if it could have prevented this travesty. weezer has gone from a clever and talented band to just another pop rock group. i think they were hitting that hash pipe a little too much while they made this. bring back the old weezer!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"this is a fantastic record. from the first song to the last, the record is loaded with glorious pop melodies and hooks. it's the album fountains of wayne wished they could have made with \\"utopia parkway.\\" the only little bone i have to pick is that several of the songs end rather abruptly, woodenly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy, great!","review":"Weezer is just synonomous with the word \\"catchy\\".

Lots of room during that time to change war itself & how & with what it's waged with. I'm not going to go into the argument of Clausewitz vs cultural versions of war as Many others have already done so & I feel no need to add more either way. I have the ww2 book & the face of battle all written by this author. Fond of all of them. If you're looking to see how war has changed than this is.for you. If you are looking for more depth or more coverage in say Clausewitz than, I'd suggest getting something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"An explanation of why we fight from the stone age to modern time","review":"Well written text which should be, and probably is, basic text for War College class reading. Excellent criticism of Clauswitz, explaining later frustrations such as Korea, Vietnam, and Afganistan. Too critical of Sun Tzu, \\"The Art of War,\\" not fully appreciative of his contribution. Sun Tzu does believe in a decisive battle, the heart of the Clauswitz philosophy, he also recognizes the full spectrum of war. Seldom, he would say, is decisive battle possible. This is what we see in modern war, since WWII. Keegan reconizes this in his conclusions, but does not explain well the Chinese philosophy. Good luck, it is an excellent text, very articulate and readable.As an ex-military officer, I hope they include this material in War College material.If this review was helpful, please add your vote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive !","review":"While I prefer reading great war novels like The Red Badge of Courage, The Naked and the Dead, or, more recently, The Triumph and the Glory, John Keegan is such a gifted military historian with such an eloquent style that I not only read his books, but study them. A History of Warfare is one of his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish out of Water","review":"I really couldn't make it through the book. Keegan's strengths are his unusual ability to empathize and the smoothness of his writing. What Keegan does not excel at, however, is theory, but that is the topic of this book.The worst thing about the book is that he made attacking Clauswitz the centerpiece and Keegan doesn't understand Clauswitz AT ALL. Frankly, I was embarrassed for Keegan when I read it. Don't get this book.Two books you should have, if you haven't already got them, are Keegan's \\"The Face of Battle\\" and Clauswitz's \\"On War\\". If I had to restrict myself to two books on military history, they would be the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A regrettable read","review":"War...or at least the kind that's mustached and carries a swaggerstick. A hard read for those who do not buy Keegan views on war. There's too much of his own coloured personal opinion in his thesis to be quite convincing. It isn't hard to see why he ascribe to the view he does (ie \\"Fog in Channel; Continent cut off\\") but it makes for poor history for those who really wish for a clearer understanding of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keegan's Writing Style Makes Reading Difficult","review":"I have painly read half of this book, and I have decided to give up and look for another book on the same subject. Keegan constantly, with every sentence, engages in digressions, diversions, and tangents. I found it quite difficult to focus on the material. I have read over 50 books in the last 5 years, and Keegan is one of the worst authors I have ever encountered. Reading Keegan is almost like dreaming - erratic, and difficult to remember. Reading Keegan is like hearing every last thought that runs through the mind. I highly recommend against this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CONVINCING","review":"THE FIRST 60 OR SO PAGES ARE JUST AWFUL. JOHN KEEGAN ARGUES THAT WAR IS NOT THE CONTINUATION OF POLITICS RATHER THE RESULT OF CULTURAL DRIVES. THAT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SO IN HISTORICAL TIMES, BUT IS HARDLY SO TODAY. HE UNFORTUNATELY TRIES TO EXPLAIN AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE FROM A BIOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS NOT ONLY DATED, HE'S FLAT WRONG. THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE, I.E., CLAIMING THE U.S. ABANDONED THE DRAFT AFTER WW II AND DIDN'T USE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE 60'S. WRONG AGAIN! WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT KEEGAN'S VERY VIEWS ARE SO MUCH A CONTINUATION OF BRITISH POLITICAL THINKING. NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's it about?","review":"Keegan's main idea -- that \\"war\\" has been defined differently in different cultures and in different times -- is very interesting, but I couldn't follow Keegan's argument through this very badly organized book. What does Clausewitz have to do with his dicussions of the anthropology of war? How are the sections on the impact of technology on war connected to his ideas about culture? Is this book a \\"history\\" of war or a discussion of war-making theories or an investigation of \\"culture\\" (which is never adequately defined, by the way) and war? I don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disjointed and disappointing effort.","review":"I found Keegan's \\"History of Warfare\\" largely disappointing. Although the author succeeds in bringing many facets of ancient and modern warfare to light he fails to provide a common thread. This lack of theme becomes more telling as the book continues. This is particularly disappointing in view of his outstanding earlier works, particularly \\"The Face of Battle\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful writing","review":"This book is extraordinarily well-written.

The colored pieces are a little smaller than the circumference of a quarter. They are made of a thin plastic and therefore, have little weight. You see very little seesawing motion when you play and the board tends to fall over more often because they bump the surface a little when placing the plastic playing piece. If the parts had some more weight and quality, it would be more fun to play. The toys I played with when I was growing up are still around, just more flimsy and lower quality.

I've always loved Cynthia Rylant's powerful work that makes me homesick for an Appalachian life my western US self has never known, and that same spirit comes to life in this Christmas gem.Based on the train that delivers packages each November, this tells the story of a boy whose holiday magic depends on the gifts thrown from the train. Year after year, he never receives the Christmas present he dreams of. His disappoint results in a strong message that makes this book so memorable.The book imagines a back story to the train of a generous rich gentleman trying to pay back a town's kindness, and this same mood permeates the story. Perhaps not historically accurate, but certainly appreciated and appealing to the imagination.The illustrations are vivid and details and full of expression.This is one that is hard to read with a dry eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I decided to get this book so that it could be just put in box with gifts to read Christmas Eve"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will bring tears to your eyes!","review":"A dear teacher friend recommended this book and said she couldn't read it to her class without crying!

The book has sketches of aggressive New York Jews, tweedy Wasps, evil and dangerous Italians, and impossibly benighted and Gothic Southerners. It's almost as if Boyd gave vent to every nasty prejudice he could mine -- all in the guise of writing a humorous novel. Because his characters' unpleasant aspects are so overdrawn, the resulting characters aren't believable, even in comedy. The only redemptive feature in this otherwise muddy little piece of work is that Boyd has an undeniable imagination, and he manages to write his characters in and out of some funny scrapes. But that strength cannot overcome the novel's fundamental flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written essays","review":"BROKEN VESSELS is a series of essays (as opposed to short stories) by Andre Dubus.

A 14 should be 26 or 28 inches in waist, and this was 24. I believe this product should be labeled with the waist size as well.

Various manufacturers/sellers seem to have differing views on measurements. To help others considering purchasing an item - I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that unless ALL THE INFORMATION (hint: waist and leg measurements) is provided to help make a correct choice - either find a way to contact the seller to hopefully obtain the essential details - or move on to another vendor which does provide the proper information.

My lab on the other hand, has a habit of dipping her paws in the water first to check it and is constantly spilling the water everywhere. That is probably my fault. We had to switch her back to a larger bucket outside, I guess I will just be in charge of checking on ice every day!My only complaint about the bowl was the plastic is quite thin and the plug is almost too heavy for the outlet.

This version expands the choices of colors to 9: white, black, magenta, purple, yellow, orange, green, blue, and no peg at all. The code section now has five slots, as opposed to the other version's four. This makes for both a much more difficult game and for many, many more possible code combinations.

I will gladly pay a little more for a better quality bag next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps broke on first trip","review":"I had high hopes after reading all the positive reviews. Maybe the product has changed since the previous reviews. The first time I used this bag one of the 4 sections of the bag where the straps are attached to the bag broke off. The color in the photo shows 4 sections where the straps are attached to the bag (in black). The bag I received had orange sections where the straps were attached to the bag and are apparently glued on to the bag because once section came off. We were still able to use the bag with the remaining 3 sections attached to our vehicle, but no telling when/if the others might break as well. Unfortunately I bought this item 2 months prior to our trip and it's too late to return it for a refund. I would not recommend purchasing this product unless you only need to use it once or twice, or unless you don't mind using a different method to attach it to your car. (i.e. straps that aren't attached to the bag but are able to hold it down)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better based on the reviews.","review":"I really wanted to like this product and be able to use it at least one more time. Nope that didn't happen. Its 218 between Los Angeles and Fresno and somewhere in between my Keeper 07203 had torn a hole in the corner. The bag was not overloaded, nor was I driving the speed of sound to cause it to tear open either. Fortunately the hole did not grow in size and my stuff made it back home. It's just unfortunate that I had to throw it in the garbage instead of refolding it up and look forward to another adventure with it. Save your money and keep looking.

It freed up much space in the vehicle and everything stayed dry in soaking downpours.It was hot and the bag is dark black and shiny causing me to be sweaty and irritable. I'd suggest loading in a garage if you have one or in the shade.It took considerable time to adjust the straps (we chose to unload at night and store it while in the hotel).The front collects a lot of bug bodies.The material wore where the straps laid, so we will have a few places that will not be waterproof for our next trip (duct tape will fix that!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Used this cargo bag for the 2800 mile round trip drive between Chicago and Naples, FL. I found the bag to be a great value considering its price. It is water resistant, not water proof so know that going in. During regular rains we encountered it held up perfectly and all cargo was dry. We did go through a torrential, sustained rain which did result in some slight water accumulation inside the bag but that was expected given the severity of the storm. Tip: pack soft items (clothes) in a garbage bag before putting them in the rooftop bag. Overall, it held up great except for a split in the seam on the front facing zipper cover. The split was repaired with a bicycle tire patch and it's ready for its next adventure. Giving it such high marks as it is a great value considering the price and how well it held up and performed. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap material","review":"On the first trip I made using this bag (a 4-hour drive), the material wore down and small holes developed beneath the straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drove through rain and snow","review":"This item was amazing.

Ours did not have the crossbars so the carrier was a little trickier to install, but with some extra tie-down straps it worked just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed on quality","review":"We used this carrier on a trip from Michigan to Florida and it didn't hold up. When we finally arrived at our destination I discovered there were a few spots on the carrier where it was ripping at the seam and this was the first time we had used it. I have submitted a refund with Amazon and will have to try a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked great--stayed secure and kept items dry","review":"I used this on a trip from Myrtle Beach to Pittsburgh, attached to the roof rack of my Sienna minivan. We passed through about 40 minutes of driving thunderstorms, and I drove at ~75 MPH for most of the trip (not including in the rain). The bag remained secure and kept all items dry. I noticed no wind noise. I did find it a bit tedious to adjust and tighten the 8 straps after packing the bag, but it's a reasonable effort to achieve the advertised performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rood top cargo bag","review":"It is what it claims to be. It is a good roof top cargo bag. We dove over 6 hours in the rain and did not have any issues with the bag shifting or any of our stuff getting wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome car-top cargo bag for such a low price","review":"I love this thing and it has saved us on a few trips where we couldn't fit everything inside the suv. In one corner the fabric is stretched so tight that it has some tiny holes, nothing a vinyl patch can't fix. Other than that this deserves 5 stars, therefore 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item should be called Water resistant, not water proof.","review":"Installed unit in a roof rack on top of my Forester using directions provided. We ran into a moderate rain storm for just over an hour and the product managed to not hold up as intended and items in the bag were nice and wet. Product should be called water resistant not waterproof. A perfect fix would be a second zipper or something around the bag to seal the zipper cover flap down. The Velcro provided just doesn't do any good. On a positive note, it does secure down nicely on my vehicle rack and items made it to the destination. I suggest looking elsewhere for a better item unless you plan on traveling in dry weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use & great for providing extra space","review":"We bought the 15 cubic foot roof top cargo bag (along with the SherPak SuperMat and 2 pk. Master Lock straps) when we had to put car seats in the third row of our Honda Odyssey. So far, we've used the cargo bag on three trips and have had rain, wind and sleet/snow and have had no problems with leaks. We've comfortably fit three good sized suitcases in the bag and have packed in other items (small fold-up stroller, coats, sleeping bags, etc.).Our van only has the side rails, so I generally criss-cross the middle straps around the bar and have had no issues with the bag moving from front to back. The Supermat is useful in that regard, as well. I've also used the Master Lock straps each time, though more for my own piece of mind than anything else; I think the bag would be fine with the eight straps that are attached. Definitely recommend if you need a bit more space for your travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great!","review":"This worked exactly as we hoped it would! We have an SUV, but with 2 young kids that need about a million things each for a week at the beach, we didn't have room in our trunk. We loaded this rack up with a pack and play, big graco stroller, beach cart, beach bag, towels... a ton of stuff. We basically just had our clothes in the trunk of the car. The bag zipped shut and stayed put. It rained the whole way home from vacation and nothing got wet. We did also purchase a mat for under the bag, not sure if this was necessary or not, but we figured why risk it? We'll be using this for every vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roof top Carrier","review":"Very happy with my roof top carrier and also the price which was very reasonable the delivery time was very fast considering I live in Western AustraliaI will be back I am very happy thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for the price","review":"This car top carrier is pretty good for the price (which seems quite low). We have a recent model Chrysler Town and Country and the buckles to attach it don't really hook up quite right for the roof rack on our minivan. As you can see in the product picture, the cargo bag has straps on all four sides but the T&C only has side-rails on the roof-rack. The result is that you need to do some funny tying of the front and back straps. After doing that, it worked reasonably well. We drove through a light rain and it got into the bag but perhaps I didn't seal the Velcro right. I'd say it's a reasonable value and works OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frees up a lot of space!","review":"Bought this to use on a trip we took from Maine to WI. We put almost 3000 miles on it in all types of wheather while traveling on its' maiden voyage. It preformed flawlessly. Very well made and durable. Had it stuffed full, probably fuller that I should have. The zippers are tough and the fabric held up to whatever was thrown its way. It kept everything protected and dry. Was easy to get in and out of, and rode quietly on our roof in a very secure manner. Did exactly what we hoped it would and freed up \\"A Lot\\" of room inside our vehicle. Made for a more enjoyable and comfortable trip. When back home we washed off the bugs, hung it on the clothesline to dry, and packed it away for next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product for the price","review":"I bought this product after an unsuccessful attempt to purchase a hard cargo carrier for my Infiniti EX 35. As I found out the permanently placed crossbars are only 19 inches apart and hard carriers won't fit. Even though this cover is a fairly large size, I was able to fold it to where it would fit in this small space. Because of the way it was folded, I think it made the tie downs a little more difficult to secure. Once it was in place, I rolled the loose tie down straps and taped them with duct tape to keep them from flapping in the wind. We went through a short but severe rain and the luggage remained dry which was my main concern. I'm very pleased with this cover and now I can just fold it up and put it away and I don't have to worry about storing a big bulky hard cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds a lot of crap.","review":"My family and I went camping in Bend, Or and we did not have much room in our suv. So I bought this cargo bag. It looked kind of small, but it sure held a lot of our stuff. It looks very water tight but did not get to test it because of no rain. I liked it because it could hold a lot of odd shape items. It was very quite on the roof of the suv. Could not hear the wind hitting it.It is built very tuff. What I did not care about it was that if I wanted to get something out I had to unbuckle the whole bag from the rack unzip it. Then put it all back again. Not a big issue but it took a little time. All in all I am pleased with this cargo bag and glad that i bought it. Would strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rooftop Cargo Bag","review":"We bought this for a trip we took to Florida. It worked out great. It rained on us on our way home, and everything stayed dry. Easy to secure to the roof rack. I did notice a slight decrease in our gas mileage. It did create some wind noise, and we had to adjust the straps so they wouldn't flap against the roof so much. We definitely got our money's worth from this.UPDATE: One corner tore on our first trip -- didn't notice it until the second time we went to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Procduct","review":"Great product used it on a recent camping trip, holds a lot of stuff, I had 4 sleeping bag, 2 duffle bag of clothes and if you scure it right there is no noise at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge amount of space, Solid, Everything was Dry","review":"On our last day of camping it started pouring, I loaded it up in the tent (two sleeping bags, 2 comforters, 2 large duffle bags of clothes, 3 pillows, pots/pans/bowls, some food, etc) and it still wasn't full. Took the bag out of the tent and onto a picnic table in the rain, so we could break down the tent etc. Loaded the cargo bag on the truck last, drove home in the rain. We have an nissan xterra, so the straps are pretty much the only choice for cargo bags. Unloaded the truck which had everything covered in rain and sand. Everything in the cargo bag was dry. I initially wanted a 16-18 cubic ft bag, but this 15 was plenty enough. It saves so much room for us in the back for quick items like coolers and snacks. Like most things camping, after unloading/unpacking, gave it a good rinse, hung dry in the shade, packed it away for next use. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked pretty well","review":"We took the Keeper 07203 on a 10 day, 2000 mile trip. It was easy to install, and I would say about 98% waterproof. We got a little water in it while driving through a thunderstorm, but not enough that anything in our bags got wet. The only problem we had was after loading and unloading 4 or 5 times on our trip a couple of the velcro tabs that hold the flap down over the zipper pulled off. Overall it worked well, and is a good carrier for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Pleased!","review":"This is much easier to use and flexible than a hard shell carrier and it is waterproof. The easiest way to put your stuff into it is after you have it is on the roof of your SUV. Otherwise it is a two man job to lift it up onto the roof. This unit can hold 4 large suit cases and other small items alone the sides (just to let you imagine the amount of space available). For it to be completely waterproof you need to follow the instructions well. You might put plastic trash bags around your suitcases until you have tried it once or twice. The straps could be a little more user friendly in the aspect of maybe a Velcro piece at the end to connect with the excess left after pulling tight instead of having to tie avoiding flapping in the wind. All in all, we handled that situation with sticky back Velcro and it works Great!!! Well worth the $50, for a 2000 mile trip through rain and snow with dry baggage."},{"rating":"2","title":"waterproof bag","review":"This bag is absolutely waterproof. I highly recommend it!

I will be complaining to company and if they make it right, I will amend my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit car","review":"I purchased this to use on my 2006 Mazda Tribute (Ford Escape) with a roof rack with crossbars. I could not get it to fit in anyway that would make me feel secure about using it on my long trip. The unit ended up being way too big to snuggly tie down the straps and the size of the unit was actually larger than the roof rails on the roof rack.It states it fits a Mazda Tribute/Ford Escape, but I do not recommend it. I think it would work find on larger SUVs or minivans with roof racks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor gas mileage","review":"Made a trip Oklahoma to Orlando and spent almost $300 one way in gas and knew that was too much because we went to Orlando several times in the past and it was around $200 in gas one way. So on the way back we did not put the cargo carrier up and sure enough it was only $195 in gas on the way back. So beware the extra room you may get because of the cargo carrier will come at a cost. For me it is not worth $100 each way just for some extra room in the minivan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"The product performed as advertised.

I have Thule crossbars not the standard Pacifica bars, however the bag design will fit either way. The straps offer lots of room to reach the bars and tighten down easily.The longest part of setup is after closing the bag, is securing the extra strap to keep it from flap-flapping against the bag as you drive.The bag is waterproof! I have taken it camping and have driven thousands of miles with the bag in place. The only time i got water in the bag was when I opened it in the rain, and didn't see the puddle on the top before unzipping.My only recommendation would be to bring a collapsible footstool or something to give you that extra boost to get things in and out.I use this one:B&R; Plastics 101-6 White EZ Foldz Step Stoolit's small and folds pretty flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really works well.","review":"This is a great product-well worth the money!We needed more luggage space for a last minute family vacation.

The return was another story; over 600 miles of heavy rain, sleet, snow, and road spray. Upon arrival at home, the outside of the bag looked like a dirty snowman but the contents were clean and inside of bag was dry. We packed smaller stuff toward front and tapered toward back to streamline as much as possible. Result was that there was not a noticable change in gas mileage.

I was really wondering if the bag would hold up and it did. When we got home and unzipped it...not a drop of water was inside! The built in straps were easy to attach to the roof rack and it stayed in place. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought it would hold more. We had a medium suitcase and a rolling duffel bag but couldn't fit a 2nd medium suitcase in there (the bag wasn't tall enough).

It then says you should wash your hands after using.I had intended to carry our luggage and my INFANT daughter's gear (pack n play, highchair, etc) in this item. I was/am livid that the warning is small and that it's not on Amazon's product information page. I am returning it, and Amazon has been great about that (as always) but I am extremely dissapointed in this product.We wound up going with a hard top. More expensive, but no cancer-causing agents to get all over my baby's stuff!Buyer beware on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"Glorified trash bag with flimsy straps.

Then when I tightened the cargo bag straps, one of them came loose from where it was supposed to be adheared to the bag, so I had to throw that away. Then when I unzipped it to get out my clubs, they were very hard to extract. The solution to my frustration and disappointment with this product was to remove it from my roof and throw it away.

There was minor flapping of the side straps in the wind but perhaps that is because it wasn't 100% full. I think if it's only half full it might not be quite as aerodynamic. Anyway, we drove threw rain - not a torrential downpour but I sure was glad that I put my suitcases in trash bags because water got in somehow! I looked all over and found no holes whatsoever and yet water penetrates it. I had the zipper at the bag as instructions state but the water must penetrate the zipper possibly on the sides, hard to say. Anyway, for around $50, can't complain I guess.

With these I could bring the side straps inside the car and hook them around the handles above the inside of the door and this worked well. However, the loaded carrier sat outside in the rain and somehow the rain wicked along the nylon straps and inside the car and some items inside the car got wet. The items inside the carrier remained dry.I thought I could purchase 1\\" wide parachute clips and just clip my extensions to the existing clips on the carrier.

But they went way overboard with the \\"mod\\" 70's hippie scenes...these are right out of \\"Austin Powers\\", and that character would have fit right in helping Van Helsing fight off Dracula. Aside from that, Cushing and Lee have typical powerful performances which carry the film. And the incredible women, like Munro sure are easy on the eyes. Dracula vs. Powers could have been the title to this, but the film moves at a good pace if you can stomach 37 year old hippies trying to act like teenagers.

Very correct. Watch the film. What I like about it is the Dracula puts the bite on a major male character making him an acolyte, who in turns puts the bite on another male character (whom the vampire, Johnny doesn't much care for.) Victorian mores aside, the homoerotic scheme of this film is interesting. That could possibly explain the pan for this film as opposed to TTBOD.This is pure camp however. Enjoy in the Hammer canon.

Also this is my second favorite Dracula movie (right behind the 1931 film) for a variety of reasons: the cast is mainly hot youngsters looking for kicks, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing's roles could not be played by anyone else and even with it's minimal production value, it turned out great.In a way, the plot is quite decent with additional excitement from a story of revenge. Kids of the 70's get bored and the solution is to have a black mass (I have seen hundreds of horror films but THIS one has the best black mass sequences I've ever seen) which resurects Dracula from the grave.I cherish this movie because it is, without a doubt, the last vampire movie that is considerably scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S OKAY!","review":"This film brings back Christopher Lee as Count Dracula but this time he isn't at his castle in the late 18oo's.This time he's in London 1972!This film at some scenes can be chessy and not so great but this is good to watch if you want to be thrilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda' quit while you were ahead","review":"At this point in time, the Hammer-Dracula series should have been put into the coffin for good!Breaking tradition, Dracula is put into a modern setting amongst groovy 70's party-dudes and babes, one of them ( the busty Stephanie Beacham), just so happens to be grandaughter of Professor Van Helsing... and guess who comes looking for her to avenge her grandad's wrongdoings?

It is interesting to have the count in the 20th century, but he does not belong in it. He needs to stay back in the 1800's, as Stoker meant him to be.This film is also confusing in many ways. If it is indeed a sequel to \\"Horror Of Dracula\\", then how did the count come to be? In \\"Scars Of Dracula\\", he caught fire and fell to his death, leaving nothing of himself (presumably). And, being Professor Van Helsing was not in any of the period sequels, how did they fit this story in about he and Dracula fighting one another to the death in 1872? Did this happen in one of the films when we weren't looking? Very unlikely.At least Peter Cushing returns (finally) as a descendent of Professor Van Helsing. Too bad he could not have been in the four previous films.As I said, this one is not worth watching, unless you're bored.

Not even the considerable talents of Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (which could make a commercial for potato chips thrilling) can save this pic from the trash heap. The acting, previously mentioned thesps excepted, is terrible. The attempts at making the film relevant(you know, hip, man!) only serve to hasten its turning old and rotten. The score has a way of causing the teeth to rattle. The sound of metal pole being struck with a baseball bat would be preferable.

My other gripes are that to turn it you have to push down on the handle to lift the front tires off the ground - seems like this would wear on the handle. On the first car we got the pin to attach the handle would not fit through the holes, so we had to return it. Lastly - it would be much better if the wheels were rubber. The plastic wheels are very noisy. The whole neighborhood knows when we are coming.

My 2 oldest boys are 2 and 4 yrs old now, so they have a ball pushing each other around the backyard. My 3rd son (the youngest)will use it a lot too when he is old enough to ride in it.

So in order to turn the car, you have to lift the front a bit, kind of like the jogging strollers. I already have a jogging stroller, and am not looking to jog him in this push car.

The only drawback is that it is lower to the ground than a stroller so it wasn't great for us parents in summer festival crowds, people just didn't seem to see her and we were continually having to announce our way through and when baby gets tired, unlike your stroller there is no where for them to rest their head, so don't go far from home unless you want to carry your little sleepy one.

I know my daughter is unhappy about taking walks in her stroller again, and my husband has to either find a way to fix the handle so it can be used again, or shell out the money for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"make sure tis is not the recalled version","review":"My daughter had this when she was younger but they have since recalled it because the handle constantly kept coming off. The storage and working horn are adorable. If I had to choose now, I would pay the extra to get the whisper quiet newer model. She did have a blast though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need rubber tires","review":"This toy is so much fun, my 13 months old loves it, but it is extremely LOUD. The tires are pure plastic and make so much noise on the pavement. I would definetely recommend anyone getting the silent ride version of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to assemble","review":"this toy has too many parts and incorrect assembly instructions! I would never buy another toy to assemble! What a pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great.... but loud!","review":"We got this second hand from a friend who used it with her daughter, so we didnt purchace it. But I would have! I LOVE this car. I read some of the 1 star reviews who said it was small, and I never noticed. My son is big for his age, about 30lbs, 33.5 inches and 16 months old (but hes been at that weight since he was 11 months old) and he fits in it just fine. He loves going for walks outside while riding in his car lol he beeps the horn and its really fun. The only thing I hate is it is LOUD!! I wish the wheels were made of something that would make it less noisey. After a 10 min walk you may not notice how loud it is until you STOP and then you're like WOW haha I took this car to my moms neighborhood for trick or treating this year and I was saying \\"what?!\\" a few times when people were trying to talk to me, but overall its a lot of fun for my son, he loves it and I'd say its a worth while product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!!!","review":"My son loves to play with this just as much as he loves to ride in it!! Very age appropriate!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motion Sickness","review":"My 13month old son loved this in the store, but once we got home and out on the side walks and park floor and streets. It gave him motion sickness because its so low to the floor and was very bumpy! Its very sad to see your child sick like this. He has never been motion sickness and love to play airplane with his Dad all the time! ?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"item was received incomplete","review":"would have loved the item except that amazon shipped the item missing the handle, the seat belt, and the decals - therefore, we ended up having to ship the item back to amazon at a cost of almost as much as the item was worth! So far we have not received a credit for the item OR the shipping so we are REALLY dissatisfied customers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Push Buggy","review":"This item is fantastic. It's just the right size, not too small or too large. The handle is the perfect size for parents to push their child around. The wheels are plastic so it can get loud when you push it over concrete sidewalk, hard surface. Overall, great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to a stroller","review":"If your toddler HATES sitting in his/her stroller for walks and trips to the mall. This is a great alternative. It is a bit loud when you push it on the concrete...that is my only complaint. This push car is better than a lot of the others because it has a seatbelt. A must have for a toddler that would like to stand up when you are strolling around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for a 2 or 3 year old!","review":"This toy was a major dissapointment for us. The age guidelines are for 1-3. We got this when our daughter was 15 months old. Granted she was big for her age at 34 inches and 27 lbs, but she was still smaller than a 3 year old! Her feet were to large to fit on the side where they were suppose to. She looked like a clown riding a small bike at the circus! This toy is definately for very petite children. Either it should be made larger or the guidelines should be changed. We gave it away to her 3 month old cousin."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great buggy","review":"My kids love this buggy. It's very sturdy, comfortable for the kids and the adults to push. Everyone I know has one :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me with the assembly of this thing?","review":"Well I would love to write a legitimate review regarding my son's use / enjoyment of this toy but we weren't able to get past the assembly. We were terribly disappointed to discover that this requires so much assembly. Seriously, why can't the tires come attached? We broke one of the knobs while trying to put this thing together, which involved a step that necessitated perfect balancing of the buggy on its side, which was very difficult.Grrr, I'm so annoyed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare to assemble","review":"It was literally not possible to assmble this toy properly. The metal rod for the wheel was mishaped and the plastic cover did not fit. Then, the steering wheel did not attach properly. Finally, the screw to attach the handle would not fit flush against the back fo the seat. Do not waste your money or time on this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but doesn't turn","review":"this is a great push buggy if it only turned....you can go straight forward and straight backwards, if you want to turn a corner you have to lift it. We exchanged ours for the Little Tikes version and we (mommy and daddy- the pushers, and baby) all love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves his buggy!","review":"Bought this car for our 11 month old. I love that it is safe and has a seat belt, carved out sides to safely rest his feat and a sturdy seat. He fits very comfortably and likes to go for rides around the block. It was very complicated to put together though. I also wish it had real buttons instead of fake stickers on the car for him to push. But it's a cool car and he loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites","review":"Our son got this from his grandparents when he was about 11 months old. He loves it. Some mornings he climbs in it while I'm making breakfast and sits there looking at me as if to say \\"Can we go now\\".The hard plastic wheels and hollow body do make for a noisy ride, but that is pushed by the wayside when considering how much our son enjoys this toy. It's very durable and we expect it to last for many fun-filled years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"I went visiting to a friends house who has a 13 month old little girl. I soon noticed that my son was very interested in her little pink push buggy. He climbed right in and was thrilled to be pushed around the yard in it almost all day. He also enjoyed pushing his little friend around in it. I decided to purchase one for him at my local toys r us store the next day. Imagine my surprise at the too good to be true pricetag. This item is very well made and sturdy. It has a great little storage section under the front hood. I bring this car practically everywhere with us to block parties, fairs, the mall, the supermarket and for walks around the neighborhood. my son just loves to be in his little car which is a real score for us because he has started to hate the idea of being in a stroller so this is a nice alternative. You can't tell from the picture but it also comes with a great safety strap. At this price as compared to other push toys this item is too good to pass up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far!","review":"I bought this about a month or so ago for my then 7 month old son. We have just put it together recently and he is 8 1/2 months now. He really loves it. He hangs on to that steering wheel like he is really in control. He is extremely content to stroll around in it. My 9, 11 and 13 year old children really love to stroll him around in it as well. It isn't easy to push him around for a long haul since the wheels don't turn but on the other hand he is so darn happy in it, it might be worth it to skip the stroller and let him \\"drive\\" instead. It seems durable but we have only had it for a short while so I didn't feel I could rate it's durability high at this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my 12 month old!","review":"My son received this buggy for his 1st birthday and he loves to ride in it. He is always smiling and gets excited once he sees he's about to be put in his new car. I can tell he is having fun especially when he goes \\"down\\" our driveway. It was too perfect of a gift and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby girl loves it -- but it's teeny!","review":"I was really surprised at how SMALL this car is! I guess I was used to the ones they have at the grocery store, but my daughter is 20 months, and less than 25 lbs and her knees knock right up against the edge of the car. Not a whole lot of room for growth, so I have no idea how they claim this is a toy up to 36 months... I would be shocked if she still fits in it in 4 months. It's a great now present, and thank goodness we have another one on the way because I would have felt a cheated since we wouldn't be able to use it that long. I feel like it's more suitable starting at 12 months and max age of 24 months.Otherwise, she loves it - and wants to ride in it everyday. Just disappointed in the size."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 month old LOVES it!","review":"I bought this for my 10 month old son and he LOVES it. The handle is perfect - to save mom's back - and wheel him everywhere. It goes in the yard, on grass, or down the sidewalk. My little man couldn't like it any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Purchased this as a gift for my grandniece because it was a favorite with both my granddaughters and grandson. It is really sturdy and will last through numerous children and still be in great shape to hand down to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car to save your back!!","review":"My son received this toy for his first birthday party. He loves it!! I wanted something where his feet didn't drag and that I didn't have to break my back to push around. This has been great for walks outside or the mall to push around. It is light enough to take with you. My only complaint would be that the age range states up to 3 years old and that is a big stretch. My son is slightly above average and I don't think it will last but maybe until 2. But, overall it is a great buy and I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you child is not small this car is not for you","review":"I have been researching these types of cars to buy for my son's upcoming birthday. After reading the reveiws on this car and others like it I thought the best thing to do is pack my son up and we would go to toys\\"r\\"us and test drive them. I put my son who is 11 months old and 30lbs in this car and it was ridiculously too small. Up to three years of age my foot. If your child is not small for their age this car would not be for you. We put him in the Deluxe Cozy Convertible Car and we could not get him out of it. He threw a fit each time we tried, so we just pushed him around in it while we finished shopping. The cozy coupe is more money, but it is worth it. He loves it! It does not have a seat belt, but it was easy to put one in and very easy to put together. So my advise is before you buy this car take your child and try it out first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get enough of it","review":"Our 9 month old absolutely loves this. He's constantly crawling to it & trying to get into it. He'd ride around in it for hours if he could! Best purchase we've made yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Much Fun","review":"My 15 month old daughter loves her buggy! We take it everywhere we go, to the park, the mall, or just around the block for walks. She gets alot of attention (which she loves) and she has fun honking the horn. i love this buggy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Item","review":"I absolutely love this Buggy. I purchased this item for my 15 month old son and he loves it. He prefers to ride in this than in his stroller. I especially love the seatbelt I feel more relaxed knowing that he won't fall off. It was well worth the money because even though it has gotten cold he loves getting into the buggy in the house an acting like he driving. Well worth the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have!!!","review":"My daughter got this for her first birthday and she loves it!!! She laughs so much when we push her around, and because of its size it doesn't take up much room in the house. We have taken her for walks with it and we even take it to the mall (she likes this much more than her stroller).When we are not pushing her in it she'll just sit in it in the family room or play with the trunk in the front.This is something you won't be sorry you bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it's weight in GOLD !!!","review":"When our son turned 1yr old, his grandparents gave him this car. From the very first ride he feel in love. You could not and still can not get him out of his car. He asks to go for a ride everyday. When he is outside playing with the other kids he WILL NOT share his car with anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This buggy is SO cool!!","review":"This little buggy is so fun! My 8 month old loves this! He gets so excited when he sees it. When he is not riding in it, he loves pushing it around and walking behind it. He is not riding well in his regular stroller, so this is a nice change. The only thing I can think of that is a negative thing, is that its not good for a sleepy baby. I have used it in the mall, and its great, but when Andrew gets sleepy, its not comfy for him and he gets crabby. So I would not reccomend it for all day trips. Also, there is no room to put shopping bags. It turns easily and is really easy to push. I am 5'8\\" and the handle is a prefect size. The little storage space is great for sippy cups, burp rags, keys, etc. It actually holds a lot! This little car is great to have! My sister is thinking about getting one for her 8 month old daughter, in pink. Over all, I would say this has been one of the best things I have bought for him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 10 month old son loves it, I hate it.","review":"My son loves to take our evening walks in his buggy, but for me it is too noisy. Rubber wheels would have been a much better idea. Also the sides where his feet sit should either be clsed in or the whole mid section should be open. He has a habit of dragging his feet. Other than that it is a great buggy. We get many stops and stares walking down the street and he loves to ride in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase!!!","review":"I brought this for my son's birthday and he loves it. When I am pushing him and I stop he starts crying until I start pushing him again. He loves it!!! It does make a little noise when you are pushing it on the road but besides that it is a good little buggy. Another thing it comes with a seatbelt and I love that. It takes away my worries from him falling out of it. Highly recommend!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for your little guy or gal!","review":"We got this for my son for walks around the neighborhood as a change from his stroller. He really likes riding in it and \\"steering\\" the car. The hood is great for taking snacks/toys with us and it is very sturdy. As other reviewers have mentioned though, it is very loud on the pavement. Not really a problem during the day, but it has ruled out our night walks. The decals and everything look brand new and we have had this for over a year now. The handle seems a little flimsy, but definetly does the job. We thought we were going to be able to take the handle off and he would be able to push himself around when he got bigger, but the siderails keep him from touching the ground (this is a good thing when going for a walk, but bad for him using it on it's own.) Great deal for the price, but you may also want to consider the the Little Tykes cozy convertible is you are looking for something they can use on their own (The floorboards are removable.) Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun little ride!","review":"My b/g twins love their little cars. I realize I'm pushing two kids at the same time but the plastic wheels are a little loud on pavement.I'm glad I bought them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby goes BUGGY!","review":"I bought this for my nephew's first birthday.

Mommy can push him around while keeping up with the older kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST!!!!!","review":"I bought this for my son when he was 8 or 9 months. He loves it!! We go for a walk everyday. When I walk down the driveway to get the mail I put him in it and we put the mail in the hood of the car. This is a must - even the older kids try to fit in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this toy","review":"My 1 year old loves this toy the only problem we had was we had to return the 1st one because it was missing the seat belt and then the next one the Trunk lid was pushed in and I to for ever to pull it back into place because there is nothing to grab on to I ened up haveing to use a plastic kitchen utensil to pull it out...But now we have Tons of fun with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a stroller","review":"My son will not sit in a stroller, but he drives with one hand on a knee and one hand on the wheel in this. We use it at the mall, and in grocery store -- he loves it and people stop us all the time to look it over. The safety belt keeps him in, and the hood space holds a sip cup, a fresh outfit, and diapers! The handle easily comes off to put the car in a trunk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"toy enthusiast","review":"My 11 month old son loves this buggy! He holds onto the steering wheel as if he's driving and turns his little key. The seatbelt is a definite necessity. He has a tendency to lean over from side to side and without the belt, he would fall out. The only thing that concerns me is that he's so fascinated by the turning wheels that he reaches down and grabs it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy For Grama's House","review":"We love this car and by we I mean our 14 month old grandson as well as Gigi and PaPa. When he comes to visit we push him for hours in the house. The car is the perfect size for me to push him around as I do my chores and I don't hurt my back or shoulders by carrying the little guy. He loves the storage area for balls or the toy of the moment. I wish the horn were easier to honk and the key easier to turn for little hands and fingers. This is a MUST HAVE for toddler households."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO SMALL","review":"I have to say I started out LOVING this Buggy! However, my 13 month old Baby Boy is 35\\" tall & 35 pounds!!! He is quite the \\"Amazon\\"... His long legs now hit the key ignition and steering wheel. When he gets tired of sitting cramped up, he then pushes out his legs and feet so they drag on the ground. I just wish they made the same exact buggy a little bigger. We don't mind the excessive noise... it draws attention to him... and then we get \\"awwwwww.... how adorable\\".... and THAT makes us smile. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but safety concern","review":"My ten month old daughter LOVES to ride in her buggy when we take the dog out for a walk. I agree with the other review that the wheels are VERY loud. But, my main concern is the fact that when the buggy is moving, she reaches down and grabs the wheels. (I have spoken with other mothers who indicate their children do this as well). I doubt that she would get seriously hurt, but you never know. I would feel better if there were some sort of bumpers over the rear wheels to prevent little fingers from getting in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It rocks a one year old's world:)","review":"My daughter absolutely loves being pushed around in this little car.

They love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this!","review":"My son got this for Christmas when he was about 16 months. He would get in it and just look at us waiting for us to push him. We take him for walks in it regularly, and he likes it much better than the stroller. There are 2 reasons I didn't give it 5 stars. 1. I wish the handle was adjustable. I'm 5'3\\", my husband is 6'1\\". The handle is a bit short for him. 2. The steering wheel and horn in ours didn't work. You can't turn the wheel at all, and the horn won't push in to beep. I'm not sure if this was just a problem with ours, or if it's made that way. But overall, we enjoy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great push toy!","review":"We bought this for my son's first birthday. It works great and he loves it!!

How funny... To this day we still talk about her little red bug. It was the best thing we ever got her.... Years of fun pussing her around in it and we gave it away and another family enjoyed years of fun with it also... At the time this was a realy new item and she loved finding things and putting it in the little flap in front. I almost want t buy another just to keep it around when we have friends with kids over,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the kid that won't sit still....","review":"I bought this for my 1 and 1/2 year old for Christmas. She is one of those kids that doesn't stop moving. She hates riding in a stroller and usually won't stay in a wagon. This was the perfect solution. She loves to ride in her car when we go for walks. Another great feature is the seatbelt. Even though she can't get out, she rarely complains. The only negative I've seen so far is that she can touch the ground if she takes her feet off the footrests. Sometimes she drags her shoes on the ground as we're walking. Not too good for the life of the shoes, but I'd rather deal with that than the screaming and Houdini-like escape attempts from the stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fun for the price","review":"This buggy has been so much fun for our family.

We love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY 1 YEAR OLD LOVES THIS","review":"My one year old son ABSOLUTELY loves this toy! From the second he got on it, he was in love with it. This is definately his favorite toy! He must have played on it for an hour and a half, without wanting to get off! I definately reccomend this for any parents who have active children. My son is very active & loves going outside. This is ideal for going for a walk to the park, or going on a mall outing. 5 STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Car","review":"I did a lot of research on toddler push cars and decided to let the amazon reviews guide me on this purchase. I'm glad I did. The reviews are quite accurate. My 12 month old loves this car and so do the other neighborhood kids. All the little ones want their turn. I love the seat belt - keeps him safe. The handle is great too. I'm tall (5' 8\\") and I worried that I would have to bend down to use the handle. Not at all - it is the perfect height - even for moms tall as me. So why 4 stars...I agree with others this little ride is quite loud on the sidewalk and driveway. In and of itself not so bad - but we often find ourselves in a caravan or wagon train with lots of other moms and kids and I can't hear anybody when I'm pushing this car. I have to strain to hear, ask people to repeat themselves and finally I just stop so that I can hear. Not a reason not to buy the car...just know this going in and you can make the best of an overall awesome little ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally worth money","review":"this toy is totally worth the money. my 14 month old loves this toy. when we are outside he runs to this and wants to ride in it all the time. he will not stay in a stroller but will ride in this for a long time. he loves to turn the wheel and wave to people. this is the greatest and we have a bunch of ride on toys and this is our favorite. a must have for little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, but a little small.","review":"I just bought this toy for my 15 month child and he LOVES it. It was VERY easy to put together, and seems VERY durable. My only complaint is that we don't think he'll fit in it much longer than a month or two from now because his barely fits in it. The packaging said it was for a child up to 3 yrs. I doubt many 3-yr-olds could fit in this buggy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four years and still going!","review":"I bought the push around buggy for my son on his first birthday. He will be five in May and he still loves it! His little brother is twenty months and he loves it too. We've used it in parades, around town, shopping and at a local festival to get my son around. Only one of the headlight stickers has come off in all this time! Please note though; do not leave out in the rain or under the sprinklers. It will fill with water inside and it's hard to get out. Boy can it stink! Otherwise this is the best toy I've ever bought. I have another son on the way and I'm sure he'll use it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby's first thrill","review":"This little car was a snap to assemble and a blast to use. My nine-month-old isn't walking yet, but she stood up, stunned, for quite a while, when I first showed her her new little car. She couldn't be more thrilled with it. When I push her around in it, she bounces up and down in excitement, giggles and chortles. She holds onto the steering wheel for balance, which makes her dad and I laugh. She looks like quite the little driver.The car fits her well and the seatbelt seems quite adequate for keeping her safe. We're very happy with it, and can't wait for warmer weather so we can try it outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beep Beep","review":"Our 12 month old loved this gift from his Grammy.

He LOVES it, and so do the adults that don't have to bend over to push him around (especially his 6'2\\" daddy :). It fits in the back of my (Volvo) wagon even without taking off the handle, so it's easy to take \\"on the road.\\" The trunk is a great feature too. Jason loves opening and closing it, and it's big enough to pack a picnic lunch and other essentials. If you're considering a toy like this that doesn't have a seatbelt, think again.

If you are, stay away from this one. Even the most maniacal collector should beware. It's worse than the worst vinyl bootleg you've ever heard. Thin, compressed, recorded-from-the-lobby recordings complete with ambient noise, volume fluctuations, and electronic garble. Now, I've been a giant Giant fan from the very beginning and might even admit that this may be a less-than-inspired performance, too. Bad photos and graphics combined with no information make for cheezy packaging as well.

It gives concise and easy to follow instructions on many exercises and they are broken down by body parts. What makes this especially valuable is that she give you reminders to tell your client plus things to watch out for as a trainer for each exercise. I only wish she had added more of this in the book.

It's jam packed and filled to the brim with practical knowledge about how to become fit and/or a fitness trainer. 2.It discusses aspects of training yourself or others that most people never consider, such as: When to say when,Trainer ethics and credibility, and the importance of functional fitness. 3. Teri writes like she talks which means the book is more fun to read than most others. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Brand new replacement part (not refurbished), works great (power mirror works) and very reasonably priced! The part is exactly like the original. Two minor things: first I had to modify the rubber seal that fits between the mirror and the door by cutting off the rubber nipple that fits into the door frame; otherwise, I wasn't able to get the mirror to sit flush against the door. Second, the original screws that fastened the original mirror were not long enough to reach the screw holes for this mirror, so I used some sheet metal screws instead. Still, a very good product and very affordable."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"although deaver is among one of my favorite authors,I just couldn't 'get into' this book.I struggled almost halfway through before finally giving up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I've read all of Deaver's books eagerly awaiting the next one. This one however, I've tried to read many times and just cannot garner enough interest to keep reading. I even checked to see if it was one of his first efforts at writing books. For me it was just unreadable and very disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Forgettable I Actually Forgot It","review":"Seriously, I started reading this on a trip, started talking to someone on the plane, and a week later realized that I must have left it in the seat pocket. It didn't grab me, and it definitely didn't hold me. Additionally, the punctuation, spelling, and diction were so bad they were distracting--I assume Deaver's publisher failed to provide him with either an editor or copyeditor. I recommend skipping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good - but not one of his best","review":"I have read all of Jeffrey Deaver's books, and have enjoyed each and every one of them. While, this book was engrossing, I did not feel that it was up to par with some of his others, like \\"Bone Collector\\", \\"Coffin Dancer\\", \\"Devil's Teardrop\\", or my all-time favorite - \\"A Maiden's Grave\\" - all of which I would rate as 5+-star books. I'm looking forward to reading another new book by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deaver is capable of better works.","review":"This is the 5th of Deaver's novels I've read and I know that he can do better. There are too many characters in this book and too many sub-plot branches that make it \\"messy.\\" As a result, they robs the narrative of its precision and tensions that Deaver usually crafts brilliantly (in \\"bone collector\\" and in \\"maiden's grave\\" for instance)."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his first I believe.","review":"What can I say?

His later books I've devoured."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"I have read almost all of Deaver's novels. About 1/4 of the way into this book, I had to question if this was written by the same author! The book is not like the other Deaver books I have read. The story is hard to follow. It is very fragmented, and seems to go nowhere. It did not hold my interest at all and I had to keep going back to keep up with the ever changing storyline and addition of characters. Was this really written by Jeffery Deaver?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate not to finish a book","review":"I have never been one to not finish a book once I start one. Even though I did finish The Lesson of Her Death, I wish I would have thrown it in the trash. The Story line was interesting enough but the sexual tone of the book was dirty and too graphic for my taste and not needed to enhance the story. I have read hundreds of mystery book and with the rating this book received from its Amazon readers I thought I would welcome Jeffery Deaver into my library. Big mistake, the book got thrown out with the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nail biting Deaver thriller","review":"Bill Corde is a former big city cop turned small town detective who is assigned to investigate a murder of a local college girl. Although signs point to a cult killing, Corde knows better and he closes in on the real killer. He discovers the victim has left him with a number of suspects and as he gets closer to the killer, the killer gets closer to him. In typical Deaver fashion, there are twists and turns with every new chapter. You are kept guessing until the very end as to the identity of the murderer. The book is a smooth read and it held my interest throughout. Deaver conveys real suspense and dread by bringing the Hero's children into the sights of the villain. Deaver and suspense fans will find this as a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller!!","review":"I've now read all of Deaver's books in paperback & I've loved them all. It's a shame not all of them are in print. This one is a real thriller that really surprised me in the end. The characters were very believable & as all of his books, the handicapped person was portrayed with accuracy. How can we get some of Deavers out of print writing back in print??

From what I can see, it was designed as a DOS-based, off-line product, that has been shoehorned onto the Internet, and shows it.

Some of it might seem abit overboard, but hey, whose to say....read it and decide for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of hype on this book but it's disappointing in many ways","review":"This is something of an updated Mel Tappan \\"Survival Guns\\" and \\"Tappan on Survival\\". It's just not as ground-breaking or as enjoyable to read as Tappan's works were. Some of it is informative but a lot of it is wasted rhetoric. I guess if you're interested in how to circumvent the authorities, you might be thrilled with sections of this book but if you look at the size of the book and think you will be getting a lot of information on firearms, you will be disappointed. The book is heavy on rifles, light on handguns and almost devoid of information on shotguns. I'm not into rifles. I'm not real interested in how to buy and sell firearms at gun shows. I'm also not real sure the quasi-legal advise given in this book is trustworthy. For those who are already members of the Boston choir, this sermon will be thrilling. For the rest of us, it's pretty disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Good, Amazon Customer Service Sometimes Stinks","review":"I gave it 1 star - when the book itself deserves 5 - just to get your attention. The current version of this book (a/o 6/11/2011) was published in 2009. But when you use Amazon's search suggestion for Boston's Gun Bible 2009, what you get is the 2002 version. I directed Amazon's customer service's attention to this, and their response was simply \\"Well, it's the 2002 version we're seling.\\" Second time I've had exactly the same response to the same problem - a search suggestion supposedly pointing at the current version actually leading to an out-of-date version. So be prepared to return if you order and get the 2002 version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This is an excellent book that covers firearms that are biased towards self defense shooting.

Many, no doubt, say that \\"Boston\\" is very pro-rights, and this is true. However, if you were trying to learn about Fords, would you buy a book written about them by a dedicated Chevy man? Boston brings to the keyboard a fascinating mix of information, stories, first hand experience, quotes, and references that are almost staggering in their volume. This is, however, the main reason that you should buy this tome. It will stand on your bookshelf as a reference manual for quite a period of time to come. You will constantly refer to it for the little questions that keep cropping up constantly over the years. It is undoubtably the only book on the subject that you will ever need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm this is not really a technical book","review":"If you are looking for a technical book to improve your marksmanship, this isn't really it.

This book is a must have for anyone with any interest in guns, be it a weekend shooter or serious collector. Out of all the gun publications I have read, this one is by far the most practical, helpful and easy to understand that I have read. Even the most technical of topics are easily understood. Reviews and comparisons of equipment are based on practical topics and are given without bias. Includes everything that every gun owner should know and understand, from shooting to buying/selling/trading, legal issues, et al. Having read various technical publications across various fields, I have yet to find anything that equals Boston's Gun Bible when it comes to the vast amount of information that is contained in one book. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boston's.....","review":"Great book. A must read for any gun enthusiast; beginner to expert. Thoroughly researched technical info as well as thought provoking philosophical ideas. Lots of founder quotes which I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LOVE GUNS AND FREEDOM YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!!","review":"This was the first \\"Boston T. Party\\" book I bought. I am not flush with money so I don't buy many books these days. In less than a year my copy is tattered, dog eared and has MANY pages marked. It is THE book of battle rifles and the chapters about creeping gun control and what you should do about it are worth the price alone. If you are thinking of buying a battle rifle BUY THIS BOOK FIRST so you don't make a mistake!! If you love freedom and understand how guns are what preserve freedom buy this book for the chapters on that subject. My favorite chapter is \\"Boston is NUTS!\\"You will NOT be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not about guns!!","review":"It's about being a Patriot and returning America back to the land of the free.Off course there is a vast wealth of knowledge in here covering many, many weapons and all the correlating ammunition. Use it to wisely choose a weapon or three. There are defensive tactics, gun safety issues, politics, philosophy, some necessary ranting and a few attitude adjustments to boot. This is a must read for all Americans, not just us members of the gun culture.The overiding theme of the book for me was preparedness. BUY THIS BOOK, use the information to learn as much as you can about guns and related issues. Take heed, and stand tall."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOSTON'S","review":"Great reference source for those who have a general knowledge of firearms.

This is it.","review":"Yes, I disagree with Boston on a couple minor technical points (and was proud to see my \\"contribution\\" on Aimpoint optics in the latest edition), but being active-duty Army, this is the only civilian weapons book I make room in the bags for when deploying overseas. When our battalion was issued M14 rifles from storage, the class I gave on iron-sight zero procedures came right out of BGB. I'm on my third copy as it keeps growing legs, and bought copies for some of my soldiers as welcome-home gifts.BTW, the M855/SS109 is better and punching holes in things, but you're correct in that its inferior on soft tissue. When possible here, I followed SOCOM's lead ans scrounged some Black Hills match grade 5.56 loaded with the 77 grain Sierra. Works great if you don't have an M14 handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one of the few books that I'd pay the premium for a hardcover!","review":"If you take self defense seriously - buy this book. If you take citizenship seriously - buy this book. This is the definitive text on American gun ownership. As you read this book, you'll grow more comfortable with weapons and less comfortable with government-generated anti-self defense dogma. This book will help you select the right tool(s) to defend you & your family & your country! Thank you Boston! Also, I highly recommend Molon Labe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows the truth about guns, politics, and philosophy.","review":"I would strongly recommend this book to anyone even vaguely interested in firearms, but also to those who want to realize the truth about where America is heading today. With no-nonsense reviews, facts, and suggestions, I believe this book will not only be a Gun Bible, but also a Liberty Bible. In the coming years it will be a blueprint for gaining freedom from a socialist government. For all the Americans who believe that real patriotism goes beyond just putting an American flag sticker on your car, this and all other books by Boston T. Party are required reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start","review":"This book would be a good start for anyone just beginning to enter the world of firearms.

Other reviewers have already provided a lot of details - let me just say that you'll get your money's worth and then some in the first few chapters. Need a strategy for what to buy? It's here. Need a plan for when to shoot and how much? It's here. Want details on good gun buys for hunting and defense? That's here too. And I'm only 1/4 of the way through it all.

About 30 minutes long, the tape starts with a warm-up, proceeds with the work out and finishes with stretches for the muscles that you just exercised. The main part of the work out cosists of about 5-6 different excersize series. Each of them is some variation of the old but proven lunges, squats, and leg lifts. What is really helpful for me is that while there are not any \\"revolutionary\\" new exerices, I am forced to do all the repetitions--something that I do not have the discipline to do by looking at a magazine or going to the gym. And judging by the areas where I am sore after I do this series, the routine works out not only the legs but the but as well.My only issue with the tape is that Claudia does not have the controlled movements we are led to believe are safest and most effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible form","review":"The exercises in this video would be effective if done properly. Although Kathy Kaehler (Schiffer's trainer) demonstrates the proper form, Schiffer doesn't follow through when she's exercising. She seems very awkward and not into the moves at all.

First of all, bettas requires air to breathe. Having a plant in the bowl takes up too much surface space for the little guy or gal. Secondly 3/4 gallon is completely inappropriate. Bettas are tropical fish who requires to be in heated water with temperatures ranging from 75 to 80 degrees. There is no room for even a Hydor 7.5W mini heater. Third, ammonia can easily build up within a few hours. Bettas are sensitive fish who requires in pristine water. You would have to be changing his or her water like 2-3 times a day. Yes it may be stressful but eventually the fish will settle down. I would rather have a stressed yet healthy fish in clean water than a happy yet unhealthy fish in dirty water.

Anthony Quinn's performance in the title role suggests a cheap thug rather than the beautiful soul trapped in a hideous body. Gina Lollobrigida is full of sex appeal as the ill-fated gypsy dancer, Esmeralda, but she comes across like too much the tart, and not the innocent of the novel. While the photography is lovely, this film suffers in comparision to the other major versions of this classic tale. I would recommend this film only if you want to compare it with the other versions.

Ron Silver deserved one as well for his work as Alan Dershowitz, von Bulow's legal eagle and fascinating foil, the embodiment of chutzpah.

It features strong performances from Glenn Close, and Ron Silver as Dershowitz, and Barbet Schroeder won an Academy Award nomination as Best Director. But in the end, this movie is all about the portrayal of Claus von Bulow by Jeremy Irons, in an Oscar winning performance. Irons is superbly ambiguous throughout, never allowing the audience to finally settle its sympathies with his character.Irons' final line is typically enigmatic: \\"Just kidding.\\" This movie is well worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST AS MUCH FUN AS A LETHAL INJECTION","review":"After seeing this on TMC a few years back, my grandfather would dress as the terrorists from this movie.

The story is character driven, but the main characters aren't particulary interesting or believable. Their (endless) ruminations about films are so banal I kept wondering if the author was deliberately making fun of them. The fact that main character Harriet is supposed to be a writer is also hard to buy into, given her slightly creepy and thoroughly pedestrian missives to her idol, Pauline Kael. The setting is supposedly contemporary, but the characters' sensibilities and interests seem oddly constricted and old fashioned -- as when husband Lew flees the undercurrent of marital tensions by retreating to his room to play his mandolin.

The liquid needle may have too many holes for easy filling as you have to keep it submerged about 2 inches. If you don't have that much liquid all you do is suck air.

The output is not near the bottom of the needle...instead, there are multiple holes along the side of the extremely long needle. Even when injecting a 9lb pork butt, the top holes were exposed allowing my injection fluid to expel from those areas and not into the meat. Also, the diameter of both needles are very large leaving huge holes in my products. Perhaps there is a market for this item but it is only injecting very large cuts of meat....it's not a utility style injector."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I hadn't","review":"This injector has not worked for me at all. I find that it is only really useful for liquid injection and even then, it is difficult to assemble (the parts aren't mechanically perfect) and injecting it into meat such as a chicken breast results in a lot of projectile splatter of the marinade. Hurray, salmonella on the walls and ceiling!I'm giving it two stars (instead of one) because I hold hope that someone with greater skill could make this thing work wonders for them. For me, it's a wasted $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"The packaging of the product was already open and the rings on the base were damaged.

It appears to be made from quality base materials. The first thing I noticed was the smell of machine oil. Not a problem as I was going to wash before using anyway. I found that the tips would not fully seat into the barrel. The threads had not been machined all the way through on the barrel fitting. Also when I separated the plunger form the barrel, it was full of metal shavings. I've seen better quality work from a high school machine shop. The threads are metric so it was a little challenging to clean them up. The tips had to be tightened with pliers so no leakage would occur at the attachment point. Once this is done, the unit works well. The thought of needing pliers to attach and remove the tips is reason enough to return item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Injector","review":"it's great and durable.

I called to get a replacement ring but the company said that they did not carry them and that they could not help me get one.I could not find a replacement elsewhere. So the extra money you pay for the metal injector is not worth it. A cheap plastic one would cost much less and last longer. Poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality seals - suffers from \\"weakest link\\" syndrome","review":"The plastic seals turn a potentially good product into junk. Plastic is too hard to easily tighten needle by hand, so the liquid runs out of syringe or shoots out of seal when injecting the meat. Will try to replace with some softer rubber o-rings from the hardware store, something the manufacture should have done in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great turkey injector","review":"I used this product for my thanksgiving turkey and it worked great!

The customer service was great, got a replacement in less than a week. I just hope it was a defect in the first one and not a design issue, this thing is made in China, so I don't know yet.

Luv the SS for ease of use. Its a little tight for the first try but you get over that real quick.

Comes apart without a hitch for cleaning. I bought the 2oz.which is perfect for my needs. Might want to go for thr four oz. if your roast or shoulder ect. is on the big lb. size but can't see the need for myself. The needles are great and just the right size.

This album however is the WORST live album I have EVER heard. The audience doesn't seem too entertained. Usually when an artists begins and finishes a song on a live album, you hear thunderous applause. Not the case on this one. Did she only sing to 5 people? Pam's vocals and the band seem off as well. Normally really energetic songs like Mi Vida Loca sound dull, drug out and boring. Don't be fooled by the amount of songs either. 3 of the songs are a medley and only portions of them are played.

DiLorenzo's inability to craft English sentences with a subject and object is not quite as disturbing as his inability to preserve historical integrity. He has presented no \\"myth busters\\" to anyone who has read an American historical text in the past decade. I am a capitalist, and for the most part agree with DiLorenzo's standpoint.

Its not going to be stable like the big metal arcade ones of course but it gets the job done. Easy to fold and put away, dont get dirty at all (unless you like to eat ketchup Popsicle while dancing[which is dangerous by the way])and also fun. The pad does move around while you dance any if you have big feet (like myself) you will be pressing a few buttons at a time.

And I got what I paid for. Half of the time the buttons don't work when you press them so if you are trying to use this mat for points or challenges it isn't worth the time. The mat slides all over the place while you are using it so you have to stop and adjust it after each song. But for 5 dollars I shouldn't have expected a great mat. I don't think I would recommend any one buying this mat since shipping costs more than it does and you are frustrated by the time you finish playing.

It's incredibly slow and the plot is so convoluted and confusing, it's hard to keep up with it, if you even stay with it to the end. Mira Sorvino and Olivier Martinez sleepwalk through their roles, and it is only the glorious presence of Italian screen legend Alida Valli that induces me to give it two stars. She is marvelous as the elderly lady whose story is at the heart of the picture. She commands the screen with gentle elegance and she deserved a better movie than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to give it a chance...","review":"I really wanted to give this movie a chance, because I am a Olivier Martinez fan, and speaking of him specifically, and not really the movie, he didn't have his usual French accent. I guess that's a small thing to focus on, but I ended up yelling at my tv screen for Olivier to bring back the French accent. And if you like his accent, which I do, he sounds like a completely different person, and not in a good way, I hate to admit. It's an awful movie, I hate to say, there's no positive spin I can put on it. There is one cute line that Olivier says, and it's funny but, I can't remember what it is, I guess that should be an indication of how awful this movie is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I like what another revioewer said to described the \\"sleepwalking\\" acting in this movie.

Ninety-five percent of it was anecdotes and generalities, none of which had much value. The writing is mostly in the nature of celebrating the fact that this wonderful thing, the ringing sound, exists, and how great it is to have found it. All of which I agree with, but I wanted more about how to meditate on it, and I found very little here. The best thing about the book is the bibliography, where you might find authors who have more of substance to offer.There isn't a lot written about the ringing sound (anahata nadam in Sanskrit, or Naam). I, for one, will have to keep looking.Since posting the words above, I've come upon The Law of Attention: Nada Yoga and the Way of Inner Vigilance, by Edward Salim Michael. It is exceptional, with four or five substantial chapters devoted to the inner sound. If you want to learn about the inner sound, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guide to the Sound Current","review":"The Ringing Sound is not just for those experiencing unusual auditory sensations. It is a revealing and enlightening guide to an ancient, secretly guarded meditation technique known as the Sound Current. As an introduction to the Sound Current, the book unites physics with metaphysics in an exploration of the nature of all life as energy. Tapping into the Source of energy through the Sound Current is the exciting goal.The book is a culmination of many years spent by the author studying a variety of spiritual paths ranging from Shamanism to yoga and marshal arts. Written in a clear, concise style, it is beautifully formatted with intriguing sidebar quotations which add literary beauty as well as meaning to the main text. The result for this reader was a joyful, ahaa feeling on practically every page. It is highly recommended for all who seek an accelerated journey along the spiritual path."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Topic, Good \\"Start\\"","review":"The book has a great title and a good but brief introduction to the topic, but falls short of the promise by padding a few good pages of information into book-length with \\"la-la\\" filler. I was bothered that the entire \\"what you hear\\" section was vague and hardly filled one page. For example, there was no mention that many folks hear chords, and no mention of the pitch, that very curiously for many is the older musical key of A (~425 Hz), might possibly be the source of our musical scale, and no mention that the sounds become stronger when one clinches one's teeth. Nonetheless, this book is the first entry into a field rarely separately discussed, and my hope is that we don't have to wait long for the \\"fully researched and revised edition\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and useless","review":"This book is ONLY a comic relief, there is nothing here that you can learn. The words \\"How to\\" in the title are misleading. I was mislead by great reviews here, so want to warn other potential buyers. I bought this book as a gift to my girlfriend because we got a cat and she has never had cats before, only dogs. I was hoping that she will learn something from it. She read the whole thing in about 20 minutes, smiled a couple of times and that's it.

It is mildly humorous, but it mostly left me wondering whether the author has ever even lived with a cat. Probably about 1/3 of the material is right on target, but most does not apply to any cat I've ever had and certainly not most cats. My mother read the whole thing, and her first comment was that she thought the author had never been in the same room with a cat. Way too much of it is based on bad stereotypes (e.g. that cats scratch people a lot) or complete misinformation.I wasn't expecting anything beyond light humor, but I did expect for it to actually apply to how cats really are! Parts of the book are funny, but most of it is either repetitive or just inaccurate.

Sorry.....I could not use any of the pieces. This is not the fault of the CD. However it should not have been recommended for dance class use.....I am very unhappy that the magazine recommended it for general studio use. The language is 100% unacceptable to use in class.

I will never use this material much less listen to it for any recreational pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!","review":"I could not be any more disappointed with the new Outkast album. I have been a fan from the beginning and they have consistently put out phenomenal albums...until now. This is yet another instance where the duo has reinvented their sound but it just doesn't work this time. First of all, their are far too many tracks on the album. Most of the tracks dont deserve a second listen as they are poorly written and produced. Even their current singles are lacking in comparison with their previous work. After Spearboxx/the love below, this work is simply embaressing. Perhaps, Andre and Big Boi should collaborate more as the best tracks are the four that includes both members collectively.Unfortunately I DO NOT recommend this album to even the most loyal of Outkast fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!","review":"I love Outkast, rushed to the store to buy it. Couldn't wait to get home and listen to it... so I opened it and put it in the car cd player and 1 track skip, 2 track okay but skip...3, 4,5 -12 tracks skip, skip, skip, skip. WTF. So maybe it will sound different in the home stereo sysytem. So go home and gave all the songs a solid listen and felt like somebody con me and stole my money.

Quit hatin."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has not gotten nearly enough love!","review":"I'm very saddened by how understated this album is. It is one of the most unique albums I own, even more daring than Outkast's usual showings. Simply put, this album just works. The instrumentals are pure joy, and the songs range from blues to soul to Outkast's signature style of hip-hop. If you enjoy Outkast, and enjoyed the musical feel of the movie (I definitely can't speak for the movie's plot) then you absolutely must get this album. It's a must-have for any fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"What else is there to say...it's definately a great CD and I love everything that's on it.

I Love most of the tracks, and I think the other ones will grow on me much Like 'The Love Below' did. I think the more surprising part to this album so far after only three listenings is Big Boi's tracks. I am always impressed to see what he does now that Andre seems to be going into a different direction. I wish more groups tried to fuse there styles together instead of just breaking up over creative differences....

I never though I would even be using the words 'worst' and 'OutKast' in the same conversation. Matter of fact, this was their only bad album. I am a die-hard outkast fan. Andre 3000 is my idol. However, I have to admit this album sux. I can't believe that Kast would even put out something of such low quality. They must of had a contract obligation to fulfil or something. I knew it would sound different because after all, it is an OutKast album, but damn, this Idlewild album sounds horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, but loves Outkast","review":"I purchased the Idlewild CD from another source, only to find that some of the songs I was digging on the movie were not selections on the CD.

As soon as I received it, I immediately made notes in it and it is not resalable condition.Good prodeuct, but outdated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I started with this book!","review":"When I first picked up this book it looked so technical. Then I began to read it and the basic premise hit me like a ton of bricks. Robert Dietz uses the Circle of Fifths in a way I have never seen before. First he will show you a simple way to instantly identify the notes on your guitar following the circle. This has facilitated my reading skills very well. Then he shows you how by knowing this information you can just as easily identify the triad chords and scales. The rest of the information that follows builds on these skills and tie into a well formed method for finding harmonized and altered chords, and modes. The section on modes breaks them down into basic forms that follow the BEAD pattern so that you can identify the modes as well. I wish I had this book when I started. In the last weeks it has improved my knowlege of the guitar neck. I've been playing for about four years and I've struggled with all the notes till now. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAD Method Review","review":"If you are learning by tablature, this book may not be as helpful as it would be if you are learning to play the guitar using musical theory and are a visual learner. I've used other methods, such as \\"Fret Board Logic\\", and numerous articles from websites, but \\"BEAD Method\\" made it click for me. I can honestly say, I now know the notes on the guitar fret board. Moreover, this publication helped me better visualize the \\"CAGED\\" method of learning the major, minor and pentatonic scales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow Trip Hop Tunes for Low Lighting Levels","review":"I was very pleased with this disc. I read several positive reviews (here on Amazon) that defined it perfectly. This is primarily an instrumental album that sticks with the down-tempo and mellow theme, with occassional up-tempo break beats.I would recommend this anytime you would want to \\"chill out\\" or be intimate with someone. If you have a nice sound system or a great set of headphones, the bass and tempo will put your brain in the mood. If you have love for early Morcheeba or late Massive Attack, this disk would fit sonically in your CD changer or playlist just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad stuff","review":"A very beatsy and decent chillout/kickback CD. I play this CD in the background when friends come over. I really like the songs on here except a couple of tracks, but generally I'm satisfied with the CD. However I wouldn't recommend it if you're into more mellow moods. A couple of friends were more into the melodic chillout and found the beats kind of heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chill?!? Not exactly.","review":"My idea of \\"Chill\\" music is Hed Kandi's 'Serve Chilled' or 'Winter Chill'--they're the BEST--or Cafe del Mar, Man Ray, or Budda Bar II.

More pointless than the original. The cast is good and so are the special effects. The production values are high...but the movie just plays like cheap drive-in shlockfest. People relate to each other by hitting or worse. You can't follow what anyone wants because the dead are never really defined (Gus was actually better as a dead guy, right?) and the living start losing their minds.It's just pointless.

The sad thing is that the movie starts out pretty good. For starters.. fans of horror will enjoy the excessive amount of gore. The heavy metal soundtrack works well. And the film is atmospheric in a macabre sort of way. The big issue is the last 25 minutes, the production value goes rapidly down hill. Even though the gore continues, true fans of quality horror films will be disappointed in the over all product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borring and pointless!!!!!","review":"This movie its such a waste of time!!! my sister and I saw this movie last night!!! we were really bored, its a pointless movie, bad acting, it's just horrible!!!!! it will never be as Stephen kings original Pet sematary!!!! if you wanna see this movie see....... ummmm lol!!! just don't see it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Bury Me...","review":"One would think that someone would've taken a bulldozer or something to that burial grounds, or paved it over...

A dead evil stepfather coming back to be an undead evil stepfather!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked it","review":"Pet Semetary two was much more actioned packed than the first movie and more deaths/gore. The only thing thats odd about this film is unlike in other films the sequel has a connection two the first film and has continuity, this sequel is completely different than the first movie with hardly any continuity. In the first film the evil buriel ground is called the \\"micmac\\" in this film it's called \\"m'iqmaq\\" Much more interesting than the first film. In 2003 they were going to make a third film but it was cancelled :("},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is This?","review":"Making a sequel to \\"Pet Sematary\\" was completely pointless. In other horror films, we learn new things about the villains in the sequels. But what are we to discover in this pathetic sequel, that some kids also know of the place on earth that raises the dead, even though in the first film and novel it was a place only the old folks new of. Instead of a failed attempt at remaking the similar kind of terror from the first film, they could have made a prequel or something about the origins of the place and how the Micmac Indians discovered the ground was \\"sour\\".

Anthony Edwards (who should have known better) and Edward Furlong (who shouldn't have, probably) star as a father and son who move to the town which the Creed family from the first movie didn't have so much luck in. Mayhem ensues. A zombified sheriff oozing face goo onto his cute little screaming wife as he sexually assaults her... A box full of chewed-up kittens... A young boy getting his neck snapped in a scene which winds up being played for laughs... These scenes are not just disgusting, they are in bad taste.The first movie was not \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"-caliber cinema either, but at least it was scary and a decent \\"popcorn\\" movie. It was gross too, but it was practically \\"Annie\\" compared to this sequel's pointless, offensive gore-a-thon. Apparently the filmmaker's goal was to make as many audience members as possible flee the theater retching. Mission accomplished.

THE MOVIE IS A JOKE.","review":"The only redeeming value in this so-called \\"sequel\\" (that King had nothing to do with, mind you) is the soundtrack, featuring heartfelt power ballads and thrashing punk anthems. The movie itself seemed like just an excuse to push the gore envelope around for a while. Earns two stars for the soundtrack and Clancy Brown's performance as a dull-witted, mean-spirited law enforcement official. Otherwise a total waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pet Sematary 2. Stay away at all costs.","review":"This movie was a joke. What a waste of no talent bums. Bad acting. Bad story. And it really has nothing to do with the original. Two punk kids use the infamous burying ground to raise the dead. One uses it to bring back his dog and another to bring back his mom. This movie warrants nothing but regret that you rented or purchased it. If you like any of the actors in this film, I suggest you stay away even more. You may end up having less respect for them after having to induce this vomit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow-up","review":"This movie is actually good.

You quickly realize what a terrible, terrible movie Pet Sematary Two is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun and Silliness","review":"I thought this movie was ok as cheap horror flicks go, but the one reason to see it is to watch Clancy Brown eating mashed potatoes with his hands. I cannot see him in anything else without thinking of that scene. Worth seeing the whole movie for this scene alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good, but has its moments","review":"Sequels to films based upon Stephen King stories are usually rather awful. The \\"Children of the Corn\\" formula was beaten into the ground fairly early, and the sequel to \\"Carrie\\" was an absolute dog. This one, although it is a clunky, poorly-written hack job, is nonetheless entertaining in places. It it worth viewing just for Clancy Brown's outrageously funny portrayal of Gus. Other than that, it's nothing special. Edward Furlong somehow manages to look and act creepier than the villains, but watch it anyway. Gus is a gas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly disappointing sequel","review":"It's amazing that with Mary Lambert at the helm of this sequel to her richly chilling adaptation of the Stephen King novel that this film is as emotionless and empty as it is. Anthony Edwards and Edward Furlong play a father and son who move near a familiar pet cematary after a tragic accident. There's no point in going into the overall story, because the screen writer sure didn't put too much thought into the story himself. Animals and people die, they get buried, and then they come back rather homicidal. This goes on for a while, with some nice gore effects, but it's all rather pointless. Clancy Brown (Highlander, HBO's Carnivale) is at his usual psychotic best, but he's lost in the middle of this schlock fest. All in all, this dismal sequel can't come close to how good the first film was, and is better left on the scrap heap."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont care what you say. this movie was good","review":"First off, you shouldnt be watching this if gore offends you. Its a \\"horror\\" movie and you should expect that. Also, most people didnt get the plot, which is death. Learning to deal with death and learning that it is a natural part of life that you should learn to deal with. Hence the dark brooding feel of the film. I enjoyed this movie start to finish without being bored and I thought it was a good way to end the franchise. They even played The Ramones again at the end of the film! Buy it if you liked the first"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and nothing else","review":"This second film by Mary Lambert, on a screenplay that has nothing to do with Stephen King, is a gross remake of the first one. All the elements of depth of the first film have been erased and annihilated. There is only one thing left : the grossness of the living deads and their only desire to get even with the world, to get their vengeance. The only interesting situation at the beginning of the film is the quick exploration of the relations among teenagers (boys only please) and the constant fear and hassling that the bullies impose on their unluckily willing mates. Apart from that the rest is gore, blood, gross special effects and at times unbearable artificial tension. This film has nothing to do with Stephen King's imagination, even if it carries a Stephen King title.

So for me to go from VHS to this was extremely significant. I bought this series right away, because I was always a fan of just mainly the original crew (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, etc.). After seeing the new movie, it renewed my interest, (excellent marketing Paramount!) The HD picture is so much better on this set and the new special effects shots are stunning. I am in shock and awe that this series came out in the 1960's. You will be also when you see the new effects. I also noticed that some of the action is remastered in HD audio. For example, when Kirk throws a punch, you hear it well. The only issue I was curious about was whether they would decide to remaster \\"The Cage\\"(the original pilot) or just leave \\"The Menagerie Pt. 1&2\\" as enough of the episode. This show is really great and a must see for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Bodly Go with New Effects","review":"I must admit that I have haven't viewed these in HD yet.

I've heard and read criticisms of the digitial enhancments from many of the purists, but I am quite sure Gene himself would approve of the changes made.

Really astonishing. Good color, contrast and HD.- Very nice new special effects, done from scratch. Also possible to see both effects: original and new one. I enjoy this feature a lot.- Fully remastered digital sound, but keeping the original music and effects.Cons:- No wide screen. (I suppose this is technically impossible to accomplish, without distorting the image on screen) So you will see black bars on both sides. Not a big deal, considering this is a 1960s TV show!- Sound too quiet. Even if you increase volume, it seems that some details are lost.- Episodes are not in the right order. Can anyone explain why is this? Annoying...Conclusion:- If you are a Star Trek fan (even if you are a Sci-Fi fan), you definitely MUST have this. It is a classic, ...and made in HD.- You can live with the minor cons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Trekker!","review":"When I first saw an episode of the HD Star Trek I could't wait to get it on DVD. It was everything I expected...but too much. I am not a fan of the combo DVD/HDDVD discs (Hence the 4 stars not 5). I feel like I have to use kid gloves to avoid scratching 1 side (which I did first day). To see The Original series with the remastered and enhanced effects made it worth purchasing thou. The bonus features could have been a little better thou, I was expecting a bit more behind the scenes stuff with the HD aspect giving more room for additional material.

You can tell the people who worked on this project put a lot of love and respect into their work. The picture is awesome! I like just looking at the restored and enhanced Enterprise. We have just one quibble; why aren't the episodes in order. We collected the series on VHS and each tape had two episodes with original air dates on them. The episodes in this set don't coincide. What's up with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the Sound Level???","review":"The picture looks stunning and makes this purchase worth buying. I'm not sold on the special effects as yet. I think there's something so special about the original effects because it was done with real models and there is an artistic-ness in that alone. Thankfully both versions are available which makes this set worth buying.I am very disappointed in the sound level of these episodes. I have to turn my volume up to max on my TV to hear them the way I'm used to watching movies. I don't know what's going on. The preview for the new Star Trek movie sound is loud and great but the playing the episodes sound is way too weak. Switching back to the original episodes soundtrack helps but not that much.

Blu Ray movies are 50% more than normal DVDs while HD is usually around 25% more. I think this is the only thing that's keeping the race going.The Star trek sereies is great, no doubt, but to charge this much is absurd. They are alienating those who might be on the hi-def fence by showing them that it's not only a hefty investment in the machines, but that they are going to get taken to the cleaners on the DVDs.Ouch, this is just a slap in the face to not only Star Trek fans (like myself) but a great way to convince people NOT to go Hi Def.These need to be $79 a season for me to even consider them. I got the original DVDs for $40 a season and love them, and would love to have the new Hi-Def versions... but not at thier asking price. Pretty sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't these Star Trek DVDs of the original TV series!","review":"After careful of the contents list of each episode, I have noticed that one episode is missing - \\"Assignment Earth\\".

Given your typical new HD-DVD release is about $27 a disc and twice the price of the DVD for the same title this is actually really good value!I haven't seen the disc yet so can't comment on the content quality - we get a \\"preview\\" at our local cinema in a couple weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Old Schooler is Cooler!","review":"Great set! Buying Now is actually cheaper if you buy each complete season separately rather than the 3 in one package. Do the math.This edition has not been touched from its original version.

Gene Roddenberry put together a cast that clicks and the characters mesh well. \\" Star Trek, the Next Generation\\" is likewise entertaining for the same reasons.

I look forward to seeing seasons 2 & 3 in this format as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, except for the packaging","review":"The series looks and sounds great. But the packaging is ill-conceived. The actual DVD's are in a flimsy plastic library held together by tape (really I'm not kidding). The paper insert has no sleeve to hold it so you have to stick it next to the plastic library in the big yellow case. There is an additional paper sleeve that wraps around the plastic library but it fits too tightly to be at all practical or convenient. Whoever designed the casing and packaging should be punished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I can't remember how quickly the product was shipped, but the case and all the DVDs were in perfect condition. I bought them new, so of course this is to be expected but doesn't always happen. I absolutely love the Star Trek series for the dynamic and comical trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy; the cheesy but often inspired story lines; and the endearingly low-budget set and costumes. I don't really love some of the \\"upgrades\\" made to the show in recent times (such as the redone graphics to make the various planets look like actual planets rather than rubber bouncy balls; and the addition of the occasional shuttle craft landing in the landing dock which were never present in the show as it was when it was first airing, etc., dinting the cheesy quality a little), but they don't bother me so much as to make me not spend money on the series. I basically just think they were totally unnecessary.Anyway, I am totally satisfied.

While f/x are only part of the appeal in today's programming...a great story being first & foremost, I was very pleased to see the excellent updates presented in the original series. I had not realized the extent to which I have come to expect superior graphics until I started watching this season 1 updated version.

Look at the Amazon listing....it says \\"English Subtitles\\". Well guess what.....there are none. It has FRENCH and SPANISH...but NOT ENGLISH. Someone at CBS or Paramount or whomever actually made this for the ENGLISH speaking AMERICAN market needs to be shot. And Amazon too, since they incorrectly list this.I am hearing impaired an need subtitles. The non- remastered edition has English subtitles-- which I already own. The clarity looks so good on the remaster, but sadly I cannot hear much of the dialogue or read the actor's lips when they are off cam and speaking. A huge blunder and disservice to hearing impaired / English speaking fans.

He said that this is the best gift he's ever received and since he worked as a TV/movie grip for many yrs and worked with William Shatner on TJ Hooker and Billy Blackburn and some of the other stars, this DVD series means alot to him now. He said the remastering was done pretty good for the most part and feels like TV history has been preserved well for what they had to work with.

They even give you the option of the updated special effects. Season one really changed society and tv as well. Many of the ideas of this show inspired real scientists too. It's a classic show and well worth owning. The blu ray picture was loveningly cleaned up and the show has never sounded or looked better.

I won't go into the quality of the episodes, since none can argue they are the greatest ever to be aired on television.Now, the DVD. The special features- interviews, scene selections, nothing over the top- are great...if you're into such things. Me, personally, I like to listen to interviews, etc., but it's not for every one.The one thing that REALLY bugs me is the pricing. I mean, all of the ST box sets are outrageous, but that's still no excuse for a price of ninety-ninenty ninety-nine for a set of 24 episodes when most such collections are around $40-60.Don't get me wrong, the episodes are great, but the price makes all the difference.

These episodes from the first season have the added bonus of being just a little more wobbly and unsure of themselves than the next two years, where the show's rhythm had been found. The performances are both less assured and a little more serious (the \\"Trek\\" crew dove heavily into the inside humor in the later episodes) but the entertainment value remains unparalleled after all these decades. I picked these up just to have a failsafe entertainment option on nights when regular TV falls flat... and boy, are they great!

The episodes in the ST:TOS box sets look FAR better than the TV re-runs, and the Dolby Digital audio is miles above the original Mono VHS soundtrack.You have to remember that this show is pushing 40 years old now. There's only so much the engineers can do to clean up the original source video and audio. The Okuda commentaries, bonus features and interactive menus are very well done, however the menus can be a little clumsy to navigate. That being said, you get used to them fairly quickly. The original TV previews for each week's episode are a nice touch.These sets are a little expensive, and the packaging isn't the best, but a couple of $1.99 Ikea CD-Wallets solves that issue.

They start remastering the original show and hike the price up even more. This is for product that has essentially been released already so why not a substantially lower price?

I was right, the Next Generation series was proof that his vision was alive. Further proof was provided by Deep Space Nine and Voyager.The fetus, the original series, was simply an absurd \\"William Shatner Show\\", the acting was ludicrous and Shatner's overweight and over acting destroyed the essence Roddenberry intended.The Star Trek legend was born when Patrick Stewart and company came on TV in 1987.

Awesome story, acting, everything. Credited to sci-fi author Harlan Ellison but the produced version is very different from his original story. It's still a great tale. Basically, McCoy goes back in time to depression-era America, changes history and the Enterprise, UFP, everything that the crew and captain knows is gone. Kirk and Spock need to go back to stop McCoy from doing whatever it is he does. While back in time, Kirk falls in love with Edith Keeler (a young Joan Collins). Don't want to spoil anything, so just get this and love it.

I didn't realize how much I was missing in SD\\" Then came the \\"Galileo 7\\" episode and when I saw the shuttle craft launch and the pulsar star, I realized that all of the cut scenes, the viewing screen content and other scenes not involving actors have all been redone with modern special effects and computer enhancements. What a great job they did! the upgrade to the scenes really gives this 40 year old series a nice facelift! Very well done. I am enjoying re-watching these episodes from my childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased, but not over excited","review":"The only reason that I bought it was that I could watch the both the original style of the show as well as the \\"enhanced\\" version and to switch back and forth between the two.

Oh well, I still have the DVD version also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek TOS!","review":"This was an awesome gift for my wife who is a big trekky from way back. Actually, It is I who remember the Captain & Spock during the original broadcasts. She was too young, but when she saw them for the first time (during repeats) thought they where new, and became hooked. This DVD collection really is cool! We play them on our Sony DVD player and enjoy the exploits of the orginal Star Trek team in action all over again. What a great gift. I know, because my wife reminds me all of the time how much she really enjoys it. The price is right too! Target sells this item for much more then Amazon. I say get it while you can. If your a true TOS fan, you will by all means love this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth that much money","review":"I took in all the hype and was really waiting to get my copy..... I wish I'd spent my money on something else. The HD redone effects seemed way to short to short for me. Not there long enough to take it in. And there are still alot of \\"record pops\\" in the video, not to much , but for this much money I expected better. And I do not know about seasons 2 and 3 , but the colors seemed out of wack or something. Sortof like a music song which has been processed too much. If it were cheaper , I would not have any issues, but for this much money, I do. I give it two stars instead of one because I appeciated the attempt. Please for the sake of everybody ...

The price of the set is about twice the normal price for one season of a TV show. Given the price and the cult status of Star Trek, I'd hoped to see lots of extras. Instead it was a pretty skimpy transfer to DVD IMHO.Only 4 episodes (counting Managerie as 2) have optional text trivia tracks. How hard would it have been to include them on all the episodes? Given how much this syndication has been milked by all involved over the years, you'd think somebody involved would have volunteered to to an audio commentary track or two. I guess they were too busy pursuing their writing and singing careers.The plastic case is original, but not very convenient.For some reason, the episodes have a tendency to default to closed captioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you want to watch the old Star Trek episodes!","review":"I haven't seen these shows in years!

The quality is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blu-ray transfer","review":"One of the few 1960's era TV series that still has relevance today, Star Trek is a timeless sci-fi classic. With the upgraded picture and sound, as well as new special effects (which can be swapped out to see the original effects), make this a no brainer for any fan of the series. The picture quality is very impressive considering its almost 50 years old. The sound is also good but it is not going to blow you away like a new blu ray such as The Lord of Rings.All in all, it's a great deal for a wonderful piece of tv history."},{"rating":"1","title":"great buy","review":"Well worth the money.

A few of the episodes aren't worth the disks they're printed on, especially \\"the enemy within,\\" where Shatner walks through his lines like the dazed Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds singer he would become. Still it's well worth the pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm impressed","review":"Well, when I first saw the details about this set, I was really sceptical. I was not crazy about how the packaging looked and I was not happy with the fact that the episodes are in original broadcast order and not production order. However, after receiving my copy, I was so impressed with the packaging that all other issues I have with the original series box set releases are out the window. I am really pleased and impressed with the design of the packaging now that I can see it and feel it. It's very innovative.If you are a fan, this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as Gift","review":"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 27 year-old son.

Lukily, it has the standard edition also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying","review":"If you are a Star Trek fan, and especially if you are an original fan this is worth every penny. I've only ever seen the original series as reruns on TV and I was truely shocked to see these on Blu Ray, the quality of the picture is way more than I expected from a series this old.The only gripe which I took one star off for was in the sound as others have mentioned. They could have put some more effort into equalizing the sound. Turning the volume up so you can hear the dialogue will result in being blown out of your chair when they cut scenes with music or throw in sound effects. Turning the volume down to where the sound effects are acceptable leaves you completely unable to hear the dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useless Eyecandy Packaging, Great Re-mastering!","review":"Just received the new DVD Star Trek TOS 1st Season Set.

The Bones in me had to come out!Sorry . . .As for the content . . . it's top notch and worth the money.Sound is wonderful . . . and the quality of the video seems on par with the lastest compression standards.

While season 2 may represent a time when all the characters were \\"hitting their stride\\" so-to-speak, season one has quite a few episodes that represent the best of TV science fiction writing. City on the Edge of Forever, Balance of Terror, The Naked Time, absolutely excellent. The documentary about William Shatner's horse business - not so much. I'm a bit of a purist, as well; so while I appreciate the new versions with the updated special effects (they did a great job on them), I really want to see Star Trek the way I remember it. The budget struggles and antiquated effects technology are part of the history, and tell you something about television production of the 1960s.

There is something on the DVD for everyone. It is my understanding that they will also be doing an English version of this Spanish language DVD. A must for any Walter Mercado \\"Primer Impacto\\" viewer, or radio listener.You also get a free Natal Chart, which costs Walter Mercado Club Members $100. So anyone that is interested in Astrology, Horoscopes, etc. basically gets the DVD for free, plus another $85 of free stuff! So for 15 bucks you get food, drink, a bath, a message, desert, advise, a Natal Chart, and if the stars are right, some romance with your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend or significant other.

In the beginning you think the film will lead to something if you give it a chance, but it doesn't. You will wear out the fast foward button on your DVD controls, and turn it off before the end, because you won't care what happens next. I love B movies and even C movies, but this is way below them.

I caught myself wondering what sort of person could actually get intrigued by this. It's not tongue-in-cheek enough to be campy, and it's not subtle enough to be satire. It was impossible for me to suspend my disbelief and swallow the idea that this was happening in a far future devastated by nuclear warfare. I expected that at any given moment the camera would turn and reveal the entire film crew, complete with the director wearing a hawaiian shirt, sitting in his chair under a beach umbrella, and sipping a fancy cocktail. I couldn't care about any of the characters. The beginning animations were interesting enough, but after about 20 minutes it disintegrated towards total boredom. I couldn't last past 45 minutes. A complete waste of time. If you want a morbidly funny/bizarre post-apocalyptic movie, try Delicatessen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually turned it off","review":"Unfunny and pretentious.

This was a huge disappointment for me. I don't like almost everything on this CD. There's nothing remarkable about Miten's voice, even though it's certainly nice to listen to. His lyrics are banal. Sweet and heartfelt, but hackneyed.There's nothing really bad about the music, but most of it is Miten by himself (the ones with Deva are far better, to my ear), and I honestly can't find anything to recommend it.I only gave it two stars for the few songs that are predominantly Deva's voice.As much as I am dissing this CD I wouldn't hesitate to recommend \\"Love is Space.\\" So, if you're expecting something along those lines, don't get this as it's totally different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs for the Inner Lover","review":"Beautiful from start to finish.

Most composers just make the pianist fill in what the singer can't do, but Barber actually makes both parts interesting without each other. Not many composers can do this well.

Therefore you could not raise or lower the product. The company that we received the product from was great and they sent us a replacement feeder at no cost and paid for shipping. The second feeder was worse than the first. The screws that held the legs onto the feeder were rusted and several of them were not screwed all the way into the base. The black color was peeling off of the product which I am sure had it gotten wet from filling the water dish a few times would have completely peeled off. I was very disappointed in this product.

Similar to Morgan Spurlock's 30 Days series, except without the social conscience. Fans of Jackass/Viva La Bam/Wildboyz would probably find a lot to like about this documentary also, as the humorously stupid behaviour is done in the same spirit. If you're into responsibility and conservative ideas of a worthwhile successful life you'll probably find this documentary and it's star contemptable. Call Brian a stalker if you want, but he was clearly harmless. If he got a \\"no\\" from Drew he would have backed off. The part where it did get a bit too stupid and creepy for me though was when he recounted meeting Drew at an afterparty but didn't have the nerve to ask for the date, and then proceeded to continue campaigning for the date through third-party means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"Trust me, it's not worth buying.

It is perhaps something I could swallow easier for a rainy nights' TV-watch, the concept however is not worthy of a movie (or documentary or whatever you'd call it). It just carries on with the reality-tv-fact; Anyone can get famous, just do something weird... and tape it!On the other hand I must say that \\"My date with Drew\\" has it's moments. Witty moments, it's never hysterical funny or even close. It is stupid funny, nerdy, and obviously ment to be.

The problem is, it's a date with a celebrity. It's shallow, non-eventful and drab. I mean, how many times can you say \\"Do you think she'll go out with me?\\" to every common folk on the street? Entertainment? Doubt it.Don't rent. Just drink a lot, go out downtown and ask everyone if you could date Jessica Simpson/Brad Pitt.

Creatively Bankrupt.","review":"I'm amazed that many reviewers give this release such high praise, the only stand-out single on the cd is Prettier Than Me. The rest seem to mesh together in a most uninspiring way. I loved the debut effort from this band(nearly a decade ago!) and if you want to hear a 4 star effort that's the one I'd recommend. I hope the next release(if there is one) consists of more substantial tunes without resorting to cover songs as in Hamburger."},{"rating":"2","title":"a much different, though musically interesting muffs","review":"The first few songs are pleasantly strong, though it seems the muffs are getting slower and slower (less punk and more pop). this is ok, as most great artists change styles, and the muffs are great--perhaps the greatest band never known. As usual, the dark and sometimes sad overtones of many of the songs resonate with the pessimism and cynicism that so many of us brought up post-vietnam feel. Track #4 sums up the album and, perhaps, the muffs career--they can't be prettier for most people. By the way, this is a fantastic ballad. not a pure knockout like the first album, but nothing matches their debut (it is my favorite album). If it's muffs, it's still fun, that's my saying. pop it in and drive down a coast. enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Muffs just rule.","review":"This is an excellent record, by one of the best bands out there.

Fair to say that the reviewers' adjectives on the back flap of Happy All The Time -- 'fun', 'clean', 'healthy', and 'delightful' -- should hardly have led me to expect anything more than a squeaky-clean romp of a weekend read. Unfortunately, the only thing this book left me feeling was why I bothered to read it to the end. This insipid book neither captivates nor is it particularly well written. The four main characters are like cardboard cutouts and for 214 unremarkable pages, we are led to nothing more than a ho-hum, isn't-life-grand-as-long-as-you-can-afford-champagne ending. Please! Whether your literary interests tend toward the light or dark side, there is much better out there than this for the taking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"vapid and inane","review":"I probably should have put this book down when I was halfway through it and I realized it was about the tiny problems of several self-engrossed upper class New Yorkers. I found the plot to be lacking in any sort of stimulating element; the book basically boiled down to two people finding their perfect mates. Furthermore, the characters seemed somewhat flat, since everyone is describable in a couple words, and the dialogue strained for snappy wit, but instead came off as silly to me. My problem with this book wasn't that it was light and happy, it was that the book didn't even do a great job portraying light and happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book to read if you are a self centered bridezilla","review":"that only cares to fit into a size 4 dress.

This is the only set of Weingartner which I do not find of interest, much less of enjoyment or illumination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few drawbacks","review":"Overall I thought this is a great player. I'll only list a few potential drawbacks since the good points are probably already mentioned elsewhere:1) Does not work with NT or Windows 2000. At least, I couldn't get the software to work.2) The cradle is nice if you are only using the Nomad with 1 primary computer. If you like the flexibility of multiple computers (e.g. one at work, one at home), then carrying the cradle around in order to download music is annoying.3) You have to recharge using the cradle - which in most cases is a decent idea. However, if you want to bring the Nomad on a trip you will also have to lug the cradle with you in order to recharge, rather than simply bringing a extra battery or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Product, but no NT or W2K support.","review":"I ordered this product, but I'm returning it due to the lack of NT4 or Win2K support. On their support pages, they say they don't have plans to release NT drivers for it. They plan on supporting Win2K with the NomadII whenever that ships. So I recommending waiting until the next version of the hardware comes out before purchasing the Nomad.From what I could test, the FM tuner seemed to work fine, and the sound was above average.I was a little disappointed in the case that comes with the Nomad. It was just a nomad-sized bag with pull-strings at the top. Also, there is no belt clip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin' Player","review":"This is the first mp3 player that I have ever owned.

I called tech support 6 times. All 6 times I recieved no help. So, I finally called Amazon.com who helped me greatly. BE WARNED...YOU CAN ONLY USE MP3 FILES ON THE NOMAD...this means YOU CANNOT UPGRADE IT IF MP3's become outdated. 64MB IS THE TOTAL MEMORY!

The sleek design, 2x32 MB memory and the FM tuner - the added useful feature - made me go for it. Back home, where I run Windows 95, I'll be able to regularly refresh the Nomad with all of the wonderful music I legally ripped from my own CD's. While travelling, I am confined to a laptop running on NT. Hence, FM tuning is all I get on the Nomad until I get home (I do not really like listening to my own voice). It's not that Creative led me on to believe it worked under NT, but, well, Winamp and all the other run-of-the-mill MP3 players work just fine with NT. As I can rip my favourite songs from my CD's, I just thought I could make my Nomad work. This begs the question whether I should have bought the Rio and have had the benefit of Elena's RioShell....?

The graphics were great, the gameplay was next to none. As I got better I noticed that I can dominate the CPU using just 2 plays the whole game on offense. I was so hyped up about Madden 2003. Expected huge improvements. But, as I started to play Madden 2003, I noticed something. It's the same game! The graphics are almost identical. And, that's right, I started using those 2 plays again and I dominated. What a waste! Does EA think that they can just make a great game, then clone it and update the rosters and add little extras and add a year to the end of the title and expect to keep their fan base? Well, I guess they do. And, oh yeah, the commentary still stinks!

The tackling is hard in Madden, there's no slamming or effect on the tackle. It's plain. I still can't figure out the audible.In Sega NFL 2K, you just press a button to call an audible and a list of optional plays will be displayed for you to choose.

Madden is quite simply one of the most frustrating football experiences you will ever endure. First, unless you are the Rams, forget about a running game. Second, you will discover very early on that the only way to beat the computer is to hail mary every throw to the streaking wideout and then pray on defense. The computer simply scores when it wants to, no matter what scheme you throw in its face. If you like 72-63 games, then this is your title. If you like a modicum of reality (and fun) then go with 2K3. The learning curve is steeper, but ultimately it delivers a better experience. Madden is all marketing and not enough game. Oh, and 2K3 looks and sounds MUCH better.

On defense if you miss the initial tackle you still have a chance to bring the receiver down. In Madden 2002 if you miss, the receiver is GONE.3)Madden 2003 has gang tackling, about time.4)Passing is an art, you have to be more precise than in earlier versions of Madden. I love it.5)Running in 2003 is incredible. The stiff arms and breaking takles are more realistic than ever before.6)Gameday can't hold a candle to this version.

One big plus is the Instant Replay challenges...in the 2002 version the wrong part of the play was often viewed, in 2003 everyone so far has been right on.When playing the computer, running the ball is tough...you usually only get 2 to 3 yards per carry. Sacking the Quarterback is a rarity..but interceptions occur more than in 2002. The one thing I find rediculous is the computer almost always being able to connect for big yards especially on 3rd down. I like a challenge...but it has become predictable that this kinda thing will happen yet there is no way to stop it usually.Overall, I would recommend Madden 2003...but like any other video game the little things can get to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best football game!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Madden 2003 offers the realest graphics a football game can have.

You travle from camp to camp, competing in different tasks and scoring points in those events. This game has a pretty good sound track with Andrew W.K., Good Charlotte, Nappy Roots, and Bon Jovi.

Needless to say there were a lot of expectations for Madden 2003. Play-action passing is improved. Trick plays have been added to the playbook. The game is loaded with new extras, such as online play, training camp, preseason, etc. Where the game fails is the actual gameplay. The normal Madden buttons are the same, but the Offense is almost impossible to stop. Where in the last Madden punts were a norm and a defensive battle took place often, 2003 is all about the scoring. It is extremely easy to put up over 70 points a piece in head to head competition. The offense is easy to run. It is no longer difficult to pass for over 70 percent completion rate with almost any QB in the game.

For one thing the computer defence is unstoppable. For antoher, the gameplay is too slow and that makes running plays both difficult and boring. If you have played other football games(i.e. NFL Blitz Pro) you would find that it is much better because of the fast gameplay. And another thing, making players and teams gets old FAST.

The game runs smother and faster now, instead of have those 1-on-1 tackles this years has gang tackles which is really cool, also the franchise mode is really challenging (for the first time ever) because of the simple fact that some players that you want like marshall faulk and others you simply cant trade for which is good because thats like it is in real life also the draft is very cool because you have to scout the players that you want and you dont know their rating until you actually draft them this is cool because any team regardless of draft position can have a good draft.

When she wrote about meeting Stalin cracked me up. My own experience was reading this book, followed by her biography, \\"A Portrait of Myself\\" and \\"They Called It Purple Heart Valley\\". I only wish I could have met her.To pay homage to her, I brought along some black and white film and developing chemicals on a recent photo trip to Ireland, processing the film in my hotel room each night.

The movie seemed like a good idea playing on how the media controls the public's perspective and influences our everyday lives but really had no substance to it. 15 Minutes tries to be shocking but fails to deliver anything substancial. Robert De Niro plays a celebrity cop in New York who is teamed up with another cop Edward Burns (who's acting was disapointing). They are hot on the trail of two criminals who record their murders on a camcorder. There are some entertaining action/shoot 'em up scenes throughout and the idea is intriguing, but the movie fails to deliver.

It is one of those movies that makes you genuinely sad that you've wasted time watching it. I'm actually embarassed for De Niro, as I can't quite understand why he allowed himself to be a part of this travesty.The film is full of ridiculous scenes that you possibly could ignore, if the film was otherwise intact. But TRUST ME! This is the worst the worst the worst flick De Niro has ever acted in, although he wasn't awful himself. The story line reads like a high-schooler wrote it. No regard for reality. Its not smart, its not sexy, its not hip, its not funny. It IS an awful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this garbage","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life.

The stunt people and special effects people did their job. The story wasn't bad. The problem was a B director trying to direct A talent. The movie just misses, but it is not bad. Good popcorn movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this?","review":"This movie is just bad. It is supposed to make a statement about the media's obsession with violence, but it is hypocritical. Director/Writer John Herzfeld has directed these violence based movies: 2 Days In The Valley, The Preppie Murder, and even an Amy Fischer biopic. DeNiro is the only good thing about this, but he is still not very good. The bad guys are apparently the guy from Radiohead and some Austrian bodybuilder with a video camera obsession. Do not rent this, you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing.....","review":"This is a characteristic action movie. To begin with, it is some different from other ordinary action films. One of main character that is Robert DeNiro, is killed in the middle of the film. This film is quite interesting. The murderers kill people to make money, and broadcasting company use them. It shows morally bankrupt broadcasting companies that can?t think of anything but a scoop. So, they conclude agreement with the murderers to make a scoop. At first, this film was little bit boring, but it become to make tense and be interesting. At the last, it finishes stubbornly that murderer was punished as a conventional ending. Of the action films I have seen recently, I think, it is the most interesting and peculiar film. It looks like a common action movie, but it has a harsh criticism for broadcastings. Anyway, it is a well-made and funny movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a True Lemon!","review":"Avoid this film at all costs.Robert De Niro is One of The Greatest Actors Ever but aside from a few films over the past Decade&change His Films have been for the most Part Oen Note Johnnys.add this one to the Dog Pile.it tries to shock&provoke but all it does is become a film that lasts 45 Minutes too long.and when Robert De Niro dies in the Middle of a Film that usual means it's really doom.Kelsey Grammer in a Major Picture? He is solid for Tv but in Film He is Closer Tom Arnold Vile to me overall.this is a Film that was done within the first half hour.this film also suffers for trying to be too many things to all people.I Respect Robert De Niro, His Older Films are Must Have, but unless He changes His tune He is Better suited behind the Camera now or maybe time to chill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money On This One!","review":"You know De Niro is good in any movie no matter if it's a bad one and my God did he ever try to save this film with as usual a stellar performance but he gets killed in this one and you know De Niro isn't supposed to die in any film especially this lame one.

First off the acting is pretty terrible the Two Russians. Oh excuse me One Czech and one Russian Either way they both suck. One dimensional,scene chewers that they are they look like Oscar winners next to Ed Burns. How does this guy continue to work? He is unwatchable. I give this film Two Stars 1 for Robert Deniro Who is lucky enough to check out earl if you know what I mean. No big Surpise, and 1 star for Kelsey Grammer who does a nice turn as sleazy talkshow host.If you have to see this movie. do it while you're cleaning you cat box or peel dead skin off of your feet or some other really exciting task you've been putting off.

Acting (except DiNiro, who bails), dialog, plausiblity, pointlessness... and of course, utterly predictible from start to finish.All the stuff about fame, the media, etc has been said & done over and over and over--but this time, its for comic book readers only. Its utterly obvious and very, very dumb.I usually enjoy movies that make New York look like a dangerous dump--not a stretch, really--but this is rock bottom.

It's as boring as it sounds. The writing is really generic and typical as well. It's boring just thinking about it. I refuse to recommend this film to anyone.I'm not trying to be a jerk by being really short here, it's just that I've seen so many predictable films in the same exact style as this one, and it's just a repetitive nightmare watching these kind of movies these days. I've honestly had enough.But hey, maybe 15 Minutes is for you, if you're someone who likes frequent \\"cop chases bad guy because bad guy remains smart and free for the majority of the film\\" scenes.

It's been done a thousand times by this point, and I'm just really tired of the formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually love De Niro, but...","review":"This movie was awful. De Niro is a media savy cop, who, with the help of an arson investigator (played by Ed Burns), is hunting down a couple of Eastern European criminals. The criminals decide they can get away with anything if they can appeal to the media. If the intention of this movie was to poke fun of the media, then it seemed to take itself too seriously. If it was a serious movie, it was just too over the top to be enjoyable. I kept trying to find something to enjoy, but just couldn't.

The man is truly a legend and I still hold him in high regard but my god this film was bad.It was suppose to reflect what America's love of violence is like - a condemning look, yet it didn't achieve it. Scene after scene of pointless violence soon made it hypocritical and the script was appalling.De Niro just wasn't up to scratch, he's slumming it in this film and I resent him for it. I resent him because he is one of the few actors I choose to admire and trust his judgement of films thus forking out money to see them and then being let down by something like 15 Minutes.I haven't lost faith though, as I said I still respect him. I just think of Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Midnight Run and loads of other films and then remember why I like him.De Niro fans - don't avoid this film see it by all means.

I know this is hard for children to conceive, but actual instruments are the mark of a performance. Consider: Gibby Haynes uses \\"Gibbytronix\\" to enhance the experience. It is never, ever to be seen as the experience itself. Techno is like disco, but the latter had heart, and real human beings; and horrible, horrible fashions. Yet, THEY BOTH SUCK!!!!!

Fullmetal Alchemist and Bleach. I gotta great idea, lets mix the two together and throw a new name on it.That's basicaly the whole idea behind this show. Though it rips A LOT more from Bleach than it does FMA, the show is a very poor attempt to capatilize on the two series. For those looking for something with the same heart and soul as Rouroni Kenshin you will not find it here. Weak character deveolpment and even weaker narrative. While I'm not a huge fan of either Bleach or Fullmetal Alchemist, I willingly endorse both shows as a better option than this, \\"pokemon\\", version of the two better written and animated shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable!!!","review":"This is a fine collection of Captain and Tenille songs on this CD. The songs are recorded well with just about the right amount of remastering, even better than my LP's. On the back of the case it says, 96k/24-bit Mastered from the Original Master Tapes. These do sound like the originals, but even clearer and cleaner sounding. The songs are arranged in a pleasing order and have a nice flow to the CD. All their biggest hits are included, as well as, several somewhat lesser known songs. We really like this CD and enjoy the memories, it evokes, of our younger days. We should have bought this one sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again.","review":"Well, the labels did it again. First, when they released the album \\"Dream\\" on cd.

Of course when you are a child you do not always pick up on words and phrases so I have been tickled by the silly words to the songs. \\"Sunday after mass, picnic in the grass, diggin Momma Cass with Skoobydoo\\"(LOL). I have been driving down the autobahn singing my little heart out! This collection of the the Archies hits is pretty good. Just one song that I felt could have been left out but we all have our preferences. I have enjoyed reading the historical information about the voices and people behind the Archies sound as well as information about the music included in the insert. I would suggest that other Archie fans purchase this CD. It will be money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Absolutely The Best Of The Archies\\" is simply the BEST","review":"Having bought 3 Archies compilations and being not satisfied with the quality of the sound, this one is a winner!! This one has none of the defects or marginal sound quality of the previous cd's I bought. Obviously it is from the original master tapes and produced as well as any compilation as I have heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, the best Archies CD","review":"Over the years, the market has been flooded with more than its share of Archies compilation CD's, most of which have been marginal or just plain miserable. This effort by Fuel 2000 is among the few high-quality Archies CD's to come along. Most notably, along with a selection of album cuts and TV-series related tunes, it contains every single to make the top-100 charts, a claim few other Archies compilation CD's can make.For a reasonably priced piece, the production is top-notch. Sound quality is respectable and far better than most other Archies CD's. All the tracks except 1 and 8 are in stereo. The eight-page liner notes booklet contains five pages of detailed and interesting musical background on the studio group behind the name. Overall, if you're looking for an Archies collection, this deserves front-runner status on your list."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Archies are fine....it's just this release that's less..","review":"I love the Archies music. I bought this CD thinking I would get the same perfect quality I did when I bought THE ARCHIES: The Best Of, released by Cult Records, but nope, I didn't. Many of the songs are the same but the songs on this release were not remastered and in fact, the songs are actually worse in audio than originally recorded. What happened here? Some of the songs actually max out and make your speakers sound like they can't take the sound. I recommend buying THE ARCHIES: The Best Of, if you want a perfect, remastered version of THE ARCHIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD OL'SATURDAY MORNINGS","review":"a 4 year old wakes up every Saturday morning to see the newest cartoons on tv.After hearing much adult artists as Dean Martin,Glen Campbell,and Johnny Mathis,I needed a switch.I wanted something that could rock.Across the tv screen in 1968 came this red head teenager and his four friends opening with the line\\"Everything's Archie\\" and along with it came a pre-MTV video .As 4 yr old kid,it rocked.To this day those same songs til play on my cd and record player.I have almost all their LPS except 'THIS IS LOVE' which some of those classsic songs made it here.It still rocks from the theme song to ARCHIE'S PARTY.The only ones missing and my personal favorites are BOYS AND GIRLS and LA DA DO DOWN DOWN and some others NURSEREY RHYME.I wished a boxed set would bring back all five of their LPs on cds.Its corny,but its classic and holds up very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUBBLEGUM AT ITS BEST!!!","review":"Finally, we get an Archies compilation with great sound that includes all of the Top 100 hits.

I hoped it would provide straight forward instructions on how to do basic tasks such as finding the zero's on a graph or maybe the vertex. The answer is probably in there somewhere but it is not in plain site. This book may be useful for dummies who have the time to plow through it in its entirety to learn how to use the calculator, but it is not organized to show you how to do basic things quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"This book is of course much better than the horrible manual that comes w/the 89 (who were they kidding)...however, it could be MUCH better at showing how to imput expressions or equations. I am a math idiot...the TI89 has saved my butt (I just need to take Algebra even though I am a history major) but if you do not know EXACTLY how to enter say a radical then you are left hanging. The examples that are shown are good, but for much less complicated problems...not dealing w/indexes and exponents at the same time. Unless I've missed something. I've had to call TI tech support to teach me how to input various problems...and they were very helpful....now if they would only rewrite THEIR manual and not assume everyone is a math wizard."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks a--","review":"This is the worst hack job I have ever seen. It should really be called, TI-89 for imbecile sucker fools. The book rushes through various functions without giving a single example of anything that the user can practice.

The Anime stays faithful to the Manga story. The plot gets more complicated and interesting by 10 folds. She is really getting sucked in the story as Light & L battle wits.The enclosed mini L statue is plasticy and nothing too excited. I wouldn't buy it on its own. But for a few bucks along with the DVD, it isn't bad and L crouches happily on top of our TV. You may want to concider the regular edition without the statue.What I hate about the series is the English dubbing, which quite lame, but not bad. The extras are nothing to be excited about, so I subtracted a star for the cons I mentioned. Otherwise, it is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death Note is spectacular","review":"I love how the authors have us rooting for Light the entire series. It's amazing. I only watch this anime and Bleach, and Death Note is now one of my favorite shows of all time. Suspenseful, thoughtful, and things actually happen (main characters are not immune to being killed). I'd suggest watching it from the beginning, but I had a friend start watching it in the middle of the series and she was hooked half way through the first episode she watched.

My 3 year old has a little trouble getting more complex structures built because of how strong the magnets are, but my 4 year old LOVES them. She has declared them her favorite toy of the holiday, and plays with them constantly. The magnets are of such great quality, and are built to last. Even though you are only given the little bars and the silver balls, the possibilities are endless. They come packaged great, so it's easy to tell if any pieces have gone missing.

Children and adults will be disappointed with the comparison.The on-line tracking provided was worthless. It stated that the package was delivered Dec 19 when in fact it was delivered Dec 24. Maybe not the fault of CMS Magnets but the shipping method will be considered for future orders. Sticking with items that are eligible for Amazon Prime is best.I gave the 3 ratings because it is OK, just OK.

When you have spent a week practically glued to the screen to play a historical strategy game, you don't want to see such an ahistorical event any more than you want to see Martians invade Normandy.

My family was excited to play it that evening. The game was excruciating to play. We are average SNL viewers having seen most episodes at some point in time (there are reruns on everyday), but the questions are TOO difficult. You would have to watch the show 12 hours a day and take detailed notes to get most of the questions right.The DVD only plays a few questions from each catagory so when you use up the questions it refers you back to the written questions.

The DVD clues are dumb and ineffective. I was playing with my dad (who is legally blind). He couldn't read the questions on the tv. I think it would have been better if the dvd was narrated. Overall, the game sucked, the questions were silly and it wasn't fun at all! As an aside, I noticed that there are no African Americans on the box or the board.

I'm far from a master gamer and I beat this game in 2 weeks.The other problem with the game is that it's a little buggy. Every now and then it crashes... once when it was showing the movie after beating a boss but before it saved the fact that I beat it. There's also a spot in the Cunning Disguise level that you can jump into that will cause the screen to mess up.

I love the cell shading, and I wish PS2 would have more games, better games that is, with art like this one. However, I found this game to be far too simplistic to be enjoyable. You don't get a health meter. AT ALL! If you touch ANYTHING you're not supposed to (for me, it was a plant) you die instantly and are sent back to the beginning. If you fall into the water you die instantly. If you die three times you start all over, like you did in old Nintendo games.True, I didn't get past the first level so I don't know if this situation improves at all, but for a game to have that kind of set up in the first place is pointless. Hasn't gaming come far enough in the past 20 years that have rendered the concept of \\"how many lives I do I have left?\\" totally useless?

That got me thinking that this game wasnt very good, oh but it was. I was amazed on how much fun the game was.... Wats not fun about stealing stuff w/ a stealth raccoon?

There is a huge flaw though. You get hit, you die and it's back to the beginning! I tried to solve that with my gameshark, but for some reason that code makes a button go all crazy and it wont work. So, you can't grab hooks, you can't get to the boss w/ the mirrors top layer. If they make a Sly 2 and I am sure they will, I hope it will have a life meter!

They also work well with just one or a small group to a large classroom. When we go out for a day trip, we almost always find a project (or we create a variation) to get the kids excited about being on a hike. It really helps encourage their process of discovery! After using this book heavily over the summer, our child's friends now want to come over to our house and our son leads his friends outside collecting so they can do many of the projects in this book! Well done!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and sexy with a great paranormal twist!","review":"CALDER'S ROSE is a wonderful and funny contemporary romance with a neat paranormal element. When western writer Shane McNamara is teamed up with romance/western author Devin James, the sparks fly. They have completely different writing styles, and opposing viewpoints on how the two main characters should behave. Shane and Devin are also opposites in real life: Shane is a hunky, \`live-it-up' type of a guy who wears T-shirts with wild slogans, and Devin is button-down-shirt conservative, and wears her hair in a tight braid. While Shane rises to the challenge of loosening up his writing partner, the characters of their book, Rose and Calder, realize they're going to have to take matters in hand to get the book written, and they come to life in a unique paranormal twist and a book-within-a-book story. Warm, witty, and sexy, CALDER'S ROSE is a definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible for musicians","review":"It was recommended I read this book as I am new to the music industry.

You can still hear all of the music, and the One Wild Night Remix is fun. The songs on this album have captured all of the excitement of a Bon Jovi concert, and is the next best thing to actually being there. I would recommend this to the fans who have a lot of their records since the songs on here come from so many different albums.

I don't usually like live performances of bands. Dunno why. Something about the shrieking crowds never shutting up in the background ruins it for me. But the Bon Jovi fans on this disc however are remarkably well-behaved compared to those on other bands' live recordings. They even participate and sing certain parts of songs, adding to the listening experience. So while I normally detest live performances, 'One Wild Night' is one I not only don't mind but actually enjoy to the fullest. I listen to it even more than their Greatest Hits CD!I used to listen to it a lot on my computer over and over while surfing the Web. This was back in the early 2000's. The CD became lost.

I also didn't like the sleeve work. The song selection could have been so much better.

I was super excited if you cant tell. I was curious whether the flowers not being red would affect the birds but they just swoop on in! :) great feeder. I purchased the top filling one too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Feeder","review":"This one's a leaker! This hummingbird feeder is very, very pretty, but has a major functional design flaw. The removable plug makes it convenient to fill the feeder. However, the plug ends up at the bottom of the feeder when the feeder is hanging, and herein lies the problem. The normal temperature variation over the course of the day (up to 20 deg difference between the high and low temp on a normal day) causes expansion and contraction of the plastic parts. This makes the plug move just enough to cause the feeder to leak. Bummer, because I really liked the way the feeder looked. It is well made otherwise, but sadly this design flaw caused my feeder to drain within ~3 days from the constant dripping (not from hummingbirds). I decided to throw out the feeder one week after I received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hummingbirds never used it","review":"I bought this last year and hung it up and the Hummingbirds never used it.

It not only has a near perfect story line, but all hose freaky undead guys and some reall cool weapons. The only downfall is the last sentence. A suprising Star Wars end to a fantasy book.

The storyline sucks you in instantly but you have to wade through scene after scene of graphically detailed sex. There are numerous rape scenes and our heroine (Gale) decides at one point that it is best not to report a pedophile.The storyline itself is nothing new. It is the classic fish out of water/man of the people rise to power story. You know the one, he is better suited for the job because he didn't want it and has no political ambition. The fish out of water portion is how uncivilized he is. Think Beverly Hillbillies but in this story Jed Clampett becomes president not a millionaire.Even though the concept is not new it is still a very nice story just be prepared to skip about every 4th paragraph because it seems like that is how often the graphic sex scenes appear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Racey for Me","review":"I love Piers Anthony's Books. Usually. But there's just too much sex in this series. This one, the First Book. isn't as bad as the others. It just gets worse and worse with each one.

But I had to skip over so much of it because of the sex.The Kindle Version was as good as the book would have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Storyline and Gameplay","review":"Wow. Neverwinter Nights totally blows away all other r.p.g.s out for mac today. Terrific graphics and gameplay are just part of the package. The real gem quality in this game is its storylines and quests. Compared to Dungeon Siege, the intricate storylines provide a real feel for the world. It is almost as if you have been sucked into a really great fantasy novel, playing the main character. The A.I.s, for the most part, actually engage in conversation with your character and you can choose how you speak to them and deal with them. I really enjoy the large number of quests that you can pick and choose to complete. The ability to mold your character's personality through your words and actions is also a really great, fun feature. Overall, despite this game's flaws (of which I think there are few), I think the stories and characters make this game an amazing way to keep yourself out of touch with reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"I waited for five years for this game and I am not at all disappointed. I opened it up last night, installed it, and sat in awe while I played all night until I fell asleep at the keyboard. I'm still so in shock at the grandness of it all that I'm going to have a hard time explaining my feelings. Even on my measley - by their standards - 400mhz G3 powerbook it runs beautifully. Not astoundingly fast, but the only problems with loading were with text conversations in large areas. The in-game system is easy to understand and use, the characters are as well done as you would expect, I absolutely love the music. Also, it's the closest by far that I've ever seen to sitting at a table and actually playing pen and paper dungeons and dragons.

It plays like reading a good book or watching a good movie, only it's interactive. It is quite versitile and open in that you can use single-player characters in multiplayer, but restrictive in that ultimately, there's only one or two paths to follow. That goes for plotline, character development, and even the equipment you use. This is as much fun as real Dungeons and Dragons as far as adventuring goes, but I'd still rather have the face to face interaction, roleplaying, and character development that Neverwinter Nights lacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could not turn it off...","review":"I actually could not turn off the game.It gave me hours of play and i really loved it.It reminded me of Diablo 2 but i liked the player classes in this game much more :-)I really did buy a game worth it :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect.","review":"Some of the missions have glitches.

Yes, it may be 3D, but the character control is show-stopper terrible - unplayable - especially in combat.Also, regardless of how many people are playing together, there is only ONE main prize-weapon. This has two game-ruining effects - first, only ONE player in the team gets rewarded FOR THE ENTIRE QUEST!!!! Second, because everyone knows this, at the End-Main-Battle, no one is trying to defeat the boss, but rather are all fighting each other for the main prize weapon.Stupid story, blah 3D graphics, show-stopping game quirks, horrible interface.

It's about finding the courage to love openly, despite society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveiw of \\"Nothing Happened\\"","review":"Edle Henriksen is a very likeable character in this book, someone that people of any sexual orientation could relate to. She is smart, studious, and very loyal to her friends. The book is about her discovering her sexuality, at first she thinks she is attracted to a man, Hans, but later discovers that it is really her girlfriend Gro that she is in love with. She lives in a deeply homophobic culture, however, and so is afraid to express that love. To make matters worse, she has been led to believe, even by her mother, it seems, that she is homely, in a culture that judges women heavily by their physical appearances. The book is quite depressing, I found, because in the end, Edle seemed to despair of ever being able to be loved by anyone, hence the title of the book. I felt for her, and had certainly hoped for a happier ending for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat, but hate to clean it!","review":"We liked this car seat so much that we bought a 2nd one for our other car and a 3rd one for my mother. My son has been using this car seat since he was about 4 months old. He is now about 33 lbs and we are still using it. It was very easy to adjust the straps as he grew and the tention dial to loosen the straps was easy enough to push to release the straps. The ONLY thing I HATE about this car seat is cleaning it. My child has on more than one occation puked in the car seat where it went down into the base. In order to completely clean the straps and the base of the seat it requires a screwdriver, and a LOT of patients. To remove the straps (which wash very nicely in the washer) you have to remove EVERY Screw in the car seat and completly disassemble the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"more negatives than positives","review":"Positives: The foam padding was great. My daughter looked very snug in it. Received great reviews from consumer reports.Negatives: So hard to tighten and loosen the straps. Seemed like a great idea with the turning of the knobs, but my hands were red and sore after 10 minutes of trying. Also, about the straps...they are spaced far apart where they go over the shoulders and could easily slip off a small child. The seat is larger than most and the knobs stick out on the sides. Probably won't be able to fit 3 people/car seats in the back seat of a smaller car or SUV.I returned it immediately and purchased a Britax roundabout, which I love."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST CAR SEAT I HAVE EVER OWNED","review":"I absolutely love this car seat! It is very well built, easy to install, and very comfortable. I bought this for my 3rd child when he was just 3 months old. He had outgrown his infant seat already and we needed a convertible seat. I wish I would have had this seat for my other children. The best features are the recline and the adjuster for the straps. I use the recline feature all the time when he sleeps in the car - especially on long trips. His head doesn't fall off to the side, much more comfortable. And the adjustable knob for the straps is just perfect. It is so easy to use that I use it almost every time I put him in the car. Especially in the winter with the extra clothes. It only takes seconds and you have a perfect fit. With my other car seats I would have to either squish the kids in with their coats, or go through a timely ordeal to lengthen the straps. My son is 2 1/2 now and he loves his car seat as much as I do. I recommend this car seat to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat with ONE flaw...","review":"This seat is AWESOME and so EASY to use. I love the fact that I dont have to remove the straps to adjust them to different heights just one squeeze of the button and slide them up or down. Its very roomy and comfy and my 2 year old LOVES it he has been in it for about 1.5 years and still has plenty of room. I love the fact you can adjust the recline position of the seat even when using it forward facing since most forward facing seats only have one position UP RIGHT well not this one I can keep my toddler slightly reclined for those long trips so that he can nap comfortably.The only thing I HATE about this seat is that you have to completely remove the back cover (you must use a screw driver to remove the 4 screws) to take the cover off so that it can be washed.I would definitaly buy again if I had too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for us!","review":"Very comfortable. I personally find it easy to adjust the straps. You have to push kind of hard to release the straps on the carseat, but that's the way it should be! Easy to wash the cover if you have a spitty baby like I do. I have a kid that's into everything and she hasn't tried to pick at the styrofoam.

The batteries that came with them are not that great, so I replaced them with Duracell Alkalines. They are slow as the gear ratio is low. That's where the strength comes from. Contrary to some of the other reviews they are strong, and contrary to the B&D info they will mar the finish on soft wood if you crank them too tight (even with the rubber feet). They'll hold the earth on fresh batteries. I bought 4 heavy duty 3V3 Wall Mount Power Packs and modified them with heavy guage wire about 8 feet long. I then wired the Power Packs into the clamp battery compartment and made them wall powered rather than battery powered. Now I use them exclusively. No more manual C-Clamps for me except little small ones for tight places. You need to keep the shafts lightly oiled. Like any tool, maintanence is important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery powered battery eater","review":"There really isn't anything good to say about this clamp unless one works for Black and Decker.

This book is completly unfocused & frankly, boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album, Even Better Band","review":"I've met Latex Generation a few times over the years and they are quite possibly some of the nicest guys ever. Their music isn't so nice, though. It's raw, angry, funny, poppy, sarcastic and happy all wrapped up into a nice neat package.The only reason I can't give this album 5 stars is that that mix isn't up to par, but don't let that keep you from owning this album.

The only problem is that after about the first five tracks, you may start to feel the same way you might feel after eating way too many sugary sweets (trust me). Therefore, I strongly suggest that you listen to Sarina Paris only in small doses. However, I do think the Sarina Paris album would provide excellent background music on a summer road trip to Vegas or something.Standout tracks include a dance remake of Cyndi Lauper's \\"True Colors\\" and track #3, \\"So I Wait\\".

I have yet to own it for myself, but I have heard it. Her music style and voice remind me of Saint Etienne and their lead vocalist, Sarah Cracknell.

From the main menu to the gameplay. I was shocked how similar Madden 2003 is to 2002. The only thing different is the soundtrack and the addition of the Texans with it's new divisions. You also have rookies in the game like David Carr and Joey Harrington, which 2002 doesn't have. But everthing else is the same. The franchise mode, custom league, season mode, practice, etc.I often find Madden saying the same sentence three plays in a row, and then not say anything for the rest of the game. Its more like Al Michaels 2003.It also could be harder. I went 16-0 and won the Super Bowl my first season on All-Madden. I did a Franchise and decided to trade some of my players to other teams only to find out that the computer was incredibly stupid.

Personally, I am glad I only rented this \\"deep movie\\" of two gay lovers whose \\"rhymes\\" would only make sense if you were high. On the positive side, while the story and the \\"xxx?\\" historical poem, and Ginsberg's life story with its center point being a nothing rambling poem, had its 15 minutes of fame, it left me cold.

In fact, I agree with a previous reviewer that this album is treading quite close to elevator music. Rigmor Gustavsson is an accomplished singer and sounds a lot like the late and great Monica Zetterlund. The lyrics are consider classics, however, I personally think they talk basically about nothing and are filled with simple lyrics regarding love and emotions such as that. The artwork and book-let well it is a nice collage of photos but there are no lyrics and no additional information is included either. Still and all do not get me wrong. This is a good album with some very easy listening jazz that can fit perfectly as background music and I therefore give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"the mud of montparnasse","review":"if the only review one needs to know is this one, let it be this, it has been required reading in French literature since its creation.

The plot of the story is rather complicated, but as the novel approaches the end, everything starts falling into its proper place. Both wealthy and poor classes are analyzed in the novel through the actions and interests of individuals. Vice characterizes the nature of Parisian society; for this reason, vice opposes and also prevails over virtue . Of course, in order to create the drama of the novel, vice is used to represent a large section of the people living in Paris at the time. The novel illustrates a large segment of the human condition during the first half of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, the powerful evil over good theme of the novel is rather devastating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardcover version print quality terrible","review":"I ordered the hardcover version of Pere Goriot.

I was feeling a lot of sympathy for this \\"father's king\\" who is able to sacrify his life for his two daughters.So this novel remind one of my most impressive experience of reader.To finish, I can say that there a lot of other very good reasons to read \\"Old Goriot\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Crochet Resource","review":"This book is a must have for beginners, and those interested in doing more on their own. I recommend this book to anyone who has just picked up crocheting. The directions are easy to understand and THOROUGHLY illustrated (a huge plus). The book also has a nice array of projects, but is more oriented as a reference, not a book of projects.The section on different patterns is what I use most...again, thoroughly illustrated and photographed. Thanks to this book, I am making my own designs now instead of buying patterns from the store. There is also a great selection of trim/edging patterns, so you can add something special to an existing item, or add on to a current project.I cannot say enough good things about this book. I only wish there were more Donna Kooler projects for crochet available in stores (they all seem to focus on her needlepoint projects). I can't wait for her Knitting Encyclopedia to come out -- it's already on my wish list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stitch Gallery","review":"I wasn't too impressed by the projects, but the Pattern(aka stitch)gallery is well worth the price of the book. I have several crochet stitch books, you know like \\"300 crochet stitches\\".

I would not let that deter me from purchasing the book. It's a must have just for the plethora of stitches given. I mean, you can make a daffodil, a 3-d daffodil. How cool is that?

This is my first Harlan Coben book and I will definitely be continuing this series if not most of his other books. I loved that it wasn't the typical cop mystery. I'm not going to go into the plot summary since so many others on Amazon already have. But I will say I enjoyed the secondary sports theme. I really liked the chemistry that was developed between Jessica and Myron. I loved the Win character. He's so fascinating and mysterious.

Myron, accompanied by his partner Win, a blue-blooded yuppie with a devastatingly brutal side, sets out to investigate when one of his clients receives a disturbing phone call from his girlfriend who had been murdered years before. The result is an action-packed explosion of intriguing characters, great plot developments, and hilarious dialogue.All in all, a great book and well worth your time if you're a mystery fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deal breaker","review":"I loved this book and all of the other ones that I read by this author they are the type of books that you can not put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turner","review":"Harlan Coben is one of my favorites!

I love this series, the first 3 books are the absolute best. I have turned many people on to Harlan and we all love him. The sarcasm and characters are hysterical. Reminds me a little bit of Janet Evanovich - the Stephanie Plum Series. I have started reading his other books that are not Myron Bolitar and enjoy them immensely. You will NOT be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Show me the money","review":"Harlan Coben is relatively new to me, but I've thourghly enjoyed the works that I have read so far. With \\"Deal Breaker\\"; however, I slightly got tired of some of the repitition and seemingly long wait for the \\"punch\\" of certain segments. I didn't find a real \\"can't wait for the next chapter to see what's going to happen\\". Now this has nothing to do with his writing, which I find facinating and with just enough wit to turn up the corners of your mouth. Deal Breaker is one of the earlier Coben novels (1995) and later offerings have proven to be much more to the point with the hook to keep you turning pages. You will eventually become a Harlan Coben fan, all you have to do is keep reading him. Amazon has several Coben novels, enough to get you hooked, so keep looking and take some of the not so good, with the really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal!","review":"I recently discovered Coben with One False Move, which was so good I promptly picked up the rest of the series. And Deal Breaker is just as good if not better. A fast pace, exciting and twisting plot, hillarious wit, and intriguing characters make for a fantastic read. Myron is a great lead character, and Win is the perfect sociopathic sidekick. The sleazy bad guys are great too. Deal Breaker is an outstanding mystery that will also leave you laughing out loud at times. My only concern is what I'll do when I have finished the whole series. I can't wait for the newest installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start to the Myron Bolitar series","review":"This book is a good read on its own and it is also a good introduction to the characters you will find in the newer Myron Bolitar series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe the reviews","review":"Having read great reviews for Myron Bolitar series, I bought three (used of course to minimize loss lest they be unengaging). Read the first, Deal Breaker, and will not read the other two. Will donate all three to local library. The book has completely non-credible characters (might work in a kid's comic book) that left me wondering what world the author circulates in. The hero's sidekick, Win (no Joe Pike, he) is an amoral, misogynistic, cold blooded killer. Having read virtually everything that James Lee Burke, James Elroy, Michael Connelly, Elmore Leonard and Robert Crais have written, Harlan Coben isn't even close to being in their league. Total bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Adventure of Bulletproof Clowns","review":"All the hallmarks of H.Coben are here: the plot is simply superb, the delivery is annoying but this time without extremes, the clowns are still bulletproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deal Breaker is lame","review":"I've listened to many audio books, but Deal Breaker is by far the least enjoyable one. The voice talent was terrible-forced and annoying. The story was so fictional and unbelievable in parts, yet very boring in others. Now I'm stuck with an audio book that I wouldn't subject anyone else to nor is it appropriate material to donate to a library. It's basically like an old PC or motor oil that one cannot easily dispose of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read them all","review":"If you love a good who-done-it with some great slap stick comedy, then you will absolutely love these books. I have read them all and am anxiously awaiting the next one. The characters are so fun and they take you this way and then that way and just when you think you know who did it, they go another way. Great reading!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leisure Story","review":"I listened to the audiobook of this story. The narrator was great-very funny when speaking as Myron Bolitar. The story was just okay but the character of Myron Bolitar made it interesting. The audiobook is probaly better to listen than just reading the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wit and Suspense in one Package","review":"The golden age of mystery of the Christie era has been hard to match in recent times. The Deal Breaker might just change all that, it is a mystery set in modern times that for once is believable, the plot is cleverly thought out with the added bonus of making you laugh out loud from time to time. Myron Bolitar an ex basketball player turned sports agent is drawn into this murder mystery to help his client and ex girlfriend. Myron is tough, hansom, human and honest just what you are supposed to get in a hero, he also with the help of his less admirable cohort Win, delivers some of the funniest one liners ever written in a novel of this kind. I read it on the recommendation of a rather frail looking old lady working in a bookstore, although dubious at the time I cannot be more pleased to have done so. Try out a somewhat different but excellent approach to mystery writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Read Better","review":"I have really enjoyed some of Coben's novels, but this wasn't enjoyable. I generally don't like his Myron Bolitar books as well as his stand-alone novels, but I liked this the least. It seemed like a formula. For example, every time Myron got in a jam, Win was there to save him. Usually, I can't put Coben books down, but I found this one hard to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Myron Bolitar books","review":"Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar books are all just great, and I had read all but this the first of the series. Aside from a couple of references that date it (like to car-phones), this book still was great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different sort of mystery","review":"I'm always looking for new mysteries for myself and my husband. I gave this one (the first of a series) a try since the good guy is a sports agent/mystery solver and I knew that would appeal to my husband. It was a good book, a very easy read. Since it was written quite a while ago, I had to readapt my thinking since they still used typewriters and cell phones were called car phones because that's as far as it went then. Also, one of the characters had to 'find a phone' to make a call. Actually that made it a little more interesting to read. I will recommend it to my husband and I will read more of the series, if for no other reason than to find out how the character comes into the 21st century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ!!","review":"I first started reading the Myron Bolitar series a few years back when I found this book in a bargain bin at a local bookstore. I fell in love with the series. The characters are flawed just like all of us which makes it easy for me to relate to them. Myron and his cohorts always seem to get themselves involved in situations that most of us couldn't even imagine--and always find a way out of them while making you laugh hysterically! I definitely recommend this book and the others in the series! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm excited to read the rest of the series!","review":"I've read other Harlan Coben books but never one from his Myron Bolitar series, so I thought it was about time! In the Deal Breaker we are introduced to Myron Bolitar and his sidekick Win. They are former FBI agents turned agent and accountant respectively. Myron has signed on a star client, Christian, a college football player turned pro. Right before they sign the biggest contract of Myron's career, a picture of Christian's girlfriend, who has been missing for 18 months, turns up in an ad for a 1-900 number. Christian's girlfriend also happens to be the sister of Myron's old flame. Myron works to solve this mystery and find out what really happened to Christian's girlfriend....If you've read Coben's more recent work, you can tell that his writing style is a bit more rudimentary and that he was just starting out, but the premise made for a good page turning mystery and I'll definitely be back to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deal Breaker","review":"My first book by this author and truely enjoyed it. Very suspenseful and full of twists and turns. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT YOUR USUAL ZAWINUL","review":"If you like Big Band and Zawinul, then this one is for you. I happen to like Zawinul A LOT (been listening to him since his days with Miles, Cannonball, and Weather Report), but I am not much for Big Band. SO, this one is just not my \\"cup of tea\\" despite my fondness for Zawinul. Joe Z does best, in my opinion, in a small combo environment: Adderly, WR, Syndicate. The Big Band seemed like it was mostly studio pros who were good, not great, musicians (Zawinul usually played with the best), but collectively were just not \\"tight\\". Some of the band solos lasted waaaay too long - and Joe Z was too often buried in the background. I'd give this one a 1-star, except I recognize that it is my strong preference for Zawinul in his natural small-combo environmet that makes me disappointed with this recording. Zawinul was a virtuoso, a genius, an innovator and an original - I just prefer his music a-la-Zawinul, straight with no chaser, and this one is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is This!","review":"There is not a cloud in the sky on this wonderful summer afternoon.Joe Zawinul revisits the brilliance of Weather Report through an amazing concert that features the 15-piece WDR Big Band and an array of friends. The two-disc set was recorded in October 2005 at Zawinul's Birdland Club in Vienna, Austria, and features drummer Nathaniel Townsley, bassist Victor Bailey and percussionist Alex Acuna.Adapted and orchestrated for a big band by Vince Mendoza, soloists like Karolina Strassmayer (alto sax on Black Market, March of the Lost Children, Procession), Paul Heller (tenor sax on Fast City) and Olivier Peters (soprano sax on Badia and Boogie Woogie Waltz) deliver outstanding performances that acknowledge the brilliant past, but illuminate the present as a means to set sail into the future.The weather has never felt so good and Zawinul powerfully proclaims that Mr. Gone has been here all along."},{"rating":"2","title":"21st Century Weather Report","review":"This big band rendition of the best of Zawinul, Shorter & Company is an essential \\"Weather update.\\" As other reviewers have opined, those 70s synth sounds have not aged well despite the fact that JZ was the consummate synth player (akin to Garth Hudson with the Band). The horns arrangements are unified and add a fresh perspective to the WR standards. Would love to hear more peformances, but these two discs' worth are nothing short of amazing. Jazz is alive and well in the 21st Century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it's job","review":"not much to say here, it's an innertube.

A very powerful performance by William Holden, as an engineer whose youth and reformist ways make him an ideal candidate. Supported by a cast of Hollywood A-Listers including Miss Barbara Stanwyck, this movie takes a hard and fast look at the internal politics and power struggle in ascending to the top of the corporate ladder; not really much different in todays corporate world.Presented in glorious black & white and with a sagacious motion, this film contains no music score, providing intensifying drama. Brilliant direction from Oscar winner Robert Wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"This is a top-notch movie. It is star-studded and has a high production value.However, Barbara Stanwyck fans will lament as her scenes are few.If you are looking for a good William Holden movie, this movie fills the bill. He carries the movie quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXECUTIVE SUITE COMMENTARY","review":"Star-studded story of how a new CEO was selected when the one man company's one man died. Good, although somewhat dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"William Holden","review":"The first reason you need to see this film is for William Holden. I make it a point of trying to see every film he's in. He is my favorite actor of all time. Now that thats out of the way...Robert Wise has delivered a suspenseful and tremendously well made film that doesn't use a lick of music and has stunning camera work. I was particularly blown away by all the smooth dolly shots and the opening POV sequence in the beginning of the film...Seeing everything through Bullard's eyes, the dead man who sets this story off and running. It reminded me a great deal of the John Frankenheimer film \\"Seconds\\" in that sequence and Suite was made sometime before that film. This is a must see office drama that really was ahead of its time from a technical filmmaking perspective. The script is solid and watching Holden fight to be the President of the company is a joy to watch! And you've gotta love a movie that has Stanwyck and Holden together again in the same film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Business Psychological Drama","review":"I can't remember who recommended this one, but it turned out to be a favorite! Young Wm Holden rises to the challenge as various inside and outside directors try to take over the corporation. Anyone who thinks business is boring should see this for a taste of what corporate politics at its worst could be. Great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VHS","review":"This really is a great movie, even tho it's in B & W.

I have asthma and am very sensitive to odors, mold, and dust. The ozone works good, but must regulate its use. Works like chlorinating your water. Kills and sanitizes bad things, but too much is bad for you too. But Ozone is very unstable and quickly disappears in minutes. The unit has strength and timer settings. Set the timer when you leave for the day, come home to a fresh no odor home. I also run good filters in my central heating/air system and leave just the fan portion of the system running continually. This combination has worked the best for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend, period!","review":"Bought three of these based on reviews from their own website. Should have known better. My air conditioner filters more particulate. The filter intake barely could hold a tissue in place, so you can tell there is really not much volume passing through. The fans are not strong enough to pull air through the filter. The filter medium is just too thick and air does not easily pass through. The ozone feature deoderizes, but I wanted air purification. We noticed no difference in air quality. Go with a better known brand like the Hamilton Beach. To the reviewer who suggested the filter cover may not have been removed - the perforated cover was removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Loud + Little Purification = No Recommend","review":"The only reason I gave this product two stars is because it worked better than having nothing at all. I am very allergic to my wife's dog which brings about asthma attacks so I originaly bought the Biozone 3000w and it worked like a charm. Unfortunatly it was just to strong for the bedroom, but very quiet (it is rated for a minimum of 500 feet, so in the 200sqft bedroom it smells a little like bleech) so it now easily purifies the rest of the house all day long. I read some good things about this product from Surrond Air and thought I would give it a try. First of all it was very very loud, I was ok with that because I have slept through earthquakes, my wife also falls asleep easily. The problem is that it does not work. I put the biozone back in the room after trying this product for three weeks and I am sleeping well again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book - A Dog's Life","review":"I have purchased about 5 of these books.

I am a huge fan of dogs and when I saw the adorable mutt on the back cover(who looks like the dog Sandy in the movie \\"Annie\\"), I just knew I had to give it a try.

Having read a number of Mayle's books with varying degrees of enthusiasm for each, this one is refreshing and different. Mayle also pokes fun at the dog owners as well. The book dragged a bit in places but also had some truly laugh-out-loud segments.

I liked how Perry wrote an introduction of British Comedy leading up to Python. This gives you an idea of what the Pythons were up against.I also thought it was nice to split up the book into the mini biographies of each Python and then to go into the Python years as a whole. I especially enjoyed the sections on John Cleese and Michael Palin. Perry has a way of picking out the more interesting details. He does a good job of outlining the Pythons early careers in television and comedy. I was also introduced to a few post-Python projects through this book.This is a great book, although there are better in-depth ones. I would reccomend this book for those who are unfamiliar with Monty Python and who want to learn more, but individual biographies of each Python would be better if you want to get a more in-depth view of the Python People. Otherwise, a fantastic resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price","review":"Bob loves these treats better than anything and lets me know every day when it's Greenie Time.

The vet always compliments us on brushing the dogs' teeth, but we never have.

These little chewies are a boon for dog's dental health, but also for their digestive tract. Highly digestible, just the right amount of 'chew' for my older dog...Greenies are a great adjunct to yearly cleaning. They do not take the place of cleaning, and dental decay is a huge problem in dogs as they age. I want my special girl to stay healthy, pain free, and happy as long as she can...and Greenies make her healthy, happy, and sweet breathed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our dog has fresh breath","review":"No doggie breath for our dog.

I use it as a bribe in order to get their teeth brushed. I'm not sure how well they work for deterring tartar but they seem to love it. Doesn't seem to cause any digestive problems as my hounds have sensitive stomachs.

They are easy on his teeth (not too hard, etc) and my vet complimented that his teeth are in good condition.

Amazon has provided swift service and a product that would cost much more from a local pet shop.

The first canister arrived as a solid ball of Greenies. I contacted the company and they talked as if they were a tad interested and would take responsibility but in the end they did nothing. After a month they'd sent me a mailer to return some samples that I'd pried off to test if the product was safe for my dogs. They said they never received anything and maybe the mailer was lost in their mail room. That was the end of their customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together. It is a struggle trying to pull one at a time out of the bag and they break apart. Not exactly what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORMS IN GREENIES?????","review":"This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today. I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible. I had this box for 3 months. I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted. I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs. The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product. I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this. I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.

These Greenies really clean your dog's teeth very well. When I first opened the container I was a bit skeptical because they smelled pretty bad but after a week of using these.

I was worried for their safety since I had heard some negative reviews for these chews, so I did some research and found that the most common problem is from choking. They do chomp them down so I have them eat it while I'm nearby in case they choke (haven't yet). Their teeth and gums are clean and strong so that saves $$ on dental bills. I don't like the idea of having them go under general anesthesia just to get their teeth cleaned (seems much riskier), so I will continue to take the \\"risk\\" with Greenies.

I first bought Greenies years ago when my first greyhound, Sophie, was alive. She very much enjoyed these treats and her breath improved, at least a little. Several dogs later, I was excited to bring a box of Greenies back to Mexico to give to my two dogs, Etheldreda - a greyhound, and Sadie - a greyhound mix. I'm sorry that I can't find them in Mexico and I hate to ration out the Greenies because of the short supply. Greenies are expensive, but they do help with the dogs' bad breath.

I thought it was something specific to that dog but when I tried giving them to my other two dogs- they both got sick too.

I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them. Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies. Not neat and easily stored at all. The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies. I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored. My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one. My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog. My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described. Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not feed this product to pugs.","review":"My pug almost died from this product.

I can offer her nothing else to eat all day and she still will literally turn her back and walk away from these things. I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware.

I started feeding him these, and within a very short time (weeks? Maybe even less), the inflammation had gone away and his breath was much better. I buy a size smaller than recommended for his size, and that way he can have more than one -- it breaks the treat up. Since he loves these, I can use them as a reward.

I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back.

I have been plaing the guitar for 1.5 years but I will tell you I did not start out on this guitar. My neighbors have one and somtimes i'll try to tune it but it dosn't matter because they never play it. the strings never stay tuned and they are horrible quality strings. I own a Gibson Les Paul Epephone. It is my third guiar. Do not even buy your child a guitar unless they are interested. A way you can tell is, How creative are they? How often do they use thier right brain? If they are interested you have to spend atleast $115 for a nice guitar. My eleven year old self hopes that this helped you/ Thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - Don't Buy","review":"Fell apart within about 5 weeks of mild use.

It does not stay in tune. My son received one as a gift from a relative a couple years ago. The only thing I can say is that, if you just want to see if a child would be interested in guitar, then you could buy it for that reason, it's cheap enough. It would certianly not be good for a child with a real interest in learning the guitar as they would be disapointed in the guitar not staying in tune and might then lose interest. If your serious about a true instrument, stick with the known brands and visit a music store to learn more about what would be appropriate. The real ones (child size) can be found for around 100.00 so it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My son opened this toy on Christmas morning.

It looks swell next to the Tacoma on the stand, but it is painful to hear. We couldn't get it in tune, much less keep it there. As far as I can tell, there's no way this will ever sound good.On the other hand, it works great for the four year-old twins that play it. Hopefully the sound won't drive them away from learning that instrument."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk - not durable in the least - even for an adult","review":"I purchased this for my 9 year old son for Christmas. Luckily, I took it out and inspected it while he wasn't home. I took it to my piano and was going to tune it when I noticed that tuning it made the neck start coming away from the main part. After twisting the middle string 2x it broke. First Act includes extra strings for the two thinnest strings but not for the middle. I am very disappointed and will be sending it back. I'm just glad I looked at it before Christmas morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"We bought this guitar for my 10 year old son as a guitar to start him on. It was nothing but frustration for all of us. It is very poorly made, never tunes properly, and is all around junk. He is constantly irritated at the fact that even if he plays the chord correctly, it still sounds wrong. After questioning a nearby music store about this particular guitar the manager told me that they get at least 5 or 6 a month in for repairs that end up costing the same as the guitar did.Reasons for the ratings: This would have been so much more fun if it wasn't such bad quality. Sure a guitar has incredible educational value, just not this brand. It's like getting a lego set with warped bricks. Durable? I think I have already stated my case.You could consider this for a 3 year old to go crazy on, but it would be cheaper and more educational if you sat down with the tot and made a guitar out of a kleenex box and rubber bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be tuned","review":"I am knowledgeable about guitars so I was reluctant to buy this thing to begin with, knowing that you usually get what you pay for. But I gave it a shot anyway.This guitar is made to be BOUGHT not PLAYED.The intonation is so bad that it cannot be tuned, especially the low E string.The problem is the height of the zero fret.It looks nice, but no child can learn to play on this guitar. Save up and get one that can be tuned."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real, playable guitar at an amazing price","review":"We got two of these guitars for our boys, just turning 4 and 6. They're really too young to start learning guitar, but they enjoy playing with them and haven't destroyed them yet. I did replace one high string (it was included and easy to do).I personally had been thinking about buying a full-size adult guitar for myself and have been playing these guitars a lot for a week now. They're really quite playable.I give this a high rating as a toy, and I'm not sure what all to look for in a guitar, but the tuning holds reasonably well. The sound is okay.

It doesn't sound like fun it sounds like a \\"prodigy showcase.\\" I hear alot of great music though, but I just don't feel anything . . .

But, those reviews are for the CD Eldar, released in 2005 on Sony BMG. NOT the CD Eldar released in 2001 on D&D Trio, also by the same pianist. So the only way you will know this listing is for the Eldar CD from 2001 is by the date Amazon gives you: \\"2001\\". Now for the music. I really don't know why he would make 2 albums with the very same title. It doesn't make sense. But the music here is great. It's his first album, from he was 14. Included in the cast is Gerald Spaits-bass & Todd Strait-drums. Grab this CD while you still can. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Reviewer Must not understand the piano","review":"I am not sure where the reviewer who was a bit negative is coming from, although certainly entitled to his opinion. The comparisons he makes however, fall short. Comparing Eldar with Joey DeFrancesco or Chick's Electric Band is not valid, because the entities are different and serve a different musical purpose. The kid has it all, and I mean \\"all\\". The reveiwer must not understand the piano very well near as I can figure. I have not heard anyone get a \\"sound\\" like Eldar does really since Bill Evans, or Oscar Peterson, whom I have heard live 4 times.Most of the folks I know who gripe about someone having \\"too much chops\\", normally don't have too much chops. Oscar took heat for that, too, mainly by people who didn't get it. I am going to go hear Eldar again as soon as I possibly can.

It will be of special interest to therapists. As a training therapist I found this book helpful in opening paths for doing the work of exploration and figuring out between sessions.

I had to go to the bike shop to fill up the tires. Even now time to time I have to go to bike shop to inflate the tires.The underneath basket is smallish and difficult to access. You have to unsnap one side of the basket to put in bigger bag.After a half year use the front wheel start to shake when you go for fast walk. And when the front wheel is in fixed position the stroller start to pull to the right side. After fixing this problem couple months later the problem came back.Tips over easily, when my kids is trying to get in it.The seat is adjusted with one strap on each side, which takes time and patience.The buckles for straps are hard to open and close.It is bulky and heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ram cd pouch","review":"recieved mine and the ram logo is crooked. very noticeable!

But who if not music lovers will buy this DVD, and they will find only brief snippets of Rubinstein's playing.As for biography, the great raconteur does not get a word in to tell his own story until almost nine minutes into the program. Instead we are treated to a self-indulgent display of his son John's narration, analysis -- even his conducting!The many photographs of Arthur Rubinstein are marvelous (though other people in the photos are never identified), and a few moments with Daniel Barenboim provide desperately needed reflection.But -- tell me, someone - is there no better DVD providing a musical and biographical profile of Rubinstein?

The graphics are also amazing. Now i am a big football fan and also played on a team so i know a good game.The Refs never throw the flag the refs barely call pass interferance unless you turn the penalty meter all the way up. This is still not a big flaw and didn't turn me away from the game. The major flaw is the memory it takes which is 59 blocks your whole memory card unless you have a huge one. So all summed up it is a good game with great graphics but takes a lot of memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FOOTBALL GAME EVER","review":"Madden 2003portrays everting a football video game should have. The graphics are better than the '02 version which were in itself stupendous. The music soundtrack which accompanies the game is much better than the constant rap blaring in '02 as well. Game play is much the same. But the difference lies in the running game. Running inside is much easier and going to the outside tougher. A problem w/'02 was that speed running back who were rated in the low 80's (Tiki Barber) were doing much better than power runnning backs, who were slower (Ron Dayne)EA fixed this problem and has made game players use more types of runs and this has added to the enjoyment of the game.

Better tackles and more players breaking tackles. Plus they've finally allowed two players to smash the quarter/running back. Interceptions are really cool in this game because when you pick it off you are either running it by huge guys that can't run or fast guys that can't tackle. Another thing I had gotten frusterated with was Kick returns. It seemed like you would never be able to get a good return but in this game. You always have a shot at going the distance.Ya gotta get it if your a madden man"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"I AM a fan of football games but this feels WAY too much like NCAA Football 2003 with a different title and cover art. It does have different modes, not too deep. I was struggling last week with a decision whether or not to get NHL 2004 PlayStation2. NHL 2004 happens to be MUCH better. It also doesn't have a good \\"addiction level\\" as I call it. Besides, the box now has a hobby, collecting dust. Commentary is quite annoying. Just the same thing again and again and again.

Then you have a small amount of units to choose from. The game play is just standard RTS nothing new or special about it & the graphics are extremely poor. The main thing that really bugged me was the unit voiceovers, they are ANNOYING! For example your spearmen whinge carry on, its not even funny like the units in warcraft 2 & 3, its plain stupid. To tell you the truth, the whole game annoyed me and after forcing myself to play due to paying good money for it, I uninstalled it and gave it to a friend who hated it as well.Do not waste good cash on this, stick to Empire earth 1 & 2, and try and imagine that this game never existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Empire Earth?!??","review":"If you played the original Empire Earth you will be sorely disappointed in this game.

It looks like EE III was redesigned to better cater to players interested in a first person shooter (FPS) game instead of an RTS. The variations of the different cultures and their technology evolutions were completely thrown out in favor of 3 basic cultures: western, eastern and middle eastern. The more advanced technological stages were diluted and \\"cartoonified\\" into something resembling a weak PS3 game.

I couldn't remember the name of the author, although I remembered it was Swedish sounding. Last night I found it listed on the Library of Congress web site and got Tove Jansson's name. Low and behold -- I plugged the name into Amazon and here are all the books! I had no idea there were so many...

I am now 32 and still own the copy I read as a child. Moreover, I occasionally re-read it to comfort myself, when I want to feel cosy and positive.The Moomin characters are kind and goodhearted, they are adventurous and loyal to their friends. The Moomin family welcomes every guest, friend or neighbour into their home, they accept and embrace everyone oddities and offer every newcomer comfort, cookies, warm milk and a bit of constant adventure. This book has no malice in it, and non of the contemporary commercialism or greed. But it has plenty of what every kid needs: adventure, friendship and good heart.If your kids are anywhere between 5 and 12 you can wholeheartedly entrust them into the hands of the Moomins. This is really the best book one can get as a present."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite books for children of all ages","review":"I love these books. They are amazingly unique.

They are struggling to give 10-year-old daughter Etta a normal childhood, while mourning the sudden death of four-year-old Joe several years earlier.Largely due to their intense sorrow, Ave Maria and Jack begin drifting apart. Ave Maria begins to suspect her husband of intimacy with Karen Bell, a woman he met through work; and she herself is faced with a difficult decision after meeting a man on a trip to her relatives in Italy.The humorous color of the side characters first introduced in the previous novel balances well with the seriousness of the MacChesney family's problems. It also gives hope that in the end, what's good will prevail.This book is the second of the \\"Big Stone Gap\\" quartet; the fourth book is scheduled for release at the end of October 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only read if you've read the others first","review":"I would only read this book if you have read Big Stone Gap. This is the second book in the series. I loved the first book Big Stone Gap and was excited to read a book with the same characters and by Trigiani. However, I thought it was a bit strange how it skipped over basically 8 years. It was still pretty good, but not as good as I hoped it would be. These books are a fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why go there?","review":"I loved Big Stone Gap. I was eager to read the sequel. I was very disappointed; so cliche', so repetitive. It really lacked the fresh, involving soul-searching of Big Stone Gap. The characters seem to be dragged into a trite story-line which was oddly uncharacteristic. I wish the author had left the story alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I enjoyed Big Stone Gap and anticipated the sequel, hoping it would further explore the relationship between Ave and Jack. I always found their relationship and Ave's decision to marry him in the last part of BSG a bit shallow minded, with Ave putting her dreams and aspirations aside to become the doting housewife. An easy ending. I was curious to see how the relationship would develop, obviously Ave is a more complex person that that, only to find Ave and Jack smack in the middle of a crisis and serious lull in their relationship. Never having experienced the \\"good parts\\" which were not fully realized in the first book, I continue to wonder why Ave chose this life. Of course, Ave goes off and attempts to explore herself with a glimpse of her old independent spirit, only to return to BSG and accept all of the fault for the breakdown of their relationship. Pleazzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO DISSAPOINTING! AWFUL SEQUEL.","review":"I loved Big Stone Gap and was super excited to find that there was a sequel to Ave and Jack's cute story. Unfortunately, I was sooooo disappointed in this sequel that I almost couldn't even finish reading it. I did finish it in the hopes that maybe it would get better at the end. No. The ending was horrible and lame. I was appalled by the way the characters developed. Mostly by Ave herself. I got more and more frustrated and annoyed by the way she was acting. Just read the first book while you still have respect for the characters. YUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and insightful","review":"I loved Big Cherry Holler. It was interesting to see how the characters from Big Stone Gap had grown and changed. It was also astonishing how much Adriana has grown as a writer. I felt like I was part of the conversations.

Good story about everyday life and its ups and downs. I can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer","review":"After the magic and suble romance of the first, this one was a real bummer.

I can only hope we return to the amazing writing of Big Stone Gap in book three. This one was ok, maybe because I loved returning to a beautiful place and time. I loved the characters returning to make me laugh. These things were all hear in round two but without the heart. The story was ok, I loved visiting Italy and watching Etta grow up. But missed the amazement of Big Stone Gap that kept me on the edge of my seat. I didn't find this had any suprise in it. Just a story of a married couple trying to cope with life. Don't worry...I'm on to book three with hopes of loving it as much as the first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Marriage in the Doldrums","review":"Long time spinster Ave Maria Mulligan married Jack MacChesney in the far better novel Big Stone Gap. But, alas, the marriage has grown stale. Following the death of their second child the two find it increasingly difficut to communicate, or even to muster much concern for the other. The supporting cast of characters is so much more fun than the main characters that I have trouble mustering up much concern for Ave and Jack myself. The book comes alive when Ave and her daughter travel back to Italy-without Jack--to spend time with her family. Upon her return to Big Stone Gap she and Jack eventually effect a reconciliation. One hopes that it \\"takes\\" because another novel exploring their further marriage travails would be too, too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad second.","review":"After reading Big Stone Gap I fell in love with the characters. Everytime I looked at the book it made me smile. But, after reading Big Cherry Holler, I just want to sell my book back to the book store. The characters are still wonderful, except they take certain roads in their life I would have rather not known about. The ending to Big Cherry Holler was also very disappointing, but I'm assuming that is because she will write another.

What a let down!The story is cliched, the narrator has no inight into how she is letting her marriage fall apart, the novel's other characters are under-written and there is none of the wit or charm the book's jacket told you to expect. I also found the unchallenged remarks made about the Indian doctor racist (is that supposed to be okay because this is set in the South?).How can it take Ave Maria so long to realise that her marriage is in trouble? How could she not know Theodore was gay? The guests on Rikki are more intelligent than this woman!Do yourself a favour and buy an Anita Shreve book instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pales in comparison to the first book","review":"I purchased this sequel expecting some of the same warm characters and quirky storylines that made the first book wonderful... and I didn't get any of it.

It is the perfect size for her and fits nicely in her doll stroller. Her stuffed animals have gotten very dirty from going outside and they aren't washable so I was excited that the doll could get wet. Unfortunately, the doll doesn't dry very quickly, so she has been relegated to a bath toy. We bath her at night and she dries overnight/during the day. This frustrates my daughter.

When you are passing, the best way to gain yards whaen the recievers are covered is to make your QB run, the computer will not stop you at all. The graphics are extremely better than 2001, it finally looks like a ps2 game, but the players are too skinny and they never show their faces. and this year they also took time to put everyone's name in the game, which they didn't do in 2001.

At one point, I actually felt tears in my eyes (when the governors of two other states join Wyoming in its defiance of the Feds). Unfortunately the novel is marred by frequent typos and other lapses; better editing would have made a big difference. The most serious problem, however, is that the story ends too soon, sadly avoiding the confrontation that it was clearly weaving its way toward.The above having been noted, overall the book's blend of fiction and fact works well, and it's quite entertaining and informative.

I have heard good things about the Author's other works, and as someone who majored in Political Science in college and is in the US Army, I figured it would be a good combination of my interests.The book was marred by multiple page length quotations from dry sources, attempting to (as far as I can tell) inject some sort of intellectual foundation into this work of fiction. The book suffered from way too much \\"telling\\" instead of \\"showing\\" and could have been about 100 pages shorter without losing any important content.

There are a lot of creative ideas in this book, and it does a decent job of keeping the suspense up.While I am a huge BTP fan, I couldn't give this five stars because he is just not at the highest level when it comes to writing fiction.

It becomes quite clear that anyone with their eyes open and a good sense of history should have been able to see what was and is coming. This book is fact, fiction, and forecast all in one.

My sister actually had it for a year or so before I read it. This is one of the Peabody series, but it operates on its own as well, so you don't have to read the others first or anything.The plot is, Jack Derwood has an offer to go with his uncle on a fact-finding trip in the Yukon. Allegedly, a long-dead crook buried treasure there, and they want to find it. Jack invites his bully-turned-friend Scruggs to come along, and, along with other party members, they begin their venture to find The Treasure of the Yukon.The book is surprisingly believable, well-written, and fun to read. While giving the feel of being back in the days of live-on-your-own-means, fighting outlaws and recovering stolen treasure, it is not at all unbelievable or fanciful. In fact, I thought it was rather cool, especially the end.

Madden 2003, NFL Fever, & NFL 2K3 from Sega. Last year I loved Fever for my XBox and Maddedn for PS2. DO what I did. Rent all 3 at once and sit down and go to work. You'll find Madden to be the much more realistic game of the three. That's what it comes to. Realism. Plaine and simple. All three games have great graphics (too close for me to lean either way). Just take one look at the throwing mechanics from the qb's. Madden has it hands down. The biggest negative is the commentary due of Madden and Michaels. How freakin boring!!! I threw a 90 yd bomb from Joey Harrington to Az Hakim to win a game and Michaels barely even aknowledged the td much less a bomb to win it all. They need to improve that part of it. Madden is the better of the three, no question!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's time for a change.......","review":"I have purchased Madden games too many times before.

With the addition of the ESPN and the actual intelligent commentary it makes you feel as if you are actually playing a real game. Do your self a favor and pick up NFL2K3 instead.

There is NO comparison to the realistic look and feel of NFL Fever compared to Madden. Sure, EA may have put more features like drills and cards to collect etc. but I bought this to actually play a football game, and NFL Fever allows you to do just that with better graphics and more realism! Not having owned any previous version of either, I gave both an equal amount of time, and even invited several friends to try both and NONE of them chose Madden after playing both.

You have to command a squad of four navy seals, Kahuna-You, Boomer--Able Unit, Jester, Spectre.--Bravo unit.The online gaming is all about either if your on the terrorists or the seals side the primary objective is to usually Eliminate all seals or terrorists depending on what team your on. You can also create your own games like say HANDGUNS ONLY, you pick a map, and the people who join the game only use handguns.Or you can even do Clan Tryouts...A clan is when you and a group of people just make a team, give it a name and compete in tournaments. ...Also I recommend Cable/DSL modem for online play.!

You assume the role of a US: Navy SEAL. You can play the single player missions or online. In order to play online you need the Network Adapter. The single player aspect of this game is very weak. However online is where this game excels. It has a headset that allows you to speak to other people in real time. What you say is what they hear.

A definate plus to this game is the fact the voice commands via the headset actually work (you have to speak caveman with simple preset terms). It definately brings in the excitement to the play when you're calling for backup or assigning attacks with your secondary team Bravo. Online play brings enjoyment with reach-out-and-frag-someone on the otherside of the country feel, but some lag issues will remain since this is sony's first real online system.

You play the commander of another 3 other seals. Pick between 30 weapons like the M-16, MP5, and M203. The game is a Tom Clancy Rainbow Six all over again. Just a better all around game.

It has all the details of real war from nightvision goggles, all different guns and explosives and much, much more. It gives you the feeling that you are really a US NAVY SEAL! a must have for people who liked Medal of Honor: Frontline."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is horrible","review":"I don't know what it was about this game that made me dislike it so much. Oh wait, could it be the fact that it was boring, my teammates never did what I wanted them to do, the weapons were boring, and did I mention it was boring?

However, since the game has been around a while too many geeks have hacked the game so now you go in and play online and some guy walks through walls with a super machine gun and kills you in 2 seconds.

Unlike a lot of games out there ... socom does not allow you carry the firearm eqivalent of most european nations. you can carry a pistol, a rifle, and 3 slots for equipment. the good part of all this is that any weapon you find you can echange for yours. as for the diffuculty part, the main part is that your teammates can be [stupid] at times. like when they were firing at a sniper and a terrorist ran up on our flank. rather than shooting him, they continued to fire at the sniper and promply got killed. but your team can be murderous at times, and often they see enemies i didnt know were there.

While the latter shows better on the screen--the original film is rough and worn through aging--the deleting of such racy images detracts from the film maker's artistic intent. Perhaps the new edition's editors expect to gain a broader audience by not offending puritancal tastes, but for me it's a disappointment. Specially since it's the only film I've ever seen of Sheree North topless (fortunately the original shows occasionally on cable t.v.). While such gratuitous editing occurs frequently on network television, one wouldn't expect it to happen on a DVD. This viewer certainly wouldn't have bought it had he known it had been cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good flick. Lousy sound.","review":"No matter my inclinations towards Lancaster and his no nonsense duty and honor, the movie was not at all enjoyable due to the lousy sound--I've heard better in downstair closets filled with 20 years of dust. What went wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"The movie was unbelievable for two reasons:There actually were few gunfights in the Old West.Nobody but Burt could shoot straight.Should have called it Low Noon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great western !","review":"The great Burt Lancaster at his best. Robert Ryan, Lee J. Cobb,Sheree North,Robert Duvall and a very young Dennis Hopper. It even had a great line. You know what a lawman is kid? A killer of men. Now that's a line. Well Lancaster is lights out as a by the book no matter what career United States Marshal. They even made a TV series based on this knockout western! I cannot understand how Shane or High Noon can be considered superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Film - Sound Not So Good","review":"I was very disapointed with this film \\"LAWMAN\\" and not because of the film itself, but because of the sound quality of this DVD. The sound was very flat, high pitched and with no depth to the sound at all and that's sad because this is a great film in itself. This is a great Western with an excellent cast, especially the great character actor William C. Watson as Choctaw Lee, the gunfighter. Richard Jordon as Crow was also great. You just don't see great films like this anymore, basically because you don't have actors like this anymore, Burt Lancaster, Lee J. Cobb, Albert Salmi, etc. If someone else purchased this DVD and the sound is great, please let me know as maybe I received a defected DVD. I hope the DVD was defected as I would love to enjoy this film once more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lost gem","review":"This is an excellent western. All the main actors are given time and words/actions to create interesting and complex characters. Even the secondary actors are given space that fill in the cracks and make a story complete. There is some beautiful location work, the town looks like a real town, and the interiors look authentic. Every actor rises to the occasion giving a convincing performance. It's a film where many correct small details make the story real. The subtext of ageing, regret, lost love, changing times adds depth to the a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do driving force. Burt L. plays tough, but is not a dumb rock. There is a side of him that is slowly revealed that makes you care for him. I'd never heard of this film, got it in a Burt L. three pack. Watched it out of a low intensity curiosity. After maybe ten minutes I said to myself \\"Hey, this is a good movie!\\" And it seemed to just keep getting better and better. I would recommend this film to any film lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Film--BUT DON'T BUY THIS VERSION!

There is one problem; you can't actually hear the orchestra on some of the tracks, which is a shame, because they make the songs pretty classy. I'm a diehard Chicago fan, and I've been upset with Cetera for seemingly distancing himself from his former bandmates. However, it's nice to hear him doing some old Chicago songs, mixed in with his solo stuff. Cetera's voice earns this CD a four-star rating from me. I've never heard him do much in the way of live stuff, and I'm impressed by his still-impressive singing voice; he manages to hit even the high stuff here. Now, if only he would get back with Chicago..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording of a great concert...","review":"I'll agree with the reviewer who called it his review \\"great artist; poor recording\\". I bought this hoping for the same great performance I saw on PBS but the recording process was just terrible for this concert in Salt Lake, UT. The concert music sounded very far away and when Peter Cetera's voice climaxed, the audio muffled which was very annoying for me. The recording wasn't as clear as it was from his television performance which has me thinking the recording process is what is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Artist, Poor recordings","review":"It is sad to listen to this poor quality recording of Peter Cetera live in Salt Lake.I wonder if he did listen to this cd because if he did, he would fire his sound-crew immediately. Because the songs supported by the symphony orchestra are special and well performed, it is a shame that this product is sold. And even a bigger shame on Peter Cetera who's recordings normally have a 5 star rating.Sorry Peter.Rogier from The Netherlands.(or is it possible that this cd has been dubbed in the wrong way..?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Pedal, Don't waste your Money!!!!!!, Great Seller, Buy from them!!!!","review":"I bought these pedals to replace the OEM pedals on my Raleigh bike. The originals have been on the bike approximately 10 year (they still worked well but the glued on reflectors fell off). I put these pedals on my bike (did noticed the roughness the other reviewer complained of)and road about two mile to the gas station to put air in my tires. At that time I noted the left pedal had a crack in it and thought it I had recieved a defective pedal. I got the air and decided to return home, rode a total 5 miles and when I got home to my surprise the right pedal had cracked and was coming apart from the shaft. lol Total junk, totally wasted.

There's lots of pictures of Dillon doing \\"his\\" technique which seem to all incorporate his back being bent over. Then there's this horrid spelling of Aikido technique. One example is \\"Techi nage\\" I guess this is his spelling or pronounciation of Aikido's \\"Tenchi Nage\\".I found it interesting that the author recommends ignoring the ego and all it's trappings, yet he doesn't give his Aikido linneage.In the end, I found the technical portions of this book and philosophical/spiritual aspects incredibly lacking. I don't recommend this book at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book on Aikido I ever saw","review":"This is probably the worst book about aikido I have ever read.

It was really sad at some momments, but at others it was kinda funny. Since I believe in all of that 'phycic stuff' I enjoyed this book a lot.

But despite that, this is one fabulous hard rock CD.

Oh, and the bass and drums, it's hard to figure out what \\"air instrument\\" to jam on. Everybody tries to steal the song, and the bass and drums are great. The vocs are also good, no problem there.

Well, this cd just flat out rocks like a tidal wave. Thank God for the return of the guitar solo. Where has it been hiding in recent years? You don't hear it much in today's so-called \\"new rock\\" genre. This band is hard rock, metal, jazz and funk with a boost of high octane 104 jet fuel. I stumbled upon this cd in a Border's bookstore (of all places) in their headphone listening section for new music. Being a long time fan of metal and hard rock I found this to be a jem.

Not rare, but at least it has acceptable video and sound quality. The vast majority of the remaining clips don't fare so well.There are no musical clips of the group at all, but at least this is clearly mentioned on the packaging.Agnetha once wore a stunning green cape in a 1975 TV performance of \\"Hey Hey Helen,\\" but I seriously doubt that she ever dyed her air green. Well, in some of the footage seen here her hair IS green. So's everything else. Someone was asleep when transfering the footage to video, or else they couldn't be bothered with properly adjusting the chroma phase.And you shouldn't bother to buy this DVD, unless you truely must have every ABBA release."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun to use with lots of opts. for the chess lover","review":"This little guy is great for playing chess. It's about the size of a PDA and has a strong durable feel to it. The chess pieces are fairly easy to decipher although sometimes I get confused as which pieces belong to which color (the only indicator is a little black or empty square in the middle of the piece). The touch screen is very easy to use and you don't have to press hard to move pieces around. It has a lot of options and features with 100 levels of intelligence. As far as I can tell, no other lcd touch screen chess game comes close to the quality of this one. The price of it should be an indicator of this. If you are curious, the Sharper Image sells this under their own name and for[] more! Get it here and save yourself some money. It's a great deal for what it offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Misled....","review":"Although Roger Dean's artwork on the cover of this DVD may evoke some nostalgia in many Yes fans, don't be lured into parting with your money for this one. The quality of the sound is terrible, and the video looks almost like a home-movie. None of the atmosphere of the Rainbow Rooms is captured and the whole experience left me thinking I should have read some reviews before buying! Put on your Yes CD's and close your eyes - trust me, you'll have a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Quality Unacceptable","review":"The sound quality is the same as VHS before the days of Hi-Fi which is totally unacceptable.

They can get Elvis on stage again nowadays but it's probably to difficult in the age of computers to remaster and to digitalise this beautiful concert. Oh, it would be so nice to relive this concert again and with good sound quality!! Well, I'm still hoping that day will come."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could this be released ?","review":"I waited a long time to buy this and it was going to be a treasure as I had seen the band live many times in their early years, including their Marquee residence every Tuesday night (entry fee approx $1 or 6/6d in English currency). What a disappointing video and the sound is not much better. Having recently purchased Keys to Ascension and appreciated the quality of production, I was amazed a band with such integrity would allow this third rate DVD to be released. Come on now, lets get the band on a soundstage like Eagles, Mac and Fogerty and showcase the excellent musicanship that they are still capable of. It will be a winner. As for Yessongs, I would save your money. In fact it was so poor I traded this DVD in, it simply was depressing to watch given the memories I had of watching this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes's Golden Age","review":"This is classic Yes, at their most compelling. I guess there's very little film of them from this era - they were hardly ever on TV. I'd forgotten this film existed, but I now remember seeing it at the cinema in 1973 or 74. Obviously it's not great film quality, but neither is it heavily doctored. It's great just to see the guys at close quarters. An absolute 'must' for any real Yes fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISMAL AUDIO","review":"Why doesnt someone do a remix from multitrack masters to get better audio??This is just TERRIBLE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant unabashed artistry","review":"This is a great movie. I can remember seeing this many years ago, more than once. Starship Trooper is not in its entirety, only get small pieces, tastes at the end. Obviously an editing issue. I would guess that even in 1973 they had to cut \\"something\\", had to keep it commercial for the low attention span masses and their money. Other than that I have zero criticisms because it is very true to the performance. The camera work is fine, the amoebaes and fly-traps are fine, the capes are fine, and And You And I is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Yes indeed !","review":"Forget about your state-of-the-art DVD & speakers, let the magic of these guys take you somewhere else.

Looks like a VHS transfer from some 3rd generation film after gathering dust for the past twenty five years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes to Yessongs","review":"This is classic '70s Yes and it's great to visualize the album.An absolute highlight is witnessing Steve Howe's guitar mastery and 'other worldly' abitlities on The Clap.The whole thing is a 'trip' for the senses and the memories!The recording and colour are great - you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting for any avid Yes fan","review":"Although the product is not top-quality photography, the close-ups and clarity are not par to today's technology, or maybe even at that time, this may be the best Yes concert on film in their early years. Yes is one of the most talented groups of musicians and composers of the last 40 years, and continues to tour with original members this year. To me, they did reach their peak of live-performing talent about 15 years after this tour, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A picture of masters in their prime","review":"This is the best film available of Yes in the height of their wizardry. I would rate this a 5 in content for the sheer joy of watching this amazing band perform their best material except the sound on this is poor to say the least. I've been waiting years for this to come out and while it is truly amazing to watch, the question arises as to why this wasn't remastered. Sound rates about a 2, being oddly muffled and seemly recorded on a cheap tape player from the back of the concert hall. It's still great to watch and the musicianship is jaw-dropping but I often like to throw these concert videos on and play them as I would Cd's while doing other things just to have some great tunes going on in the back ground. This sound just isn't up to that quality. That being said, if your a fan of prog rock or just a fan of master musicians at work, this is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes - Yessongs DVD","review":"Back in 1972, the progressive band Yes was in their infancy and with an original line-up of Steve Howe, Jon Anderson, Chris Squire, Rick Wakeman and Alan White played most of their songs from the Fragile and Close to the Edge albums.

Which doesn't sound right unless you've been in the bullied kid's shoes before. This kind of thing may go through someone's mind, but this movie shows what happens when the line between fantasy and reality blur and everything falls apart.Why 2 stars then, if it does such a great job? Because the original, with a well deserved NC-17 Rating, did a great job. For whatever reason the company chose to only re-release the terrible R Rated cut on blu-ray, in which less than 33% of the story is even TOLD, let alone depicted.

This has handsome production, atmospheric direction, and above all a solid supporting cast (Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, Patsy Kelly, Wally Vernon, Anita Louise, Joseph Calleia), but the results are more noisy than funny in this stagey adaptation of an old play. Not at all typical of the Ritz Brothers, who were much more at home with musical comedy, and first-time viewers shouldn't judge the team by THE GORILLA.

It is, however, very topical in relation to the impending American onslaught on Iraq. He identifies the fear of uncertainty as a key motivation for the adeherence to ideologies (such as those that guide the Bush Administration). Fear of uncertainty (Saul says) is an obstruction to thought - it's easier to embrace the simple guidance of (especially) conservative (and insular) ideology that America uses to protect it from an uncertain world.

They don't get to watch a lot of TV besides PBS stuff, but when we saw this at a friend's house, they were riveted. My friend said it was one of her son's favorites, and since they were such sweet, simple stories (no loud crashes, flashes, etc.), I decided to get it for our house. Unfortunately, because it's old, it's hard to find. I ordered mine used through Amazon. It was advertised \\"like new,\\" but it did come with the wrong case for one of the DVDs. Not a HUGE issue, just a little annoying. And not enough to go through the hassle of returning it for - especially since it's hard to find.My husband and I find Shelley Duvall a little annoying, but our sons seem to love her. Maybe because she IS so different and silly. Anyway, I strongly recommend this set if you want to offer your children simple stories on DVD. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE TITLE!!!","review":"The title of this book is very misleading!

You just need to look at the number of albums they have, to see that.

But, that said, it also happens to be my 17 year old daughter's favourite Alabama song...so I guess it's 'horses for courses'. The other hit song is the title track \\"In Pictures\\", a lovely bittersweet song about a fathers love for the daughter he hardly sees due to divorce. This album is worth getting for that song alone, but for Alabama fans the whole albums a 'must have'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alabama CD","review":"This product came to me very fast!, I was impressed with the quality, worked wonderful for my daughters wedding.

None of them great, none of them bad. The prints have not been restored, and look OK, but this is what Universal has to do when they are selling these films as a budget item.Don't expect the incomparable high quality you get from Warner Bros. on these releases....the prints they were taken from are worn out and just plain bland.in life, Lonbard was on fire.

Imagine all of the bad qualities of Scarlett O'Hara from Gone With The Wind and none of the good qualities, and you have Carole Lombard. Her on screen persona in these films is just that of an irritating, flat out incomprehensibly difficult, and irrational female. The plots are all too far-fetched because no man in his right is going to adamantly pursue such a distasteful person. The plots in this collection of films are too stretched and too remote to be even slightly believable. The comedies aren't funny and the romances not interesting.

I enjoy all Dean Martin movies as he had a way of fitting his part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Big","review":"I saw this movie when it was first released and the reviews were mixed to downright savage. What reviewers seemed not to realise was that Andrew McGlaglen was an afficianado of John Ford.His father, Victor, acted in many of his films. Something Big was an affectionate parody of Ford's cavalry films, mostly with John Wayne and most of the supporting cast of Something Big. Not meant to be taken too seriously, the film was a vehicle for Dino who was huge on American TV and most other media at the time. It was lambasted for poor taste but compared to what has been released onto the public in recent times it is almost Disneyesque by comparison. 3/4 stars for entertainment value. The one jarring note of the movie was Carol White's Scottish accent but it was no worse than Dick Van Dyke's Cockney accent in Mary Poppins and I enjoyed both films in spite of dodgy accents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I may be jaded by today's technology...but this film failed to deliver on multiple levels - it was forever leading to \\"something big\\" and only delivered on having to sit through to an unrewarding promise.

So after 35 years or so I got it it is a 70's action/comedy/western and is pretty good in that respect. It won't win any oscars but is a good lazy sunday afternoon movie.

More than once I've dropped a basket of food only to realize the plug had come loose (I think the lightest breeze loosens it) and I was soaking the food in cool or lukewarm oil. So you gotta pay attention to that. Unfortunately it just stopped working after less than a month. Now that I read the reviews, I see we're not the only ones that happened to. Willing to give it another try, sent for a replacement. If that one dies too we'll be looking at a different manufacturer.UPDATE: DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE.

I must admit I was surprised at first at how small it was inside but my first try was a success so I decided to keep it. I made crinkle cut chips and french fries from fresh potatoes and they both turned out great! For 5 russet potatoes I think I did around 10 batches. I did not want to overcrowd the tank because the temperature would drop. What's really nice was the potatoes cooked evenly so there was no need to babysit it. Once I dropped the basket in I could do other things and check only after 5 minutes or so. It's also great that I could hook the basket onto the lip and leave it there for a few seconds to drain. My only wish is that the tank could be removed for easier cleaning. I cook for only my husband and myself so this size is perfect for us. It is a cute little appliance that goes well with our tiny kitchen. Hopefully it would last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prefect size","review":"Great product for a single serving.

The author's basic concept is a good one--share with the reader the experiences of children brought up in an unorthodox (read hippie) household. The novel itself does little to bring that concept to life. Although she has an interesting--almost poetic--writing style, I finished the novel feeling like I had learned almost nothing about the characters. The main character's three siblings are basically interchangeable, with no distinguishing characteristics. The readers are supposed to be empathetic with the children, but I felt as if they barely existed. Although the preliminary short story is compelling, none of the following chapters live up to that promise. This is a slight book built on a great premise. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious Girls, Serious Novel","review":"It is a great pleasure to read a first novel that is as lucidly and unprentiously written as Maxine Swann's.

This book is filled with many half-truths and unsubstantiated claims. I am very supportive of a vegetarian lifestlye, but this book is hugely biased toward promoting a vegan lifestyle. People with food allergies already have so many limited food choices- this book makes it seem that they must follow an even more limted diet than they need too. Just one example- under the discussion of the health benefits of Omega-3 fatty acids, fish is not even mentioned as a source. This is misleading information. The topic of food allergies and intolerances is already filled with so much confusion and misunderstanding, I am afraid this book does nothing to help the situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book","review":"I got the book super fast and was in pretty good condition.

Need to know a budget number for a solid core door relative to a hollowcore? its in there, painting by sf of drywall vs CMU or even fee % breakdowns. Having this book makes you look good and esp for architects that know the big picture but cant'remember the actual size of a conc block or what 11 block courses equal (vert or horiz) I tell people to get this book and keep it in your car or briefcase, so you can go look up the answer to those questions that put you on the spot esp on the job site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift For Clients","review":"I have had my own professional engineering firm (building energy systems) for twenty-two years. This small-sized, well-bound (in soft plastic), and amply illustrated volume is my favorite gift to clients who are new to the building process. It allows them to get comfortable with common ideas and terminology used by design professionals on their projects.The book also is a useful reference for site construction personnel, junior architectural design personnel, and engineers who need to know what the architects are talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you need something small","review":"As a portable handbook and quick reference it contains some useful information if you need something to carry in your pocket, beyond that I feel if you have a graphics standards or building construction illustrated you are better off.

The pictures are fun to see and her lists of what to do in order to be a model may be helpful to those looking for that type of insight. I was looking for a refreshed interpretation of a model's life. On the bright side, it is better than Paris Hilton's book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a book on modeling","review":"I was expecting a book from Heidi Klum to give alot of advice on how she became a model, but i was let down. This book contains alot of advice from people like Donald Trump, and other business people. Which is OK i guess, but i wanted to hear her \\"behind the scenes\\" look at modeling and this book does NOT have that.

Is Ms. Klum really targeting women who feel they need to re-vamp their bodies, images, sex lives, etc? In other words, the average, moderately insecure woman? Wow, it really makes me feel special to see PAGES AND PAGES--even the inside of the front and back sections--filled with images of an airbrushed, overworked Heidi Klum. How can anyone aspire to that virtually unreachable level (as if Ms. Klum is anyone special without her makeup artist and hair colorist)? Certainly not someone who is taking the time to read this book. If you're in the mood for getting your ego stomped on or for seeing Ms. Klum in a book riddled with soft porn, shovel up the eighteen bucks and ENJOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the book i thought it was..","review":"I bought this book for my daughter, and it is NOT for children or teens.

We go from anecdote to anecdote, without really figuring out why people enter these subcultures, and what their everyday lives are like. She meets some nasty, scary types, with some deeply internalized pain and hostility, and does little to help us understand or sympathize with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pity.","review":"Given that the subject matter is pretty interesting, I found the book hard to read, mostly because of Ramsland's scattered organization, wierd investigative techniques, and uneven coverage. As befits an Anne Rice scholar, she refers constantly (even relentlessly) to Rice's books, even when it makes no sense to. Considering the constant references to Goth culture, it would have been nice if she'd given us a coherent definition of it first. Also,frankly,some parts of the book were just goofy: the \\"vampire porno\\" viewing session (which told us what?), her personal experiences with an \\"emotional vampire\\" (which was obviously a personal rant), and the whole encounter with Wraith, the 'real' vampire, which left me feeling that she is so gullible that the rest of her book is seriously questionable. Over all, I would still like to know more about this subculture. I just don't want Ramsland to write anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Boring...","review":"This account of Ms. Ramslands investigation into the disappearance of Susan Walsh and subsequent exposure to the \\"underground vampire scene\\" is dead boring.Ramsland loses the Walsh story within the first two chapters and then the book cascades into her snooze provoking adventures into underground clubs (which appear to be your standard pseudo-bondage pick up bars). The contacts she meets are also of no particular consequence and the only slightly frightening aspect about them is their need desperate of psychologic help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another avertisement for Anne Rice","review":"With all of the references to Anne Rice in this so-called \\"investigation\\" into modern-day vampires, you would think that Anne was getting co-author credit. This book is not worth the pages it's printed on. It seems the author was much more content to see how far into this world she was wiling to go than to actually inofrm the reader as to what this world is actually about.

She didn't do her homework with the first paragraph of her \\"criminals\\" chapter and has done a great disservice to the many scapegoated members of this \\"subculture\\" and others by simply quoting rumors. Damien is not a \\"vampire,\\" a \\"satanist\\" OR a murderer. He was not a member of a \\"dog eating\\" cult. Let's move beyond Geraldo once in a while and check those facts.. It IS important. - b u r k"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing ending","review":"My husband is a huge vampire fan, and we listened to the cassette tapes on our vacation. Even though many of the descriptive scenes in the book are too graphic, the thread that kept both of us listening was the hope that she would solve the mystery of the woman's death. Unfortunately, the author decides in the middle of the book to abandon the search for the truth, and instead continues to listen to Rath's fruitless stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terribly childish and naive treatment...","review":"of a fasinating subject. There are three problems with this book: 1. It's self serving. The author has no special insight into the subject yet she insists on assaulting the reader with her bland opinions rather than reporting the phenomenon. 2. There are no shocking revelations here. Nothing a casual observer wouldn't pick up in a Goth or BDSM club. If Ramsland thinks this is a recent phenom she needs to do a bit more research. 3. If I wanted to know how Anne Rice felt about Vampyres i'd pick up one of her books. The author needs to stop name dropping and riding on Rice's coat tails.I find myself a little angry that such claptrap could be clothed in such an alluring title."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I bought this at Buck-A-Book","review":"I found this book very disappointing because it presented itself as a work of investigative journalism, but soon turned into a socio-psychological treatise on the allure of the vampire image in modern society. Too much of the book was philosophical speculation; too little of the book was hard journalism. Ramsland's writing style is hardly riveting, and I skipped dozens of pages to find interesting parts. Too often she writes pages and pages of dialogue with \\"vampires\\" who are obviously dysfunctional and emotionally disturbed, expressing themselves with bombastic language a la Anne Rice, Poppy Z. Brite, and Giles of Buffy fame. I found it very hard to wade through page after page of this drivel. There were some insights, but nothing that hasn't been thoroughly revealed by others in previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Fiction, Not Good Journalism.","review":"Which would be more insulting to a reader's intelligence? That Ramsland's \\"investigative journalism\\" is so flimsy that she's taken in by transparently fictional vampire stories spun by a neurotic goth named \\"Wraith\\"? Or that Ramsland made the stories up herself, and for the sake of \\"a good scare\\" expects us to buy into the cardboard masquerade?Hey Katherine, if \\"Wraith\\" is real, he was playing you. A first-year journalism student would have seen through it. If you made it all up, then publish it as a novel next time so we'll know where to file it.A shame, too. Ramsland skims the surface of a fascinating cultural phenomenon. Too bad she didn't have the discipline to follow through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti -Psychotic Medication Required!!!","review":"I loved Ms. Ramsland's book \\"Cemetary Stories\\" so I was really looking forward to reading about her foray into the Vampire Culture in search of a \\"real\\" Vampire. All she found was a lot of sad lonely individuals of questionable sexual persuasion who engaged in 'Vampiric Costume Drama\\" for the sole purpose of having a sexual encounter. One gets the feeling that these poor misguided individuals could all benefit from a great deal of Therapy and/or some Heavy Duty Medication.Even Ms. Ramsland becomes jaded with these poor folk by the end of the book.One gets the feeling that it would be easier to find a 'real\\" Vampire working the Graveyard Shift at your local 7/11 than in all of the S&M clubs she visited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrilled, Chilled, & Disappointed...","review":"If you are about to buy this book stop!

How the author didn't pickup on the meaning of vampires 'till the very end is disturbing. Yet on the good side this book will keep you listening until the end.

This CD represented the pinnacle of his career with an album that had so many standout tracks. \\"Ai No Corrida\\" was one of the first songs that I loved and even today, it still makes me feel great. It and \\"Razzamatazz\\" were the sound of the future. Quincy made great choices with the songwriters and artists that he worked with and his own production completed a classic piece of work.

These Qunicy years brought great songs by Michael Jackson and The Brothers Johnson. His album here \\"The Dude\\" is no exception. \\"Have you met The Dude and his mistress Patti Austin\\"? She is probably the best part of this record, the only throw away to me is maybe \\"Just Once\\", \\"One Hundred Ways\\" is the better of the two ballads. \\"The Dude\\" is pretty damn funky, and the best of the whole bunch is \\"Somethin Special\\". Patti Austin is ethereal in this song, with great bass slapping by Louis Johnson. \\"Turn On The Action\\" has a very urgent feel to it, and \\"Ai No Corrida\\" is just fun.

Walden was the third coach hired in the last three year, he made a promise to stay with the downtrodden program and even though he was not there when WSU made it's improbable apearance in the '97 Rose Bowl, He clearly planted to seeds that started the turnaround. Very similar to the Cindarella story of the Mariners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny and prophetic satire","review":"Philip Roth is one of the great writers of his time. He has gained a mass audience while still retaining his credibility as a \\"serious\\" author, worthy of critical consideration. That's pretty hard to do.This book, the first of Roth's that I read, showed me his reputation was well earned. The satire was over-the-top, but Roth knew just when to pull back a little to avoid it from diving into Marx Brothers territory. The characterizations of Nixon and his administration are dead on. I loved how the story gradually became more and more absurd until reaching a crescendo at the end.What impressed me even more is that Roth wrote this book before Nixon's ouster. Reading it with that knowledge, one has to feel kind of spooked that so many things in this book actually turned out to be true.With all that, this book still manages to be a light and funny read. I would recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Gang, a novel by Philip roth","review":"Sure, it's by far the most dated of Roth's novels, and often over-the-top. Who really needs a Nixon satire at this point? Or even a reminder of some pretty bad times? Well, it turns out that the funny stuff still works - and there's a quite a bit of it, madcap & rollicking. Roth on this kind of roll is always best in class. And the serious stuff - I mean Nixon - really? Maybe it shouldn't be surprising that much of it still connects, that some of the caricatures, only slightly altered, are currently all too with us in the news. A somewhat weaker book by Roth is a prize nonetheless, better than nearly anything else around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, most of it is new, but...","review":"Having been a HUGE Bill Cosby fan since the second I heard the man talk, I know that it has been a struggle to find the perfect compilation of his best work. I saw this one in the store, and bought it anyway (just because I didn't have it) and expected quite a bit, since all of his older released were fantastic. Instead, I got an album full of new stuff (which was still funny), but I could hear the trim work done. If we're going to get a CD, can we at least hear the entire track. For example, the track 'basketball' starts off \\"Basketball was invented...in - break here, you can hear the digital trimming - Springfield Massachusetts. Dr. Naismith.\\" THat's the start of Basketball. I think, while it is still a good collection of Cosby hilarity, it could use a little work."},{"rating":"1","title":"material is great, but cd makes a weird noise in our stereo","review":"I bought this cd for my son's Christmas stocking and he was very pleased to receive it.

Nersessian's Manhatten Loverboy after the F-Up, Goldberg's Living Dead Girl after Fake Liar Cheat, for instance, are both great adult novels. Maybe that's why MTV didn't publish them. Whatever.

Melody (the main character) acts like someone in the real world.. not just someone in a false pretense existence. i truly thank god for freedom of speech after reading this novel. i would definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Crooked is about Melody Booth, a young woman who has just finished a three year prison sentence for attempted murder. Melody moves in with her Mother, and she almost immediatly goes back to her old routine of binge drinking. She can't deal with all the freedom she has. Melody is a good narrator, with a raw and (sometimes brutally) honest voice. Throughout the novel, Melody has flashbacks from prison. The thing about this novel that wasn't so good was there was a lot of uneeded profanity and sex, that didn't really help the plot, it just helped the book sell better. It sometimes also got a little confusing because it would jump back and forth between what happened to Melody in prison and what was happening now.

Not only is this a significant work by one of the past century's most important Roman Catholic theologians, but it has set a paradigm for Barth interpretation for 40 years since its publication - even among Protestant scholars. Balthasar's study focuses on the issue of nature and grace (naturally) and the promise of Christological ways of theologizing for ecumenical dialogue. Balthasar's reading of Barth's theological development has been challenged of late (Bruce McCormack), but his 'magisterial work' contains so much promise and insight that it is not likely to be outdated anytime soon.

While it does contain some valuable information on the Value Methodology process, it not to be considered more than a companion to the author's course on Value Enigeering. Thus, I have not found it to be a good nor readable resource.Much of the text (326 pages) is devoted to overhead presentation type information, i.e., heading and bulletized list likely originating from the author's own presentations developed to teach his class. Have you ever received an overhead presentation without the author's notes? It is very difficult to understand the points being made. Many pages contain examples of forms that a VE team leader might want to use. They amount to little more than a page full of empty boxes. In the latter portion of the book, many pages contain very little information and lots of empty wordless space.

Conradi explains all of this clearly. What is not so clear are the details of how all of the info he presents was acquired.

It is also very good for stretching your hamstrings and backside. Also, just keep your back flat and flush with the pad and you will be fine.You can't expect a miracle product for under $40 bucks, but for the cheap price and small size, this thing gets 4 stars and it works too.

The Kirkus reviewer didn't think so, but then that reviewer's summation of the story was surprisingly simplistic. I think most readers will get more out of it than that. My advice is to get the book for this piece alone, although story number three is also a worthy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"HMIENJ","review":"I loved this book, I read one of the short stories and I understood one of them very well. I thought it was the enitre book but it had 4 short stories. When I was almost to finishing one of them, My Dad asked me, \\"What made you find this book?\\" and It was simple, I was watching The Emperor's Club and during the Open Credits it said, \\"Based upon a Short Story \\"The Palace Thief\\" by Ethan Canin\\" And once I saw that, I just decided to get the book with the other short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOUCHED THE DEEPEST OF THE DEEP","review":"It was fantastic, the fire was ignited when the statement of confused greed (can greed be confused?)by the accountant was uttered.

I read this book only a couple of weeks ago and can only remember one of the stories very well: The Palace Thief.The Palace Thief has nothing to do with a palace or a conventional thief. It was also used as the basis of the movie, The Emperor's Club. The story has the same feel as Dead Poet's Society with a professor that gets his students to dress in togas as they study Greek history and literature. The story is good but, in my opinion, the only true gem in the palace of this book.Ethan Canin likes to infuse his stories with baseball and other diversions enjoyed by men. I suppose these are the types of things he himself enjoys when he's not writing books or working as a doctor."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't help but love the book","review":"I can rip into avant-garde fiction and potboilers like there's no tomorrow. But when it comes to something so sweet and unpretentious, I can't help but be mesmerized. Ethan Canin is as witty as O. Henry. Perhaps due to his medical training, he pens intricate and perfectly logical stories. His stories, like Raymond Carver's, have the supernatural ability to be minimalist yet breath maximum emotional turmoil in the readers. There are four novellas in this collection, my favorite being the City of Broken Hearts, about the connections between a lonely father and his pregressive-minded son."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD player stopped working after about 10 hours of use","review":"CD player stopped working after about 10 hours of use.

However, I returned the unit after 1 week because of technical problems. I asked for the same product as a replacement but, it was not available. My money was refunded.

I replaced it with another Delphi XM product and have been very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to use, good value","review":"I bought this for my wife at Christmas. It looked pretty good and has decent features, although I've since learned of the limitations. First, the remote doesn't work from more than a few feet away, and needs to be pointed a certain way (although I'm not sure what that is yet!). The sound is pretty tinney, and of course, the antenna must be positioned to face the southern sky......so home application is limited. I haven't taken it out in our boat yet, but hope it will work better there.3-2012.... I have now taken this to two new homes, put the account \\"on vacation\\" twice, and now have reactivated it.

The third one works but there is interference when playing CD's but only when it is reading the CD into memory.

One of their dates dumps them (but then gives them a rose) and the other doesn't get to be cyberqueen with her boyfriend (oh no!). They also sing their horrible raps and songs which used to be cute but now are just dumb. They really, really can't sing (painful painful),Their school looks like something out of degrassi junior high (with a marble bathroom!!), and the dance decorations are not something a highschool budget can afford. I wish that they had least made this a middle school dance, but why highschool? Both of the twins could pass for seven without the caked makeup and styled hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the coolest DVDs ever","review":"This is a very great movie and I really love it. When I saw it for the first time I was not able to remove it from the DVD player anymore. Mary-Kate and Ashley look so cute in there and the wardrobe is very nice too, especially in the end where they wear a black dress. And their four songs are very good as well. I can't understand people saying that Mary-Kate and Ashley would not be able to sing. I love these four songs, especially \\"Noyz about Boys\\". It's a pity that the movie is only 26 minutes long, but it is great anyway and I can't stop watching it. So I think that this is a must-have DVD for every MKAA fan and also for every non-MKAA fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SINGERS!","review":"OK, first of all: I can't belive the people who says that they can't sing:S They are SO good!

Instead, I found this to be his worst movie. The script is more or less completely incoherent.

I am a fan but I wish I had spent my time watching something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"Despite the fact that I'm a Dolph Lundgren fan, I hated this movie. It was hard to stay awake watching it. Boring! The movie is way too slow. In this movie he is a restaurateur with two computer experts working for him. There are two main women in the film who have a minor romantic connection with Dolph, but it fails to please, partly because these women aren't that attractive. In Dolph's films that were make before 1993 the ladies were always attractive and sexy. In this movie, all the woman are strong, but not sexy. Upon the first encounter with one of the women, she immediately starts trying to punch him. Then, there is a restaurant brawl, and of course, she beats up a man.Dolph does have some fight scenes in this movie but you have to wait a long time to get to them, and they aren't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dolph is a disgrace to his own IQ","review":"This movie is a sad attempt to do an action movie.

So I can only give it two stars.I have ordered a different and slightly more expensive (and better rated by Amazon users) power supply, (Thermaltake Power Supply 240-Pin 600 Power Supply W0388RU). I just hope it arrives before this failure of a PS dies.Best advice for prospective buyers: 1. Don't waste your time and money with this power supply. 2. Trust the Amazon reviews, They are generally spot on correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible power supply, ridiculously loud","review":"I can't believe how loud it is, and I've owned a lot of power supplies over the years (including some really cheap ones).

Good luck to the rest of you guys. Hopefully their return policy works better than the actual product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logisys PS550A-BK","review":"This product, although a reasonable price, had a very long power connector to the motherboard. This power connector cable had about 24 individual wires which were not contained inside any sheathing or wrapper. This made for a very messy install unless I personally found something to wrap these wires in to prevent them from being loose and in the way, hovering above the motherboard. It made me worry very much about the real quality of this product. If I had known about this beforehand, I would not have ordered this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 5th grade.","review":"This book is a collection of math problems.

He was using Kelp to richen the soil, Who would have thought. Tom Berringer plays the wealthy American heavy just right. Just as well as when He played Comedy Western in \\"Rustelers Rapsody\\" a belevable actor. The movie \\"The Field\\" was also belevable and outstanding. I got a renewed respect for Richard Harris as well. Yup.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Field of Sorrow and Regret","review":"This film is an excellent character study written and directed by Jim Sheridan. It is moody and brilliantly photographed. Richard Harris turns in a poignant performance as \\"Bull\\" McCabe. He's grim, stoic and stubborn yet he remains poetically sympathetic. It contains a fine score by Elmer Berstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly emotional film","review":"This is a well acted, well written, heartrending movie. What stuck me when I saw this in the theater was that as the credits were rolling not a soul moved. No one got up, no one spoke; that's how powerfully moving this film is. The first time you see it, it can take your breath away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this classic movie","review":"After visiting Ireland and the town this movie was filmed in, I had to order it. Glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well acted, but depressing","review":"The other reviews do a good job of reviewing the acting, scenery, etc. It was a good movie if you like to see the decline of a man's sanity. Mid-way through the movie, when he beats the Yank to death on a rock, I lost interest. The field was everything to the man, which I guess was the point. It was depressing and somewhat gruesome. Not my choice for a good movie. My life is hard enough, I don't need to live someone elses hard times. Thanks, but this movie wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerfully depressing and bleak","review":"With ordinary actors this movie would be depressing. With Richard Harris finding enormous, brilliant energy in his role as the doomed main character, it goes beyond depressing to being scorchingly, searingly upsetting. It's bleak, harrowing, dismal and severely gut-wrenching. If that's your kind of thing, this movie delivers it in spades, way more forcefully than the next ten downer flicks put together.I saw it on cable and walked out before the final, awful ending. My wife sat through the whole miserable story and confirmed that the ending was even heartrending than the rest of the movie.Two stars because of the acting, otherwise zero stars. Life is too short, and there are enough miserable things to deal with, that I prefer not to voluntarily subject myself to painful movies.You've been warned. I wish I had been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful film, terrible DVD","review":"I'll leave comments about the value of this movie (which I love) to other reviewers. what I want to warn buyers about is the rediculous lack of features on this DVD. There are, literally, NONE. There's not even a language menu for close captioning... it's essentially like buying a VHS tape that's been transferred to DVD. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Field of Dreams","review":"Bought this movie (based on reviews) prior to a trip to Ireland. DEPRESSING movie. It is not one that will make you want to see the Irish countryside or meet the people. (As a side note: both the Ireland and its people are lovely!) The only thing I could identify with was the hard work that went into preparing the land for cultivation by removing all of the rocks and mucking the land. The rest of the movie seemed to be poorly written fiction with \\"name\\" actors who did not measure up to their meager roles. This movie is best left in the jewel case or on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real story","review":"Although some may think that this is a \\"powerful\\" movie, I refuse to believe so. Not only was it mediocre (Tom Berenger over-acts), but it seems that many animals were harmed and drugged for this movie (got this info from a non-profit web site) . On both counts, I rate this 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Drama","review":"This is one of the finest tragedies to ever come to the screen. The story of a man's obsession and his fall from grace. Only a Richard Harris could pull this off. It surely ranks as his finest hour. This film is an undiscovered gem. How unfortunate that Pioneer's DVD release only offers the truncated aspect ratio of 1:1.33! Perhaps one day they will release a version that shows the entire \\"field\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie and story","review":"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine runs deep with this film. A long time fan of Richard Harris I feel his role in the movie was extraordinarily well performed. I found myself siding with McCabe. Seeing his dirty hands that worked the land, toiled over it, bleed into it and made it what it was. It was his from birth and then enters an American taking it away without a thought. To build something foreign on the land as well. McCabe loved the land, the American saw a profit. I was rivited from the beginning until the bitter end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introductory guide to the internet","review":"Internet for Dummies is a great start to learning the internet.

Yes, I agree, Hot Bot is a pretty good search engine...but it is not the only one out there. This book has technical incosistansies throughout and is basically a really really long advertisement. Easily the worst dummies book in print, and Im not being a jerk, I love dummies books, Ron Gilster rocks, but this is absolute crap.

The sound is a mix between pop, soul and adult contemporary. The booklet contains no lyrics and does not have a list of whom plays what. Mr Hucknall is a very accomplished singer and lyricist and shows was well met both by the critics and the public at large. In the UK the album entered at #4 and also went into top 10 in Austria and Ireland. Allmusic gave the album 4/5 and I agree with this. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad Mick \\"Stayed\\"","review":"I've waited a long time for this cd. Love the radio friendly \\"So not over you\\".

Ended up buying this so we could do some at home as well. It's a very simple set with plastic 'coins' and about 160 puzzles color coded by difficulty level. Ever since we got it, it has the family hooked on it.

This one is boring compared to Chocolate Fix, the pieces aren't as easy to manipulate, doesn't store as nice, cards aren't as easy to use. If I was buying just one, it would not be this. We have several games from Thinkfun and they are all well designed and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logical","review":"This is a good game for youngsters to help them puzzle through different scenarios.

I bought the logic links several months ago and they're still in new condition. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone older than 10.When I first bought the logic links, I asked my sister if she wanted to try them out. She said 'no' disdainfully, but after a few minutes, she was figuring out the last puzzle with great interest.I think Logic Links is great for 2 or 3 or 4 people, but also it is fine alone.

Whatever happened to the days of \\"Independence Day\\" and the like? The song \\"I Love You\\" is a trite, contrived piece of pop bubble-gum. The whole CD just indicates what is wrong with country music...its personality crisis. Mainstream country artists these days will sell their souls and record any kind of junk just so they can be accepted. If you want to record pop, please just go and do a pop album...the country-pop blend is corny and simply sounds ridiculous. Either do country or pop, Martina, not both. But she's not the only culprit....just look at Shania, Faith, and the countless other me-too country artists. I actually used to like Martina before she got claimed by that thirst for cash/record sales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Bland Bland","review":"Cutesy bland country pop, sung with earnest conviction.

It's truly awful to hear sickly sweet junk like 'I Love You'. Even harder to believe is that it took a commitee of people to write it. Just compare this to Bob Dylan's 'Just Like a Woman' and you'll realize what kind of junk is being played on the so-called soft favorites radio format. Avoid this shallow CD at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Country Enough","review":"Country Music fans are fiercely loyal to their favorite artists. I am a country music fan, but I won't blindly buy a CD just because it is put out by an artist I enjoy. I pride myself in telling it like it is. Let's face it...Martina's voice, while enjoyable, is really only average at best when compared to true country divas like Trisha Yearwood or Reba McEntire. But in the past, her songs have still been pretty good. Unfortunately, this CD sounds more like a Debbie Gibson 80's bubble gum pop album than a 90's country offering. If there's a country song on this CD, I haven't found it yet. Therefore, an average voice with little ability to convey \\"emotion\\" coupled with slightly below average songs equals a disappointing offering. The best thing about this CD is the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evolution is tough to top","review":"I know that Most Martina fans realize that Evolution is hard to top. This cd does does not have the same fire and boldness as Evolution and is missing a lot of steam. Their is a lost of passion in many songs and its clearly not a great effort. Sad to say this being a big fan of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"I AM A BIG MARTINA FAN BUT I WAS LESS THAN THRILLED WITH THIS ONE, DEFINITELY NOT HER BEST EFFORT.

While Evolution had a few different kinds of sounds not heard before, the production on Emotion is clearly crisper. The ballads \\"Goodbye,\\" \\"This Uncivil War,\\" and \\"From The Ashes\\" have arrangements that clearly set them apart. Not to mention, they have definite depth to their lyrics. While the lyrics on \\"I Love You\\" are kind of lightweight, the song has an irresistible melody. Martina sounds good beside the piano instrument of \\"There You Are,\\" and intimate, not stale lyrics help the song. \\"It's My Time\\" rocks hard, and has a definite attitude that is memorable. The whole album has a direction to it, and that should help Martina to keep developing her sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARTINA NEVER CEASES TO AMAZE!","review":"Martina McBride makes some of the finest albums around today and Emotion is no exception. It demonstrates her amazing vocal ability once again and she takes you on such an emotional ride, thus the title. My favorite songs are \\"There You Are\\", \\"It's My Time\\", \\"Love's the Only House\\" and \\"I Love You\\" which just spent a amazing 5 weeks at #1. This album proves once again why she was named this year's CMA Female Vocalist of the Year. One of the best things about Martina's albums is that she sounds just like her albums in person. Her voice is truly AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INSPIRATIONAL NO MATTER WHAT'S HAPPPENING","review":"In your life. The words in this album got me through some of the roughest times of my life, and I mean rough! After being attacked and brutally beaten just prior to 9/11. I was terrified of people and everything on the other side of my front door. I retreated from the world completely and decided this world no longer deserved me. After the attacks my doctor refused to release me back to the job which was high paying and what I like to do. I lost many friends that I had on the job. Then I lost my self esteem, lost the job, lost the friends, and almost lost my life until I listened to this album with songs like \\"Ashes\\" and I came through. God bless her and the writers on that album I know they save people, they saved me. Every song speaks to and inspires me! You won't be disappointed even if you don't like country! (which I never listened to before, other than Patsy Cline!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her weakest effort , more suitable for the pop charts","review":"Having purchased four other CDs by Martina McBride, and having been completely satisfied with them, I have to say how disappointed I am in this new effort. I am appalled at the pop overtones to this CD and the selection of tunes presented. After Evolution, which was a tremendous album, it's a let down to listen to this one. I'm sorry I spent my hard earned money on this CD and in the future am going to be more selective before I buy another one by Martina. P.S., her voice is, as usual, exhilarating and spine tingling, I just wish she had chosen her material more wisely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This cd is so good I can't even describe it.

You have to buy this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd bought something else!","review":"Like everyone else, I anxiously awaited the release of Emotion. Wish I'd listened to some of the songs on the CD before I wasted my money. Martina is one of the greatest singers of all time.

Until they start singing real country music, I'll spend my money on someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This is Martina at her best! A little pop, a little country. It's great! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The more you listen, the more you like.","review":"I have reconsidered since the first time I wrote. The more I listen to this CD (and I listen every day in my car), the more it grows on you. The tracks become songs you're humming in the grocery store and while you walk to work. It did take a while, but I gave the album a chance and now I love it. You can still find the loud powerful Martina voice if you listen (\\"Make Me Believe\\", \\"It's My Time\\") but it's more woven into the song. I'm hoping those of you that have the CD won't dismiss it right off the bat. It's a clever piece of work that you'll warm up to over a short time."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding, smart, fresh, and very modern!","review":"Martina McBride continues to improve with each album she releases.

Buy \\"Emotion\\", you will not regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is WOW!","review":"People will degrade this cd because its not typical country. So what? \\"Emotion\\" contains super catchy tunes. Yes, it sounds like pop, but it don't matter,all the songs are great! Tunes like \\"I Love You\\", \\"Loves The Only House\\", \\"Its My Time\\", and \\"Do What You Do\\" are very uplifting wheras songs like \\"This Uncivil War\\" and \\"I Ain't Going Nowhere\\" are very soulful. This cd has a great mixture of songs. Each song is musically inspiring. I highly recommend this fantastic cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Anything & Everything\\"","review":"I've never been a \\"big fan\\" of country music. I remember the first time I heard Martina Mcbride on the Radio. The song \\"That's Me\\" made me an instant fan. I still don't like country all that much. But her voice lends itself very well outside the range of country music. Each song on this album is testimony to a very great album. It has all the required elements to be a success. \\"I Love You\\", \\"anything and everything\\", and her current hit \\"Love is the only House\\" show the complexity of her vocal style. Her interpration is what sets her apart from most singers. I can only name about 5 all around singers that give everything they have to a performance. The production on this album is kind of reminicent of Celine Dion's \\"Falling Into You\\". A lot of care came into picking a \\"set\\" that really relates to its listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly entertaining","review":"Martina McBride first caught my ear on \\"I Love You\\" but I never expected Emotion to be as uptempo and light as it is. Of course, like any typical listener, I set the song I liked (the aforementioned \\"I Love You\\") on repeat so I didn't really listen to the remaining tracks until I pretty much bored myself over the song I'd been listening to. \\"Do What You Do,\\" \\"Anything, \\"Make Me Believe\\" and \\"There You Are\\" all sounded as terrific as \\"I Love You\\"--little pop-py for Country music (I'd never been a HUGE Country fan, but had a phase of Country in junior high) but still Country (a la the presence of steel guitar in almost every song). 1999's Emotion by Martina McBride surprised me with an extremely delectable combination of the perfect Country-Pop. Definitely a suggested buy for any Country fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"very emotional","review":"this record gives me goosebumps every time i put it on the sheer power of martina's voice is breathtaking and is backed up with quality songs a must for any new country fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb explanation of how the Imagineers operate","review":"This is a fascinating look into the mind of the premier Disney designers. Hench explains how every single detail of the Disney parks is designed to fit into a great whole: color, form, space, and even time must reinforce a narrative theme in every single ride or experience, as if the viewer had entered a film sequence. All detail is foreseen - with storyboards! - discussed, and built with this kind of total consistency of experience in mind. I was astounded that the parts were so much more deeply planned than I had imagined.I read this as part of my research for a writing project on Disney. For this, it was extremely useful and informative. It strikes me that the imagineering method is of great relevance to all managers.While easy to read quickly, this book will give anyone who likes Disney a fascinating new perspective on one of the great American success stories. Warmly recommended. The writing is clear and to the point, while elegant."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an incredible book","review":"WOW!!! This book is something else.

No \\"she's cheatin' on me, so I'll cry in my beer\\" type songs here. Just good, uplifting messages borne from a deep relationship with the Lord. \\"All the Fun\\" is about a man who doesn't need to find something outside of his home. \\"My Father in Me\\" is a real tribute to fatherhood. \\"Richest Man on Earth\\" helps one appreciate what we all have; and \\"Heroes\\" is a great song about the importance we all have in someone's life.

My low rating is due solely to the poor production standards of the DVD set. No digital remastering here. The grainy transfer to DVD looks every bit of twenty years old. No sound enhancements either, only a single AC3 stereo channel. Worst of all, Alastair Cooke's episode introductions, which accompanied the series when it was originally shown on Masterpiece Theatre, have been eliminated, replaced with cheap graphic images of the production company's logo.

Definitely worth the retail price! And it'd make a great gift for yourself... or for any knitter--beginning to experienced.I'll be knitting the a few of the patterns from it very soon: the fulled baby mary janes, the fulled hat, and the fulled sheep with my handspun yarns.Buy it!

The problem is that this book very poorly explains the basics. I ended up googling \\"How To Knit\\" to figure out what I was doing and became much less confused. Part of my problem is that I feel like many of the steps to get from skein to scarf are left out, because I'm always asking myself \\"But what about __.\\" I'm sure that when I become more mastered in the art of knitting I will open this book again.I also agree with another reviewer-this book is very poorly organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant cover","review":"it's a shame that the world doesn't have eyes or ears or even a pelvis of any kind. it's just rock salt and candy bars, and i'm riding the eastbound train at 40 miles per hour heading for a train going west at 60 miles per hour, and we will never collide, even though the two trains are on the same track, we will never collide, because the trains are invisible trains. i think this book is kind of like that. two invisible trains heading toward each other at an alarming rate, yet they will never collide, because god has decided that that is not something he wants to happen. cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, hilarious...","review":"I have respected James Franco as an exceptional actor since \\"Freaks and Geeks\\" and have seen almost all of his work.

I can take an occasional \\"sh..\\", \\"a..\\" but this is full of \\"fu..\\" and \\"GD\\". I wish people would consider these things when they fill out their reviews.

It has some good 80's acting with some good 80's action. Most people around this time were making films along these lines. It is a war Movie, it is Fictional but it adresses a few issues that were around for that time that were going through alot of people's minds. Movies like all of the Rambo movies and other War movies that came out in the 80's it was adressing some of the things that went on in that war. If your a Chuck Norris fan this movie is a must is has the typical things that made him Famous in films.Another thing is alot of the Negitive Reviews done here were by people who are attempting to Compare this movie and/or it's actors to others and making a judgment based on that or by people who were and are not 80's movies fans and or people who just want to bash a good movie.This movie is very enjoyable but you either hate it or you love it either way its enjoyable"},{"rating":"2","title":"soldier's captivity resolution","review":"A triple pack serviceman's effort in freeing his fellow warriors from extremists.

I only have one complain and that is the audio quality, really mono dts you have to be joking me i at least got stereo on the dvd release of this movie come on you use a 50gb blu ray disc dont tell me you couldnt even add stereo. just on the audio alone is why i rate it 2 stars. if you are a big chuck norris fan or just like missing in action i cant blame you for wanting to get this on blu ray.

These new series are really well done though there is a hint of The New Batman-Superman Adventures style. Overall, quite well done. The new versions of Sabretooth and Wolverine is better although there are some disappointing things such as Toad's strange and scrawny body. It doesn't look like his figure was supposed to be adapted from any place, nor comic or movie. Magneto's boundaries are better at some levels and worse than others. But the fresh plot always wants you to view it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quicksilver fans Buy this item!","review":"This cassette features three episodes of the first series ofX-Men Evolution.These episodes introduce important characters of good and bad nature.They introduce THE BLOB,QUICKSILVER and SPYKE even though in series three Spyke isn't a main character.It's best to buy or watch UnXpected Changes first if you don't get the storyline.UnXpected Changes is the first part of Series 1.Xplosive Days is the second part.X marks the Spot is the third partBut you'll have to pre-order the final part out in September 2003.This video isn't as good as some of the episodes in Series 3 but they are a good way to introduce main character.So I believe this is one wicked video.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative and different","review":"I've been an X-Men fan since I was 14 years old.

He'll have u laughing silly with his jokes & I was surprised to see the stunts that he pulled off along with his sidecick Breckin Meyer (undercover hacker). My only letdown was Vivica Fox's role. She wasn't bad for an FBI agent, but the FBI presence had almost no purpose to the film, I'd rather she her going to oil rig herself.For a low-budget movie, I'd say \\"Blast\\" was pretty well done. The storyline (though creatively laced with enough unexpected scenarios to keep u guessing what's happening next) had a few holes left to be desired. Watch this only when u have spare time. It's a good action thriller to watch. Oh! Look out for Shaggy (reggae recording artist)...not bad for a movie debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blast not much of a blast.","review":"The movie is quite mediocre, but not as bad as you may think. The casting of Eddie Griffin as a tough action guy is ridiculous, to say the least. But the reason I bought this dvd is because Nadine Velazquez is so hot! She plays a villain, is incredibly flexible and does some great martial arts kicks. I hope she will be in other movies as the baddie, but in a much bigger, sexier, and action packed role.

However, for a Benford/Niven fan like myself, it is just awful. The main premise is implausible, the technology, both human and alien, does not even pretend to follow any kind of physics, and the plot is utterly predictable. Moreover, while 1940's SF characters lacked any personality - the intended audience, male teenagers, did not need it, - all \\"The Black Sun\\" characters have ridiculously exaggerated personality traits, as if the author used to the original model were trying to overcompensate. Not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Williamson's more forgettable works.","review":"I wanted to like this one, because Jack Williamson has always been one of my favourites. Alas, he has presented us with a rambling, disjointed tale, populated by characters that are more suited to grade-school space opera fantasies. He has no respect for the readers' intelligence, and feels that he has to exagerrate every character trait to make sure we know who the good guys and bad guys are.The story drags when it should move, and leaps over important parts with little more than a flat statement that something happened. Subplots are left entirely unresolved and uncommented on, leaving the reader wondering why they were mentioned at all.All in all, not one of Williamson's best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, predictable, and wordy.","review":"My first Williamson story; I was not impressed.

I was truly with the passengers on the wavecraft waiting for lift off from earth. I could feel the tension of not knowing where you will end up. There were a couple of empty spots that left me wondering what was going on. Exactly how many people were on this ship? Only a few were described to us. There really seemed to be problem after problem for these traveling earthlings. One thing that seemed to be far fetched was that they sure had a never ending supply of food. I didn't want the poor people to starve but it would have added to the drama a little bit if they had that to worry about. For the most part the story was really entertaining. I liked the whole idea of not knowing where you will end up and what would you do when you got there. It kept me turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This little book is an excellent companion to all of Tolkien's books about Middle Earth. I found that Purtill's insights -- informed by his Catholic faith -- were fresh and illuminated the Catholicity of Tolkien's work.

The book was a quick and easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried To Like It","review":"I really did. I've heard so many good things about this book, so I went out and bought it. I loved the idea of it. I thought it romantic that a young man would go in search of a fallen star for the woman he loves. But the woman he loves is so obviously disinterested in him, I had to wonder why he even bothered. There were a couple times in the book I wanted to just forget it, but I forged ahead hoping it would get better. I'm sorry to say, for me at least, it didn't get better. Tristan and the star were the most interesting aspects of the book, but it wasn't enough for me. And the ending was so...blah. I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't read it, but I expected more of a reaction out of Tristan at the end regarding Veronica...Victoria? I've already forgotten her name. It just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I wasted my time.","review":"Neil Gaiman wrote a fairy tale in a fairy tale vernacular, a huge deviation from other works (that I actually enjoyed) like American Gods and Neverwhere and even the Sandman comic series. I realize it's probably a typical fairy tale, but I can't help comparing it with the likes of Tad Williams and Gregory Maguire and Gaiman's other books. This one was written as though it was for small children (and then you get a sex scene and once a well-placed four-letter word, which were both just weird). It was as episodic as The Wizard of Oz, and the coincidences were so unbelievable that they had me rolling my eyes in places. Gaiman is usually a creative genius. What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighter than air","review":"Neil Gaiman is a wonderful writer and when I picked up Stardust and read the first few pages I was prepared to be enchanted. Unfortunately, the spell never quite took. There is so much to like about Stardust - the basic premise, the main characters, the descriptions both of the human town of Wall and the faery land of Faery. But for all its plots and subplots the story has no depth. It's like only being able to dip your toe into the pool on a hot day when you really want to dive in. As another reviewer here points out, everytime we appear to reach a crisis Gaiman gives the character an \\"easy out\\" and there's never any real denouement. Stars may be able to survive without substance, good stories can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's something missing here","review":"Stardust is one of the most remarkable books I have ever read. But this edition is sadly lacking because somehow, another publisher purchased the text only from Time Warner without the Vess illustrations. If you read this edition you will sadly miss much of the beauty of this book. By the way, this book was originally published as a comic book by Vess and Gaiman. Don't let this text only version fool you. You'll miss out on the beauty of Gaiman's prose as seen through the eyes of Charles Vess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wnderful Book.","review":"Really, really enjoyed this book. I saw the movie based on the book first and enjoyed it enough to want to read the book. Although there are some differences between the movie and the book, both are excellent. In fact, some parts of the movie that expanded on the book were so well done that I wish they had been in the book. My biggest disappontment is that Gaiman never wrote more stories using the world he created in \\"Stardust\\". Fascinating world with wonderful characters. Would also love to see a well-done series based on \\"Stardust\\". I higly recommend both the book and the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting...but awesome just the same","review":"I saw the Stardust movie long before I ever read the book. When I first saw the movie I didn't even realize that it was a book until I saw the credits. I decided that I wanted to read the book and see what Neil Gaiman had originally written. I must say I was very pleased with the book even more than I enjoyed the movie. It explained things better and made things a lot clearer than the movie.

I had a lot of fun reading this one. I bought it a while after reading NEVERWHERE (another odd fantasy that I had to read in one sitting). I couldn't put it down!

Maybe it's because I fell in love with the movie many times before reading the novel, but I just felt that the book was rather... odd. And not in a good way, like the movie is odd. Also, the ending is abrupt and anti-climactic, although I won't give any specific spoiler details.If you're a fan of Neil Gaiman, you might enjoy this book, but i really would recommend seeing it portrayed in film. They took a mediocre book and made it incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the movie...","review":"This is the first time I've ever been disappointed in reading a book after seeing a movie.

I found the characters in the movie much more interesting where as in the book they were fairly one dimensional.Overall, rent the movie and skip the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been a great YA book","review":"This was a fun, quick read with a pretty original story. If he hadn't have put the sex scene and some of the gore in, though, it would have been a perfect YA book.

Also the storylines for the characters are unpredictable to the point that the end to me was a huge surprise. Definetely among Gaiman's best, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanciful light reading =)","review":"This book is a great one for quick, fun reading. Gaiman's style here comes almost as very fairy-tale-esque, and at times this almost reads like a children's story (though Gaiman is quick to remind us that it is not). The writing in this story is very simple and straight-forward... Gaiman doesn't use a whole lot of flowery language, so this book isn't difficult to read in the slightest (but the plot of the story is enough to keep advanced readers interested as well).It's accessible enough to be enjoyable to teenagers and adults alike. I wouldn't recommend it for children younger than about 13 because there are brief instances of cursing and some suggestive content (nothing explicit, but still). But for anyone of teenage years and above it is a delightful and imaginative read. It was the first book by Neil Gaiman that I've had the pleasure of reading and I definitely look forward to experiencing more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, faeries and a plot that makes sense","review":"There are a lot of faerie stories out there, and most of them rely on hoary conventions, coincidence, or random magic to get from start to finish. Plot coherence is usually the first casualty of the effort.Well, this is the most entertaining, coherent, satisfying, \\"tie-up-all-the-loose-ends\\", alls-well-that-ends-well, adventure story that I've ever read in the genre. Humor, romance, excitement, multiple plot threads and sub-plots, engaging characters, and not a hint of the twee or precious.I like everything that Gaiman, (in his own words), \\"makes up and writes down\\", but this particular effort should appeal to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is the fourth book that I have read from Neil Gaiman.

The description of Tristran's conception was inappropriate and the intimate detail was not a necessary part of the story line. Also this is an almost singular case of watching the movie before reading the book, and 99% the book is always better, sadly this is not the case with this book. In my opinion, most of the changes made for the movie would have greatly enhanced the book. I'm not going to go into an depth review as there are numerous others that have already done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DIGITAL EDITION.","review":"Awaiting feedback on really terrible formatting errors in the Kindle edition (as in, it's currently unreadable). Will update if anything changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh approach to a classic genre","review":"Don't miss this one. Gaiman's writing effectively captures the style of the time covered, with great wordplay, humor and heart. It's a short, decidedly adult fairy tale, with rich, earthy characters and a plot that splits and turns and only gets better as it rolls along. The myriad ends are tied into a nice, tight bow by the final pages. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this Book!","review":"I was given this book by a friend who introduced me to Gaiman's work in a book swap (I gave him a book I loved, he gave me a book he loved).I had expected it to be miserable and dark and suffering and full of too much \\"angst\\" for me. Instead, it was beautiful, creative, and very funny.I have made a specific effort to avoid Neil Gaimon because of all the \\"hype\\" around Sandman.

This is both a plus and a minus in my mind. I truly enjoy the worlds that Gaiman creates and, with this the third book of his I've read, can consider myself a fan. Stardust doesn't fail in that regard as I was happily drawn in to the sometimes silly, sometimes scary, world which our hero must inhabit in order to retrieve a fallen star for his true love.Simply put, the biggest problem I had with this book was that I wanted more. I wanted deeper character stories and more history and a longer plot. I felt like I was only allowed to dip my toes into a cool stream when, after some initial toe dipping, what I really wanted to do was strip naked, dive in, and swim and swim and swim in said cool stream. But all you get is the toe dip, and that is to be regretted and enjoyed at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book of true beauty suitable for Lord Dunsany","review":"If you are weary of violent, negative punk fantasy/sci fi and long for a book of wit, grace and breath-taking beauty, \\"Stardust\\" is the book for you.Gaiman's perfect book has the charm of Lord Dunsany's best. An adult fairy tale - be careful reading it to the kids! The changeling hero is sent on a fool's errand to Faery to retrieve a fallen star in hopes of giving it to the girl of his dreams and making her his wife.

The premise of the book was so wonderful, and I had hoped that it would follow the lines of Gaiman's other work in Faerie. However, I missed the menace of Faerie, as though Gaiman didn't want to touch that dark side of the myth.

I hope Gaiman is with us for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I loved Good Omens and REALLY loved Neverwhere so when Neil Gaimans newest novel came out, of course I had to buy it.

The simple fact of the matter is that Neil Gaiman and I are *never* on the same page, no matter what book I have open._Stardust_ is okay. It's a quick yarn, got some cute references to fairy tales, and the occasional decent pun. But there's nothing remarkable upon it. No actually interesting characters or situations or turns of phrase. It's forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"High up in the sky the little stars climb.","review":"You may have seen commercials for a movie called Stardust that opened today, August 10, 2007. Well, before it was a movie, it was a book published by DC Comics' Vertigo imprint. Despite the fact that it is published by DC Comics, it is not actually a comic book. It is in fact an illustrated fairy tale for adults. It has sex, high adventure, low comedy and, most of all, a sense of wonder. Neil Gaiman has written a fantastic (in every sense of the word) story, and Charles Vess' illustrations (many of them painted) compliment the tale perfectly. Any fan of the fantasy genre is sure to enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia for Adults","review":"If you have ever pulled your tattered copies of C.S. Lewis' Narnia Chronicles from their space on the shelf as an adult, you will definately enjoy this book. Not as innocent as Narnia, Stardust nevertheless conjures delightful tale of a young man's journey through Faery to lay claim to a fallen star. Interesting characters abound in this tale-- drawing the reader deeper into the twilight world of Faery as their tales are woven into the rich fabric of the world beyond Wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exquisite little package","review":"Like a miniature Faberge egg, this glittering little gem contains all the right pieces in a beautifully-assembled package. Tropes, characters, and situations from the gamut of legend and fairytale populate its pages, and the familiarity of these elements gives the reader a little thrill of discovery each time they appear. And like any good fairytale, it offers a \\"happily every after\\" ending... but with a bittersweet epilogue.This book was marvelous fun to read, drawing on a rich canon of fantastical literature. And as always, Gaiman's deceptively simple, inimitably gorgeous prose leaves the reader breathless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fav Book!","review":"Stardust is a book everyone should own and read. Kids, adults, everyone! It's magical and fun :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stardust","review":"Stardust is much different than other books by Gaiman I read. It's much more lightweight and prefect both for bigger kids and adults. Its a very cute story of a boy, who wanting to marry a girl from his village promises to do anything fr her to say yes. It turns out she wants him to get a star that they saw falling and shortly after that Tristran leaves his family and sets out on a long journey to find that fallen star."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quaint Fairy Tale","review":"Stardust is an enjoyable light read that has all the fantastical elements of some of Gaiman's Sandman work.

The book story is very well conducted but final part where the rhythm is very accelerating what disaccord the previous chapters. For example, the meet between Tristan and his real mother is faded and emotionless. On the other hand, the book was written masterfully by Neil Gaiman. The each book word was chosen precisely and magnificently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very entertaining.","review":"This was a very well written book. It was a little odd at times, but very entertaining. I have to admit that the movie was better though. Go see the movie after reading this book. You will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stardust","review":"Stardust, by Neil Gaiman, is a tremendously fun and well written fairy tale. This is a fun book with a story featuring witches, poison, betrayals, magic, romance, and a lot of fun. This is a very enjoyable read by a gifted author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Much Glitter in this Star","review":"I like Gaiman's books...usually. This one was very disappointing. A mishmash of old generic plot lines for fairytales and not too well put together. And, if written for children (as for the most part it seems to be), please tell me why there are such explicit sex scenes in this book!This is a Gaiman book to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book","review":"When I finished reading this book, I felt that I had wasted a few hours of my life. The characters are not developed at all. The story barely exists. There are so many positive reviews of this book that this will probably not affect anyone's decision, but I like virtually any good fantasy story. This book just does not have a story or interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"$150 for a $25 book with a slipcase and signature?","review":"Just canceled this order, so I didn't actually get this book...but my fears were true that this version is nothing more than the regular Gift Edition with a slipcase, signature and limited numbered. Probably worth $50 as a collector but not $150. Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"If What You Want Is To Go Hollywood, Then Don't Write Books","review":"I've now read three Neil Gaiman books, brought on by the fanaticism of some friends of mine who are fans of his.It's clear that what this fellow really wants to do is to be a movie producer, and each one of these books that I've read sounds like it has been the product of a Hollywood pitch meeting, like something out of The Producer.If I ever see Neil Gaiman's screen credit on \\"The Graduate: Part Two\\", I'll be sure to look for it when it comes on HBO. In the meantime, I'd rather read books that were written to be books, and comics that were written to be comics, and not second-rate attempts to make another medium do things it can't do very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"This is my first book by this author, and I honestly feel like I might like the story after-the-fact, if the author didn't ruin all the punchlines in the book. The fact that he felt the need to explain away every twist in the plot made me feel like I was being beat over the head with a \\"Did you get it?\\" stick. I also thought he was over-doing the fairytale theme, with the swirly chapter pages and obligatory detail that had zero quirks."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR YOUNG READERS","review":"NOT FOR YOUNG READERS!All parents are strongly urged to physically go to a book store and READ PAGES 27 AND 28, right then and there, before purchasing this book for a child.This fairy story is marketed as \\"HarperTeen,\\" and my child bought it from the Young Readers section at Powell's. There was no warning, either from the product information nor from the thorough flip-through we did in the store, that the book contained a soft-core sex scene; which my child therefore ended up reading, and found confusing and upsetting.I strongly urge the publisher and vendors to reconsider their marketing of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring fluff","review":"I read Neverwhere and loved it. It's on my list of favorite books and looked forward to Stardust. What a disappointment. It's all fluff and no body. The characters were boring and I didn't really care what happened to them. I read halfway through the book and put it away. I enjoy fantasy but this was sad. It's as if he tried to write A Princess Bride but fell far short. Write a continuation of Neverwhere and please don't try to do a fairytale again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should not be marketed to Young Adults.","review":"I really did enjoy this book, but I am disgusted that it is being marketed as a Young Adult novel. There are two very erotic scenes, and one use of the \\"F\\" word. I don't even think the \\"F\\" word was being used during Dickens' time. Shame on you Mr. Gaiman for marketing smut to children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful","review":"The story grabbed me and didn't let go until the end. Gaiman is truly a master of his craft. I'd recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling traditional fairy tale.","review":"I had read Neverwhere a few months ago, by recommendation by a friend from almost a year ago, I found it to be one of the greatest story's I had ever read, full of lively characters that you can feel for. Stardust, I found, seemed to mildly lack the characterization that Neverwhere did, but was none the less a great story.Where as Neverwhere creates a almost moody gothic feel, Stardust is farely uplifting in a whimsical fantasy fashion. All my praises go to Neil Gaiman. He is a master of story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaiman is a natural storyteller","review":"I saw the movie before I read the book, not my usual order of operations. Loved the movie and the book was perfect. Some story lines were updated for a theatrical delight in order to tell a smoother story in the timeframe, but the book on its own is a stand alone winner. Cuddle up and read it under the blankets with a flashlight and you are sure to enjoy the adventures of Tristran over the Wall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"This book was just adorable. I read it with fascination. It tells the story of a young man who grows into a Dad who has a son who goes off to find his destiny in the Faerie Lands. So fun and fresh and innocent. A greast book for ALL ages, young and old will love the enchanting qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Land of Dreams","review":"The wonderful thing about Neil Gaiman is how he can work in the world of faery without overly softening the sharp edges or glossing over the dark parts. His land beyond the wall is not only the home of flowers made of crystal and little people, it's the place on the edge of the map where the monsters dwell.Tristan Thorn is an excellent hero in the classic mode-- belonging neither in one world or the other, he does his best to navigate through both. Although I have to admit to a certain disappointment that we didn't see a direct follow-up to Neverwhere, this is a very strong and very entertaining book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious Magic","review":"More innocent than some of Gaiman's other works, Stardust is mysterious, earthy, and magical: a true fairy tale, and a lovely one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait","review":"It seems to me that Neil Gaiman is simply using writing as a stepping stone to his real interest which is movies and lunch at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills. Nauseating, especially after seeing Princess Monotony."},{"rating":"1","title":"plodding","review":"I'm sorry but I fail to see what these five star reviews are about.

AT ALL.","review":"\\"Stardust\\" was just about the worst book i have ever read.It's extremely boring, and some parts are very inappropriate for little kids.The first chapter was pointless and too long (30-something pages) and had bits of fluff that were not important. Every chapter is 20 pages or more. I stopped reading it by chapter 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure.","review":"There are only so many things to say about this book. It is a trivial little story about nothing. Though it may have some value as a multi-part comic book, it has no value as a true book. Having read most of Gaiman's works (Neverwhere, Sandmans [as the came out, mind you, not one of those who came later and thought they were in on it], his short fictions in multiple collections, etc.), I was looking forward to reading this book, which I had passed over when it came out (annoyed by the many reprintings of Sandman). But finally monthes ago I got to it and it was wretched. There is nothing good about this book, no nothing at all. It is a childish pulp book. Though it may be better than that fool Harry Potter and Oprah's book club, it is not good for Neil Gaiman."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have no idea what they are saying......","review":"I have no idea what they are saying.

I thought Harry Potter was bad, this is untranslatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAST OF TIME READING THIS BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK WAS SO BORING I DIDN'T EVEN FINISH IT, WAS A WAST OF TIME AND MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"All of his works are trash, not just this alone.","review":"Neil Gaiman is certainly talented in a WRONG WAY. He just doesn't know what real fantasy is. And, if he doesn't know the right words to say about something, he'd better keep mum than use wrong words to defile true beauty of life. Tell him to come back when he is good enough.Michael Lloyd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful escapist fun","review":"_Stardust_, an original fairy tale by Neil Gaiman, is filled with enchantment, wonder, and a splash of humor. Tristran Thorn, who doesn't know he's half-faery, sets out to find a fallen star in the hopes of winning the hand of the lovely but icy Victoria. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, the star fell into Faerie, and so that's where he has to go. But what if a powerful witch and three feuding heirs to the throne of Stormhold are all looking for it too, for their own reasons? And what if the star has a mind of her own? Much complication follows. The basic plot is so familiar-feeling that it isn't hard to predict the ending--it feels just like an old hearth-tale passed down through generations--and yet it is utterly original and full of surprises.(Note to Tori Amos fans: Tori has a brief cameo in _Stardust_; I didn't figure it out until I read the acknowledgements at the end. But now that line in \\"Horses\\" makes so much more sense...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get better than this!","review":"It's an adult faerie tale, by one of the best writers of this (in my opinion, this or any!) generation. The imagery, as always, is astonishingly good, the characterizations are realistic without bogging you down... Gaiman is just the best there is, my friends. Have at you, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our reviewer gave this a B+, which is like 4 1/2 stars!","review":"Mr. Gaiman read our review of STARDUST and commented on it in a St. Louis newspaper. As a result of that, I read GOOD OMENS and NEVERWHERE and conducted a very interesting interview with him at All About Romance at http://www.likesbooks.comThis is an incredibly talented author w/very interesting things to say. Our reviewer for STARDUST is one tough cookie, and her grade of a B+ was heartfelt. She and I both agree that Neil Gaiman's imagination is exquisite.As our review says, if you read STARDUST, \\"your inner child will thank you.\\"TTFN, Laurie Likes Books"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"I loved this book so much.

There are too many books like that out there today and it was refreshing to read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"No maps! No glossaries! No orc wars!","review":"Gaiman takes the ingredients of epic fantasy, mixes them together, and comes up with this intimate fairy tale for all ages. At turns funny, heartwarming, and thrilling, Gaiman proves that you don't need a series of phone-book sized novels or a cast of thousands (each with their own unpronounceable name) to tell a gripping tale of the fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"I read this book after watching the movie and being disappointed by it. It was strange, the movie had a great plot and a ton of potential but just kind of fell flat. As a long time member of 'the book was better' club I decided that the movie makers must have mangled it and got the book. The book was not better.This was my first Gaiman book, but since I had heard good things I entered with high expectations. I remember plots. I remember characters. I remember little bits of trivia that others forget. I wish I could give you a detailed review describing specifically where this book went wrong, but for the life of me I cannot remember. I do remember feeling like I was waiting for the story to pick up and take off right up until the book ended in its blah-like fashion. Gaiman managed to take what had the potential to be a great story and turned it into a chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, sweet fairytale","review":"A surprisingly romantic fantasy from Gaiman. A good read for those who want a heroic journey through fairyland."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! - a rare treasure of a novel","review":"This is an absolutely amazing novel. It isn't often that you come across a novel such as this one. The descriptions are magnificient and you are just swept away in the story until the last page is turned and you must leave the characters behind. The story has many thread ravels that are unleashed throughout the tale which keeps you guessing up to the last chapter. I can't say enough about this except that it isn't everyday you find a novel as wonderful as this one. It is about a hero, Tristran, who leaves his home in the town of wall and sets off to find the Star(who turns out to be a girl). There are many others who are also after the Star, which Tristran must keep her safe from. If you love romanace, fantasy/fairy tales, magic, and good vs evil, you will love this novel! If your looking for another book to read with this one tryThe North Kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful writing, fun story","review":"I listened to this book as an audible.com download, and it was gorgeous. Neil Gaiman narrates as well as he writes. The voices and tone are perfect. Stardust is a fairytale for adults. The village of Wall sits on the edge of Faerie, and every 9 years there is a fairy market on the border. One day a boy from the village vows to get a fallen star to win his true love's favor. Problem: the star fell on the far side of the wall. There are airships and evil witches and cat girls and talking badgers. What's not to like? In the audible version, there's also an interesting interview with Neil Gaiman at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"George McDonald Would Love This","review":"Absolutely amazing grasp and understanding of the 19th century fairy tale style.

It does have a bit of an adult theme so I would rate it PG 13 depending on the child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Gaiman Fairy Tale for Grown-Ups","review":"Neil Gaiman's forte seems to be writing excellent fairy tale worlds for grown-ups. \\"Stardust\\" is another example of that. Once again he's used wonderful writing to produce a world, story and characters that are truly enjoyable. It's especially interesting how he manages to keep a fairy tale \\"feel\\" to the story while making it for adults. I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"lackluster end","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I give Gaiman props for originality and great technical writing, but other than that the book I felt was just eh.

The end for anyone with a keen eye was incredibly predictable and incredibly anti-climactic.

He shaped a generation in ways that may not be fully understood yet or ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"He can't play guitar Stef?","review":"Having saw Frank play live many times, especially in the 70's around Halloween time in Boston at the Music Hall, this dvd paints a good picture of his shows at that time. Having also seen Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Robin Trower, Dickey Betts, Gary Rossington, Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana among many others, to hear someone say that Frank Zappa could not play guitar very well is actually pretty funny. Anyone that would say that (forget all the crazy non guitar stuff)about FZ must also think that about the names I listed above.

Sure, everyone can find 15 minutes or so that they might have cut. Just keep in mind that this is the unedited version. As with much of Zappa's material, both musical and visual, the more familiar you are with his work, the more each piece makes sense. Accordingly, this probably is not the best place to introduce yourself to Zappa. As for the quality of the DVD itself, it sounds and looks great to me, though the volume seemed to be a bit low.So, someone in Genoa, Italy doesn't like it?

At least they value the lives of their children more than the civil rights of a sex offender. I agree with the reviewer who said the self-righteousness of the characters was laughable. It truly was.

Do not watch this with little children, for they will find some scenes and content quite disturbing (as I did and I'm in my thirties!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb film until the ending","review":"The acting here is superb throughout, with Winslet the standout in a stellar cast. The human drama keeps you hooked all the way. The ending, though, is a bit of a cheat. You spend most of the film wondering if these two people will run away together. When they finally decide to do so, their plans are undone by basically random events. True, that happens a lot in real life, but in films you like a little more resolution. You never know if they would have gone through with their plans or how it might have worked out. It's still a film very much worth seeing, though, and the Oscar buzz about Winslet's best-ever performance is justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Performances for Entire Cast","review":"This movie was not highly publicized and not even shown at cinemas in my town and that is a shame because this was such a compelling story with excellent performances by the entire cast. Kate Winslet is always amazing and Patrick Wilson played the part of the underachieving husband to a tee. Jackie Earl Haley was perfect and so deserved the supporting actor nomination."},{"rating":"2","title":"little children","review":"the film shows the frustrating life of suburban families and their struggle to cope with -and yearning for - new challenges; but the ending is a deception..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I saw this movie on Hbo and I really liked it. You think something is going to happen but then it surprises you by doing something different. I was surprised at how much I liked it. the movie was over 2 hours but it didn't seem like. it moves really fast with no dead space.I would recommend watching this movie. its really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally Flawed","review":"I rather enjoyed this movie both times I have seen it, but there is one gaping flaw in the story which totally spoils it for me. Supposedly these two characters carry on an affair, while their pre-school children play together -- yet neither cuckolded spouse finds out from the children? Obviously the scriptwriter (and original novelist?) never had children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Top 10 of 2006? Probably not. I think alot of critics should be a little embarrassed about that. But then again crash won an oscar two years ago soooo. Recommended. A great theme. A nice comparison with MAdame Bovary which is a favorite of mine. This thing had promise until that guy cut his wanker off. Actually it was headed downhill before that but.. A very chilling scene with the guy from the Bad News Bears and all those miniature dolls. Almost as chilling as the stadning ovation KAte gave handsome football man when he scored a TD. A lame \\"Crash\\" like ending which was annoying at best. Kate Winslet makes this one. She can destroy you with her facial expression. I love her so much I sat through \\"The Holiday\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Unfortunately not at all a good movie with poor dialog, no spice or chemistry between the characters.I like Kate as an actress but this role should not be part of her career.Very disappointed for the time wasted overall"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic Perspective","review":"This movie at first glance is just like others in the category of self-destructive inter-personal relationships. However, upon closer examination this movie offers realistically portrayed insights into seemingly dead end relationships. The two main players experience different frustrations with their respective relationships and fill each other's voids while living in a self-constructed fantasy world. The poignant bookclub discussion of the classic novel Madame Bovary pits two very different points of views against each other, much like the reactions of the viewers to this well directed, and extremely well cast movie. Perspective in this movie is everything and is further enhanced by the nature documentary style narrative. This movie has quickly become one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Both shallow and overwrought","review":"Kate Winslet's performance is nuanced and well done, but it's wasted in this dark, ill-conceived mess of a movie. The cloying tone of the male narrator reminds one of the female narrator of that waste-of-time tv series set on Wisteria Lane, another suburban enclave.This production manages to be shallow, annoying, and overwrought to the point of often seeming comic, although the sequence of events grows increasingly violent. This director desperately needs to find some better, less cliched ideas to make a plot worthy of watching. A woman bored in suburbia? A man feeling emasculated by a capable wife who is the family breadwinner? A cop with \\"post-traumatic stress syndrome\\"? The movie strikes one as a paint-by-number creation, and an extremely sloppy one, at that. It ranks as the worst film I have seen in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"As a big Patrick Wilson fan, this was a must have. It is a great movie, based upon a wonderful book. The book is simular so read it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah: worst mother of all time!","review":"Beyond the fact that I couldn't stand this long, disjointed, predictable, self-important \\"film\\", I was utterly appalled at Sarah's (Kate Winslet) \\"mothering\\" skills! Here's some stuff she did that stands out:- First of all, she kissed the \\"prom king\\" right in front of the kid. Bad move. Especially when you're married to the kid's father!- She had an affair in the basement while the kid was sleeping upstairs. Not cool.- She left the kid with a sitter overnight just to sneak around with the \\"prom king.\\"and here's my favorite one...- She LEFT HER KID IN A PARK SWING LATE AT NIGHT BY HERSELF WITH A PEDOPHILE ON THE LOOSE!And we're supposed to feel sympathy for this character?"},{"rating":"1","title":"train wreck","review":"I couldn't stop watching, waiting to see where everything tied in, only to be let down.

Sorry - I just didn't see the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"A revelation...","review":"I just finished reading this and am truly stunned. I haven't encountered a book this good in far too long. Ferocious writing, luminous characters, and the ending...

An interesting take on how such a thing could effect the economics and culture of interplanetary civilizations. An excellent platform for a story of mystery and intrigue, and surprisingly full of action and plot depth given the limited 230 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading to understand modern SCIFI","review":"I read this book because of the many raves it has gotten from friends. I liked it, but did not love it the way many other readers do. However, Bester's work is an integral step in the creation of modern sci fi. In many ways his work prefigures great works like Hyperion and Diamond Age. People who love the genre should take the time to read his work, just so they can understand the juncture between the old masters (Asimov, Clarke, etc) and the moderns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book 40 years ago and still recall it vividly!","review":"Now as I think about the book up comes the \\"poem\\" after all this time has passed:Gully Foyle is my name, Terra is my nation, Deep space is my dwelling place, The stars my destination!I read the book while a sophmore in high school. I liked it so much and didn't quite understand it that I read it a second time--quite a rare event.Later on in college while reading James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN, to my distress, I discovered that Bester had pinched his poem from Joyce. Thus perhaps this brief review will stimulate someone to read both excellent works and see what I am talking about. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book with multiple messages!!!","review":"An excellent book that will inspire the reader to pursue his/her dreams whatever they may be. The main message to be learned is that a person must never give up even if everything seems hopeless. Throughout this book the main character (Gully Foyle) teaches us that the impossible can become possible. Jaunting (teleportation) is a good twist to the story. Wish I could do that - LOL.Foyle labeled as a person with absolutely no intelligence is left to die in the middle of space, but revenge and hatred keep him alive. Foyle eventually becomes the most wanted criminal. However, as he approaches his evil objective he gets caught between hatred and love. What a dilemma!?!?One of my favorite quotes from this book is \\"There's got to be more to life than just living.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book: HORRID kindle editing!","review":"This is, of course, one of the absolute classics in science fiction ... too bad that this kindle edition makes the book almost unreadable. None of the special characters, poor paragraph formatting and numerous typos and missing quote marks throughout the text will ruin the book for anyone who is trying to capture the great sci-fi retelling of the count of monte cristo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like plot, like protagonist.","review":"I'm not one to chastise a story for being outdated. And I have to admit, this particular book does reflect its years with dignity in a conceptual context. Unfortunately, the plot never really ascends to its full potential. Like its hero in the beginning, the book is a well of possibilities with no purpose to drive it to greatness. Also, inconsistencies and non-researched science (the light side of the moon always faces the sun...there is no 14-day swap in light and darkness) hamper the story to anyone who can recall the last few pages or who's spent ten seconds in a high-school physics class. Morally, the book runs a tad preachy (don't abandon faith for it shall set you free) and ideologically it never really takes off. Recommendation: read Welles...fat dead men are always a kick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"\\"The Demolished Man\\" and some of Bester's short fiction were brilliant. This one is not. A confusing hodgepodge of ideas that never ring true, \\"The Stars My Destination\\" illustrates what happens when a talented author becomes overly self-indulgent and neglects the requirement of a soundly plotted, clearly written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gully Foyle rocks!!!","review":"\\"The Stars My Destination\\" is one of my \\"best books of all times\\" favorites. I read it first so many years ago, loaned it to someone and never got it back. Read it again from the public library (I wanted to steal that book!). Gully Foyle is a complex character who has to learn to overcome himself, and does. I was fascinated by the idea of \\"jaunting,\\" and still am. As I re-read the book (finally, finally obtained from Amazon.com), and was re-introduced to all the characters, I remembered why I had looked for it in used book stores and libraries in every town i lived in. Alfred Bester is an all-time favorite author of mine, and in my estimation \\"The Stars My Destination\\" is his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"stars my destination","review":"i have loved this book for many years, now. currently reading it to my best friend. i feel that now movie making has advanced to the stage where they can do justice to mr. besters imagination with this work of art. many ideas of his are just now coming true in our society. please enjoy one of the best books i have ever read! john"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty, but appropriately","review":"Gully is inspired by a desire for revenge. I have a hard time understanding that, but it's apparently a guy thing.Having accepted that motivation, one can enjoy the story on its own merits. There are enough plot twists and unexpected developments to satisfy someone who is partial to mysteries, and enough technology and spacefaring to satisfy someone partial to science fiction.However, there is one \\"technology\\" that is hard to swallow, namely the method of travel which is apparently entirely mental, and which makes me think perhaps J.K. Rowling read this book at some point in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Htich your wagon...","review":"This, quite frankly, is my favorite sci-fi book. Alfred Bester is the hidden genius of sci-fi, overshadowed by the amiable popularity of Heinlein and the visions of Asimov.What Bester does in this and to a lesser extent in the Demolished Man is take a hero and stretch him into an unrecognizable, almost Heathcliffesque proportion. But in that stretch the hero (now anti-hero) is believable and human. Bester is different from his contemporaries (and not at all like his supposed 'heirs' in cyberpunk, but that's a different story) because he uses human emotion as his template, not human sociological patterns, though this is a pattern in his stories. Overall, Bester is by far my favorite speculative author, because he is not afraid to do weird things but also not afraid to make a rapist and vengeful man into a hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE","review":"If you enjoyed the Demolished Man you'll love this. If you hate science fiction you'll love this. This is one of the best books that I have ever read, if you do not read it you are depriving yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful, and it got worse.","review":"As a fifth grade teacher, I would have given a D to a 10 year old if they wrote this. No descriptions. No characterization. No sense of setting. Plot jumps (jauntes?)around like crazy. No sense of connection to anything or anyone. The dialogue was absolutely choppy and lame! I read the whole thing only because I can't stand to leave things unfinished. I only wish the author had felt the same. Honestly, this was one of the worse things I have ever read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate it lower I would have","review":"WARNING! This book contains some of the most graphic description of senseless brutal rape I have ever read in science fiction. I can not believe that this has received so many rave reviews. It must have gotten MUCH better at the end because I could not finish it. It was worse than Stephen R Donaldson's horrible Gap into Conflict book. I loved Demolished Man. I was extremely disappointed in this book. I can't imagine why The Stars My Destination was chosen to be on the list of all time classics. I have read all but 2 of the rest of the books on the list and they are great. This is pure trash. Demolished Man should have been on the list instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work from a SF master","review":"This was written 42 years ago and it is just as exciting today as it was when it was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"Bester is a skilled writer with a keen imagination, and this book has long held a position of awed respect among readers of science fiction. So why was I so disappointed?The major problem: I found the characters repellent. Not just evil -- some of fiction's most memorable characters have been utterly villainous -- but petty, monomaniacal, and (worst of all) boring. Only Gully Foyle, the protagonist, manages to develop into anything resembling an actual human being towards the end of the book; everyone else is made out of smelly cardboard.A second problem is that Bester seems more intent on social commentary than good fiction. This is obviously a matter of taste: those who are fascinated with the political ramifications of advanced technology are much more likely to enjoy this book than those of us who are simply looking for a futuristic story with interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terra is my nation....","review":"Just a great book. It will seem a little odd because its written in something of an introspective style but just give it time to grow on you and you will not regret it.Overall-One of those books that has LOTS of reread value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is a fantastic novel. It truly is a page-turner. I've read a fair amount of science fiction in my 43 years, and this is one of the best.Although it was written in the 50's, there is absolutely nothing dated about it. It takes place in a far future, involves intrigues in a military-industrial complex fighting a Solar System-wide war, and yet is a very human story about the failings of men and women of any age. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book","review":"Seriously, just buy it. It took me until I saw the word \\"negro\\" before I realized how old this book actually was. Writing a sci-fi novel that doesn't become dated with time is truly amazing. Just buy it. I really can't say anything more, you will love it. Even if you don't like sci-fi as a genre, give it a try, I think you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundbreaking 50's work","review":"Bester was a groundbreaking Sci-Fi author in the 1950's with this book and \\"The Demolished Man,\\" which won the first Hugo award. It is basically a retelling of the story from \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" in Sci-Fi form, but it loses none of its power for that, and the story certainly stands on its own merits.The transformation of Gulliver Foyle from an ignorant, low-grade spacehand to a shrewd, intelligent, and educated, but tortured man capable of carrying out his revenge on the Vorga crew, is one of the great character portrayals in Sci-Fi. This book remains one of the great classics of science fiction and is still worth your money and time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good","review":"A good book that's hard to believe was written in the 50's. Science fiction as it should be. The characters are interesting and the plot simple but exciting. Why can't they write like this anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stars My Destination","review":"Superb science fiction. Bester has a wonderful style. He once wrote comic books & the economy of words he acquired makes for wonderful, fast moving, eye popping action. That along with an imaginative plot makes it one of the best sci fi novels ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vengeance and imagination","review":"This is a book of frightening intensity. Bester's imagination was truly boundless. I agree with the writer of the foreword that the original title, \\"Tiger, Tiger!\\", was more appropriate to the book's theme and protagonist. If you enjoy this novel, make sure to read Bester's short stories as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating and creative","review":"Alfred Bester didn't write tons of books like some other authors, but what he did write was incredible. Both this book and \\"The Demolished Man\\" deserve a place in any sci fi library. One of the things I appreciate about Mr. Bester's books is how creative her is not only in content, but how he expresses that content in writing. The last few chapters of this book are brilliant. The main character is pretty disgusting. He's a rapist and a murderer, but Bester gets you on his side and it's fascinating to watch him grow as a person. In some ways this book is more a study in psychology than anything else. Fascinating!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action and a great ending.","review":"Bester has a gift for dynamic storytelling as well as delivering powerful and thought-provoking messages. Set against the backdrop of a burgeoning solar civil war, the first half of this book kept me hooked with its relentless action and well-rounded characters. I started to get disappointed when the second half started off with a vengeance in action theme but the ending brought intelligent thought back into the story with some very satisfying plotline wrapups. If you want hard science fiction that will inspire you after the ending, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assinine","review":"This book is a jumbled mess. The main character is initially developed as uneducated, unemotional and unreflective clod, which actually interested me! He then goes on to do exactly everything that such a character never would or could do.

The volume is loud enough for indoor single room settings with a limited number of people. In outdoor situations, the volume is also adequate as long as you are relatively close to the unit. The antenna works extremely well inside with what I would consider to be limited exposure to the southern sky. However, I actually recieved two units.

His voice is distinct, and offers different elements to each song, bringing them to life. While there was nothing truly groundbreaking on this CD, it still has some exciting material worth listening to. The ballad \\"Me And You\\" is a touching love song. The ballad \\"When I Close My Eyes\\" is one of his most touching ballads, with a good indication of what he has to offer voally. There are quite a few uptempo songs on here as well. \\"Back Where I Come From\\" is one of his favorites he has quoted in interviews, a song about remembering where you've come from, and where you're going. He does an excellent cover of the Don Williams hit, \\"(Turn Out The Lights And) Love Me Tonight\\". Other highlights include \\"Aint That Love\\", \\"Back In My Arms Again\\", \\"Another Friday Night\\" and \\"It's Never Easy To Say Goodbye\\". Overall a consistent album, not his best, but definately worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a little disappointing","review":"The story was decent. Two lesbians meet and fall in love. The story takes place on a beautiful ranch and the characters were likable. However, the story receives only 2 stars because of extremely poor writing.I don't appreciate having something repeated over and over and over again. Yes, we know that Lex and her housekeeper love each other and banter a lot. We know this greatly amuses Amanda. We know Lex loves the attention.

The structure is non-linear; within the first few pages the author references more advanced Photoshop techniques as if the reader understands what he's referring to.Frankly, I'm surprised the \\"for Dummies\\" group ever published the book. If you're new to Photoshop, this book will almost certainly confuse & frustrate.It simply is not a text that \\"Dummies\\" (read beginners) will get much out of. I read the first 3 chapters, and I still had no understanding of Photoshop's basic features.Perhaps it will be a good reference book as I become more adept at Photoshop, but I wanted a book that would teach me the basics.I've found both the \\"Photoshop CS2 for Beginners\\" DVD and \\"Adobe Photoshop CS2 Classroom in a Book\\" to be far superior choices for Photoshop novices.If I could rate this book a zero rather than a one, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"Judging by the number of people who don't find negative reviews helpful people don't like to hear the truth - that this book is not for beginners.

It is written in as plain an English as one could expect.All the \\"secret\\" procedures to do various things are explained, things that would take decades of use if you were to try to figure them out without help.It does not go into the aesthetics of photo editing at all. It only explains the basic procedures of how the various functions work, but it does this well.It does nothing with the other graphic arts programs that come with CS2 such as In Design, Illustrator, and others. Photo editing is only a small part of the CS2 program.If you want instruction on how to improve photos, this is not the book. If you want to learn the functions of how photo editing works within CS2, this book does a superb job in easily understood language."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men","review":"My grandson who's 4 is really into X-Men and loves these episodes and watches them over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy acting, terrible lines","review":"On boy.

Only under this perspective this film will be appreciated in its total dimension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Truffaut","review":"I kept waiting for something to happen in this movie. But it's just the story of a girl, who likes to steal small stuff. I really expected more from Truffaut, who wrote the screenplay.

From the same Chicago 2001 concert that produced the far superior Ringo & His New All Starr Band (King Biscuit) album, this album repeats four Ringo tracks, adding only It Don't Come Easy, and adds previously unreleased tracks by Greg Lake (Karn Evil 9, better known as Welcome Back My Friend To The Show That Never Ends), Ian Hunter (I Still Love Rock 'n' Roll), Sheila E.

The guy that puts his All-Starr thing together - I can't remember his name - is using his good name and the goodwill of fans to make a buck. As another fan wrote right here, enough already! Ringo is turning into a shameless nostalgia act - the same old stuff, year after year, more CDs. The 2003 All-Starrs I saw put on one of the worst shows I've ever sat through, and there's poor old Ring out front, alternately looking so arrogant and thrilled by the whole thing. What he needs is a real band (the Roundheads? I'm not so sure Mark Hudson isn't using him the same way) and a real, all-Ringo show. These things have become redundant and ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more live Ringo please!!!","review":"Ringo Starr and his allstar band releases, are beginning to get out of hand. We have already seen four single disc variations of the band released, not to mention the 3 disc live set as well? Let us not forget two DVD releases as well. This latest single disc release is billed as live extended versions, and features a few tunes from Sheila E, Ian Hunter and Howard Jones, and they are supplemented by the usual Ringo Starr tunes that we have already heard a thousand other times on his previous live releases. This is just a horrible bargin bin priced cd, that should go out of print very quickly. His shows are entertaining with the allstars, but enough already, with releasing the same old live tunes over and over again. If you need live Ringo bad enough, I recommend the 3 disc live set, which is all you will ever need to properly appreciate Ringo and his all-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's YOUR money, but just be forewarned","review":"OK, most of the tracks here are available elsewhere.

Most films or television shows portray teenagers as either miniature adults or as tired stereotypes, but this film does neither. In \\"Bully\\", the young characters are restless, awkward, rebellious, sexual, insecure and volatile. They constantly feel the need to perpetuate a fierce bravado to compensate for their fear and vulnerability. Although I was fortunate enough never to be involved in anything as horrific as the characters in this film while in my teens, I could see my younger self, friends and acquaintances in all of the characters, which made it all the more disturbing when their actions turned violent and tragic.

The only person who was half way decent in the movie was Marty and that's because he didn't talk all that much. Every other character was just plain annoying.

Letting this movie be directed by a guy who came out with a series of photos called \\"Teen Lust\\". This movie is simply an excuse for him to show teenagers completely naked. I'm no prude, but about, oh, 99% of the nudity has no reason to be there. The acting is awful, the directing is gastly, and the story is just terrible. Plus, none of these characters are forgivable, they're just as bad as the kid they kill. Not all teenagers are this violent or stupid, many are yes, but this is just horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larry Clark craps again","review":"This movie depicts the said goings on of rich kids with too much time on their hand.

Once again the topic is stupid and aimless teenagers who do nothing but have sex and take drugs. I agree there is a certain segment of the teenage population who act like this, but it does not represent ALL of them. Larry Clark's movies don't have anthing to offer. They are basically soft-core porn movies dressed up as being something profound or artsy. Don't be fooled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This film is brutally realistic and to my surprise it gripped me right from the start. Brad Renfro was excellent and probably in his acting prime in this film. The characters are very easy to relate to and all very well rounded. Director Larry Clark offers the viewer every possible point of view rather than forcing his own view of proceedings onto you. It's the sense of empathy that you feel with each character that makes the film so powerful. Based on real life events the story is really quite sad and tragic. Definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Real and true","review":"I didn't even know this movie was a true story until after I saw it. Then when I read about what happened in real life, I had a new appreciation for this film because it stayed so true to the real story and did a great job developing the characters. It's about a teenager going nowhere in life, Marty (Brad Renfro), who is being bullied by his supposed best friend, Bobby. Bobby bullies everybody, he's raped Marty's girlfriend and her best friend. As a result, Marty and a group of friends decide that the world would be a better place if they murdered Bobby. The film is really graphic, in violence and sexuality. It's very realistic and touching. If you liked the movie \\"Kids\\", you should like this movie. It's less like a documentary than \\"Kids\\" and has more of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WAKE UP CALL!!","review":"LARRY CLARK'S FILM DOES NOT PROMOTE DRUGS, TEENAGE SEX, AND VIOLENCE.

There is a lot of profanity, drug use, sex, and nudity, most of which cheapens the film and is not necessary. A film for mature adults only, as it is violent, disturbing, and explicit.

I was highly disappointed. The acting was horrible, though, I like the main two actors in other movies. There was also barely any character development (IMO). I didn't feel compassion for anybody, nor did it make me hate the 'villain', if you will. The movie's based on a true story, but I've seen many better jobs done to True-story movies.

Between the horrid shooting style (spin the camara around a group of kids more than 10 times at a high rate of speed) and the gratuitus crotch shots, nude scenes and pointless sex, this movie was just a mis-filed porn flick.There was no point to this film, it could have been a disturbing look into teen angst, the problems of rampant bullying, or drug use. Instead he just lays out the story of stupid kids doing stupid things for stupid reasons in a stupid film. A little more character development would have been nice. In the special features we learn that many of the kids have really painful pasts.

I wasn't impressed. I made it through the first twenty minutes before I had to cut it off. It was just ridiculous; full of gratuitous sex scenes that didn't have to be there. Not to mention Rachel Miner's character walked around naked a lot. However, I did see some similarities to some people I remembered from high school. Just shows how it doesn't have to be an innercity...teenage pregnancy, drug use, and violence can happen anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bully\\"...a silly, voyeuristic fantasy","review":"I have to disagree with the plethora of positive reviews given for this film. I feel that Larry Clark's previous landmark film \\"Kids\\" used graphic sexual imagery, violence, and rampant drug use to portray characters, a culture, and a story that was very real and very understandable, and for that, \\"Kids\\" was quite an achievement. Rather in \\"Bully\\" Clark uses that same shocking imgagery that hes very well known for, but for a story, a culture, and characters that are very unreal, and a plot that is confounding and ridiculous. All this leads me to believe that Clark's supposed obsession with teenage sexuality, which drove him to produce the ingenious \\"Kids\\", has degenerated to mere voyeurism."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"Its the movie I could not find at the store.I like this movie, thats why I gave it a good rating it keeps your eyes glued to the screen.based on a true story I recommend it to my friends that like dvd movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customer Review","review":"Arrived in a timely manor.

They actually discourage collections in favor of arrays - something that is inconceivable in .NET 4 with LINQ and Entity Framework.Even forgiving the outdated advice, this book was heavy on the hand waving and there were few concrete examples. It really assumes you already know most everything about the key technologies, so it leaves implementation up to your imagination.An even better idea would be to create a series of books on specific technologies rather than trying to be a catch all for the entire .NET platform.The only reason I didn't give it a single star, was because I managed to get it through a company library for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts to live by.","review":"Even without profound and thought-provoking messages, this story would be engaging to read!

Life's mysteries are discussed at their empirical level and are aptly described as \\"so simple, so intricate\\".

This story keeps you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk About Disappointment!","review":"A very good friend of mine told me of this particular book, Romeo. She said, \\"It will keep you guessing till the end.\\" Well, I suppose she was right, however, after the first 100 pages I really didn't care anymore. The story tries to be like other great suspense novels such as, Kiss The Girls. I found that the characters were not likeable at all, with very flat personalities. The only reason the book keeps you guessing is because it is always pointing to someone else new who may or may not be the killer, Romeo. I see that many people did like this book and that is fine. But to me, the book was in NO way challenging enough. I highly recommend Jeffrey Deaver or James Patterson if fast-paced suspense is what you desire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"This book was supposed to be suspenseful, but it was only one thing...predictable. I was able to guess Romeo's identity almost from the start, and the attempts at making just about every character we came across a suspect except the one it turned out to be just enhanced my suspicion. I kept reading more to find out if I was right (and hoping I was wrong) than to find out who did it.I also didn't care for the main character at all. While I understand Sarah had problems and trauma in her childhood, she was totally unlikeable -- to the point I began hoping that they'd catch Romeo, but only after he'd done her in.I also found it annoying how the book fluctuated back and forth between tenses.Quite a disappointment that it was so predictable. Had I turned out to be surprised by the ending, I would've definitely given it more stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV movie","review":"I also read this book upon the advice of a friend - we obviously have different tastes. I found the dialogue badly written, the characters overly dramatic (lots of fists pounding on tables, falling to one's knees, etc.), like it was written with the hopes of it being turned into a TV movie one day. Not at all \\"erotic\\". The characters were flat and unbelievable, as were the situations in which they were placed (many of these characters were connected by the \\"coincidence\\" of childhood abuse). The author obviously tried to lead her readers into thinking certain characters were guilty, which didn't add a sense of suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G !!!","review":"The summery on the back of the book made me wanting to read it but I was really bored after several pages. I read it through but the ending was the WORST I've ever read. The persons are not very well charaterized, sometimes it is not understandable what they do and why they do it. The lovestory has to be influenced by the murders but it is very badly done and you can see through it very soon.It really is a pity, still there seems to be no better criminal writer than Agatha Christie - her variaty is yet the greatest. But nonetheless I keep on reading and hoping..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Dark","review":"Ugh, she does a great job with the violence, slash by slash detail. The book deals with some rather dark topics so be prepared for that. On the brighter note the book is good. The author does a very credible job with the character development, especially the women victims. I would have liked more insight into the killer. The main character has so much personal baggage you believe she would want to get into this world. If you are looking for a mystery that is a light I would not pick this book up. If you are looking for a book that takes on some issues we normaly do not get a lot of detail on then this is a good book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: Boring","review":"I've read the book in german and I must say: One of the most boring book I read last year.

When the hitch is installed, there is NO room to put the exhaust hangers after the install.

But the price was right for this game and when it plays, it plays well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Okay.","review":"I went through this entire game, it was quite good. It starts off slow, and hits a few low points, but it picks it self back up, and gets the ball rolling towars the middle. Some of the first half is very confusing, and most of it is by your self, however, this will get you very good, very fast. The music gets a 5/5, because its ambient and has a nice effect through-out the game, the voice acting is terrible except for the main character and a few characters here and there. Graphics get a 3/5; they are probably about as good as some recent ps2 3d games, but nothing spectacular. Gameplay gets a 3/5 because its so slow at first.

This game implements some of the worst coding I have -ever- seen, with hundreds of glitches, bugs, and other problems. I have never been so disgusted with any videogame ever.

Playing a neurotic, brilliant hypochondriac with a Chopinian accent is right up his alley in this film. Judy Davis as the famous popular woman writer of the time period, George Sand, is also fabulous. As is Mandy Patinkin, who Princess Bride fans will know as the sword-fighting fatalistic spaniard. The comedy is well-timed, well-scripted, and well-carried out, and if you think you'd enjoy watching a film about all that can go wrong (and right) amid a commune of writers and artists, this is a film you want to see as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun and great music!!","review":"Whether or not this movie comes even remotely close to telling the real story of the love affair between George Sand and Frederic Chopin doesn't matter, for once. George and her group of hedonistic friends are great fun to watch. And you'll love rooting for George as she tries everything to get the \\"frail as a holy waifer\\" Chopin to notice her. Wonderful performances by everyone, especially Emma Thompson and Mandy Patinkin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comedy about Chopin?? Yes!","review":"When I first heard about this movie's concept, I was outraged. How dare they make a comedy of such an ultimately tragic figure? Eventually I got over it and went to see it. Amazingly enough, they managed to make a Chopin comedy work. A semi-biographical \\"what if\\" fantasy that's a delightful comedy of manners. It makes a small attempt to examine the psyches of Chopin and Sand. Generally very good performances all around. Grant just didn't manage to convincingly bring the frailty to the role of Chopin that I imagine would have been accurate. Davis gave a convincingly forceful performance as Sand. I don't know why the premium cable channels never bother to show this movie. How long will it be until the viewing public eventually rediscovers this little gem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hugh Grant film ever...","review":"Being a Hugh Grant fan, I had great hopes for such a well reviewed movie on Amazon, but boy was I mistaken. I am quite sure Hugh Grant himself must be embarrassed with such a performance.This movie had absolutely no story line or plot, paper-thin acting, horrendous values and was a complete waste of time. I managed to make it through the entire thing with the vain hope that somehow the production might redeem itself in the end, but alas, this was not to be the case.To anyone considering a purchase of this movie, I strongly advise you to think twice so you are not disappointed as we were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Chopin","review":"The whole movie concerns George Sand trying to get close to and possibly gain the affections of Chopin, who she doesn't even know. The mistress of Franz Liszt gets into the act, presumably because she believes that Chopin is more talented than her present amour, and she would make a better muse for him than Sand.This film does not go into the backgrounds of either Chopin or Sand, which would have been interesting. I came away with no new information. Not something that I would ever watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring","review":"I found this movie to be rather boring. Not much character development. Some parts, especially what the children were doing from time to time, were scenes I had to tolerate to get through the movie. Hugh Grant is a fine actor and Mz. Davis was ok, although she looked a good deal older and more world weary than Hugh. I just felt Chopin's transition from avoiding George to loving her was not believable and underplayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Mark Twain wrote a romance about Romantics . . .","review":". . . This would be it. This movie is one of my top 10 favorites. It is funny, funny, funny, but in a crisp and understated way that makes each viewing funnier than the last. It shows the foibles of the characters with amusement, but without quite wandering into satire. The love scenes are squirm-in-your-seat awkward, just as in real life! This is not your typical period piece (not that I have anything against them--I love them). It's too funny for that. Soundtrack is a winner with music by Chopin and Liszt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow.... disappointed.","review":"Not loving this movie.

I haven't read much about Chopin or Sand, but this movie definitely doesn't inspire me to do so in the near future (or ever for that matter). I normally love Hugh Grant, but he played a strange, sickly character with a bad Polish accent. Sand is a tramp with very poor fashion sense. I mean, my goodness, even if you are going to dress like a man it seems like you could still comb your hair!! She seduces Chopin, a man who appears to be quite a bit younger than her and plagued with health issues. It is repulsive. I enjoyed the performances by Emma Thompson and Bernadette Peters more than those of the lead characters. It is probably not worth wasting your time watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETENTIOUS AND BORING","review":"What happened here? You have a great cast, admirable production and producer/directors of note. Why was this one such a stinker?

But my question is: how true to life were the characterizations of Chopin & Sands in the film? Chopin's character seemed so blah actually, so shallow that I had to wonder where the romanricism expressed in his music came from. On the other hand, I fell in love with George Sands.In any case, the film was wonderfully written, acted, directed, photographed, etc. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I was non-plussed by Chopin's character."},{"rating":"2","title":"These brothers know how to harmonize!","review":"Great harmony with a beat you can't resist!

One can definitely hear the maturing of her work from the first \\"Agnetha\\" album through to \\"Elva Kvinnor...\\", but each stage of her career has its own charm. The earlier works have a carefree sixties kind of lilt to them and then on the later albums, the music is crafted pop that could stand alongside the best of ABBA. It would be really interesting to hear Agnetha's songwriting nowadays, with all that life has offered her and put her through over the last 20 years.For anyone that is a fan of ABBA, this is a must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"De F?rsta Aren 1967-1979 by Agnetha Faltskog","review":"I have been a fan of Agnetha Faltskog since I discovered ABBA.

The songs may all be in Swedish, but her voice is so exceptional that the entertainment factor never diminishes. This product may seem a little expensive, but the six cds contained within make this purchase a great investment. If you love Agnetha's voice as much as I do, then this set is just what you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"An expensive, but historical gem","review":"I love Agnetha's English albums but was reluctant to purchase this Swedish set. Without understanding the words, I didn't think it was possible to achieve any significant enjoyment from it. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised. Her voice is so smooth and beautiful, you won't care that you don't know what she's singing about. The melodies are unique and captivating.

In the course of 14 months, the family learns a great deal about the world beyond Marin County, California-and themselves. While some of Cohen's more meditative passages slow down the travelogue, his prose sparkles when he relates the joy his children find in looking at African animals or describes the enormous warmth and hospitality he and his family find in rustic Sardinia. The reader will share Cohen's concern when a child is injured and his relief over the outcome. One Year Off is a good yarn: a good read and a terrific present for any family, adventurous or stay-at-home."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to be their nanny!","review":"I recently grabbed this book at the Boston Airport because of its colorful cover.

I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Lived My Dream","review":"What an enjoyable experience! David Cohen makes travel writing seem effortless as he injects humor and wry observations amidst profound awe-inspiring moments. The e-mail-style letters broke each trip into quickly readable chapters that had me thinking, \\"I'll just read one more, and then I'll put it down.\\"As far as taking the children along - I would love for my children to be exposed to such raw life experiences at such an impressionable age (and to make it out pretty much unscathed!) How lucky the three Cohen kids are for having gone on the trip - and that their creative parents understood that the benefits far outweighed the risks. Too bad David Cohen seemed too worn out and ready to get home as they made their way back through Japan and Hawaii. I was looking forward to reading their adventures in these two locales, but the book pretty much ends without any details about those parts of the trip. Hopefully, there will be a follow-up someday down the line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining book!","review":"My husband and I both enjoyed this book and hope to someday take an extended trip with our three children. The anecdotes and mishaps were described in ways that made me laugh out loud at times.

We would read this book in the car, in restaurants, at the dinner table and during quiet time. We were completely engrossed in the way David Cohen was able to reach myself and to keep the interest a my 9 year old. The only problem we had was that we had to keep a dictionary on hand. I consider myself fairly knowledgeable, but found myself not being able to pronounce words and feeling guilty for never having heard of many. So from one prospective, we have learned many new words. But from another, having to stop while traveling through a rainforest in Costa Rica, to pick up a dictionary, became a nuisance at times. Thank you to Mr. Cohen for wanting to share the experience most families wish they could too could enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable writing","review":"David Cohen seems incapable of looking at the world except as a pampered, racially superior American. He is the smuggest fellow I've come across in a book since many a Jane Austen character. No deep thinker and his book reflects his shallowness. He loves his wealth though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick With Photography","review":"While Cohen has extensive publishing experience as a photo editor, his writing lacks the style and grace that could make this family adventure come to life for readers. His writing seems forced. This could have been a great magazine article, or maybe next time, he could just publish a book of photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring.","review":"I generally like travel books. But this one is about this guys family and how great they are. The wife is a biathalon athlete or triathalon. Anyway, it's all about rich California people with time and money to kill. It's very 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but Club Med-ish in its approach to the world","review":"As a San Francisco resident planning to take a similar trip in five years, I was especially interested in David Cohen's story.The book is extremely enjoyable, funny, and frustrating at the same time. The simplistic e-mail style of writing works well for a light read, but I often hoped the author would add deeper meaning or insight to an experience. At least he didn't pepper the text with LOLs and smilies, I suppose.Traveling primarily by plane and car, instead of by trains and buses, the family has little chance to become immersed in the local culture; in some places, they seem to barricade themselves from the locals instead of trying to sort out just how fearful they need to be. And where are all the stories of the kids becoming friends with the local children?So, although I thought the book was fun, and I will read it to my three, it was frustrating in its documentation of missed chances to really learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous, entertaining and educational - a good read.","review":"Having read a few chapters from this delightful \\" travel book with a difference\\", I cannot wait to read the whole family saga! Aside from Cohen's lovely sense of humour, his observations and insights of some of the countries I know well, are 'spot on'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish-fulfilling, funny, poignant!","review":"As a septuagenerian, it's a trip I would have loved to have made with my husband and children. The book is totally delightful! Cohen writes with humor and poignance. In addition to being entertaining, the book is informative. He and his wife must have boned up on all those exotic places they visited. I loved the way they explained things to their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the Experts Win at Bridge","review":"I have not had the time to get very far in the book. So far it meets my needs. I plan to continue my pursuit to become a better bridge player."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Name Book Ever","review":"I was so excited to discover this book. Pamela Redmond Satran and Linda Rosenkrantz are -- hands down -- the very best baby namers in the business and I have always found their advice to be extremely useful. Their previous books (including Beyond Jennifer and Jason & The Last Word on First Names) were far and away my favorite books when I was naming my first 3 children. Pamela and Linda are always funny and hip and all of their books make fine pregnancy reading. This newest book, though, is a real treasure. Not only is it a beautiful keepsake gift for us to be able to pass down to our next baby, but it created some special time for my husband and I to reflect on our family histories and what's really important to us and our future. It is a great book and one I will be giving to all the pregnant women I know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"(not a kid either) Goldfinger--listen to your fans and quit","review":"Where is my band? This album is honestly awful. This is trite, sophomoric modern rock and it sounds as though they've been hanging out with Fred Durst. Please, Goldfinger, return to the true faith. I personally promise to forget this album--just release something good next. It'll be like that 8th grade yearbook, still in my possession, but so far under everything else I own that it might as well be a Jurrasic fossil."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE","review":"I'm not quite sure why this album is getting so many crappy reviews. I have to say that it is one of the greatest cds I have purchased in a very long time. Sure they don't sound like they used to, but this new sound ain't too shabby. My personal favs being: Ocean Size, Uncomfortable, Iron Fist, Faith, and Stalker. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Its NOT that bad","review":"OK it was NOTHING like goldfingers old stuff, but it still beat a lot of stuff i have heard recently. Goldfingers old stuff like Stomping Grounds and their self titled album were simply amazing. It is not dair to compare a newer album to their old stuff. When you look at the album compared to the rest of the stuff out today I would say its pretty good.99 red balloons floating in the summer sky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"I don't understand all these people that are saying this change is good - fair enough, they have changed their music, but now they sound like busted (and thats a bad thing by the way!)I am the BIGGEST fan of Goldfinger and have been obsessed with everything they have even done - I even thought open your eyes was a good album just because it was from my favourite band.But NOT this album, this is embarrassing, the people who say that this is good obviously don't like Goldfinger for their uniqueness and comic outlook. It is a money-making album with no time put into it - it was recorded quickly and badly. All the songs sound too similar, no catchy riffs - no happy ska sound.True Goldfinger fans won't like this! Silly people who think it's great. Fair enough if you like it - but you can't say fans shouldn't be bothered by this awful change!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stared idiots","review":"For all those idiots telling us we're idiots because we can't except change and all that bull crap, please listen to our opinions!Now first: The whole point of ska punk/ska is the fact that it is different, that is what made goldfinger different back in the day! Now they sound like all the other gay poppy/punk bands today like:new found glory (Horrible) simple plan (horrible) the starting line (awful) good charlette (the worst)These bands are in their own catigory of the worst music put on the radio today (excluding country) Now the sad thing is that Goldfinger has now joined these horrible bands as the worst bands to ever put out a CD!!!So I believe we're the ones that can except change in music, that is the whole point of listening to SKA, but it is sad to see you are the idiots who don't realize you are changing! So go ahead and buy this CD make another band rich so they can abanden the fans that got them popular in the first place!!![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"At one time Goldfinger had core values.","review":"Do you remember when Goldfinger wasn't a preaching vegan band? Or when John would encourage fans not to support Nike and their adventures? Not only has the music lyrically and musically gone down hill, but now they even thank Nike in the liner notes. If you are looking for anything punk, even really poppy punk, this isn't the cd you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I have been a goldfinger fan since 1996 with their first self-titled album. So of course when i heard that this new cd was coming out i was excited. I just purchased it earlier today expecting good things, seein as how their last cd, open your eyes is one of their best cds. I put this cd in, and i was appalled. Only one word can describe this cd, terrible. I hate it. It is a waste of my money and of my time...Goldfinger has clearly gone down hill with this sad sack effort. If anyone wants to buy this go right ahead. But anyone who is a real Goldfinger fan cannot say that this cd is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I would absolutely suggest you buy this album. People in some of the previous reviews are just diminishing themselves from the enlightenment of everyday changes in societal music. Goldfinger has approached a deeper sense of connection with the outside world and have reluinquished a serious and sad side to their creativity. I believe the album to be a very unique yet enjoyable piece. I must admit, however, that it doesn't beat \\"Stomping Ground\\" nor does it beat \\"Open Your Eyes\\" but it has a developmental direction in the eyes of true liberalists. It takes political views and knocks them dead in accordance with the opinions of Feldy and the crew. I have to say I love the album. It's not an album that sucks, it's just an album with a lower and emotional side of the world. I believe everybody can relate to most of the tracks on the album. Take my word for it. It's something to really listen to and think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected","review":"Goldfinger...This review isn't about previous releases, how long I've liked Goldfinger, or how great they are live. This review is about this album. This pollished, over-produced, uncatchy, and overall pathetic attempt for an album. The lyrics are weak and whiny, always complaining about being lost, \\"wasted\\", or tired. The sound is boring and dull and nothing stands out or makes you want to listen to it again. I tried hard to like it, I forced myself to listen and try, thinking about earlier albums and maybe I'm missing the edge. It's unbearable and I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone. If you're just getting into Goldfinger, pick up their self-titled or \\"Hang Ups\\". Please do not judge this otherwise incredible band on this album alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total crap from a buch of sell outs","review":"A band that I loved for a long time now and have always enjoyed the fact that they have stayed playing the same great music and not headed down the path of producing poppy garbage to make it big with mainstream audiences.Well Congrats John, because you have produced an album full of the worst pop garbage I have heard since good charlotte.I would have given this album no stars if possible. There is however one good song titled \\"My everything\\" which is more like their old stuff.I can understand when bands mature and broaden their musical styles, but only if it leads to a positive outcome and not when it seems like it has been made for a mainstream audience which is when I say a band has \\"sold out\\"If you havn't got any of the cds, get self-titled, hangups or stomping ground. This is complete crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"(not a kid) Horrific effort by an overall great band","review":"What I noticed about Open Your Eyes was the slight shift to a pop-punk feel. I was slightly dissapointed in this, but my comfort came from the fact that the album actually sounded solid and crisp.Disconnection Notice, the bands latest effort, is by far the worst album I've ever heard. Goldfinger completely sold out, and thrust their ideologies onto their fans throughout the record. I think the majority of the readers would agree that Mr. Feldman has given up on making descent music, and is trying to reach to an audience of little to no intelligence.The only song I like off this record is Damaged. It's unique to the album and is quite an enjoyable listen. I suggest downloading it.Don't purchase this record, it's not quite worth it.I'm out,peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"YIKES!","review":"If you are into Brazil/Electronica, DO NOT GO FOR THIS. I admit it is a fun CD but after the first track or so you start to think that maybe you should be playing shuffleboard on an old person's cruise or listening to this at a retirement center. It's just not up to date with what is considered modern Brazil/Bossa Nova/Electronica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for those who don't want really play","review":"This book is not for people that want to play, cause it uses only the single-finger technique, limiting the student and, worse, giving a bad initial education"},{"rating":"2","title":"View from an insider","review":"This is not a movie against war, our military or our country.This is a film by a war vet and pastor who is reviewing the effects HE has personally experienced and his working to help others who are in the midst of the struggle now...This film is not for the faint of heart. This film discusses some very deep topics such as killing others.The warning I have for you is it is WAR: There are pictures and videos of death, and live combat movies.Discussions about bodies with holes from the bullets etc..This is NOT a family film or an educational film for your children.If you have friends and family who are military and unsaved this is a great film to help reach them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Incredible stories of soldiers and Marines who served and suffered for our country.

After that the book is of little value. I was lured by the promise of a \\"meditation technique\\" that I found completely disappointing. Japa meditation is simply uttering the throat sound \\"ah\\"- drawn out for a long tone - and it's supposed to keep your mind from wandering to other thoughts, sort of like a mantra. The CD is not really guided meditation, as it's hard to follow or understand.
