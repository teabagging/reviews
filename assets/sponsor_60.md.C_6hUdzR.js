Sure, you're backside is numb by the time you sit through all three, but hey, no pain no gain!The extra features are well worth the effort of watching, ESPECIALLY the piece on Golem and WETA.

As most, I bought the theatrical DVDs, then the extended version. It is appalling to witness this kind of business practice and I think it can be taken for granted that J.R.R. would take the time to puke on Jackson's desk after his (Jackson's) phony display of being a torch holder of the epic.

Do not buy if you're looking for the extended cuts. This studio has made over a billion dollars on this series; and that is after recouping all spent cost. They are nearly one billion in the black with this series and they're trying to push it farther during these harsh economic times. You will not get my money for this nor perhaps for the extended bluray when you finally get around to releasing it.As for the Peter Jackson mention in my title; the studio has been tight-fisted with releasing any of the money they've made on this thing; going so far as to not pay the director (Jackson)contract money owed him when he took initial pay delay cuts in case the movies flopped at the box office. As we all know, they sold through the roof! And the company tried screwing Jackson out of the money he let them hold onto. What d-bags! Good day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the director's cut!","review":"The reason that there is an Extended Edition is that:1) It is closer to the book and what Tolkien wrote and intended2) It explains and makes clearer many things that the Theatrical Edition obfuscates3) It is what Jackson actually filmed and as he intended it to be seen.4) The bastardised Theatrical Edition was just created to shorten the film for commercial not artistic reasonsIs is indicative that nowhere in the package description above does J.R.R Tolkien's name even appear.Surely this proves the crass commercial aspects of this release.After all, I am sure that all DVD work, like normal industry practice is put together in a high resolution format before being transposed into the DVD standard.ie: the footage of the existing Extended Edition is *already* in Bluray resolution or even higher.This is a purely marketing decision!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHENANIGANS!

Heck, they could probably fit both the theatrical and extended versions on the same Blu-Ray.Do not buy the theatrical release if you plan on buying the extended version. I wish Amazon and other retailers would take a stand on this practice of milking customers with both theatrical and extended editions and announce they won't sell the theatrical release unless its released at the same time as the extended edition.

I was excited when I saw that it was coming out on Blu-ray. Then I found out that it only had the theatrical release on it. We all know that a blu-ray can hold both the theartical and extended versions on one disc, but they want the extra cash from releasing the exrended version later. I actually had the pre-order qeued up in my cart when I noticed that it was only the theatrical release.

Why can't they simply produce both versions on one Blu-Ray Version letting the consumer decide which to view?

So buyer beware, you buy at your own peril.I am aware what this rating system is for, but to my knowledge there is no forum to talk openly about products to your fellow buyers before purchases. Something else comes to mind; whether or not Blu-ray will \\"be around by the year 2012\\" when New Line says the extended versions will become available is mute.

For New Line to force us to buy two sets of disks, and NOT provide a Branched version of the film is just flat out greed. Do NOT buy this version.

No one will be able to sell this version later when ty want to upgrade to the extended version.The price of this version seems a little steep as well, considering in a couple of months you'll be able to buy it for half the price when stores clear stock for the extended editions.Graet movie.. shame about the blu-ray release."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am in agreement and will boycott","review":"Great work everyone was going to buy theatrical version being inexperienced with blu ray termanology and lack of experience i appreciate the advice and will boycott all movies until they come out with the best version possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both versions should be on this Blu-ray release","review":"I agree with the majority of the reviews, we should have both versions on the Blu-ray release.

If you buy this version on the movies on Blu-Ray, then you will be tempted to buy the extended versions when they come out later. Why waste your money? Just watch the DVD copies of the extended version you probably already have until the Blu-Ray version comes out. Blu-Ray is the perfect medium to put all four DVD disks onto one disk for each movie.

I've been eagerly awaiting the release of LOTR on blu-ray... and just assumed that New Line would have the common sense to release the extended version on BD. Apparently I'm wrong. That or (as seems to have been with the DVD versions) they are delaying release of the extended versions until they can milk as much money out of the theatrical release.

Until then, no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would anyone buy this version?","review":"This is just ridiculous. Why would anyone who is a fan of these movies buy the theatrical versions?

Do not release Theatrical Editions of films after you have already released the extended versions. If you have just done this in the first place, you would have sold millions of copies of these. So instead, all your fans are holding out for the extended versions, thus leaving you with no sales at all. And if you never release the extended version, fans still will not buy this version. Looks like a lose, lose situation for you in this case.If you have the ability to provide the Theatrical versions, then obviously can produce the extended versions. So no excuses about time and money when you have already made millions worldwide on this trilogy.

The only reason for releasing the Theatrical version and not including the Extended Edition is that they're looking forward to selling you 4 different sets & taking more of your money. Next will be the Extended Edition Blu Ray set, then the Theatrical + Extended set, and then they'll probably release another collector's edition set with extra deleted scenes & commentary... it never ends.

They charge 70 for the first and say 120 for the Extended. Most true fans, if they bought the first, will buy the second! So basically they're charging us 190 for these DVD's.

It's too much, especially when blu-ray allows for both versions on one disc, as is already the case in the regular dvd 'limited edition'. Blu-ray will obviously be the ultimate viewing experience for these incredible films but I, for one, will wait for the extended edition blu-ray and I'll probably wait for them to become available on the secondary market as I did for the 'limited edition'.

I'll buy the extended editions on BluRay, I loved the movies and love having more to watch, but there is no excuse for releasing the theatrical edition on BluRay except to try to sneak in some sales of people that are buying it for a gift or people who don't realize the difference until it's too late.Also it has been reported that Warner Bros. had employed an aggressive high frequency noise filter on the recording and the fine detail that should be present is smoothed to an air brushed look.

I have my doubts on most people, but I imagine not everyone in the world is dense enough to fall for this kind of crap.I'll be sitting on an extended edition BluRay release (which in reality, the regular DVDs scale quite well in a BluRay player, so it really doesn't even matter), whenever that may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting Double-Dip","review":"DON'T BUY THIS!

Five minutes with Peter Jackson, that's all I need to help him see the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies ever","review":"Most so-called extended editions add in only a few minutes. The added footage in these films is enough to make an entire additional movie. The depth of the story is greatly increased, and now that I have seen it, I could never watch the theater edits without feeling that something is missing. As much as I love Peter Jackson's film, I recommend reading the book - it's even better.I can't wait for Mr. Jackson to tackle The Hobbit or even The Silmarillion. But I suppose that after the scope of this film, based on Tolkiens greatest work, a film based on his earlier, less refined story would be fairly anti-climactic. We'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Paying Twice For One Product","review":"It's already been released on multiple DVD releases, asking us to pay for a Theatrical version is a bit much for me.

But now it's out on Blu-ray, I do agree with the others that I might as well wait for the extended version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trilogy Tragedy","review":"As we all know these Films are fantastic!! But the studios need to give the customers a break. Just use the Blue Ray for what it was meant to be used for. Just release the Bloody Extended Versions in one Trilogy and be done with it.

This behavior is one of the reasons why there is such a Piracy issue in the industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy until the extended edition is released on Blu Ray.","review":"My family absolutely loves The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I like the idea of buying all three movies and the extra features on Blu-Ray, but I won't buy until I can buy the extended versions. We have both versions on DVD, we don't need them on Blu-Ray. We never watch the theatrical versions, so there is no point to it. I hope the studio doesn't hold out forever.

All the little guys you can get as action figures from this Wonderful popcorn flick are great toooo! Aragorn whacks well and the hoppits get more screen time. A big mouth talks real nasty to the good guys,so they settle him and that morgal Lord. I am so crazy about these ringies that I can't talk right.Silly Stir Wars is just poohies Vader and Hmmm Yodais!

I've paid for all 3 theatrical-version DVDs, then all 3 Director's Cut DVDs, and now this. Apparently to make an extra buck, they release the theatrical version only on Blu-Ray for top price, while the whole world knows that one Blu-Ray package could have both theatrical and extended versions.

Give the consumers what they want (the best quality and value for the money), and they will be rewarded; if not our dollars will go elsewhere.

I absolutely hate how Capitalism has caused the consumers who are actually getting screwed to stick up for the people screwing them!

They understand how this works and will not purchase this edition.

This goes on the entire movie.

In three furious verses, Madame Star gives it to him like any deadbeat father should get it from the baby's mama. At the end of the first verse she wastes no time giving him props on the June Hoilday 'hope you have a f'd up Father's day'.Madame Star's \\"Baby's Father\\" was released on Cold Chillin' Records, which brought fame to Biz Markie, Big Daddy Kane and Roxanne Shante to name a few.

I tried to cut an appled and the knife will only cut on an angle. It slides away from the initial cut which makes it impossible to cut anything less than a 1\\" blade.

I'm sure the publishers and authors are sharing a big laugh at the readers' expense. Imagine an opening repertoire for the positional player that suggests 1.e4! Virtually all the defenses selected(like the Scotch Game, Sicilian, King's Indian, etc) would make a tactician's delight. And the authors' claim that they could be played in a quieter fashion doesn't obtain, for in most of the lines suggested your opponent could steer the game to fierce tactical battles! To boot, the book is also dishonest : in the chapter on the Sicilian for black, after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 the authors say, \\"well, white can play other lines than 2.Nf3, but to learn those you will have to buy our other book.\\" In a nutshell, this book should be entitled \\"An Incomplete Repertoire for the Positional Player Who Does Not Want to Play Positionally!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book","review":"I bought this book along with the companion \\"An opening repertoire for the attacking player\\" and I have to say that I was thoroughly disappointed.

But first -- please do not let me stress this enough: Esham posesses the greatest rap voice that I have ever heard in my life. I rate \\"Mail Dominance\\" as a four star CD, because of two main reasons. One -- I believe that this album is a fresh new look at the talent and imagination of an amazing mind. Two -- this album is AMAZING. I was totally captivated and completely impressed with the new style. Although, this is not a \\"Closed Casket\\", this is definitely not a dissapointment. Whereas \\"Bruce Wayne/Gothom City\\" was sadly Esham's poorest effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dominant One","review":"I bought this CD on the day that it was released.At first I didnt like it cause it was different but as I listened to it more and more I started to feel the new [stuff]. I wouldnt count Esham out yet. Id say that its just the beginning. It was 1990 when he released his first album and at that time he was only 13 years old. So far hes got more than an album a year for 10 years plus the [stuff] that he did with NATAS. Anyone that can put out that many albums, and sell as many as he did, and being underground at that, is a LEGEND. Mad props to NATAS and The Dayton Family.Peace out."},{"rating":"2","title":"not his best","review":"this album is not garbage, but it's not nearly his best. it's not horrorcore which is the whole reason i like esham. there are a several good tracks on this disk that make it a must buy for a true esham fan. this disk is not for everyone though. king of hearts is one of my favorite esham tracks, just one long flow. pretty impressive. peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new esham what is this?","review":"Has he sold out? Maybe, but its for a good cause, to make money. ESHAM wisned up a little and started promoting Mail Dominance before it was released on the streets, by selling shirts etc. The first single \\"Twirk yo body\\" shocked the hell out of me. Acid rap has finally died in 1999. More of a \\"club beat\\" ESHAM has evolved throughout the years and it will be interesting how the rest of this album will develop. As for \\"Twirk Yo Body\\" the beat is soft and it sounds like Michael Jackson is in the background. A must album from ESHAM is 1987 Gothom City/Bruce Wayne, pick that up if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good design.","review":"I thought I wanted a \\"birds beak\\" shaped knife. However after using it, the curve is useless. There is nothing this knife can do that a straight paring knife cannot do.

And as others have said, this music stands up amazingly well.And this album, their third, in my opinion catches them at their peak. Each of the 3 albums is great, but I think they're more accomplished artists as the albums go on. If you don't want to spring for the album, just download \\"Packin' Trunk\\" for 99 cents. Then you won't be able to resist buying the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's directions for financial success","review":"Well written. It provides sound biblical principles for obtaining and maintaining financial success. What is so different about this book is that it is based entirely on God's word.

While the story seems to begin a bit slow, there is no doubt that the reader quickly finds themself on a power dive into action. Benchley also does a great job adding some animal awareness messages to the reader. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly fish story misses mark","review":"White Shark/Creature (the cover of Creature clearly states that this was previously released as White Shark) is about a hidden Nazi plot being released. Something is in the water and it is vicious. It kills like a shark but is not. It's a man-shark hybrid! Now here is the really silly part, the creature has been taught how to adapt to land (it has done this before), but it has not been taught how to go back in the water (so how did it get there?).So, after creating havoc in the water, the creature becomes the Saturday Night Live \\"land shark\\" and starts stalking the land. Just when you decided to never go in the water again, the sharks take to land.This was a huge disappointment after Beast and the movie was even worse. If you want a good book, this one is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad premise, bad book","review":"This book is simply dreadful. The premise is so implausable as to be laughable. Engineered Nazi zombie with steel teeth and claws gets loose after being preserved in a u-boat for fifty years, to terrorize the coast. An author not named Benchley would not be able to get this published. Apart from some well written passages about the water, marine life and coastal towns, the book is bad. I mean, it is really bad. The title is deceptive (white shark being the code name for the Nazi Zombie) and the main charactors are so wooden as to be painful. One has to respect Benchley as the master of his genre, but he would have been better off having typed this one to re-read it and toss it in the garbage. He didn't, and there it is. Please do not read this book. Please do not buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"B+ A fun read.","review":"This was a fun, quick read. Not too in depth. Not shallow either. Jaws with a twist of lemon. Had a fine ending. Easy to get into. I am not a fast reader and I read it in six leisurely days. I recommend it if you liked Jaws. Very Jawsesque."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Paced Thriller","review":"Peter Benchley is a truly amazing writer of the deep. But I must say after reading Jaws I was very mad because he discribed The Great White as a blood thirsty killing machine. In White Shark the creature from the deep is a expariment gone wrong not a Great White. There is a White in this story and Peter Benchley describes it as a butiful wonder of the deep, NOT a evil killing thing. The characters in this book are trully amazing and unforgetable. Benchley does a terrific job of making you feel for the characters. And of all the attack parts are really good if not a litte GROSS. This book trully bad Jaws look like a pet goldfish phisicly and in the way that this book kicks the book Jaws out of the water. Want a good book with thrills and chills... Read White Shark By Petetr Benchley!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Munch on this","review":"This is an awesome book for those who like sea creatures and suspense. Some of his other books are better but this is a must read for shark lovers. It has a uniques twist to it and a great story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great White is a guppy gray.","review":"WOW! What was he writing about? The story was okay ... but the ending was the worst I have ever read. It kept building up, then dropped me like a rock into shallow water with jagged rocks. I think the fall would be more of an adventure than the book. Please, Peter, more excitement next time, and a much better ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply unbelievable...","review":"I was very disappointed with this book; I expected something of the quality of Jaws but instead found myself reading a shallow and disappointing story that is quite simply not worth the money to buy. Benchley is a good writer, and the story is readable enough, but is badly (read BADLY) let down in the believability stakes. If you want to read this book, find it in a library; don't waste your money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary but weak","review":"Peter Benchley has gone down a path that too many writers face. He has totally run out of ideas. This story does take place on the high seas, however Benchley gets away from the true terrors of the deep, which is his strong suit.The story revolves around a genetically made killer, that can live on land and sea. Benchley tries to bring together the cruelity of man and place it with the killer instinct of great white shark. The idea is there, but the book will keep you shaking your head, as of the whereabouts of what made Benchley famous. The characters were not well rounded and made the story very dull. There are some great moments of gore and terror, but they are to few and far between. If this is your first Benchley you might want to grab one of his older classics. This one missed the mark a long way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You have got to be kidding!","review":"A pyschopathic killer with gills? This was just a little hard to swallow. And he's lived on the ocean floor - two miles deep - for fifty years but only needed a few shrimp to survive? Until, miracle of miracles, his coffin is accidently discovered - in the middle of the ocean - Then he decides to really start feeding? WOW! I have more realisitic nightmares about goblins chasing me as I fly from tree-top to tree-top. The really unbelievable part is I paid $6.99 for this - after having already read it a few years ago under the title White Shark. I Hate when that happens!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing monster novel.","review":"It is difficult to write a good monster novel. If the author makes the creature too unbelievable, the reader will just not buy into the concept and dismiss it as wacky. If the creature is not fantastic enough, the reader will lose his sense of awe and fear. There is no question that this is a tough balancing act.Unfortunately, this book never finds that special balance. The idea toes the line between being trite or moderately interesting (Nazi experiment produces hybrid monster) but the delivery is lacking. There is nothing I can say that will articulate exactly what this book is lacking except that I feel it is missing that intangible \\"magic\\".My advice to you is to read this if you must, but otherwise there are other better monster novels out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lousy re-hash","review":"First of all, the menacing creature in the book is not a white shark; it's not even close to being one. They just slapped that title on here because Benchley wrote \\"Jaws\\" and they wanted to cash in on it. Second of all, what the creature actually is is so completely ridiculous that it loses the power to frighten the reader. If you need a cheap summer thriller to burn through in a day or two, there are probably others out there that have at least a shred of credibility to make it interesting. How many more dead deer and sea lions do we have to see to build endless suspense for something silly?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those rare books that actually chills you","review":"I have long since never actually been afraid of the events in a book, but this was a very well written novel by my favorite author and idol, Peter Benchely. I t reall hooks you and pulls you in and when you put characters you know in a dangerous situation, you get the suspenseful feeling like you get while watching a movie like Deep Blue Sea. I think that there could have been an extra 20 pages involving the power going out in the house and our characters suddenlt hearing deep growl and thuds from dark rooms. that woulda really been scary! I am diasppointed that our hero of the story delivers by far the worst line: \\"It's got a wrench!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Successful failure","review":"Peter Benchley's new book is what I would call a successful failure. In the beginning of the book the setting is unclear and the events not thoroughly given out which gives it a scary atmosphere. Good starting. We don't know exactly what is going on in the book yet. From the point in the book that suggests the creature has legs and arms is when the book takes its major downfall. The book was very well written except for the fact that a shark with steel teeth and legs is TOO far fetched. Turns the novel into something similar to a comic book. It took a major downfall with this. However it did get me going for a minute. It was very creepy right through the point before the end. After that it was a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think Creature is the best horror novel I have ever read.","review":"Creature was so gripping that I devoured (read) it in 4 days. It kept me on the edge of my seat and i couldn\`t put it down. Horrer novels and movies never scare me but I actually thought twice before going in the water again.

Can you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book packed with terror and adventure.","review":"I think that this book was a superb story. It was a combination of terror and adventure.

If this is a genuine motorola product its a stupid design. Now do I break it open and hope I can get it back together or toss it???

This may sound weird... since all this item does and needs to do is charge my phone but I might as well have a slick charger to go along with my razr. This charger has a slick blue LED that illuminated when plugged into the DC outlet. Along with the cool light the cord is perfect length to reach from the outlet to my ear while I am driving and not be a pain to use. The cord also comes with a little plastic clip on it so you can fold the cord over and clip it together when not in use and it saves the cable from getting tangled.

It comes in a plastic bag and is not even a Motorola product. It doesn't even look like the photo! The blue part that should light up is black and only has a small blue light bulb poking out of the plastic. It looks cheap and will probably fall apart shortly. I am sort of scared to plug my phone into it for fear of a power surge or something that would ruin my phone. I ordered directly from Amazon thinking it must be the other sellers that are selling this knock-off garbage but I was wrong. I wish the reviews would tell you specifically who the person bought theirs from since they might be selling different products. If you read the reviews and see a good one that says theirs is genuine make sure to check the date. Some of them are from 2006.

Also, the \\"rivets\\" are purely decorative. One fell out after the first time in the dishwasher.The packaging promised rust/spot free, but occasionally, the knives do get spotty in the dishwasher. The spots wipe off easilly enough and have not stained, so this is tolerable, if far from ideal.My wife used to buy all Farberware products and, up until now, we have been very happy with them.

It stays sharp and does everything you might ask a knife set to do. After pondering the issue a while, I have decided I would be foolish to spend the extra money for the higher end knives.

For it's small size it has a good heft without being to heavy and the opposite side of the blade is great surface for hammering. I gave this 4 stars because the grip would tear up your hands with moderate use without gloves. For a better grip I wrapped the handle in paracord but I'm sure that hockey tape will work just as well. With the paracord I was able to included a wrist loop as well.

It is very sharp right out of the box and has a nice balance. It is just the perfect size to put in or hang from a backpack. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars is the ridiculous plastic carrier it comes in. The carrier is awkward to say the least and takes up more room than the hatchet itself. I suppose it makes the product easier to hang and display from a store rack. Fiskars could have included a simple nylon sheath with a belt loop. That would have been more practical than the huge plastic carrier. Also, they should have ground off the ridge on the opposite end of the blade so as to make it more useful as a striking tool. I did that myself, an easy fix if you happen to have a bench grinder. All in all though I am very pleased with my Fiskars 8-inch Hatchet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hatchet","review":"This is a well weighted hatchet.

Would be a great one to take along on outdoor trips, but you would want to get a different cover in that case.

I couldn't believe it when she repeatedly referred to Angel's vampire persona as \\"Angeles\\" -- I'm also shocked that the editor (assuming there was one) didn't catch that.The worst thing about this book, however, is the author's infatuation with run-on sentences and adjective-heavy descriptions of everyone and everything.

After five years of constant use, its a bit dull - nothing that a pro sharpener can't fix. In the mean time I decided to branch out and purchased this litle peeling knife - thinking that it looks like a paring knife. It's not.

You will enjoy this fantastic story in a relatively short (only 4 hours) amount of time.If you are not familiar with this classic story, then you are in for a real treat. The cast for this drama is exceptional and I can assure you that it will be worth your time to listen to it and enjoy. We always love to play these on long trips to make the time go by faster.This was released quite some time ago, but with the recent remaking of this work now in theatres, I am sure there will be a resurgence of interest.

It is a wonderful masterpiece that hasn't been beat by any book I've read besides. Now, I love audio books, and I know that audio books have to abridge the novels that are so long. I don't mind that. But this audio totally changes the whole story. If someone hasn't read the book, they would get a total misrepresentation of the characters. I don't think they could even understand the true nature of any of the characters.

This production has a stronger heart. It also seems like something a family can listen to together without any family member being talked down to.Brian Blessed makes the role of Jean Veljean with powerfulness with passion. Leo (Rumpole)McKern is M. Gillermond with a rye sense of character stealing. Geoffrey Palmer makes Javert something to enjoy.What makes this interesting is the direction by Philip Glsasborow.

It would be admittedly difficult for anything to follow that heady experience, but I tried with Les Miserables (Radio Theatre), done by Focus on the Family.This was well done. The voices of the various characters made it easy to differentiate them, and the soaring background music was nice as well. I did really miss all the beautiful songs of the stage production �� there were none of those. Still, for someone who wants to know the basic story of Les Mis and has three hours to spare, I can recommend this.Thanks to Tyndale for a review copy of Les Miserables Radio Theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's the hooker","review":"THIS is the CD that hooked me into Poi 6 years ago.

I have collected just about all of the Poi CDs and was thrilled with their show - definitely worth the trip. I recommend starting with this CD and if you like the sounds buy forwardly not previously as their sound is much hippier from the \\"olden days\\".

Although Poi Dog Pondering is known for their amazing lyrics and vocals, \\"Natural Thing\\" allows the brilliant musicianship of the rest of the band to ooze out of the speakers and into your skin.

They won't cut carrots, potatoes, or anything fibrous. I have spent almost a year and at least [money] to try to sharpen them, and after buying the ... chef's choice 3 stage sharpener (excellent machine, by the way)they are now marginal. The problem is the thickness of the blade at the cutting edge. It does not taper to a fine point, but has a huge bevel which will not allow the knives to cut through firm foods.

They doubt the carbon dating method, which is acceptable in itself, but they give you nothing instead. Their reasoning goes as following: if the carbon dating is not precise, then the Bible must be right. They provide no plausible scientific alternative whatsoever and ignore obvious geological data and common sense in order to justify the Biblical age of Earth. I found this DVD a complete waste of time and money. I was hoping to learn more about fossils, but learned really nothing, apart from \\"Earth must be young, because the Bible says so\\".

Most of the video time is dedicated to commentary by various individuals whose titles simply say \\"Record Producer\\" or \\"Classic Rock\\" and most of their commentary is generic... very little inside stories or scoops, just basic commentary that an music-lover watching the video could get.Who are these commentators?

This is also a book I intend to not only keep, but keep close to my bedstand - I'll think it will be a book I reach for often to re-read certain chapters when I feel challenged by lifes little surprises.

The jaws aren't toothed, so if the bone gives more than a little resistance to the pull, it'll slip right through. Perhaps if you're working with a smaller, more tender fillet, the broad jaws of these tweezers may make it easy to scrape gently along the flesh and extract minor bones, but otherwise I suggest putting your money toward a good pair of stainless-steel (dishwasher-safe) bone pliers with toothed jaws, such as those available from Wusthof (I recommend their 5880 model), Messermeister, or Gilbert."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best!","review":"If you like Phillips, Craig and Dean you will definately love this one!

So I pay a premium for the same stuff? I call this fraud at the least and certainly deceptive. I could live with that if the product performed but it doesn't. It takes days to dry to where you can set something on it, even with 3 coats it still doesn't cover and you cannot sand it, it balls up.

The problem, though, is not too little noise reduction, but too much. The high-pitched whistling he cites is, I think, an artifact of hiss reduction. It ruins the whole set, in my opinion. An awful shame, considering the importance of this music, and the fact that the remastering was otherwise most meticulously done. BMG, why did you allow this to happen?***LATER***The late John R. T. Davies, who was during his lifetime the world's foremost restorer of 78 r.p.m. recordings, confirmed in correspondence with me that the whistling noise I refer to is an artifact of the master recording and is not caused by electronic noise reduction. Specifically, it is caused by the cooling of the wax master during recording. There are ways of minimizing it during transfer and remastering, and I wish BMG had taken advantage of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't realize it when I ordered it, but this item is used.

The Totem starts off pretty good(comes across as a supernatural thriller) but as you reach the middle of the story, it becomes a medical disaster story and not a very good one at that. David Morrell is a terrific writer, this must be one of his first novels.

How can a complete unaltered version of a book originally published in 1979 contain references to events occurring in 1993?

Because I saved one star in case I come across a book worse than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping, savage, intelligent action/horror book.","review":"Anyone who has read any of David Morrell's novels will certainly appreciate this one. The tale evolves as an intelligent, thriller and action story with a little pinch of horror thrown in. His imagery is some of the best in this genre. The only author, in my opinion, who even comes close is Trevanian. Picture an isolated valley that comes alive at night with bizarre happenings, that culminate in an amazing hunt for creatures with human like intelligence--you will not want to put it down!

Juice is simply the most amazing female singer in the country/pop genre. Before there was ever Faith Hill or Shania Twain, there was Juice Newton.

Usually translations of old historical works make an insipid reading but Bosworth has done an excellent job here. Footnotes added throughout the text clear up a lot of things and add tremendously to this interesting and turbulent era. The reader may misjudge the book to be a lesser work as Tabari bases his words on hearsay. However, it should be emphasized that Arabs were reknowned for their amazing memory. So much so that the words of the Quran were for many years kept in memory rather than being written down on paper. Tabari does not even fail to mention a good length of the names of every narrator's forefathers. In essence the book is about the Sassanids. It tells in good detail of a variety of events from the lives of Kisra.

At last, I've concluded that although some may find beauty in the so called poetry of Thomas' language, I find nothing but confusion - both for the reader and the audience member.

And even though that Breil rubber band is thick, it already has cracks. This one seems to be made of better quality rubber so I do not think durability will be an issue though it is too early to tell.

Other users have complained that their knives were duller after using this or that the sharpener scratched their knife. I haven't had either of these problems. I think you are more likely to scratch the knife if you pull it through too fast. I will admit that the knife doesn't get quite as sharp as I'd like, but I'm not comfortable using the whetstone. I'm worried that I won't hold the knife at the correct angle.

His style continues to evolve from one album to the next and he has delivered yet again.

Sophisticated mixes with delicate layers laid with artistic flair that only a true artisan can enamor. This series has gathered a lot of fame over the years, and I am really glad that Buddha Bar IX is here to keep that flame alive. Buy this album without an apprehension...pure sonic bliss."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best so far...","review":"I've always loved buddha bar cd's but this one is definitely wonderful!

But that is the point of revival. In my mind this is one of the best. But that should not matter to you. here is what should. The songs on the album are very much more electronic than world and exotic which we are used to from buddha-bar collection. there are many seductive and dreamy elements to many of the tracks. Particularly on the first CD. Ravin incoporates girls voices especially singing in english with a dreamy attitude, you could almost see the picture of how the girls lips seperate as she is about to sing. The songs seem more sexually inviting and an offerance to flirting than the exotic charm of the past that buddha-bar is known for. But you need to understand why the change has occured. A new buddha-bar is opening in London (hence the color Purple) so they wanted to move away from what is in paris. Not to say that one is better than other just a difference in perception.ciao"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"This is one of the best series ever made for detective series lovers.

The originals are in language of the times when he wrote them, but the \\"George-isms\\" edition contain a shortened version of each rule in plain language.

It explores the differences between Classical (Orthodox) Judaism and Secular (Reform) Judaism in a clear and straightforward way. Classical Rabbi Yosef Reinman engages in a dialog with Secular Rabbi Ammiel Hirsch. The dialog shows that Reinman's points are always better than Hirsch's ones, but I don't think that it is because Reinman is a better spokesman than Hirsch, but because Hirsch has the impossible mission of rationalize the secularization of Judaism. Hirsch lives in a relativistic world where majority decides what is true or right; Raiman lives in a world where G-d tells what is true or right through Torah. A wonderful reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor results","review":"I have to agree with Ian and the other reviewers who were, like me, disappointed in this book. The authors talk past each other, neither taking up the other's challenges. Hirsch does not seem up to the task, in terms of writing or scholarship, and ultimately Reinman wipes the floor with him. (There must have been someone who could make a more spirited case from the Reform perspective ... ?) The smug putdowns, especially voiced by Reinman in regard to Reform, grew tedious very early, and I finally gave up on page 152 -- and this was during a 9-hour international flight in which I was desperate for something to read! (I would have liked to hang in there to learn how they became friends, as the book jacket and reviews indicate, but I couldn't take it anymore.)

Nothing new in this and I suspect, little that has been contributed by Alliss. It's just a cut and paste of very well known bits - anyone who has read more than 5 golf books (not instruction books) will know 98% of what's in this one. It also has numerous typographical errors suggesting a sloppy job overall - Billy Caspar (Casper), George von Elme (it's Elm I think), Ledbetter (Leadbetter), it has Gene Sarazen \\"chipping\\" from a bunker on the Postage Stamp hole at Troon which is possible but doubtful, and Chick Evans playing in 50 consecutive 'Amateur Opens' (an oxymoron, Amateur Championship is surely meant).

I say \\"half-way\\" because there is still somewhat of a contemporary element present in these songs (and it works). CeCe's voice is strong, convincing, and the title track is breathtaking. My personal favorite though, is \\"Without Love\\"; my finger always hits the repeat button when this song finishes. Other greats include: \\"Fill My Cup\\" (those who read CeCe's book will fully understand the meaning of this song)\\"It Wasn't Easy\\", \\"He's Not on His Knees Yet\\", \\"One and the Same\\" (w/Take 6) and \\"King of Kings (He's a Wonder)\\".

Knives that I have utilized range from the \\"cheap but effective\\" to the finest products from Henckels. But the knives I use daily are the Globals', and the one that I cannot be without is this one. Although it is designated by the manufacturer as a Utility knife, it is simply the best paring knife I have ever used, and I've gone through a lot of them. Its razor sharpness is easily maintained, it has a perfect heft and balance, and it is exactly the \\"right\\" size and shape. It just feels great.

Now lets talk about the knife, at first I was a little worried about how thin the handle was, and I had read that people thought the handle was thin and uncomfortable. However, I have large hands and I think that the knife is quite comfortable. I used it today when cutting onions, garlic, shallots and numerous other things and found it rather comfortable and it really did not feel like I had anything in my hand. In addition to this, the balde is extra sharp and it is a breeze to cut through anything. I would reccomend this knife to anyone looking for a great quality, smaller blade utility knife.

Little kids listen to the CD and I don't think they need to hear about suicide. Take It back is not what I expexted from the group. Instead of rapping they say their lyrics and that takes away from the tight beat and the rest of the cd.The best song on the CD Has to beFuel Injected because of the way it flows, the tight beat, and the chorus by Moka Only.

I was a little concerned with the handle at first, but it's very comfortable, and isn't slick at all, even in soapy water. I also worried that maybe I should have gotten the bigger version of this knife. Again, my fears were unfounded, as this was the perfect size for vegetable preparation. You can't really describe the feeling of using the best tool for the job... but if you've ever had that feeling, you already know how you'll feel using a Global.

It does anything I need it to. I would call this knife scary sharp coming out of the package, but scary in the best way possible. And it stayed sharp for a year, until one of my roommates abused it and pitted the blade. But even with all of the abuse it took, it held up much better than any European steel I've purchased/used in a professional setting; a professional sharpening will fix it right up. It is worth the money to me to at least buy this one to have as your go-to if you have small hands and need a workhorse knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes cutting veggies enjoyable","review":"The knife makes cooking more enjoyable. You can cut faster and easier. BUT BE CAREFUL! There is no forgiveness- this thing is sharp. If you cut yourself its a big deal since this knife is razor sharp.

This powerful capability of Powerpoint is my associates' (university faculty and physician-educators) stock in trade, and the real reason they use Powerpoint.

Admittedly I'm not a very happy person at work, but I felt genuinely pissed off at the world. As soon as I stopped taking it, I felt back to normal. Since I wasn't ready to give up on a cheap fat burner, I tried four more times going on and off the product. There is no question that it definitely has a negative effect on my mood.

The title really should be \\"Radical Liberalism... Repackaged\\", because that's really all it is. Essentially he talks a lot about government hand-outs to give people a head start in life then taxing the rich to pay for it.

Angels Flight is one of his weakest. Connelley doesn't develop any characters in the cast of suspects, so the solution elicits a big \\"So what.\\" The subplots are predictible, while the major plot points seem random. And we don't learn anything new about the Harry Bosch character. I get the feeling that Connelley's publisher was simply racing to get this one out in time for Christmas.

I started reading his novels a few months ago and now have read around 6 books. Angel's Flight is hand down his best. The book takes place sometime during the late 90s in LA. The OJ verdict taint has gotten on every single case that involves a black defendant. Cases that would have once put people in jail are now ending in acquittals. One attorney who has profited, both financially and in terms of a great reputation is Howard Elias; he is a hotshot civil rights attorney who takes no prisoners in his litigation against the LAPD for brutality and shootings gone awry.Elias is found dead and it is up to Harry Bosch to solve the crime. In the process, they reopen a case involving a slain 12 year old girl. The suspense, the dram and the incredible exposure to the profession of detective work makes this an incredible read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Quality Crime Fiction","review":"Connelly is on top form in this installment of the Harry Bosch series. Angel&#65533;s Flight, a suspenseful tale of murder and police corruption in Los Angeles, a city on the brink of imploding, is one of Connelly&#65533;s best. As usual, the characterizations are superb. Bosch and gang are memorable in the pursuit of a murderer that could be from their own ranks and the depiction of LA is atmospheric and grimly realistic. I highly recommend this for fans of crime fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch at his best","review":"Angels Flight is as good a crime thriller, police procedural as you will ever read. LAPD detective Harry Bosch is called into a highly volitale situation following the murder of Howard Elias, a controversial attorney. This is classic Bosch. Mr. Connelly is by far the best writer of the police procedural and there is not a close second. Harry Bosch is one of the best continuing characters this genre has produced, his subtle complexity grow with each book.Mr. Connelly's prose is first rate. Here is an example: \\"The Bradbury was the dusty jewel of downtown. Built more than a century before, it's beauty was old but still brighter and more enduring than any of the glass-and-marble towers that now dwarfed it like a phalanx of brutish guards surrounding a beautiful child. It's ornate lines and glazed tile surfaces withstood the betrayal of both man and nature.\\" That is pure poetry.Angels Flight is a GREAT READ!! I found it impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"HARRY BOSCH SIX BEST SO FAR","review":"The sixth Harry Bosch novel, ANGELS FLIGHT is the best of the first six. Read them in order. Harry Bosch stories are the best police procedurals out there. Harry is no non-sense and this story is one of the best for any series. The death of a black-cause attorney, the cause is usually anti-police is gunned down. Harry and his team, Edgar and Kiz are assigned by the top brass. Bring in IAD as back up, not Harry's favorite and the FBI all the time reporting to the assistant chief and Harry is pulled in every direction. This is a good one with all the twists you need to keep you guessing up until the end. Loved it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly does it again","review":"I am an avid reader of this genre of books, and Michael Connelly has never disappointed me with any of his efforts that I've read (The Poet, Trunk Music, and now this) I am 30 chapters into this book and could barely put it down long enough to get on the internet and check my e-mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angel's Flight is A Rollercoaster Ride in LA","review":"Another Harry Bosch novel involves us in this unusual detective who manages to perserve his essential goodness despite everything the author, Michael Connelly, can throw at him.

The book doesn't break new ground, but it certainly entertains and ends with a bang. The plot follows Connelly's double climax formula that can sometimes cause me to loose interest, but this time I was in the dark until the last forty pages. Connelly is one of the top three working in the genre today, and as a fan I've come to expect a lot of him, he doesn't disappoint. Hey Michael, how about teaming up Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb?

The book isnt fun. I want to get this read and done with to try Marshall Karp If this is one of Connelly's best - 4 1/2 stars, geesh I can't imagine the others Connelly fans: Move on to Lee Child.

It's got an interesting but very slow first half. When the second half of this story starts, look out.

The author just keeps the suspense growing and twists twistier. I wasn't prepared to like this novel as much as the others. An attorney who lives to sue the LAPD -- and picks the race card out of every deck he's dealt -- and all the politicos covering their collective butts -- no thanks. But this was REALLY a good read. Of course, as usual, the FBI and IAD hassle Harry at every turn and he always has somebody trying to bring him down. That part gets older with each new book. But you gotta love Harry -- he just keeps fighting. Does it bother anyone else that Harry carries a briefcase? It just doesn't ring true to his character. I'm seeing Dirty Harry one minute and then Poindexter the Geek the next. Do homicide dectectives carry briefcases? All the more reason Harry would not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Author","review":"Love these books from Amazon to my Kindle.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Bosches","review":"Until this one, I liked Connolly's non-Boschers, The Poet and Bloodworks, better than the Bosch stuff, simply because I didn't take to Harry's tortured soul. Now that he's becoming un-tortured (even without a wife), Harry seems a more balanced and focused character. Unlike some other critics, I don't mind the racial themes. Rodney King did happen and relations between cops and minorities aren't exactly wonderful, in LA, in New York and most other major cities. I even liked Connolly's little self-promotions, like the ad for a movie called \\"Bloodworks'' with Clint Eastwood. I'm not up on inside Hollywood stuff, but I guess something like that is on the horizon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great !","review":"Another book that takes you out of this world and never let you escape till you finish it.Thats the kind of book that anyone would like.

I'm a fan, having read every Bosch novel except the first. This one is not better than Concrete Blonde or The Last Coyote. The ending was contrived. Certain skills of the killer are constantly mentioned in the text, as if to foreshadow what will be a very interesting confrontation at the end. These allusions are not realized.

Elias has made a career of suing LAPD officers so the suspect list is as large as the LAPD itself. As the LA streets threaten to erupt in another riot, Harry Bosch is forced to look at his fellow officers for the killer. Harry's former partner is the number one suspect, but Harry follows the trail outside the department to a pedophile ring. But will he be able to prove his friend is innocent?Another good Harry Bosch novel. The characters are all well-drawn and believable, the plot is well-crafted, the ending is poetic justice, and the writing is flawless. What more could you ask for in a mystery? Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Bosh - you've been gone too long","review":"WOW! What a read. Wish there were more stars to award this book. Michael Connelly has brought Harry Bosh back in full glory. The twists and turns are all there, as Chief Irving pairs Bosh with his old nemesis, Sustain Chastain, to solve a case that combines all the dangers of every case that has been in the public view over the past 10 years. There is only one problem with this book, and that is that Michael Connelly has totally ruined every other author on the market for me. I can no longer enjoy mysteries or adventure stories by any other writer. So I have to read trash until Connelly issues his annual fare. I find myself re-reading Concrete Blonde and Trunk Music because the re-read is better than the first read of any other author. Keep 'em coming, Michael. Bosch is the best of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good suspense and mystery from top-notch author","review":"I'm a long-time Connelly and Bosch fan and this was a worthy addition to the series. I am very glad Connelly has wisely ditched Eleanor Wish from Harry's life---this type of character works better when they're alone and lonely. Look at John Sandford's Lucas Davenport and how he turned wimpy when he fell in love with Weather. It took several books before he was back to normal. Connelly also gives us his take on the Jonbenet Ramsey case and another patented twist at the end. Although not as much character development and detail as other Bosch novels, it's still readable and definitely worth the money. Let's hope the next book finds Harry tracking another crime which lands Eleanor in the slammer again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Complex Explanation for the Central Crime","review":"I finally slogged through this thing and I only finished because I finish 98.5% of all the books I start. It is full of chapter after chapter where absolutely nothing happens garnished with an ultimately meaningless red herring or two. The final explanation calls for such complex planning and execution with such precise detail that I would have preferred the author just say grey aliens beamed down and killed the two victims. It would have been easier to swallow. Early on the author has the LAPD Inspector General commit two felonies by destroying evidence in a murder case which Bosch quickly uncovers and still he sits still while she repeatedly gives him an ACLU approved lecture on the need to watch those dirty cops. he doesn't just let her get away with this smug holier than thou attitude he seems to partially buy it. Pitiful. I still like the Lincoln Lawyer series but I'm finished with trying to like the new improved Bosch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"My least favorite Connelly book. I think he's taken Harry as far as he can go. The stopped-smoking and wife-leaving sub plots are boring, and the red herrings are too obvious. The attempt to pull actual headline fodder into the overall mix (OJ, JonBenet, etc) are too easy and seem manipulative. Connelly can, has had done, much better. \\"The Poet\\" & \\"Blood Work\\", which were not about Harry, are much better plotted and paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort for this Harry Bosch fan.","review":"Readers who give \\"Angels Flight\\" five stars obviously have not read Connelly's earlier Bosch stories and his other works (ie, \\"The Poet).

This one starts right off at full blast and does not relent. Also, as a native Los Angelino, I can testify that Connelly really gets the flavor, the landmarks, the racial tensions, the city politics and the names of the restaurants right. I've even discovered a couple of cool places based on locations in his books. Brilliant premise, brilliant execution. Now Mike, go write another POET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Connelly at his best","review":"In the latest adventures of Harry Bosch, Connelly does not disappoint us. True to form, he proves time and time again that he knows the inner workings and dynamics of a big city police department and the legal system that supports it.

You WILL have to occasionally reshim the head to keep it tight. Quick fix is to screw 1\\" sheetmetal screws into top.2. Broad face close to handle and ripping claw for good balance and ease of driving nails. It's just physics.3. Sharp edges on inside of claw for gripping nails you are pulling. Only pull nails by rocking side to side, or you'll break the handle.4. Hatchet handle for good ergonomics.

We've all been duped by the title, including myself. I was pretty upset when I bought it and watched it. The music, although nice covers by other musicians, is not authentic Pink Floyd. That was seriously disappointing. However, since I own many Pink Floyd CDs, I had the idea of making a new CD with the songs on the playlist of the DVD in the same order. So now whenever I play the DVD, I simply watch it, but listen to the CD instead with the real Pink Floyd music. You just need to start both the CD and the DVD sort of at the same time and ... enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weisser just makes stuff up.","review":"As someone who actually writes for and runs a spaghetti western website, as well as an editor for the massive Spaghetti Western Database, let's just say I watch a lot of spaghetti westerns. Like others, at first, I was blown away at the sheer amount of reviews in Weisser's book. That is, until I actually started seeing some of these movies. Not only does he get cast/crew information wrong, on many films, it's as though he's completely made up a plot. I'll watch a movie, and then check the book the next day, and there'll be a completely different plot than what I saw the night before. What's even more strange is he'll refer to actors that were in the movie, but completely makes up the plot and story line. Weisser is a hack who should have never been published. Unfortunately, it's still the most complete English language guide to spaghettis out there, so it is still useful to an extent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace","review":"This book does not help one appreciate the Italian westerns, it actually is harmful. It is replete with errors, especially plot summaries which bear no resemblance whatsoever to the films themselves. Could it be that Weisser never saw many of them (back when this book was written few were available and it's unreasonable to expect the author to have seen all 500+ anyway) and just made up entries so as to have something down for each film? Did he think that nobody would see them anyway and wouldn't know? There is an example of two films combined into one, there are missing major supporting actors, etc., etc. Why give a fake plot summary and then spend so much time outlining the director's efforts in other genres? MacFarland should be ashamed of themselves for keeping this book in print. There are much better books available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned: too many errors and mistakes to be reliable","review":"Like many folks, my first reaction to this massive tome was one of awe. But, as I got to watching more and more of the movies in the genre, I began to find all kinds of discrepancies between this book and what I was seeing on the screen. It quickly become clear to me that the author had not actually seen many of the movies he was reviewing. It's hard to believe, but it's true.Many threads exist on spaghetti western message boards detailing the wealth of factual errors in this book. Do yourself a favor and search them out if you want a second opinion. Hopefully you won't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"*literally* every film in the genre","review":"Straight-up reference book with a ridiculously thorough collection of credit lists and cast detail for *literally* every film in the genre.

I am reading until I get the next book I've ordered. Thus far, I've found the book hard to keep reading because none of the characters are people that I have any interest in. The repeated references to the \\"death of hip hop,\\" are a bit much. I liked her other book, More Like Wrestling, which is why I picked up this book. But thus far, Bliss is not holding my attention. Eva, the main character, is insipid.

I read the Microsoft Press books for each test, then supplement that with the Exam Cram 2 books. I've taken tests 70-290 and 70-291 and found the Exam Cram 2 books to be very beneficial. However, something happened with the 70-293 book. There are lots of inconsistencies and wrong information. On one page, you'll be reading about an item and what it does...on the following page, it will tell you something completely different. Sometimes there are mis-prints in the exam questions...like having the same answer printed twice in a multiple choice question. Don't get me wrong - if the real test was like that, it would be awesome. Like I said before, the first 2 books of the series were great. This one leaves something to be desired. Glad I bought the PDF version instead of the hardcover...much cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible","review":"Although I am a fan of the Exam Cram series, this title falls very short of my usual expectations. This book is full of inconsistencies, ambiguities and just plain mis-information.

Her only weakness, in my opinion, is her blatant homophobia. Of course, most readers will think one of her returning characters, Marshall Trueblood, is gay, but those who have read the first in the series, \\"Man With a Load of Mischief\\", will know that he is actually only a flamboyant heterosexual. In \\"The Old Contemptables\\", I found some of the most hateful writing I have ever experienced. Even the title, \\"The Old Contemptables\\" refers to her feelings about gays and lesbians.

It really is an amazing steel, but if you already have a very fine Japanese waterstone (mine is 6000 grit) that gives your Global knives a mirror-like razor-blade edge (MUCH sharper than they come from the factory), you're not going to like the way the diamonds on this steel scratch that finish. Also, you lose some sharpness.

He is not a chef, but a serious foodie/home cook. He now uses the honer as needed and it keeps the sharpness at its best.

There is no way to adjust it to make it comfortable to play unless you have no neck. Lee Oskar makes a great holder for 10 holes that is easy to adjust into a comfortable position. You may have to bend it a bit (everyone's frame is different so don't let that put you off) but at least that's possible with the Lee Oskar whereas it's not at all with the Hohner, which is too thick to bend. That thickness also means that it weighs far too much, making it even more uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable for a tall boy, too long for a ten-hole","review":"I got this harp rack a couple of months ago, and I'm pretty unsatisfied. I stand about six feet tall and I've a long neck, and I have to bend my head way down in order to reach the harmonica. It's made to fit all kinds of harmonicas, but the ten hole just kind of sits in the middle. I have a tendency to slide off the end of the harp when using this holder. Add to this a bunch of heavy metal that leaves imprints on your chests and you've got a harp rack that just isn't worth the trouble.Pros: fits any old harp you could imagineCons: Too long for a ten-hole, too short for Average Joe, and too heavy when sitting on the chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid holder","review":"The Hohner Harmonica Holder (specifically HH-154) is my first attempt at a harp holder. And it works great.The springs aren't too stiff or too loose. They hold the harp well. The frame is very rugged. The plastic tubing on the neck piece makes it more comfortable and prevents it from sliding around as much. The wing nut at the joint tightens fine.I've read from one of the reviews that the ends of the neck loop points downward and sticks into your chest. My solution was to flip it around. The joint rotates like 360, so there shouldn't be a problem (unless you have a harmonica larger than 10 hole, cuz the metal tabs that help keep the harp in place might get in the way). And my friend that has had this same holder for a few years now said the ends pointing down helps keep the harp in place.Height wise, it's a bit on the low end, but I manage fine (I'm 6'1\\").Overall, solid construction and sturdy. And made in Germany. So that's a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to the set","review":"This holder works well with all of the different harmonicas that I own. Including some Honer, both diatonic and chromatic. I like its ability to adjust. If you buy one,make sure to set it just a little closer than a comfortable reach. When you go to play it will settle down a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hohner harmonica neck holder doesn't hold the harmonica","review":"I bought two of thes holders--both of them did not hold the ten hole harmonica for even a second.

The one positive thing i can say is the womens voice is average in a Nina Gordon(Veruca Salt) kind of way. I give it 1 star.

You can argue that I lavish my stars here, but that is due to the star inflation on Amazon and my opinion that some differences between the Zacharias/Vonk and for example Perahia/Haitink not necessarily make the latter much better. Zacharias/Vonk give us a more expressive 4th and a somehow strict 5th.There is more darkness, more shades in the 4th than in most other performances. The 5th gives all energy I wish from it, but you can argue that the adagio un poco mosso is troppo mosso. If this is your first Emperor, you will probably enjoy that, less sugar. Summa summarum: understated emotions in the adagio and happy, triumph in the first and third movements.Zacharias' light touch is something he shares with say Fleisher and Perahia. Some would prefere a more dominating piano voice, for example by Arrau.All these differnces are matters of taste, not of excellency."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom loves it","review":"My mom loves her raised toilet seat.

The date indicator advances randomly. I would send it back to Swiss army, but the are absolutely awful for customer service and I simply don't want to aggravate myself dealing with these people. This one is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Watch but Loses Time","review":"This is a really nice looking watch. But the one I had lost 3 seconds a day. Three seconds a day is pretty bad. I got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barron's is better","review":"This book was good as a general review, but now I'm working through Barron's GRE book and I'm happy that I didn't rely on the Princeton Review book. Barron's GRE is much more rigorous. All areas of the GRE are covered much more thoroughly by Barron's GRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains errors","review":"I took this book out of the library because I'm not very good at math... and yet I've found several errors in the math so far. Among others, a triangle's angles measure 90, 43 and \\"a\\" degrees respectively, and we are told that a=43.The answer explanation of one question states that 1/105=1/7.I have no idea how many errors of this type there may be because math isn't my strong suit.There's a glitch on the CD in recording the practice test scores; it told me I got 730 on the verbal and it recorded the score on its chart as 710.Also, the book tells us that we will have 45 minutes for the math section, and then later tells us we'll have 30 minutes. I think the latter time is correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider time restraints","review":"Use this book if you have more than 4 weeks to study before your test. If you'll have less than a week to study, this book recommends you pick up their other book, Crash Course for the GRE. I found Cracking the GRE to be very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource!","review":"I highly recommend this product as a GRE prep tool! It's not going to miraculously teach you information that you've never learned, but it's great for making you feel prepared to go into the test. It gives you all kinds of little tricks and tidbits as to how the test works. I bought three books to prepare, but this was the main one that I used because it was so great. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book - but supplement with other software","review":"I used several GRE prep books, and this was by far the most useful. It seems written for a more intelligent audience - those aiming for 700+ on the Quantitative and Verbal sections. The \\"Hit Parade\\" section gave clear definitions as they are given on the GRE. I also reviewed the book's Analytical Writing section the night before the exam and it greatly helped organize my thoughts.The only way to improve this would be to add a CD-ROM with practice test software. The Princeton Review's online exam was difficult to access and required registration, and the book didn't give access to any more than the basic online test (which is already free to anyone). Use this book in combination with other testing software for better results.Also, don't buy separate vocabulary flash cards unless you are in a real hurry. It was much more efficient for me to make my own flash cards with index cards, based only on the words that were new to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it.","review":"This is the best lotion I have ever used for soothing muscles.

She rubbed it on my neck, shoulders and upper back. That evening, I realized I'd broken out into hives. They didn't hurt at first but they eventually turned into a rash that had spread all along my arms, neck, chest and back! It itched and I couldn't resist the urge to scratch. Even mild scratching felt like fire underneath my skin. The reaction lasted for a week. The only thing that helped was juicing (drinking a 100% veggie juice I made to kind of cleanse me from within) and rubbing shea butter on it. Now when I go to the physical therapist, I take my own (natural and hypoallergenic) creams. I've never had this kind of reaction to a cream before but I just want to warn anyone who has sensitive skin as well as those who are allergy prone. The therapist said one other person had a bad reaction which made me feel slightly better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect massage lotion","review":"I have tried several massage lotions, and this one is by far the best I have found.

I HIGHLY recommend this for both friendly, as well as romantic, massages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting","review":"This is a great massage cream.

He's so polite, regal, and European. But Jo is pretty sure that sheila isn't a German word... This book deals not only with romantic relationships, but also family relationships. It's a bit lacking in depth, but a fun, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent movie...every American, and Aussie, should watch this film. The path to health care reform isn't through the politicians, it's through the choices people make as individuals and this film sets a great example of what each person can do to better their life and build a stronger nation at the same time. Five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Embracing change","review":"I'm not really in the mood to write a review, but something should be said, there is certainly alot of great things to be said about this movie, so lets get into my main complaint-where is the information on what the eating regiment is, how much to consume, some of the veg combinations would be helpful, some form of support site to help make you understand juicing and such, instead, the movie strongly influences you to change your eating habits, but, currently, if you try and find info about how and why this or that, there isn't anything available, just testimonials where people tell you about their struggles but nothing concrete as to a formular to follow. I reasoned that since it is a veg fast, then I will drink when im hungry, and as much as I like, this has helped me to embrace this new lifestyle, i have lost alot of weight, so it was probably just too easy and so may have been omitted. Still, it would have been nice to follow a regiment."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Long Advertisement","review":"This wasn't the worst health documentary I have ever seen. That being said, all of the useful information in this film is the same as is contained in every other legitimate health documentary out there. The real issue for me with this film was the fact that it comes across as being one giant Paid Advertisement for the juicer used in the show. The juicer, by the way, is way overpriced; there are plenty of quality juicers on the market which sell for less. Another issue I have is the way this film promotes throwing away such a huge amount of valuable nutrition by dumping all the fiber which is extracted from the juice. The bottom line: don't waste your time with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant Australian tells me nothing new","review":"Am I the only way out there not drinking the (green) Kool-Aid Joe Cross is peddling? I'm not discounting the benefits of a juice fast or arguing against it as a mechanism to jumpstart one on a path to health but where does Joe Cross get off making a movie and touting himself as a health guru.G'DAY! I'm a rich Australian who has the means to forgo work for 2 months, move to the states, and travel around sipping liquifidied kale while instructing Americans on how to live their lives!This movie wasn't informative, it wasn't motivational. It was arrogant and painfully self-indulgent. I really didn't need to be told that eating nothing but ground up vegetables for two months results in weight loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a juicer commercial.","review":"The first 20 minutes were pretty good. Then I got the point that this guy lost all this weight by doing a juice flush. After that it's repetitive and gets boring quickly. Sometimes I couldn't tell if this was a movie or a juicer commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I enjoyed this documentary quite a bit. Joe was so sincere and friendly in his journey, you can't not like him or root for his success. And when he does ask people (who could clearly benefit from a health reboot in their lives) about how they feel about their eating habits or their elevated weight, he never seems judgmental. The real inspiration is the truck driver he meets in AZ, at almost 400 lbs and with the same skin affliction, Joe offers his help. The truck driver calls Joe up weeks later and takes him up on his offer - watch this doc for that man's success story alone. I was tearing up in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education reading","review":"This opened my eyes to healthier eating and exercise.

Very funny but also inspiring. Good way to get motivated to lose weight and start juicing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome documentary!","review":"This documentary was life changing to me.

I definitely gave me the motivation to start my own juice diet which is working out quite wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See!!!","review":"This movie is informative, motivational, and very well done.

My favorite scene is where Phil is jogging at the end of the movie wearing the yellow shirt with the kangaroo on it. LOVE IT. I've watched it 3 times on hulu.com and ended up buying the DVD and watched it three times already...LOL. That's how much I like the movie and I usually don't watch TV...LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"But...","review":"This is a great diet plan for someone who does not need to be on a diet. Issue here is what you are removing from your food by juicing it, mainly fiber. Fiber can control blood sugar spikes and curb hunger. Even though you might not think of it, this is a high-sugar, low fat diet. Low fat diets are notorious for making people feel starved, and for good reason. Anyway, this is not a debate on nutrition, but a film review. As a film, I thought it was good, but as far as quality of information, evidence-based research, etc, not so much, hence the low rating. Also, not for the average overweight person with no time on their hands. Worth a watching, but think before commiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most inspirational film I've ever seen.","review":"Been studying nutrition for the last 15 years.

It had so many good reviews, I thought I'd watch it. I just had a surgery to remove my gallbladder due to debilitating attacks and large stones. I am only 27 years old. I am in the overweight category, not obese...yet. This story has absolutely moved me to tears and I want nothing more than the energy and health of these inspiring people. Surgery caused me to have panic attacks and general anxiety over my life. I am ready to make a change and this is just the inspiration I needed. Thank you so much, Joe Cross.

I have an autoimmune disease and environmental and food allergies. I am juicing now and feeling better already. My husband is a dentist and we see patients who are bigger than Joe and Phil. The dental chair has been broken from time to time as a result of this. It's a very sad thing to witness because these patients are wonderful people just like Joe and Phil.I encourage the spouses of doctors and dentists to watch this video with their loved ones. This is a conversation that needs to keep going, especially in the healthcare industry. In my own case, I probably could have avoided major surgery if I had been juicing years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat Sick and Nearly Dead","review":"This a wonderful documentary showing the great need for a more simpler diet which excludes all the pre processed and chemical laden foods.

If only more people would choose to eat healthy, there would be less sickness.Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This was such a great documentary. I loved how this film shows viewers you can loose weight just by changing the way you eat. I know they both did exercise but nothing crazy like what you see on The Biggest Loser.

Highly recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the right person!","review":"The Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead video is very informative for someone thinking about using the juicing program. My spouse decided to try it so, he purchased a juicer and, he's making juice every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Good movie good points....yes extreme to a point but certainly worth the point. I watched this about a year ago. Bought the juicer...the breval or whatever at Macy's. Good juicer actually still running. Just used it last weekend. Do I juice everyday...um no. But I beleive that juicing does give you vitamins that are bioavailable and natural. I still take vitmains and I still try and excercise. But CERTAINLY the point being made is juicing all of these great vegetables and fruits and drinking them gives a you a fantastice cocktail you would NEVER get not even from vitamins..sorry. Its a fact. If you watch...good choice. If not...your loss I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"One of my coworkers used to talk about Juicing and I used to laugh.

I was left feeling like I needed more details on the juicing itself, such as, from what source will I get protein. I went to YouTube for more info. I will say it was very interesting and encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Realistic","review":"I understand that there are many people who would watch this and walk away saying they could never drink just juice etc, etc. I think whether someone tried this for a few days or 60 like these men did, the point is to become more aware of what you put in your body, and the benefits you can receive from making smarter choices. The fact that they chose juice is just an effective delivery system that limits calorie intake but provides your body with a lot of nutrients. I think Americans have a very skewed reality of what 'healthy' means. The program they follow may not be for you, but even so you can learn from it and see the benefit of incorporating plenty of vegetables and fruits into your diet. After watching the movie I went to the website, downloaded the pdf for the long weekend cleanse (3 days of juicing), and will be trying it very soon!

However, I think because I am a normal weight, healthy individual, I have to say that fasting for 60 days is a very dramatic way (and not easily sustainable) way to lose weight and get healthy. I remember that Oprah once said (in response to the ubiquitous question, \\"what is the secret to success?\\") that \\"the secret to success is that there is no secret.\\"Really, there is no magic ingredient or diet that will help you lose weight. It is a complete lifestyle change.

Eat less, eat healthier foods (more fruits and veggies, less saturated fat and sugar, etc.) and get more exercise... very simple, but it takes time. Most people realize that putting on the weight took a lot of time, but they have an all or nothing attitude when it comes to losing the weight..... 1-2lbs a week??? NO WAY!!! I need to lose 75lbs in the next month or it doesn't count! Anywho - juicing may be a great part of a healthier diet, but why does it have to be all juice and nothing else? How about some juice, some smoothies, some whole/raw fruits and veggies and some lean proteins.... maybe even some whole grains. I know, crazy... right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Infomercial!","review":"I admit, I did like this film. But, it was more than obvious that a person's fast did not require a cross-country trek. So, I was naturally skeptical. The main guy, Joe, kept using the same juicer. Hmmmm. And he magically runs into someone who shares his rare malady. Hmmmm. But still, there was some major weight dropped throughout the film, and that's what we all care about, right? Well, try finding those \\"magic\\" recipes. If Joe Cross was really interested in anyone's health, this would be posted. Somewhere. I really think that the juicing thing might be great. I live in California, and have met many advocates. But, this film just seems underhanded. It's not about sharing information. It's about selling juicers. Simple as that.Andrea, Santa Monica, CA"},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat story, bad science","review":"It's great to hear that someone makes a positive change, not so great when they get the whole premise wrong. This show throws out a lot of the standard (and incorrect) drivel that we've been fed for years. Calories don't control weight, eating hamburgers are good for you (sans the bun) and juicing for two months puts a tremendous strain on your systems. Hormones control weight (insulin) and grains cause autoimmune diseases (ask me how I know). Juicing will cause weight loss due to lack of calories however it raises leptin levels on a near permanent basis thus starting a standard yo-yo diet rollercoaster.

We're pricing juicers and browsing juicing books because we both want to get in shape. The only thing I think it was missing was more of a woman's perspective. They did have one woman try juicing for ten days, but she didn't really need to lose any weight. Both men did a phenomenal job, but it is generally easier for a man to lose weight. I'm just wondering if the effects are as fast or similar with a woman. Can't wait to try it out though. Everyone should check out this documentary though, even if you're already in great shape.

And it does feel good, fills me up and takes away my hunger for quite awhile.I know this is a pretty poor comparison to changing your whole diet and food intake but it is a small step for me.What I really liked about Joe was when he received a voice mail from an obese truck driver who was ready to make the change and Joe traveled back to the states to help him out.He was inspirational, non-judgmental, encouraging and yet -- told us like it is while using himself as the scapegoat.Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Documentary","review":"I saw this and it inspired me to juice and take care of my body. I dont do it as extreme but I incorporate juicing in my daily diet at lease 2 times a day instead of food. Everyone should see this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to change your life? Watch this film","review":"I have never seen such an inspiring and enjoyable documentary. I watched the entire film several times and loved every minute of it. It was a stroke of genius for Joe Cross to combine his weight loss regimen with an all-American road trip and the result is a slice of Americana that leaves one chomping at the bit to try juicing. But the real star of the show is the truck driver Phil Staples. You don't meet him until halfway through the film, but his portrayal is so heartfelt and moving that people actually stand up and cheer by the time the film is completed."},{"rating":"2","title":"fat sick and nearly dead....","review":"wonderful....It works... pretty well....you get tired of drinking the same stuff over and over though... if you want to lose weight fast for like a special event, not bad, I suppose, not too unhealthy either, however adding some other juices like watermelon /apple/ peach may make it better!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"I can relate very closely with Joe and Phil, 42 year old man, over-weight and on my way to an early grave.After watching this film the first time I purchased a juicer and I am now finishing out the second day of my 'Reboot'.I had a weak moment so watched the film again to keep me on track and it worked.This film will continue to inspire me for years to come I am sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspring and heart warming","review":"This movie is so inspiring. I see two people who totally transformed their lives with this juice fast. When Phil finally lost weight and ran in smaller-size yellow t-shirt, I cheered for his victory.

Call me ignorant, but I had never heard of juice fasting up until this point, and now I'm even strongly considering a 10-day challenge myself! This movie documents the journey of a man who is, well; fat, sick, and nearly dead. This man goes on a juice fast to see if he can cure his ailments, and not only is he successful but he saves a life on the way. (An added bonus I was not expecting!)Although the medical industry calls the benefits of juice fasts \\"unproven\\", I think you can see for yourself the tremendous health benefits in this short film. I do believe that we as Americans are eating ourselves to death on a daily basis and we just need to stop and pay attention to what we're putting into our bodies.I highly recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"Great people, great efforts, great results!!!Inspiration for everyone.

Exercise.Your cells will be so happy that your face will glow in minutes after drinking juices.Life is Beautiful! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could, I'd give it 10 stars","review":"Greatest documentary I've ever watched. Truly life changing. **spoiler alert** Phil makes the whole movie.

I just bought a juicer and wanted some inspiration....oh well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. The premise of this film is very contrived. It is just playing the typical cliches. Is there really anyone surprised that one is able to consume tons of fatty food in the southern states? What is interesting about watching a guy juice fast? I am surprised that this movie is so high rated."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes it works","review":"yes it works! this is a great documentary for anybody who wants to get well. i suffered from arthritis for many years. had even surgery in the back, was not able to take care of my little son. i watched the inspiring movie and started the next day with juice fasting. i handled to make it for 3 weeks ( after 7 days of juice fasting my pain was gone)!!!... then i continued with fresh fruits and vegetables but eating them. the main effect is that my arthritis IS gone! what no doctor ever suggested or any medicine ever could heal, my body did it alone, just giving it the right food!! nice side effect is that i lost 20 pounds and am still loosing by eating only fresh vegetables and fruit. check out the book of dr. fuhrman, eat to live. watch the movie and change your life! you can do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"towel lover","review":"I just watched this video. Amazing. A must watch even if you are not struggling with weight. We all know someone who is. Mr husband is a heart doctor and sees the scenarios in this DVD on a daily basis. Everyone should watch this if they are concerned about morbid obesity becoming the #1 cause of illness and death in America. Excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting concept...","review":"My husband and I both watched this and to see the results is amazing. We do have to wonder if this guy is trying to sell you a juice machine by making this movie. Not so sure what the long term outlook will be for anyone trying this, I'd like to know. A very interesting and informative show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead worth double the asking price","review":"After watching the movie I decided to give what I learned a partial try (busy and all that). I am 50 and 35 pounds overweight. After 4 weeks of juicing for breakfast and dinner, 6\\" subway for lunch and only drinking arizone green tea with ginseng and honey (about 2/3 of a gallon a day), I lost 19.5 pounds. No other diet process has ever been able to do this for me. Plus I have huge amounts of energy.. This movie is not about a diet program, but about the real costs of eating the way we do, and presents by two phenomenal examples what can be done. Loved it all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and Inspirational","review":"This is a must-see in my book. These are a couple of typical guys from very different backgrounds who put their money where their mouths are and take action. It really has made me think about what I eat even though I thought I was being fairly healthy. The movie is very easy to watch and very inspirational. I ordered a juicer and started with a 7-day juice fast. I am not overweight but I did lose about 9 lbs in the 7 days and felt great after the second day. Now I am incorporating green juices into my diet daily and eating much less meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inspirational and motivating","review":"I have watched this DVD several times now because the story always supercharges my own motivation to eat correctly. I have not done the juice fast as the folks in the movie do but have followed their reboot program which you can find on their web site Reboot.com. It's a companion website to the movie and lays out the plan for you simply and delicously. They continue to motivate you with daily recipes and e-mails to keep you on tract. There's also a discussion forum for community support.I will be saving to do the juice fast when I'm closer to my goal weight because Dr. Fuhrman states that a fast, although healthy, slows our metabolism even after we end the fast. This is a great thing for longevity but not for weight loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational!","review":"I highly recommend this movie! I've been interested in juicing for quite some time. This has given me the push I needed to get me going! I was particularly inspired by Phil! What an amazing transformation he made! Congratulations to him! I'm ready to reboot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extensive statistics, but still unreliable","review":"Extensive statistics on support/resistance and probability of break thoughs are given for a ten year period. The good news is that it is accurate for the commodity that I checked out (lean hogs, they're were called live hogs back then), Unfortunately, the number of occurances is not given in the book. The author suggests taking a position on something that has has happened less than ten times in the last decade. Some occurances at the extreme of his price zones have happenned only once. For instance a 1 and 6 signal will have a 100% chance of doing something. No mention is given that population size is ONE! His theories of zones are interesting, and maybe this book will spur some reader to buiild on this theorey. But not this one......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This is probably the worst, most useless book I've ever read on TA. It is pretty much continuous tables of data which was not at all helpful to me. Extremely little narrative. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent knife","review":"This light-weight and stunningly sharp knife is outstanding. As other reviewers of Global knives noted, the exceptionally acute angle of the edge makes them effective at cutting.The size and balance of this knife are well suited to working with most vegetables, fruit etc. Cuts such as brunoise become much easier to accomplish using this knife.As a first time user of a Global knife, it took me a few minutes to get used to how light it is. But once I got the feel of it, it became a real favorite.Take the advice about care and sharpening this knife seriously. You can't just hone it on an average steel. Use the right stone and ceramic steel and you'll avoid ruining the edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't love this knife?","review":"I work in a banquet kitchen that produces high class cuisine on a very large scale. When it comes to chef's knives, I work alongside every brand of knife imaginable. I see a lot of Shuns, Henkels, Ken Onions, Globals, and one guy even sports his James Beard limited edition chef's knife. But the funny thing is, when it comes to an alternate knife for more precise cuts where perfection is mandatory, this is the knife in everyone's kit. I always have to be careful where I lay my knife so that no one confuses it as theirs, but it just goes to show you how great of a knife this is. The shape of the knife allows you to line up the food for a perfectly straight cut that is made simple with the thin design and ultra sharp, low maintenance blade. It definitely shouldn't be the first knife for your collection as it's not the best choice for the variety of tasks commonly associated with a chef's knife, but it sure makes a remarkable addition to any set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite kitchen knife","review":"I use this knife more than any other in my kitchen. It holds an edge and it's light and balanced. Money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it sucks!","review":"The Design of this knife is HORRIBLE! Not all people are as careful as they want to and we know what we will get (painful cut!). This brand is not taking people's security into consideration. The corner close to the handle is general really sharp and some items even have a curve that is making it worse.I am really unsatisfied that the sharpness of this brand's collection is good enough while you may get a few stitches on your skin easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds drunken","review":"I know that this recording is very beloved in classical music circles, but I do not like it at all.

Then you have a concert album where you can't tell where it was recorded and it gives you powerful track after powerful track. This is that concert album. GD puts on a great show with \\"Foot In Mouth\\", an imported album from Japan. Contains 11 tracks, all of which are great, and it's enough to make you go out and buy more. \\"Going To Pasalaqua\\" opens the show with outrageous energy and ends with \\"F.O.D\\". The only way this could be a all-time great album is if it had the audio quality of \\"Bullet In A Bible\\"........actually, scratch that. The audio quality of this album is one that gives you a feel of actually being there, which is even better.

The blurb and the included CD (advertised as containing utilities and white papers) persuaded me to buy it. The book has a rushed-to-print feel about it and could have benefited from tighter editing (e.g. it talks about the use of \\"ATMs\\" in networking--OK perhaps if you run a banking network!). Many of the figures are simply Powerpoint slides which look as though they were included to fill space. The CD only contains some vendor marketing presentations--no white papers, no utilities. I would have liked to see more about present and developing VoIP standards and competing technologies and less about the various underlying transports. The book could be more technical as well. In short, definitely not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...!","review":"I would have rated this book with NO stars whatsoever but there was not such an option. It surprises me that there are people out there making money with books like this but then again it's because some others like them (hence the good critics). I think I'd better start writing my own book on VOIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and wait for a better book.","review":"I made the grave mistake of purchasing this book, thnking that I would get some decent information regarding the topic of VoIP. What I received was a summarization of the differences between IPv4 and IPv6, outdated chapters on ATM (two of them, one of which the author didn't even write!) and solitations for the author's other book covering IP Multicasting. The editing of the book was absolutely the worst that I have seen - my 7th grader can edit better than this. I'm still looking for a good reference on the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not about VoIP","review":"Unbelievable! This summarizes my frame of mind after I attempted to read this book. Major waste of resources (paper, ink, McGraw Hill employees' time, etc.) and more importantly :-) my money!CD-ROM does NOT feature any demos or utilities. It is just a collection of pdf's and ppt's from ABL (by the way, their Director of Marketing praises the book big time in the foreword -- shameless plug), Nuera, and Telogy.

I recently bought another book (IP Telephony by Goralski) which is a much better book on this subject. Avoid this one; save both your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in content","review":"For a book entitled Voice over IP Networks, there is surprisingly little voice covered within. The book devotes 2-3 pages to the H.323 reccomendation. The chapter on audio codecs gets 6 pages, 2 of which are Windows screenshots.This book is more about networking technologies and IP-- and I could reccomend far superior books on those topics. If you're looking for a book on voice over IP, save your money and pass on this one or wait for it to show up in the bargin bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book does not talk about IP Telephony at all","review":"This book is a collection of \\"sounds new but already out of date\\" topics of ATM and IP.

The Supersuckers have a grasp on what makes rock and roll so exciting; when it's done with humor, crunch and sincerity. Toss in a little irony too. Sadly, you get the feeling that great rock n roll is becoming a lost art form; or simply put, going more underground while the Maroon 5's of the world rise to the top. Yecch!

Brock names names, and lots of them, along with history and how they relate to one another (the level of organizational incest is overwhelming.)If you're not \\"into\\" media analysis, the level of detail might be overwhelming, and perhaps boring. However, even in this case, Brock's book is a real treasure as a reference. You can look up your favorite pundit, check out that NPR or PBS sponsor, see if that supposedly unbiased pollster is on the Scaife payroll. Use the index!Politically-inclined organizations ought to keep a copy of Mr. Brock's book on file, both for its usefulness as a reference, and for a history of classic attack and obfuscation strategies used by the right wing.And, if you're a winger, you might want to check out \\"The Republican Noise Machine\\" to bask in the glow of your side's near-absolute control of what Americans see and hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Mr. Brock, I used to like living in ignorance","review":"Very good!

Absolutely fascinating.Thank you, Mr. Brock, for turning away from the Dark Side, and for writing yet another very interesting tome. I'm learning so much!You can learn too. Mr. Brock documents how in the last several decades the GOP built a powerful media machine -- newspapers and magazines, think tanks, talk radio networks, op-ed columnists, the FOX News Channel, Christian Right broadcasting, book publishers, and high-traffic internet sites -- to sell conservatism to the public and discredit their opponents. Brock also clearly shows how this disproportionate conservative influence in the media is integrally linked to the Republican Right's current domination of all 3 branches of government.Ever wonder where Rush gets his material and talking points for his radio show?

But, oh yea its us Republicans that are bad--shame, shame. What a joke. What did Hollywood do this last election? They won an election. Now, we have a Socialist President who is destroying the very principles our country was founded on.

If you're a Republican you're going to see it as another whine-and-moan fest of democrats trying to explain, once again, how they are victims.The author is a partisan who generates diviseness between parties so he can gin up book sales.In both cases, you know exactly what you are getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably simplistic","review":"For some reason, Amazon deleted my earlier review, although it was not obscene or offensive. So I'll restate it in really simple terms:David Brock contends that critics of the mainstream media are all narrow-minded conservatives who simply don't want to read about social trends they don't like.

A republican controlled congress and White House means tens of billions extra profit for each of these companies via favorable Tax and Deregulation policies. Yet the right would like you to believe that these companies generate liberal spin ?!?!

It also includes a very informative history of the Right's methods and strategies going back to the 1960s. I think this book demonstrates that whereas Liberal views used to dominate political dialogue in America Right-wing views thoroughly dominate today. But you must be interested in a recitation of facts because the book is not a \\"fun\\" read, it is more a source of tons of facts about Right-wing propaganda. And recall that this author was a very valued member of the Right-wing before he changed his views a few years ago, so he's speaking from the inside. A much more gripping and well written book was Brock's previous book, Blinded by the Right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insider Insights","review":"Whether you love Brock or hate him, he definitely has an insider's perspective that no one else can claim. Liberals and conservatives both ignore him a their own peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleaze","review":"For someone who accuses conservatives of getting the facts wrong and lying, Brock has problems with the truth as well. He manages to get biographical information wrong in about half the sections I checked for accuracy and seems particularly nasty in writing about conservative women. Brock's misogyny is well-documented. This guys has a problem with women of all political stripes. Who can forget his egregious inclusion of a story about Hillary Clinton sending state troopers out to buy tampax for her when she was First Lady of Arkansas back when he was hacking for the right in American Spectator magazine? Whether you agree or disagree with his politics, David Brock's sleazy brand of journalism has no place in serious political discourse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Credibility- \\"Journalist,\\" For Sale to Higest Bidder.","review":"David Brock, once the darling of the conservative right, now tries to claim that he was somehow coerced by the right and the money...so how does he remake himself? He grabs the cash offered up by the left and becomes a hired gun of the left. He alledges that he is the watchdog of all things conservative media...out to correct all the wrongs, errors and call to task Rush Limbaugh and friends. Please! this guy as ZERO Credibility! Hasn't any one wondered why the attack dogs of the left; Brock, Michael Moore, Algore, Ted Kennedy, George Soros, etc...are all of questionable credibility? Why can't the left bring forth an intelligent spokesperson who has more to offer then anybody but Bush?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"I read this amusing little collection of urban legends.

He's nothing but a charlatan spouting fantasy myths. The media has been dominated by left-wing liberals for decades.

The right wing has bad guys and he worked for them. He lied for money and power. However, Brock had a problem. He was sexual unchaste and intended to remain so. The people who were hypocrites on the right were okay with that. . . but the good guys would not have been. Suddenly Brock becomes left-wing.Now we have a left-wing book full of half-truths in his breathless style. And so now Brock can hyper-ventilate on the left and keep behaving badly in private. That about sums up David Brock.Eventually his bad behavior will catch up with him. . . and we can hope he will repent and find peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, poorly written","review":"I was eager to read Forgotten Fatherland because of the fascinating and odd topic. Much of the story of the Nietzsches, the colony, and Paraguay comes through in the book, but in spite of the efforts of Ben MacIntyre. Ben MacIntyre's writing is embarassingly poor.

First off it began leaking all over the kitchen counter...the stop and serve feature is poorly made and the cover of the carafe is too small to allow the flow of coffee into it without overflowing all over the kitchen. I finally ripped off the top of the carafe and that has more or less taken care of the overflow problem, well one has to make sure the carafe is pushed way to the back and just in the right position...hard to do at 4 in the morning.Also it does require about twice the coffee grounds that my old maker used so the saving in price has definitely been lost in there. My recommendation is do not get this system. It gives one headaches!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy products","review":"I have purchased two Mr. Coffee perculators. One Black and one White.

It appears the incoming water exceeds the outgoing coffee, thus overflowing brewed coffee and wet grounds all over the burner area and the countertop. This particular model has a very tiny pause N' serve stopper because the drip hole in the filter basket is also very tiny, about 1/4 inch diameter. Perhaps it is a flawed design, and we have contacted Mr. Coffee Concepts to see what they say about the problem.So, BUYER BEWARE, This model UNX33 Mr. Coffee coffeemaker is another great MESS maker !!!

The knife looked great and was extremely sharp out of the box, but within just a couple uses I thought I could feel the blade getting duller. Telling myself it must be in my head as there were so many good reviews and other people telling me what a great product this was, I put it out of my mind. The next day I bought some dense rye bread and thought I would try cutting it with my new Global knife - even though I knew it was not a bread knife, I figured it would be fine... It did cut through the bread, however after about 6 slices I really noticed how dull the blade was...I could not believe it! Now after a few more uses on nothing harder than a carrot, it is as dull as a bread knife...I can literally slide it across my palm with no fear of cutting myself. I would like to know what the return policy is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"I bought this knife almost three months ago, and have been nothing but impressed. I am a professional chef and have used this blade almost non-stop since its arrival. Despite daily use and infrequent passes on a global ceramic steel, it still remains near razor sharp. The feel, the balance, the way the blade will hold an edge, everything about this knife is amazing. It has quickly grown to be my favorite knife, surpassing even my ceramic knife which cost me three times as much and hasn't held up nearly as well. Only complaint I have is because of its heavy weight, delicate cutting such as basil julienne (which I do frequently) are exceptionally difficult without bruising the herbs. Its possible to do the job with the knife, but not really what it was designed for either in my opinion. Every knife has its purpose, this is the best general purpose knife ive ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheap looking","review":"the watch looks very cheap and nothing like i expected.

The factory edge is amazing, I have never seen a knife as sharp as this, right out of the box. Even with the Deba having only one side it is extremely easy to sharpen.

I'm sure that the other Global knives are excellent too (I haven't used them) but this particular knife is about my idea of kitchen cutlery perfection (i.e. super sharp, light, long and fine enough to handle most any job and very well balanced); however, this knife is dangerous (my wife won't touch it, another positive point) because it is so very sharp that getting a finger in the way will definitely mean a trip to the hospital.

I very much like that I can change the view (Wide,Zoom or Standard) on my TV as well as other extras that my other remotes do not have. I also like when you press any key it will light up the buttons for a short time. It is a bit big for a remote yet how else can you fit all of these buttons on here.I also appreciate that it uses 2 AA batteries rather then AAA. I also like that it comes with the feature that it will turn itself off if any button is held for more than 30 seconds.

It has excellent weight for a medium sized hand. However, the handles get quite slippery when wet, so keep your hands clean and dry while using this knife for safety. Also, if you plan on saving money on getting a cheaper steel, DON'T, because this Global blade is much harder than the Henckels/Wusthof blades; a qood quality Diamond coated or ceramic steel is a must, or if you really like the steel design, get the Global steel which can cost quite a bit. Overall, this is a good quality knife with proper care and attention needed, just like a Samurai would do to get use to his sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Global knives = awesomeness! Best knife ever!","review":"We have had knives from all the big names: Shun, Wusthoff, Global, and more.By a large large margin, I think the Shun's are the most pretty, but the GLOBAL knives are my favorite to actually own and use!PROS:* Our Global knife has stayed sharper than all the others, even though it gets a good workaround regularly* its handle is very ergonomic* its handle feels anti-slip compared to our other knives, when my hands are wet* the knife is so nicely balanced.* the knife weighs practically nothing at all* feels very easy to use.* it's just one solid block of metal, so it feels solid and easy to clean!CONS:* the knife weighs practically nothing at all, so if you are doing something like trying to cut through large thick slabs of meat or something like that, it might not have the heft (the inertia...) that you want/need. For that task, use a heavier knife, but I'm not a professional butcher so I don't worry about that! :-)Buy this knife! You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chops, minces, slices like a dream, incredibly sharp","review":"I do regret not buying the granton edge model, since the food does stick to the blade when mincing. I found that a wood cutting board works better than a cutting mat with such a sharp knife and less food seemed to stick to the blade.I have not figured out the technique of thin slicing thick objects like a potato. The shape of the knife is different than a chef's knife and I decided not to use the rocking motion on potatoes, rather just draw the knife through.There is much to learn.Also, there was a $25 discount on $125 eligible merchandise, which reduced the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"The things you can CUT with this knife....","review":"Yeah, it IS expensive, but knives are man's prime tool with which to rework the world for his intention.

Comparable in price with Wustof and Henkels, for just a bit more money you can own the GOOD STUFF!Global knives are made of one, solid, sturdy, but amazingly light piece of steel. Very balanced also! No worrying about wood or plastic handles, tangs or rivets here, nor cleaning! They clean up like a breeze.I love my knives and I know they will last me a lifetime. Remember, friends...

I found REVIVAL to be just plain boring. Sadly, I will probably rarely listen to this CD and it will end up in my \\"CD's I don't toss but don't listen to either\\" pile.

As R.C.

So it should not be recommended by anyone with any understanding of what really separates the two systems. It would be like discussing the priesthood of Christ without mentioning Melchizedek. Also, Mr. Akin never engages on Romans 5:12-21, 2 Corinthians 5:21, Galatians 3:13 and 1 Peter 2:24, all of which go to the heart of the true controversy, the imputed vs. the inherent righteousness of Christ.

Max Lucado uses everyday life situations so that you can experience each emotion that our Saviour felt in his walks. When reading this book I was able to understand some of the pain, struggles and joy that Jesus felt. I applied past experiences in my life to understand how he must have felt when he was rejected by those that loved him and cast aside by those that once called him their friend.

If you want to read someone who can accurately chronicle gay lives, read Andrew Holleran's Dancer from the Dance, The Beauty of Men, and his collection of short stories, In September the Light Changes. He is a master storyteller, and very adept at creating sympathetic and real characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious attempt at an \\"epic\\"","review":"Picano, who wrote a very good mystery years ago called THE LURE,attempts a GONE WITH THE WIND style sweeping saga but falls short. The main fault is the shallowness of the characters - they're all gorgeous, talented, rich, etc. Alistar, the fey one, is a Wall Street genius at age nine and an equal wizard on the baseball diamond. Please. He and Roger manage to be the Forrest Gumps of the Stonewall set; they turn up at all the major historical events of the last forty years, but Picano's handling of these episodes is sketchy at best. Anyone calling this a \\"masterpiece of gay literature\\" or a masterpiece of any sort of literature needs to spend more time in the library and less on the beach. Oh well. At least Picano didn't resort to present tense.

Unlike Karen Hawkins' other books, I wasn't absorbed by the story and kept putting it down when it couldn't hold my attention. The characters are flat, uninteresting and all too predictable.

Then a few chapters later, their sex scene even contains forced, contrived, and ill-timed dialog.This story has a great premise. There is tempting sub-plot potential with his twin brother, but it falls flat. Maybe it is too much of a stretch that Tristan's country neighbor, with the sheep in her front yard, is also the high-born lady that he feels he's not cultured enough for.But for me the show-stopper was the absolute lack of nuance in this story. You can see immediately where it is going from the opening scene, and that makes it not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK!!!","review":"I really loved the story line... there was so much potential, so much bought up that never went any were...

This title was obviously \\"patterned\\" after the Patrick O'Brian Aubrey Mauturin novels and should have at least shown SOME evidence that she had read them, even if only for historical accuracy. A navel captain of the time would not have refered to \\"Tinder\\", he would have said \\"Oakum\\". I know that is a small thing, but there's more. _REALLY_, at the end he SELLS THE HMS VICTORY?????

The premise was good, but the story didn't deliver. I felt that the relationship between the two main characters and the story itself, were rushed, and the characters lacked depth.

When I first bought this knife, I had spent very little time in the kitchen. However, this knife made me feel more confident while cooking -- not because of the Global brand, but because the knife did its job effortlessly. I used this knife last night and it still works very well despite the lack of love I have shown it over the years: I do not sharpen my knife regularly; I occasionally throw it into the dishwasher; and it has found its way to the bottom of the sink pile more than once.

This knife is one of those tools.Coming from 18 years of using French style knives in institutional feeding operations I was apprehensive of the lightweight and narrow bevel at first but daily use proved that my worries were misplaced. This knife and the two other pieces I have of the same brand displaced my cherished Sabatiers as my go to knives. The lighter weight meant less fatigue while the all metal dimpled handles guaranteed no cracked nor slippery grips when working with oily foods. Am not really sure about the claims about longer keeping edges. I cannot verify since I keep my knives sharp all the time (like a good chef should)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp as nothing else, extremly well balanced.","review":"I have the 12 inch version of this knife as wellas the 10 inch bread knife!Both are incredibly sharp and wonderfully balanced.Global knives use a very hard steel, so they are notdish washer proof and need to be cleaned and driedby hand after use! On the other hand it means theystay sharp for longer! Another detail is that theyuse a non-standard angle for the blade, so a normalknife sharpener will not work on them as well...Very expensive, but will last very, very long ifcared for and I really love these knives.

The rest is bluegrass. I'm not a bluegrass fan. And really, jam bands, with the exception of the Allman Bros., usually don't impress me. Yes, there are some catchy parts, but not enough.I'm sure I've angered a lot of you who love this stuff. I apologize.

Throughout the book, Macdonald bases his conclusions on God's word, the Bible.I also appreciate the way Gordon Macdonald shares from the children's perspective, describing how \\"little things\\" to adults are many times \\"big things\\" to children. He clearly illustrates the impact that our actions have on our children and on the entire family. Macdonald is tender and compassionate yet firm and realistic.

Edgar Hoover could even pretend to be objective (and still get published), but one might hope for a little effort on the part of the author in disguising the personal defamation. The author's first attack on Hoover related to his investigation of several individuals during WWI for seditious, anti-war comments and his getting them sent to jail (in violation of their 1st Amendment rights). Well, this was Hoover ENFORCING THE LAW! The Espionage Act pushed through by Woodrow Wilson and a Democratic Congress made it a crime to publish or state anything derogatory of the current administration. Also, as a mid-level FBI officer, Hoover couldn't put anyone in jail anyway, they had to be tried in court and convicted by a jury. Yet the author doesn't even hint that this was anything but Hoover's own personal crusade.

In this book, he hops around frequently, as if new ideas are popping into his head, which makes for a hard read at times. However, that being said, the book is excellent. It is well researched, with footnotes galore, and very factual. I know people that work for the FBI and I have been told the info in the book is spot-on. It's very very interesting. But, you have to like this stuff.

The presenter is a man dressed up as a tree and there's a lot of very cheesy animation and childish music that is embarrassing to an older child. My son is eleven, and although he's pretty young for his age he was way too old for this DVD.The sound quality is also very poor, during the songs, it's difficult to hear the words (which are awfully high pitched) over the music. When the animated dog is speaking, because you can't follow any lips moving, it's even harder to decipher what's being said. It's often difficult to understand what's going on, but you are encouraged to learn the voacabulary anyway.I think younger children might enjoy the DVD and the quizes but it isn't a very impressive learning tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute dvd","review":"I have a 3 and 7 year old that speak primarily English.

I like it!","review":"I'm glad I brought this DVD after contemplating about it for a year. What I like most about it is that there are Authentic Spanish people in it - which is Great for a change. I like this a lot for my 2 yr old, and it's great practice for myself as well - as we are both learning Spanish. The dog singing I could could see that being hard to understand for a child learning. The one of the best parts of this DVD, is when the dog says \\"Muy Bien\\"! Me and my child both love that part. What I don't care for about this dvd, is a small child won't be able to do the quizzes until he knows how to work the remote. But overall, I'm very satisfied, that I brought this, and I love forward to buying all that they put out when learning Spanish. I give it 4 stars. It covers a decent amount of beginning Spanish.

This new CD demonstrates the band's intelligent approach. The music is polished and some of their best. Unfortunately, Mary Ramsey, while obviously a talented musician, does not have the vocal ability to lead a band. There's a little too much vibratto, too much clarity, too much \\"made for contempory easy listening radio\\" in her voice. The band needs a dynamic lead vocalist, and unfortunately, they just don't have it on this CD. It is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing without Natalie Merchant","review":"After listening to 10KM's other soundtracks such as Our Time in Eden and Blind Man's Zoo, I took this soundtrack out from my library thinking it would be as good as the other ones. I was extremely surprised to find a different vocalist -- the music did not sound at all like 10KM! Natalie Merchant lends the band a unique sound that the new vocalist could not even remotely duplicate. This music is okay, but if you're looking for real 10,000 Maniacs, try their other albums. Without Natalie Merchant, this soundtrack really isn't worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same name, different band","review":"This is probably the worst 10KM album.

This album, a concept piece, is one on which the maniac's obviously took time and polished every step of the way. My favorite cuts on the album are \\"Ellen\\" and \\"Cabaret,\\" both early maniac sounding \\"fun\\" songs. Mary Ramsey, now the front for the maniacs wrote five of the songs herself. While she doesn't write as much about social issues, she does, nonetheless, say something through her songs. Her voice has matured since \\"Love Among The Ruins\\" which was not bad either. Hopefully maniac fans will give this album the fair chance it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their best album since In My Tribe.","review":"The Earth Pressed Flat is the best 10,000 Maniacs Album since In My Tribe.

I found it to be much more interesting than the 1997 release \\"Love Among The Ruins\\". The upbeat title track describes a whirlwind tour of the continental U.S., \\"so much there to see inside of a week.\\" \\"Once A City\\" is also nice, with a good beat and layered instrumentation. The lyrics of \\"Cabaret\\" tell an amusing story while the music has a bit of ska flavor, not unlike some of the original Maniacs' earliest recordings. What's most interesting about this CD are the 15-30 second snippets of music that come between the tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't need Natalie to be good","review":"I am more prone to give this album a 3.5 stars, but 4 is more where I'm leaning. I adored 10,000 Maniacs, and later Natalie's solo albums, but was quite dissapointed in their first album without her, \\"Love Among The Ruins\\". This album, though, is a HUGE improvement. The tracks are upbeat and positive without being repetitive; ala \\"In My Tribe\\". In fact, the whole album sounds like songs that would have been good B-Sides to \\"In My Tribe\\" singles. \\"Ellen\\" and \\"Once A City\\" are great songs in the Maniac tradition. If you remember the Maniac hayday, or like the new rise in folk/pop rock, then you should give \\"The Earth Pressed Flat\\" a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"whats the matter here?","review":"I enjoyed the last album- \\"Love Among the Ruins\\" and picked this effort up based on hearing the title track. The music is great, if not better than the Merchant days- (\\"Our time in Eden\\" still my favorite CD}. The musicianship is the best ever -ala Bob Buck. I have put this CD on the shelf because of the vocals. I don't think Mary could \\"belt one out\\" if she had to. The lack of emotion/dynamic/power in the lead vocal wastes the fine base established by the group. Each song has the same lilting vocal as the track before. The 10K habit of doubiling the lead as opposed to using harmonies only makes things worse. These guys are far from done but they need to incorporate a lead vocal with some power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teachers handbook of sloyd","review":"The book I received has 42 of 216 pages that are not readable.

Keely's range can go from silky smooth to jazzy hot from song to song. Her voice can lull you or make you jump up and want to sing along with her. This collection shows off Keely's range very well. There are some jazzy numbers, such as ON THE SUNNY SIDE OF THE STREET and some lush torch songs, like I WISH YOU LOVE. Her voice can be powerful, but not overwhelming, soft, but not breathy.

However, I never forgot that voice - and once you hear it, neither will you. It is remarkable in its quality and timbre.Nelson Riddle and Billy May, as well as a few other of the great Capitol arrangers and bandleaders, provide solid and top-notch backing for a legendary performer. DON'T TAKE YOUR LOVE FROM ME, SWEET AND LOVELY, and a host of other standards, performed ballad-style, will keep you enthralled and wondering why, with all of her style, she backed out of performing for so long.And yes-the face does match the voice.

When I read the reviews at Amazon that this is a great OOP/Design Patterns book, I was intrigued enough to snap up a copy. I am a great fan of using Patterns in my code. But the authors of this book give a completely uneducated and uninformed writing on this complex subject. Coders who are experienced in Patterns/OOP will laugh at this garbage. Novice programmers will be misled completely. I will never buy another WROX title again. My guess is that the reviewers who gave this turkey 5 stars must be friends of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book - poorly written","review":"This book pretends to teach advanced OO and design patterns and falls woefully short.

I thought I had an incredible bargain in my hands until I read the book. What a piece of trash! I do a lot of Object oriented coding with Powerbuilder on WindowsNT4.0. I was interested in the design patterns & OO programming techniques that the authors say that they are covering in the book in the preface. I have already read the Patterns book by Erich Gamma/John Vlissides and I was interested in how the authors might have applied those techniques with PowerBuilder. It was a major disappointment for me when I discovered that the authors had no clue of OO programming and a very bad understanding of Patterns in particular. They seem to know enough about Powerbuilder, but they are totally ignorant of OOP and patterns.I spent only five dollars to buy this book but still I feel ripped off.

Then one day, he decides to find out if his daughter is alive and he goes on an exhausting trip. Does he find her? I have no idea; I couldn't finish this junk.

The major themes of this book include (in my humble opinion), the fluidity of life, the uniqueness of everything, the pain of loss and the redemption of found relationships.I actually found the book very hard to put down -- which is really a contrast to some of the reviews I've read.There were a couple of very small parts that dragged a touch, but for the most part this book kept me up all night - in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the wide wide world of sports....","review":"Paperback: $6.00Hardback: $10.00Audible Audiobook (!?!?): $16.95Kindle eBook: $16.99So you are telling me the costs to print, bind ship and stock a paperback is one third the price of a Kindle version.

I found the premise very intriguing (a man who can foretell events that he will later witness), and I really enjoyed the first half. However, I found the third quarter of the book unbelievably slow and painful to plod through. The description was wonderful, and the writing finely crafted, but very, very little happened for much too much of the book. The ending became more compelling, but I never got past how much I disliked a good portion of it. Almost everyone in my book club agreed that we found ourselves skimming whole pages just to get to an actual event. I really think that a good editor should have suggesting cutting about 100 pages from the middle of this book.

When you blame, you are saying you're the effect of a situation rather than causitively doing something about the problem. It's a new view.I've read other books that say it's the other guys' fault. Where does that get you?The best article dealt with Future Goals and how neurotics concentrate only on the present or get stuck in the past failures of their lives rather than look forward.

The band is kind of crammed in together and close to the crowd, which is different from your typical shot-for-MTV performance, but that's an accurate depiction of a small-club Truckers show.What makes this DVD worth having is the sound, which is awesome. Put it on a 5.1 surround system (it has options for either 5.1 or regular stereo) and crank it up loud.The only (minor) drawback to this DVD is what it leaves out--concert staples Let There Be Rock and Zip City aren't on here--but the stuff they include is terrific.

One mistake does not a life make, and Woody Hayes is given his due here. As a big fan of Jim Tressel, and his outlook on coaching, I would have wished more content on how Coach Tressel handles (more like juggles) the coaching of a top notch program within the NCAA.

I snapped the CD up the day it came out, having been familiar with Thelonious Monster's prior output--the excellent Next Saturday Afternoon and Stormy Weather (plus their debut, \\"Baby...\\" which was not as brilliant as their later releases.) Bob Forrest, the singer, songwriter and soul of TM creates some very personal songs, and on Beautiful Mess, he aced everything. It's poetic, sad, poignant, triumphant, optimistic; a masterpiece. I'm sorry to use such hyperbole, but it is.

History of cataract surgery and the physicians who contributed to its advancement are well documented, as well. The author did a wonderful job of speaking to his audience with respect and compassion.

So, I was quite pleased when I found this one and I was looking forward to a great read. Talk about a letdown. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. The story really dragged, and the trajectory of the characters was very predictable. It could have been a great story about three women, but instead it was a boring, mundane chick lit novel that can be described as average at best. The struggling mother was not convincing or well written, nor were the two single gals.

I strongly suggest going with MoonGel damper pads, or the Evans brand mufflers, as these are small and inconspicuous, less likely to fall off or get hit by a flailing stick, and around the same price range, if not cheaper. plus the sound quality, in my experience, is way better from MoonGel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Waiting for shipment almost a month later!!","review":"Product still not here.\\"Order Placed: September 6, 2010\\"Hard to believe a product \\"in stock\\" can't ship within a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you change your Harmonic Balancer...","review":"If you change your Harmonic Balancer is preferable as a security measure also change the sensor, especially if you suspect that is not working properly ....

I have had the infantry man watch for 3.5 years now, and it is still going strong. A few scratches in the crystal have appeared over time and the watch case has a few slight dings, but functionally the watch is in great shape and it keeps time perfectly.My one criticism is that the watch band is made of paper. It fell apart on me within 6 months. When I called the company to see if they would send me a new one, they said that they did not warranty the band - I suppose I wouldn't either if I knew how quickly it would fall apart.

I cannot agree more with all the reviewers so far who have said they could not put the book down... Be prepared and leave a lazy day for this one. Seafort's dynamic personality becomes even more dynamic in this sequel. We see a lot more confusion in him in this story as opposed to Midshipman's Hope, perhaps due to the undue torment he faces from the universe. Emotionally (depending on your level of heart), this novel could make you cry, put you in a rage, and make you depressed all in the same day. It brought me to the verge of most of these emotions. Some times you feel \\"It's just not fair!\\" what happens to Seafort... But where, then, does the plot come from? Let me amend my previous statement. Get a hotel room to yourself for a night.

Rik Ocasek (of The Cars) produced this album, and the sound he brings does not fit with the off-key drunken sounding singing and musicianship on this album. While the drunk-bar band thing sounded great (and was fairly authentic) coming from the Pogues, this group just sounds [bad]. Additionally, the band does not rock hard enough to be a \\"rock\\" band. It is kind of like they tried to cross Irish rock with elevator music while simulataneously trying to sound drunk. Did they intentionally try to play their instruments poorly? I'm not sure exactly what this band is trying to accomplish, but perhaps they should have spent some more time practicing or at very least in the studio using electronic means to clean up this album.

The book quickly grabbed my interest. Except for the fact that the soldiers I was reading about were black it could have easily been just another book about another group of tankers yet the author makes sure you don't forget that because of the color of their skin they were treated differently and had a uniquely different experience. I enjoyed reading about Leonard 'Smitty' Smith and his comrades very much.The book provides a good account of yet another group of soldiers that need to have their story told. The Tuskegee Airmen, The Navajo Code Talkers and the Japanese who fought in Europe I had heard and read about. I'm glad I found this book and enjoyed it even more because it has pointed me in yet another direction to explore the history of WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"brothers in arms","review":"Great, great it was such a enlighting experence to follow the footsteps of these Brothers in Arms.

Take two of their strongest albums, put them on one CD, and make it available for less than $10. Anyone with even a remote interest in the Ventures or sixties guitar instrumentals will find this album a must. For music that is pushing the half century mark, the albums are still suprisingly accessible - my six year old daughter has been humming along with \\"Telstar\\" for weeks. As a consumer spoiled by more recent reissues (this CD release goes back to 1992), the liner notes and track information leave a lot to be desired, and at 52 minutes you would love to have some alternate takes or single only releases included to fill out the CD, but for the price the album is a great value.

WOW!I own my dads original vinyl and played it alot until this CD reissue came out. My first reaction was that the CD sounded too harsh. They remastered from the original 4 track session tapes (making it ADD). But over time, I've grown to like the revealing clicking of the picks on the strings. This should be required listening for guitar players. Learn to play like this (if you can)! It's an amazing record, and even more amazing it never gets tired after 40+ years!

It has a removable shelf, so you can even fit large items if you're willing to sacrifice some space.My only complaint with the fridge is its temperature regulation. Items I put in the refrigerator part get partially frozen, and items in the freezer part start melting almost immediately (you have to eat the Ben & Jerry's all in one go!).

It's reminiscent of his use of Pachelbel's \\"Cannon in D\\" on \\"Everybody's Jealous\\" while he was producing True Kiss Destination music. ('round 1998?) Another nice touch in \\"Don't Look Back\\" is the use of taiko style drums. Yes! In a modern-style rock song!\\"Try This Shoot\\" features Marc and, of course, lots of Keiko.

Other violinists like Heifetz, Perlman, Milstein, etc. have recorded great performances but this one, in my opinion, is the very best.The piano concerto performance is a little rough at times but is still guite good.

Using real lives and real stories (including his own), O'Connell shows men (and women) coming to terms with their pasts as they embark on the project of becoming good parents. The book avoids prefab advice; instead we get detailed examples and straight talk on hard matters. The writer tackles all the big topics, from discipline (spank? don't spank?) to the challenges that time, and teenagers, represent. Especially useful is the frank discussion of aggression and eroticism in family life; O'Connell makes the point that physical contact is necessary and important, in the right ways, at the right times, between fathers and their children. The stories are compelling, beautifully written, and informed by a deep respect for the complex realities of people's lives. You can learn more about being a good father from this book than any laundry list of do's and don'ts will ever teach you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I am about halfway through this book and am about to throw it out. So far, he has gone through a history of the psychology of mothering and fathering and tried to relate personal and client experiences. I didn't want a psychology textbook, I just wanted the author's insite on fatherhood. After reading half the book, the only conclusion he has drawn is that men are more aggressive than women and are different in their parenting styles. I already knew this and didn't need all the psychoanalysis to prove the point.The organization of the book is awful - it has no chapters. You have no idea what each section is about. It rambles on somewhat aimlessly (at least so far). It is certainly not something you would want as light reading. I would think that only a psychology student or professor would enjoy reading it.

The Royal Philharmonic completely misses the soul and fire that makes U2 great. Imagine sitting in a sports car and not getting to start it, or strapping on a parachute, climbing to 15,000 feet and not being able to jump. Well, this album is pretty much the same. The most exciting part of it is the anticipation on the trip home."},{"rating":"1","title":"disasterous","review":"This is the absolute worst cd that bears the name of U2. The Royal Philharmonic has taken these masterpieces and completely butchered them. The only song that is somewhat tolerable is One, and believe me, that's not saying much. When I heard Bono's voice redone with the oboe, I knew that I had had enough. Although, if you're a musak fan, this cd may be for you. These songs will be coming to an elevator near you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating","review":"I didn't like this CD at all. They simply destroyed songs like Desire and Even Better Than The Real Thing. That's my particular opinion, most people actually liked this CD (and hated We Will Follow, while I liked this one a lot). If you like Kenny G, Ray Conniff and the like, there's a prossibility you'll enjoy the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra Plays U2..."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I have been a fan of U2 since 1982 and enjoy different versions of their songs and hoped to find that here on this recording. I longed for a moving, string version of say, One, or All I Want Is You but found nothing of the sort. This cd was worse than Muzak, it was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming Soon To An Elevator Near You...","review":"I don't know where to begin with this disaster of a CD. I admit that when I saw the CD in the bin, I thought it was an interesting concept... if done well. This was not done well.The RPO took some incredible songs by one of the greatest bands of all time and churned out a bunch of arrangements that High School marching bands will be using in upcoming competitions. I find it an insult as a fan of a still alive-and-kicking rock band to have their music turned into Lawrence Welk fodder.Yet, it's still better than the \\"We Will Follow\\" tribute album if only for the cleavage-showing cellist on the Jewel Case artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Disappointing","review":"It's just like a high school band has gotten a thin arrangement of their favorite U2 songs for the pep rally. Furthermore, it sounds as if it was recorded in their band room. I was expecting more. It is very shallow and disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violation of your ears","review":"The best part of this CD is the bass players cleavage on the front. I'm a diehard U2 fan so when I bought this, I was hoping for sounds like I would hear from John Williams (Star Wars, Indiana Jones) or James Horner (Braveheart, Titanic) but all I got was some crap you'd hear in an elevator. I felt like I was in a Macy's department store. People who like this album are listening to a totally different album than I am. This is one selection that should be discontinued. It's like it was rushed into production so the RPO just cobbled it together. Listen to some sample music before you buy. It's not worth your time. If you look at the majority of the reviews on this page, you'll see what I mean..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not classical and worse than muzak","review":"For a good reference on how a song should be covered in a classical style, listen to Mancini's version of \\"With or Without You.\\" Wonderful buildup, delicate arrangement, good use of a rhythm section to keep the song on tempo. This CD is nothing of the sort. A shame. It's flat in sound, classical songs shouldn't be \\"normalized\\" at a constant volume!It's hard to figure out what the intent of this CD was. Electric guitar with distortion? Instead of attempting to reinterpret the songs with the feeling of an orchestra and the wonderful sound of a full orchestra, it sounds more like a high school rock group renting a 10 piece orchestra.Maybe of more concern than the lameness of this CD is the fact that some U2 fans seem to like it. Apparently anything of U2 must be good? Shows that if Bono made an album of himself using a urinal, a U2 fan would somehow find something artistic about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt upset how The RPO plays U2","review":"This is a very-very terible for The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra plays U2's music. The sounds does not match at all and not even a bit especially when I listening 'Desire'. I'm very big fan of U2 and I'm very mad of it.

I have spent a lot of time outdoors during my life, and my skin shows it. The skin on my arms had become paper thin without any elasticity. I used Udder Cream on my hands and arms daily, and am at the bottom of my first 12 oz. jar. The difference in my skin is amazing! My dried out rough skin is now soft and supple, and the elasticity is starting to get renewed. This product is NOT greasy at all, and soaks into my skin very fast.

I unhesitatingly give the CD five stars even though it would be complete, in my opinion, if I could substitute The Witch Doctor and Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini in place of two that ARE included on the CD such as Willie and The Hand Jive and perhaps The Monster Mash. Someone previously said they hate The Name Game. I think that song is ridiculously great. However, you can't go wrong in buying this. Find the lyrics to the songs on your computer and have a great sing along with some kids. That's what I am doing with my after school class of 5th-7th graders. It is sure to be a great time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids and adults will love this","review":"A lot of the classic Rock and Roll songs of the late 1950s-early 1960s on this album. This is a great album to introduce to young kids and adults who love classic rock and roll songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wolves do not attack people!","review":"I can't figure out who this movie is supposed to appeal to. Despite the title, there aren't enough horses for the horse lovers. It's too slow to hold the attention of little kids, too corny and predictable for older kids and adults. And wolf advocates won't be happy with the ridiculous sequence of a vicious snarling wolf going after some kids. Why do we keep seeing scenes like this in movies? All it does is feed the fear and hatred of wolves so many uninformed people feel. The fact is, there has never been a documented account of a healthy, unprovoked wild wolf attacking a human. It just doesn't happen, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horses?????????","review":"With all due respect to those who found this such a wonderful family film-----all I can say is that I am very glad that I streamed it from Netflix and did not pay extra to see it. The horses were in very few scenes. Indeed, it really had nothing much, at all, to do with horses. It had some of the worst acting I have ever seen, some scenes were so predictable as to be ridiculous! And that silly piano music--which was, obviously, supposed to be moving, got on my last nerve!!! The woman who played Jake's mother turned in one of the worst acting jobs I have ever had the misfortune to witness. My advice, if you enjoy good films, is AVOID this one!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing","review":"If you care about the English language, sentence structure, and proper proof-reading before print pass on this \\"book\\". Many mis-spelled words, run-on sentences, and grossly careless proofing makes this a horrible read. Not to mention the ending, which sucks.

I can't say enough about it. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau was born to sing Schubert's Lieder. Granted, the disk's sound quality leaves a little to be desired, and Moore's piano could stand to be brought to the fore a little more, but if you love music, you will love this.

The two mothers die in an earthquake in India which leaves the adult children to divide up the remaining items from the couple. Lavinia, the other mother's daughter, insists that most the items are hers and lets Abby take a few trinkets, of which includes a non-descript chamber pot.Abby has a booth in a flea market type arena where she sells her treasures. A colleague notices the chamber pot one day and tells Abby that it might be worth something; he gives her a ticket to go to Antiques Roadshow and have it appraised. Abby has nothing really going in her life and gives it a shot. The story picks up pace with twists and greed and love and really entices the reader!If you're a flea market girlie or an antiques lover, you will extra-enjoy this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to read","review":"This is a fast read, chiefly because you can skip half the text. In fact, I had to skim, otherwise I'd have gotten too frustrated with Abby, the main character, whose personality is nonexistent and inertia more than annoying.Other parts you can skip: the narrator's endless cataloging of antiques. The silly encounter with a reporter, the whole of which was a hoot, being so badly overwritten. The soppy pity parties in Abby's apartment. The conversation with the make-up artist on Antiques Roadshow. The deposition scene. Anything Lavinia is made to say. The caricatures who pass as men in the novel.I came away despising Abby, rolling my eyes at most of the characters (except Gus, Mary Agnes and Clyde -- Clyde's \\"apologies\\" are the best reading!), and feeling anxious for the chamber pot. It's pretty bad when you're more concerned for the fate of an inanimate object than the main character. But then again, I think the chamber pot is the main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated as 60's, but awesome reference","review":"This is a very good reference on interior designs.

It is really depressing to have groups like steps in our charts - they are whats wrong with the music industry today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY -GOOD POP/DANCE/BALLAD ALBUM","review":"This is the second of the three Steps album released by the band. I have the Australian release version which has 16 tracks (14 tracks plus 2 bonus.),which is practically the same as this imported (UK) version. Of the three albums, I rate this the best, slightly ahead of 'Buzz'(16 track Aust release) and Step One (13 track Aust release) not far behind it. This album has a mixture of good dance, pop and ballad songs. The female members of the group each have distincively different voices but blend in very well together along with the two guys. What I believe makes this a very-good album is that a lot of the better tracks are the ones which were not released as singles. People who have heard the songs that were released as singles will know they were good songs. This group are sometimes compared with Abba. I am a huge Abba fan, as I grew up in that era (I am 40), there are similarities with some of their music, but in other ways are very different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book that is irrelevant in architecting the real solutions for optimizing parallel execution of queries.","review":"I have found NONE information how to Optimize Parallel Execution of the query, or any practical algorithm to optimize the parallel execution of the queries.I was looking for a suggestion/algorithm/approach to design the solutions for Distributed ETLs.

Allen every time I hear 'Rorke's Drift Threatened', or grinning demonically like Cpl. Schiess during 'First Zulu Appearance and Assault\\".It is amazing that Barry could squeeze so much energy into a mere 20 minutes of music and still make it last the entire film (well diluted as it may be with Zulu chants)!It is also interesting to note that the lyrics Barry wrote to the old Welsh paen of 'Men of Harlech' have become the national rugby cheer of Wales.I think Pvt. Owen would like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Zulu War Chants","review":"I too was disappointed that there was no Zulu war chants on this CD - It really is a misnomer to say that this is the original soundtrack when it is merely the recorded music of the film and not the soundtrack.

If you're looking for practice exams: move on, look at another product because this isn't it. Their practice test contains 65 questions, that's it. Oh, there's a teaser to purchase more questions but 296 isn't on their list.IMHO, this book isn't for an in-depth review of areas that might crop up in the 296 test.

Very steady in use. Plenty of height adjustment.I find that the wand that holds the iron cord above the board is marginally useful.The supplied electical outlet (merely an extension cord) is not of the three pronged plug type. It is also located beneath the board so that plugging and unplugging the iron is quite troublesome. I replaced the supplied cord by fitting a standard three-prong extension cord; this required bending the metal clips that retain the supplied cord.These two dubious features hardly seem worth the 1/3 greater cost compared with the IB6200 model in the Rowenta line. The IB6300 does have a somewhat different leg design and the legs are chrome-plated instead of painted steel--helping to justify the higher price.The iron rack requires fitting by bending a metal tab--a simple adjutment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy, but also quite heavy.","review":"This is a good ironing board if you are wanting something heavy duty and far from the typical \\"rickety\\" type.The board is quite broad and the pad allows plenty of steam to go thru.I took one star away due to the platform/hanger in the back getting in the way of actually using the back of the board, which I used to iron the backs of my button up shirts on my other ironing boards.I would have taken another away for the weight, but they added small wheels to ease moving.I can suggest this board to anyone who wants a \\"beefy\\", stable ironing board. But If I could do it over again I would have invested in a deticated ironing station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor padding","review":"This ironing board has a nice large surface which I appreciate but, the ironing board cover is terrrible. It has very thin padding and after a few uses the padding feels non existent. I'm having a horrible time trying to find a new cover and pad that willl fit this particular board because it's so large. I purchased it at Bed Bath and Beyond and sadly, even they don't have covers large enough to replace this weak thing that the manufacturer provided. I've had to rig a makeshift cover and pad. It's very disappointing because I expected so much more from Rowenta."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fancy version of a Walmart version","review":"This is a great ironing board. Barrowed it from a cousin for a month. Then I found a board at walmart almost identicle. The walmart version isn't chrome and only has two layers instead of three, and there aren't wheels on the front legs. All for only $39.So if asthetics of chrome and wheels are needed go for the Rowenta, but for the money, the walmart version \\" Home (something )\\" is what I recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I read this book and was absolutely engrossed in it. Really good writing. I couldn't put it down. I don't want to give it away, so enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portrait of the Artist as a Madman","review":"Hmmm...am I the only person who saw the ending coming pretty early on in this story? Though well done, this was just a detailed depiction of a dopey guy going nuts. But Goldman does have a point about those dummys--they sure do seem sinister, like they're itching to commit...murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"Fortunately this is a quick read because it's a pretty awful book. The main character had possibilities, but the plot is predictable and stretched thin for the second half of the book. It reads as if Goldman had the movie in mind as he typed. In fact, it reads like a script-writing class assignment complete with three acts. Save yourself some time and read Rosemary's Baby by Ira Levin if you're looking for some old-time horror to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight Zone episodes were better...","review":"I know, I know...the Twilight Zone was not a book but a TV show. It's just that by the time this novel came out, Rod Serling had presented not one but TWO different versions of the \\"almost human\\" dummy idea with Cliff Robertson and Jackie Cooper in two different tellings. It is not difficult to conclude that those episodes influenced Goldman in writing his novel. What a hack!For my purist bucks, I prefer the works of the originators of ideas. In this case, I prefer Serling to Goldman and you don't have to sit through hours of reading this to be creeped out. It's all over in 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat Performance","review":"(...) I loved Marathon Man by William Goldman and thought this would be a winner. Sorry, you lose.

Corky's descent into madness is funny, painful, violent, disturbing, and so so sad. There are some fabulous kickers in here--prepare to be surprised. Found myself forgetting everything as I plunged through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Interesting Book","review":"A long-forgotten little gem of William Goldman's, it's becoming more and more difficult to find this book anywhere. I was lucky to have found my copy in the library. The book is both very funny, touching and violent, with moments of brilliant humor, suspense and romance scattered throughout. Goldman can make a somewhat silly idea seem unquestionably plausible. The book switches back and forth from present time to the past, then back to present time. Also, the movie (starring Anthony Hopkins and Ann-Margret) is wonderful if you can find a copy as they too are scarce. Great to read and watch if you can find copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is truly magic","review":"Goldman is one of my favourite writers. What a pity he no longer writes novels but has now devoted himself to the screen world. Of all his books, I liked \\"Control\\" the best, but \\"Magic\\" was a good enough second. His style is brilliant, just brilliant. As for holding the reader's interest, well, not for one moment can you put this book down. I kept saying I'll go to sleep now but 4 or 5 chapters later, I was still holding my breath and turning the pages with awe. Way to go, Mr. Goldman. Couldn't we have more, please. I have read all your books. I think your successor is Peter Abrahams, but would like to read more Goldmans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great psychological horror novel","review":"Too bad this book from novelist/screenwriter William Goldman has fallen out of print. This is great psychological horror that reads fast (most of the book is dialogue) and has some genuine creepy moments. It's a kind of combination of Jekyll & Hyde meets The Tell Tale Heart mixed with magic and ventriloquism. It seems a mixed bag, but it works.If you like the other horror books of the '70's -- The Other; Rosemary's Baby; The Exorcist; Carrie -- then you'll like this one. I've read people complain that this is like a long Twilight Zone episode, but since when is that a bad thing? The jekyll and hyde theme is one of the most basic in all of literature. And creepy dolls are SCARY! Try to find this at your local library, used book store, or garage sale. It's a great weekend read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thursday the 12th","review":"The story line was very good, liked the way each major player presented the story line as they saw it.

I had already packed the unit up to return it but opened the package and inserted the gasket. It works perfectly now. Sprays a fine mist just like the store-bought cooking sprays. I wish that Amazon would allow me to re-rate this item. I would give it 4 stars. (My only complaint is that there is no reference to or warning about the gasket in the instructions. Since it is a loose piece and small, it is easily lost. I'm glad the strainer was in the drain or it would have been lost without my ever knowing that it even existed.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great until it broke","review":"I loved this product, but after a few months, the bottom popped off while I was pumping it. I don't believe that I over pumped it - I just think it's not stong enough to hold the pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love love...","review":"The only problem the reviews say it has is that the bottom breaks off in 9 months or so. I found a remedy to that in a review on another mister that to avoid that just open the cap to release the air pressure after using it. Then, the air pressure won't pop the bottom off in a couple of months, I think.It not only has the regular oil pump but a tube inside like regular sprayers have to make it work better, I think. It also has a filter at the end of that tube which they say prevents the nozzle from clogging. It is really elegant looking. I like this better than my old mister."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great before it broke!","review":"This product was great before it broke after 6 months of use. I had contemplated buying a few more for different oils, but it recently sprung a leak in the bottom. What a bummer! It sprayed great and never clogged, but one day it just stopped working and had leaked all over the place. I had even taken extra precaution by releasing any extra pressure by unscrewing the cap after using it, because I had read about sprayers that would stop working right. But maybe the other reviewer is right about the oil eating through, because the leak is right at the seam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months DON'T waste your money","review":"When I first got it worked well for the first 6 months, then the bottom leaked and it had no pressure. Like many reviewers who had the product, I did not over-pump or overfill. It is simply not durable. I relied on this sprayer for my cooking and I'm extremely disappointed. Not only did I WASTE my money on the cost and shipping, but it made a big mess. What a hassle. I recommend a sprayer that has no chance to break on the bottom. It would be better if it were all one piece instead of the fused bottom, which is too weak to withstand normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a month of use","review":"I used mine for a month, and was in love with it until this afternoon, when I found it dripping all of its oil out into my pantry. I knew I was taking this risk from the other reviews, so I was very careful not to overpressurize. However, if not pumped enough, it just spat large droplets into the pan.Many thanks to Amazon for replacing the product, but I can't recommend the product, only Amazon as a supplier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within one month","review":"I was pumping it and the bottom blew off and left oil all over myself and the kitchen.

But I think the book should also talk about legal immigration. I am an immigrant from Germany and my goal was to become an American and leave everything else behind. I promised to never rely on any welfare and in all the past decades I never have. There are rarely people who recognize that I wasn't born here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring page-turner","review":"The issue of immigration will determine, more than any other, the kind of nation we leave to future generations. Will America be a recognizable country of law and individual liberties, or will it continue down its current path of becoming a colony of Mexico?Fighting Immigration Anarchy focuses on the actions of a growing group of citizen activists who are trying to stem the tide of three million illegal aliens entering yearly from Mexico and elsewhere. The six patriots picked for special attention typify the grassroots movement to save the country from the open-borders agenda of the White House and other globalists.The book tells the personal stories of the six patriots pictured on the cover, and in doing so, informs the reader of important recent history of how citizens have fought back against a government that won't protect against invasion. The book is an inspiring page-tuner, with an old-fashioned theme of what determined Americans can do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for all Americans","review":"I think this is the best book I've read on the topic of immigration, especially illegal immigration and how it is damaging this country. The people portrayed in this book are heroes, fighting the good fight to save the country before it is too late.

I am so happy it is finally available for kindle after i requested two month ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Incredible So-Whatness of Being","review":"I was lured into reading Under the Volcano after seeing its inclusion on the Modern Library's One Hundred Best of the 20th Century and after reading a reviewer compare it to James Joyce (I am an amateur Joycean who tries to read Ulysess, Portrait of the Artist, and Dubliners at least annually). Lowry has nothing that likens him to Joyce. This book is leaden and tedious. I forced myself to finish it because I hate to start a book and not finish it. But it was no labor of love. It was simply a labor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow......","review":"Positives: Lowry writes a very good insight about an alcoholic's existence. Also the descriptions of the scenery make me want to travel to Mexico and view it myself.Negatives: I found myself begging the book to end from the halfway point. Too much imagery and not enough substance to the story. You better be up on your Spanish too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self destruction in T-minus 12 hours....","review":"Under the Volcano is a complex and beautifully written novel about one man's pitiful course towards destruction. Rich with dark portents, immense detail, and symbolism; its tragedy will draw forth uneasy laughter and unrestrained sympathy from the reader. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complex and brilliant novel.....","review":"This book is like a very poetic and enchanting accident by the side of the highway, despite the fact that disaster lurks, you just can't help looking over and then being drawn in by it. Similar in narrative style to James Joyce, Malcom Lowry is more accessable and his meanings sink in more with the passage of time. It has been weeks now since I finished U.T.V, yet it keeps revealing itself and its meanings in ever more complex ways. Picture a stone thrown into a pond and the ripples circling out into infinity and you get my point. Because of the stream-of-consciousness style, it can be confusing at times. Like any great book though, patience is a virtue that is highly rewarded. Sad, poignant, and revealing this novel (ranked #11 on the '100 Greatest Novels of the 20th List') is one that beyond being merely engrossing also packs one hell of a walop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose stream-of-consciousness","review":"Interesting book, but very stream-of-consciousness.

For a foreigner like me it helps a lot one's understanding to read and listen at the same time.

Some of them (\\"himse;f\\") suggest that an earlier text was scanned for this reprint. But if so, it's clear that the publisher didn't bother to have anyone proofread it. With some books it's easy to spot typos, but not _Under the Volcano_: in part because much of it is written from a perspective of maximum alcoholic intoxication, so you'd be justified in thinking the sloppy spelling is somehow meant to approximate that state of mind; but the typos are also misleading because the text is filled with obscure references and a medley of foreign languages. If you're really intent on reading Lowry's masterpiece, find an old hardback or look for the British Penguin edition. This one's a wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't go any further","review":"I slogged through the first 100 pages and ave decided to give up.

Another overrated \\"masterpiece.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"Wow ... but not in a good way. My reaction to Lowry's novel is a realization that page after page of such stylized writing, such carefully written sentences, is packed with so much. Too much.It's all a rush of style but so little substance. The struggle to wind my way through this maze removes any hope of actually enjoying the characters or plot. It's dense. It's thick.

I found myself speeding through to get to the next moment of the story.I can see the author is talented, but this is not my style of read and I cannot say I enjoyed this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutal","review":"This was a painful read.

Oh the humanity!","review":"Wow, I've never tried to read a book that was so unreadable. Lowry must have taken great pains to make this book as annoying as possible. There is no fluidity, the action and drama is convoluted, and there is no cohesiveness to the entire story.I'll be honest. I could not finish the book. This is the only review I've written where I did not read the entire novel. I, however, felt that 100 pages were 90 pages too much.This is the type of book that turns off casual readers to classic literature. Only the most fanatical English majors could enjoy reading this book. It's a shame that this particular book is highly regarded, because it takes away from real works of literature that everyone should enjoy.I would only recommend this book to English professors, and only a few of my worst enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming volcano","review":"My immediate and continuing impression of the book was: This is the work of an amateur, and should never have been published.

The ironic thing is this map has a small section of Chinatown & Union Square that is exactly the type map I wanted but for a larger area. The map is laminated and folded with 7 panels on each side. It is a decent map if you are looking for a particular street but the print is small and it covers a large area on two sides with a good portion of one side taken up with the street index.

The video depicts mean bishops refusing to allow Tyndale to bring the Bible to the people through an English translation. In reality, the Church had no problem with an English translation - it had a problem with **heretical** translations, which Tyndale's was. The Church took very seriously the accurate translation of the Word of God, and in fact produced its own English Bible (the Douay-Reims) very shortly after Tyndale's version. This video just perpetuates misconceptions about the Church and creates division where there needn't be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedside Box","review":"Product sizes are so small, lube is 1 oz.

This recording is one of 2 recorded by Steeplechase Records in February of 1976. The other equally fine recording is \\"Tete-A Tete\\" which you should get as a companion to this recording.

This liner is light weight and of what appears to be a mostly plastic with a little rubber mixed in. The price for this is in line with an all rubber heavy mat, not a piece of thin plastic. When I installed this, it will not sit tight against the molding under it. It is rigid plastic, so it wont lay and hold flat. Not impressed for what you pay for this.

This book is filled with the hard work and dedication of one boy, Paul-Edward, the son of a white plantation owner and a black mother who was a slave on his daddy's plantation. Paul-Edward had one dream and that was to own land. However, as a young half-black man, this was to be no simple task. This book is very inspiring and touching. The dialect that Mildres Taylor uses creates a very realistic plot and believeable characters. It is easy to see in this book that Taylor tries to show actions that lead up to the Civil Rights movement. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a story filled with suspense, perseverance, and touching dedication."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book","review":"The book The Land was a great book a bout a boy named Paul Logan who was just trying to get by. he was th son of a white man and a black women.

Paul wants to buy his own land though whites, long time ago made it hard to. Later on, things bad happen and Paul is forced to make decitions he has never had to make in his early boyhood.I liked this book, but I think the writer made it a little too sad.

After sitting and reading it over the couse of a week - my brain is screaming complete disappointment.Approximatly 70% of this book is comprised of recycled plots. Plots we've seen on tv (L-Word, Tois,) the other comes from the imagination of a potential non-lesbian. The remaining 30% was very well written. The plots were amazing and very creative.Overall the book is poorly written, the dialogue sucks, plots predictable and very far fetched -- all in all... i'm amazed the author is published. I was extremely disappointed in some of the stereotypical references and situations in the book. One of the associations between molestation and the homoseuality is borderline dangerous. I didnt care for this book at all. Save you're money - unless the book is being sold for $3 used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew !!!","review":"I found this book to be quite interesting.

Judith thought that all had gone pretty well, until she is informed that one of her neighbors, who had just received a big inheritance, was stabbed to death in the nursery. Joe asks for her help and she of course can't say no.This is one of the best books in the series. Judith and Renie's attempts to investigate are hilarious, as are their neighbors and family.

I thought the book description sounded fun and interesting: a murder by a bunny-suit clad perpetrator to be solved by a Bed-and Breakfast owner. I thought this would be a laugh out loud book because a few reviewers described the book as hilarious. I was wrong.I thought there were too many characters. Keeping track of them was a bit cumbersome at first but then the main suspects and characters were more front and center so remembering who is who became easier. I felt the pace dragged a bit and then towards the end came to a screeching halt. I found myself skimming just to move forward and had to go back and re-read. I thought there was a very strong Christian/Catholic influence. I think this book should be listed as Christian Fiction.

The presentation provides sample reading comprehension and vocabulary consistent with the form and content on the GRE. The mathematics is divided by level of difficulty. i.e. easy, intermediate and difficult questionsThe difficult questions are just that. i.e.GIVEN: Given m+ n = 24 and m - n + p= 15 then 4m + 2p = what numberm+ n = 24m- n + p = 15__________________2m + p= 39 therefore 4m + 2p must be 78The section on vocabulary is helpful to identify typicalwords tested. Overall, the book is excellent; however,parts of the exam are elusive.This is not the fault of the publisher. It is the nature ofthe exam itself.

Instead, I got a story that seems to take about 3/4ths of the book to set up, and then wraps up so quickly you wonder if pages have fallen out of your copy. Ana is the daughter of a vain, beautiful mother, who only seems to love Ana if she is not a threat to her beauty. To gain her mother's love, Ana gains weight, doesn't wash her hair, and picks up other icky habits. Then Ana's best friend gets an invitation to attend a private girl's boarding school and before she knows it, Ana is send away to join her. Add in a little strange man that follows her mother everywhere and we're about halfway through the book.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it.","review":"Carrying three stars on Amazon.com, Beauty by Nancy Butcher, deserves that score. I enjoyed the beginning of this book immensely; Queen Veda is obsessed with her own beauty and will not accept anyone else over passing her. Her daughter knows this, so Ana disguises her own beauty and attempts to make herself as ugly as possible to win her mother's love. But then she is sent away to an Academy blah blah blah...Yeah, as soon as that part of the plot came in, the book unraveled quickly. Many of the reviews say that it is too short and rushed; this is a perfect description.Avoid it, unless you are looking for something to read for an afternoon and have Nothing Better To Do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"This novel never took off. It had an original beginning, but the lack of character development of Ana left the reader frustrated and bored.

Ultimately, after my second reading I decided I really liked it. This is the story of a young Dutch girl named Flory and how she survived the Holocaust in the Netherlands. There were some very different twists and turns in her story, the main one being that she was approached on the street wearing the Star of David as Jews were ordered. A Dutch man in the Resistance asked what that was on her blouse, (the star), told her to take it off and follow him home. Flory described her situation and he offered to hide her in his house with his family. A most unusual happening since many Jews wanted to hide, but were unable to find somebody willing to risk hiding Jews. A very touching book, although it took me a while to get into it.

Collard plays the two concerti with virtuostic magnificence, imbuing them with the alternating buoyant jollity and emotional sensitivity required of these idiosyncratic pieces. The adagio of the Concerto in G is particularly arresting in its delicate luminescence. The balance of the disk is comprised of familiar solo piano works, gorgeously rendered, including the four-hand version of La Valse (fascinating if you only know the orchestral). The analog sound quality of the concerti is lush and vibrant, whereas the solo pieces are a bit dry by modern standards. Considering the budget price tag, this is a winning recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks just like our dog!","review":"My nephew loves our dog, so I sent this to him as part of his birthday gift.

The Wolfman is the worst of the bunch. It's told by a woman, who by my standards, isn't very good at voice acting. Then of course there are the sound effects at the end. Not very scary.

It is, as the other reviewers pointed out, incomplete, missing one of the most important pieces - the peroration to the Five Tyrants. Gildas himself wrote in extraordinarily complicated and idiomatic (if grammatically perfect) Latin, whose understanding has greatly improved (as if you couldn't guess) in the years since 1844, and certainly needs a better translation. And as if that wasn't enough, there are at least two more recent and perfectly functional translations, Williams (1899) and Winterbottom (1978), the earlier of which is out of copyright, perfectly available and has a commentary parts of which are still valuable. So why did Penguin resurrect this prehistoric oddity? They must be mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not the whole book!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the J.A.

Classroom Heroes is an amalgam of short biographies written about several teachers with whom the author has worked in the classroom. The author interviewed several educators, not simply about their job tasks but more about the passion and motivation that each educator carries in their hearts. It is in this respect, the personal struggles of each educator, that the book soars above typical biographies. As a non-educator, why would I read a book about teachers? I'm a working parent of three school-age children who wants to know more about the people who spend more time with my kids than I do. This book and the people portrayed gives me great hope.

And this book has been the best so far I think. I continue to enoy Pharaun, but the book's biggest plus has been Danifae and Quenthel. The battle scenes are well done as we get more one on one battles instead of the large scale stuff. Perhaps best of all is the romp thru the swamp with the surprising ending. I will say no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book, Great Series","review":"It seems as though the author didn't read the other books. Characters' physical descriptions are inconsistent with the other books. Kaanyr Vhok was red, now he's blue. Jeggred was immune to fire, and now his fur gets burned. The dialogue is overly simplistic and is awkward to read. Almost all of the spoken dialogue is broken up: \\"Hey,\\" said Valas, \\"don't go in there.\\" instead of \\"Don't go in there,\\" warned Valas. The overly simplistic dialogue dilutes the characters' personalities as well, so they all come off as bland.The climactic events in the story seem very anti-climactic because they are interrupted by extremely minor events and the effect these climactic events has on the party and the rest of the world is never fully explained. Also, some of the tactics in the battles make little sense. It's almost as if the characters forgot how to fight. Skim this one and pray that the final book isn't this bad. Mel Odom is writing it, so I have high hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basura!","review":"Definitely the worst of the series. Can't believe what Athans did to all characters: none was the same as in previous books.I finished this book beacuse my sadistic mind kept telling me this was just a bad dream of Jeggred who finally awakes at the end! (Yes, that would have been a better plot!)And I agree with many others: (spoiler coming.....) Ryld's death is pointless, stupid, inconsequential, ilogical and, worst of all, boring.The worst is you can't skip it and go directly to book 6.PD. I'll never buy another book by Athans."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I have loved all the books in this series so far. this one was no exception. Great storytelling. Very descriptive battles, although some of them seemed to be a bit long and overdrawn. All in all a great addition to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book in the series","review":"I did not like the way the author altered the characters to his liking. To assume Quenthel would be weak and stupid just doesnt make sense. Someone of her power wouldn't waiver in her faith to Lolth.The plot was just plodding to me. The Dyrr/Gromph fight took way too long. The way Ryld dies is just weak to me. He's such a great character and you are gonna off him so easily?Phaurun did appear more powerful in this book which I enjoyed seeing. I hope he gets Jeggred in the final book, that creature is just annoying at this point.If you are a fan of the series then read the book, we can't change what has already been butchered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time and money","review":"The worst book in the series so far. In about three hundred pages, almost nothing happens: three battles, one eventless trip to the abyss, and that's it. The thin plot stretchs dully over all too many pages, the characters behaviour differs completly from their behaviour in the prior books (Distinctly, Quenthel), and there are lot of mistakes in the plot as well (for instance - the way Nimor appears out of nowhere after Gromph got rid of him in Extinction).My advice: read the summary and skip to the next book in the series. Hopefully It'd be better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow....","review":"Like really, i mean its bad enough Athans messed up the baldur's gate's 1 and 2 novels (THe problem here i think was that he never played the game, I mean Minsc with long red hair..c'mon!) but now this book?...please stop butchering books, stop writting."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck...","review":"Agree strongly with whats been posted already. I awaited the printing of this book because the first 4 where great. this book left me disapointed and turned off to the whole series. What happened to ryld was a complete waste.

The way the characters interact with other characters seems to have changed and aren't consistent with the other books. Some people claim it is the result of drow being chaotic but it is something more fundamental. It seems like the author didn't really know the characters he was writing about.

Before this album came out you can point out E-40 because his style is original...one of a kind. In this album he slowed down a bit for others to understand him, but still pay attention for he always has subliminal messages in his rhymes. There are definately songs on this album you can \\"go dumb\\" to. I not a big fan of the southern style, but the southern style on the second half of the CD shows versatility.

I was a big fan of his from the 90's and I had always hoped that he would come out with a new album. It's my belief that he is one of the great hip hop legends, that no one ever heard of. That is until this album came out. But I digress, the radio singles are good the rest of the album isn't anything to write home about. Over all though it's enough to keep me happily listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strike one","review":"Hmmmmm....I was not impressed by this release by E-fizzle. There are a few cuts on here, but the majority is not up to par. Maybe I'm just getting old but I liked the old E-40 waaaay better. This album seemed very commercial. But I can't hate on the dude. He has been on the grind for a loooooong time. He just now hit mainstream with this new deal with BMI. And congrats to the Big Homie.

At any rate, \\"Awakening to the Tao\\" reads like a tedious commentary on the Tao Te Ching that says far less in many more words. There are occasional insights that are worth reading, but they could have been condensed into about 5 pages; I would have happily done without the other 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are these people?","review":"These two authors have irresponsibly perpetuated a very negative stereotype with their Hispanic mistress. Sure, the stuffy butler is English and the tacky woman who's from the trailer park has a father in jail, so everyone is a stereotype, but the mistress character so infuriating I wished I could smack the authors' across the face. Of course I don't do that kind of thing, but that's how mad I was. Please don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do NOT waste your time!","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. I had to stop about a third of the way into it because I simply couldn't suffer anymore.

I generally read a book in one day, maybe two. It took me a week to struggle through this mess. You expect a book about \\"upper\\" society to be pretentious but this bordered on ridiculous and obnoxious.

Then try the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich, anything by Whitney Gaskell or Emily Giffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"I did not manage to get through this book.

The novel was so filled with wooden stereotypes of socialites that it could have been written by anyone. In fact, all of the characters are stereotypes -- the stiff, British butler, the hot-blooded Hispanic mistress, ad nauseum. If you're looking for witty writing (save for a few unusually snappy lines, the writing is below average at best), interesting characters, or an absorbing plot, look elsewhere. I struggled to make it to page 100 before casting this book aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dangers of editing by spell check...","review":"If this book were about anything other than Park Avenue Princesses, I might let it slide. But, to gush over their \\"brilliant\\" editor and claim an \\"elite boarding school\\" background when errors such as \\"MASON du Chocolat\\" and \\"petits FOUR\\" show up in your book is, as characters Joan and Wendy would snark, \\"tacky, Tacky, TACKY!!\\"Typos aside, the writing is as wooden as one of Artie \\"The Coffin King\\" Korn's top o' the line teakwood specials.Save your money and read Michael Gross' 740 Park instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"giggling all night","review":"I think this is such a funny light read-- It made me miss New York so much-- but also made me happy I left it-- the catty, hilarious remarks are quick-witted and very City-- it was like taking trip to Park Avenue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best Book","review":"It's a tired cliche about a lower-class woman from Florida being shunned because she wasn't of right background, upper-class adultery, one of them involving a Mexican housekeeper turned mistress of a very prominent man whose life with his proper wife has been of boredom, yadda, yadda. A \\"gay\\" man gets murdered in the \\"wrong part\\" of town.This book has loads of cliches of the upper class. It wasn't well-written. I recommend Plum's book, Bergdorf Blondes or The Nanny Diaries. At least those books aren't boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read, skip, read, skip","review":"I have to admit, I did not know exactly what to expect with this book, and I was a bit disappointed. Parts were funny and watching how some characters, especially Melanie developed and how Joan and Wendy were humiliated was amusing, but overall it was a very hot/cold book. The \\"inner-workings of the Manhattan set\\" was interesting, especially \\"accepting\\" an outsider, but overall, I skipped chapters and read ahead because it was a bit slow and wordy in parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and vapid","review":"The other reviewers have been right on target. Too bad I did not read their comments before I picked up this book. It is boring, mindless, and not particularly well written.

Don't wste your time - make a different choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very offensive","review":"Trash all the way. The writers not only insult their characters but also readers who may find themselves and their style/taste looked down upon in the most offensive way. Any book that insults and alienates it's readers in such way deserves one star, but the book also comes short in plot, character development and dialog.

Truly-in absolute sincerity, the most cliched, vapid, banal piece of garbage ever to utilize paper! How or why the two authors decided to show their faces on the back is beyond me. There is no plot, no climax, absolutely nothing to be learned, gleaned, or contemplated from this waste. Had this been written in a classroom setting it would have been given an F at any grade level. How this got published is proof that the \\"dumb down\\" is a real phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring & whiny","review":"I didn't see a plot or a point to this book. It's incessant whining about rich people's 'lives' as the Social Elite of Manhattan. Plus, it has lines in it like 'She burgled his breath right out of his lungs.' The authors try way too hard for catty and end up sounding jealous. It was a total waste of time to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really awful","review":"I got this book for Mother's Day. At first, I thought all of the negative reviews must be all the people in Manhattan that were upset with the authors. Well, I don't know a soul in New York and all the negative reviews were right. I don't like the main character at all. She's crass. You don't root for her to be accepted, and I think that's the whole point of the book. I returned it to the store to get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!!!","review":"The only reason that I continued to read this book past page 50 is because it was book club required reading! It is a book where you route for no one.

I am familiar with the 10021 neighborhood of NYC and I have never met \\"mean girls\\" like these. The editing also fails to check out the details. For example, on page 79 Arthur orders coffee. When the waitress brings the order, she spills the COKE on his pants. Trivial I know, but careless. I do not have a problem with reading trash from time to time, but this is too trashy even for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Right Address","review":"I thought the book was really good.

Definitely interesting and it had a great ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cute story...","review":"I liked this story, I liked all the characters especially the klepto! Her character was very likeable and the klepto angle made her human... not just a perfect Park Place Princess!I did not like Maria, the janitor turned tacky mistress. It just didn't seem real, this high power professional man wouldn't get himself involved with this ghetto person. No way! They could have down played her a little, bossy yes, fulfilled his wishes, ok, loved to shop, sure... but it was taken too far! I loved her ending though! Perfect for the annoying character!All in all, it was a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bof...","review":"Didn't like it at all. Well written, undoubtedly, but the story is flat and boring.

Her sentences are jumbled and all over the place which makes for a terrible uneven flow. She describes 5 or more characters in 3 pages which has me so confused as who is who..I even tried 'Wolves in chic clothing' and felt the same inexperienced nonsense and hoopla. And describing things just goes on and on, I found myself skipping pages just just to get it overwith. Her books are boring and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old story, no interesting twist!","review":"The good news is that I paid only 50 cents for this book in hardback at a thrift store. The bad news is that I would have been really upset and disappointed if I had paid $12 for a paperback! I finished it only because I started it, and it was fairly short. Unfortunately, there is absolutely nothing notable about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK ChickLit","review":"I was initially surprised it took two people to write this book.

It sounds like it was written by two mentally challenged teenagers who have been living on a steady diet of soap operas. I did my best to atone for the sin of buying this piece of trash by burying it deep inside the garbage can so that I wouldn't subject anyone else to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do you find a wealthy husband???","review":"What a great book......fun reading, easy to read and a insight into how a small fortunate (or not so fortunate) group of women live on the Upper East Side of NY.

If this is what \\"society\\" in New York is like, than remind me to stay away, though I am sure the authors intended us to have all our ideas of \\"rich folk\\" confirmed in one fell swoop. However, with that said, it is a quick read that will neither titillate you nor truly bore you. If you're stuck in an airport, or looking for a harmless read (albeit one with a lot of typos), then this one is not so bad.It is all about social climbers, typical unhappy-though-richer-than-God women, and old transparent gossips. If you are a reader like me, that likes to supplement your reading of book club books, classics, and prize winners with fluff, then you will surely not be disappointed. Like the Devil Wears Prada, Bergdorf Blondes, etc, this book is utterly forgettable fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"It took TWO people to write this book?","review":"It is a snore and bore of a book.

It all adds up to irritation that I spent time and money on this drivel. I'm all for a book that dissects the upper tiers of society, in this case New York's. And maybe these people are as banal, uninteresting and hackneyed as the authors portray them. But I can't believe that the Pygmalion story couldn't have been told with more wit and sparkle -- and a lot less predictability. If you want name dropping and brand mentions, buy Vogue. At least it has photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash at it's worst","review":"Althought I finished it after Labor Day,this was bought as light beach reading but really doesn't qualify as that.

I recognized descriptions from other books and tv shows (\\"Seinfield\\", \\"Sex and the City\\"). The biggest difference is that this book is the most poorly written, poorly edited piece of garbage I have ever suffered. In particular, the dialogue (no matter the character, their age, or the situation) is written in the same shallow vocabulary of an early 30-something Spence School grad. \\"Let's have a contest to see how many exclamation points can be used in one paragraph!

My kids get some of the humor and can sing along to much of it.The first track, though, starts with a drum roll intro thing that is hard to hear unless you really crank your volume - then the rest is too loud. \\"Worms\\" is a lounge singer piece which is funny but is just too long for the kids. \\"I dig pigs\\" is a litle \\"scary\\" for some little kids.

Calling it that seems just as odd to Argentines as \\"baseball mallet\\" would seem to Americans. A polo ball is not so much a \\"pelota de polo\\" as a \\"bocha.\\" To play \\"stick and ball\\" is to \\"taquear\\" (an important verb not in the book). The polo field is almost always called a \\"cancha\\" not a \\"campo.\\" A match is \\"un match,\\" not usually \\"un juego.\\" The word \\"montar,\\" while understood, is never used, using \\"andar a caballo\\" pretty much exclusively.

I bought the Oolong tea and decided to give this white tea a try since it had so much good reviews. The tea tastes, smells and looks exactly like the oolong tea.

I drink a lot of Earl Grey. But I heard about white tea, I hadn't know about it before. It has lower caffeine than even green tea, and quite a bit less than an earl grey or black. It also is supposed to have a lot of antioxidants.I'm finding this tea to taste more like a black tea than a green. Green has a grassy taste to me.

Action is continous, no wasting time with setting up the story line..just that you are cop and you must do what you captain wants to bring law and order to the city. Only negative is that you can't turn off the power (sleep mode) in the middle of load screen. You have to be with in the game to get the psp to sleep mode.

While the gameplay in innovative and very much fun at first, once you get past the fact that you're slo-mo jumping from one car to another, and then trying to do the same with the next car in line, it just gets old quick. There is no aiming your weapon, or any other skill techniques for that matter. You press one button to automatically jump onto another car, you hold R trigger to lock on and fire. Sometimes it's cars, sometimes trucks, sometimes boats, but they all work basically the same. I wouldn't pay over $20 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Launch pad for practicing","review":"This is a simple training aid that has an arched plastic base with 2 fold out rubber flaps. Alignment lines allow a user to set up parallel to the target line. A small port allows you to put in your own tees. The device folds easily and can fit into a large pocket in a standard golf bag.Hitting the driver with your own tees is good as any other mat. However, hitting hybrids or irons has a big drawback: The noise when you hit the ball and then the plastic base. It is distracting. It does simulate hitting turf with the flexibility of the arched plastic base. The base is relatively stable but can move with contact.This does take some abuse from contact and is durable except for the rubber flaps.There is a better alternative on the market:TrueStrike Domestic Portable MatVERDICT:Better products exist out there.

Actually, the quality of this production is so paltry the original color home movies of Hitler's mistress, Eva Braun, are shown here in black and white. Some comedown. There are no interviews with former associates of Hitler, nor any Allied opponents. In fact, there is no new or revealing material in this film at all.The narration is also singularly awful. Not only are German names and places horribly misprounounced, but the tinny musical score grates on the nerves after several minutes. Instead of throwing on some opulent and appropriate Wagnerian motive, the producers chose instead to hire a brass band from a local Oktoberfest celebration.

However, not even Renie and Gertrude could save this one.The \\"surprise twist\\" at the end was lame. But worse was the story itself, with Judith continuing to stick her nose into things that don't concern her and get people to yap her ear off just because \\"she likes people.\\" It's been a lame premise for getting her involved in the mysteries through entire series, but it just came across as completely ridiculous this time.The dialogue is painful to read, the writing has become amateur. Ms. Daheim should put this series to bed and concentrate on the Alpine series, which is still enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt Cheated","review":"I've read all of Mary Daheim's B&B mysteries, and until this one, generally enjoyed them for what they are, entertaining cozies that chart the lives of Judith Flynn and her family as Judith solves various murders. So I was all set to expect more of the same entertainment from this latest in the series. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say I felt disappointed with the trick that the author played on this reader. By the end of the book, I also grew to dislike pretty much all the characters. The gambling casino location seemed to bring out the worst traits in most of Judith's family members. I agree with the reviewer who said this is not one of Daheim's better efforts. I hated this book so much that I revealed the surprise ending to the members of my monthly mystery book club so that none of them would be tempted to read the book and suffer the same irritation and disappointment that I experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best work","review":"I read all the Bed and Breakfast books and I generally LOVE them all - I don't really know what it was but I felt like I was just really getting tired of Judith sticking her nose into things the twist was nice and I cannot wait till the next book - but it was a major downfall to her last book and to all the previous titles in this series. I think maybe there just wasn't enough Rene in it for me -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"I have ready every one of the B&B series and, without a doubt, this book is the worst and a waste of good reading time. The conclusion to the mystery was ludicrous and unbelievable. I've often found myself thinking, \\"Judith, get a spine for heaven's sake\\" as she is stepped on throughout the series. However, this book left me thinking that the character has no backbone and never will. When she should have been furious with the solution, she, once again, allowed her \\"loved ones\\" to belittle her.

As with a lot of the releases involving this person, the inserts and the disc itself look very amateurish, even perhaps homemade? The music itself, performed by Yuki and Tomoko Mack, is fine but not often inspired -- the technical skills seem OK, but theirs is a rather cool interpretation of a piece that's supposed to be an outpouring of the American spirit. And the multichannel format here is like an Oscar-winning actor in a pointless cameo; seriously, what was the purpose here, given the sparse instrumentation?But the real problem: As other reviewers here have found, Mr. Jero apparently cannot even be bothered to make a product that actually plays. A few minutes into track 2, the music went silent even though my BD player indicated the track was still playing. I checked connections, examined the disc and restarted the track. Same result.I sent this back. What a RIP-OFF."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piano only!!","review":"I thought this was a rich production with a full orchestra and 7.1 channel sound. Wrong !

It has the technical foundation that more popularized treatments lack but it has a great sense for the individual personality too. In particular, it has a through treatment of Freeman Dyson's work and background, something that gets slighted elsewhere.

So my negativity toward this album is not based on a lack of familiarity with chant-like performance.Generally, every musical album has something worthwhile in it somewhere. You have to listen awfully hard with this one. What is supposed to be singing sounds more like caterwauling to me.If the prospective buyer is interested in Jewish jazz, the Mahler interpretations are a wonderful place to start - or maybe just buy some standard klezmer stuff.This, I hate to say, is pretty darn unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll say \\"I wish I hadn't seen this movie\\"","review":"It starts out pretty good.

Blakey's quintet, a clear forerunner of his Jazz Messengers, approaches the classic bop style, mixes in some soul and gospel, and cranks up the energy. Art Blakey's turbocharged drumming, Horace Silver's funky, blues-drenched playing, and the formidable frontline of trumpet wizard Clifford Brown and Bird disciple Lou Donaldson set the mold for the style.Highlights of Volume 2 are a blistering interpretation of the Kern-Fields classic \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" and two Charlie Parker tunes, \\"Confirmation\\" and \\"Now's The Time\\". Clifford Brown really burns on these tunes. If you like this CD, be sure to buy Volume 1 as well as the two Bohemia recordings of Blakey a year later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quick rundown of a great CD","review":"The band: Clifford Brown, Lou Donaldson, Horace Silver, Curly Russell, Art Blakey. (Should recognize at least Brown, Silver and Blakey - big names in jazz.)The venue: Birdland - \\"Jazz Corner of the World\\"The production: Rudy Van Gelder remaster of a live recording. (Hot, but clean.)The verdict: This is a worthwhile CD and should be in every serious jazz music collector's collection in one form or another (see below). It really swings and is seriously hot live jazz by some of the greatest jazz musicians ever to play music.The caveat: You can buy Clifford Brown'sThe Complete Blue Note & Pacific Jazz Recordings, which contains this CD,A Night at Birdland, Vol. 1,The Eminent Jay Jay Johnson, Vol. 1, and another disc of Clifford's that probably shows up somewhere else but I just haven't found it yet.The summary: If you don't spring for the CB set, get this CD, but be sure and pick up volume one as well for the complete picture of an historic night in jazz history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for studying","review":"As a student, I listen to this CD while I study and work on the computer. The lyrics and the energy behind them are really motivating and never get boring. In response to people's comments about sound quality, these are field recordings which give you the effect of standing at an intersection through which different troupes are running. Sometimes you hear different groups chanting at once as they pass each other, and you hear the roughness of people's voices under physical exertion. Like sea shanties and chain-gang songs, cadences are work songs and should not be treated as performance music. This CD sounds just like what I heard as a child growing up on Army bases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I'm wicked out of shape and can barely run a mile, but this cd is great for making sure I keep pace and don't quit early.

The sisters deal with emotional issues ranging from personal security to self-esteem to coming out of poverty and rising a prosperity of spirit. Growing Up Too Fast: When I was so very young,/Into adulthood I was flung./To grow up very quickly,/Even though I was often sickly.//My family was dirt poor,/Our house was an eyesore./Our clothes and hair were unclean,/Life in many ways was very mean.//My father had never learned to read,/Yet he was a good man, everyone agreed./He worked so hard at his trade,/We never lived on welfare aid.//Many bills were left unpaid,/Of a better life he always prayed./Until he own life finally did fade,/And at peace at rest he was finally laid."},{"rating":"2","title":"P!nk Rocks","review":"'Who Knew' the 2nd single off of P!nk's 2006 album 'I'm Not Dead' is a good follow-up to her 1st single 'Stupid Girls' not as great though (u know causing a tidal wave of controversy) but still pretty good and the mixes are good (but they need to include the 'Bimbo Jones Club Remix' (the full length version) and the song 'Disconnected' (on the Pt.1 Single) ROCKS.

Just raise all your volume controls and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I remember when \\"Monster\\" stood for quality","review":"Ever since Monster decided to mass-market everything that they possibly could, their quality has been steadily declining. This product doesn't even live up to what I expect from a budget brand.The transmission strength seems very low, it seems very hard for the car's radio to lock onto the signal. Even after managing to get the car's stereo to tune in properly, there is considerable hiss and distortion. In addition to that, the sound level is very low, so you need to crank your car stereo volume way up, which only amplifies the background hiss and distortions more.I replaced with with a Belkin Tunecast II. The signal from it is clearer (almost as clear as a regular broadcast radio station), stronger, and louder. All around a better device."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY quiet signal, lots of interference","review":"This thing is really, really lame. The signal is extremely, extremely quiet. I have to turn up my stereo twice as high as normal to get the music 2/3rds as loud, with a bunch of static (on every station I try) to boot. If I'm using this thing, and I switch to a normal radio station or my CD player without turning the volume back down first, I have no doubt that my speakers would be blown. Monster Cable is supposed to be high quality (although waaaaaaaay overpriced); this item is just another knock in my declining perception of the company.This is the second FM transmitter I've tried with my iPod, and they've both sucked. I'm pretty much convinced that I have to either get a tape adapter (which means getting a new car stereo that has a tape deck...) or find an iPod-integration solution like what's available on BMW's (which also means getting a new car stereo...) if I want to get decent sound from my iPod to my car stereo."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better products out there","review":"I have tried 3 different fm transmitters and this was one of the worst. A waste of money. Just like a previous review stated the salesperson at Best Buy swore by it based upon personal experience and the return rate of other products - BS!It ALWAYS faded in and out - poor reception no matter where I put it in the car - it doesn't matter if it sounds good in the store where the display has it set up perfecty, if it can't lock cleanly into a station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you research better than I did mine","review":"I have an ipod and wanted to get an fm transmitter for the car. My brother had a great Monster ipod transmitter so I purchased this transmitter only to find that it was very different. This one has only 8 preset stations in the 80's (bad if you live in DC) and does not charge your ipod. Monster does have a GREAT transmitter made specifically for the ipod that gets better reception, allows you to charge the ipod while driving, and offers much more tuning flexibility. Worth the extra 20 bucks, and I feel stupid for having purchased this one first because I didn't understand all the intracacies. Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickash transmitter","review":"I dont know what the he11 everyone is complaining about....this thing is awesome. It's pretty close to CD quality audio, always takes over whatever frequency I set it to, and is NEVER choppy (interference from the radio station). I bought it from a Best Buy in Florida, they didnt have any here in Ohio, only the crappy, cheap ones. I think the fact that it gets grounded to the vehicles electrical system really helps. I've had other units that I had to hold in my hand because the grounding capabilities werent there as they were battery powered."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor.","review":"no matter what volume or frequency, i get static and distortion. i wonder if the quality varies from unit to unit since some have had no problem.i won't buy one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Monster-ous piece of junk!","review":"Like others, I was assured by the salesperson at Good Guys that this would enable me to play MP3 music through my car radio.

It still works three years later, plays music great but won't charge my ipod. I had tried to return it to BestBuy, contacted the manufacturer and they suggested I purchase a new one and offered to mail me a 15% off coupon. Wow.. crock of...Either way, if you're looking for a dependable car adapter this would be it, just don't forget to charge it before you leave, or expect to use your ipod over a road trip without bringing a wall charger or a laptop to plug the feckin thing in. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"1 fatal flaw...","review":"I have had one of these 'Monster' transmitters for about 6 months. What happens is that the wire will get worn down (from wiggling, use and in my case cold weather) and you will first lose sound in one speaker then the other. Wiggle the wire and the speaker(s) might come back on. The wire is too thin and just wears out way too fast. It's not to be confused with 'Monster Cable'. I would certainly avoid used ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain","review":"This item works great and for only $15!

I was excited after reading other iTrip horror stories because this has a power outlet and does not draw power from the iPod itself, so the transmitting power would be stronger. I paid $50 (way too much) and used it in my Maxima all the way home. We have several cars and it didn't work in any of the other vehicles: 2 Chevys and one VW Passat. It was programmed to work on the lower frequencies and it was as if it was not powerful enough to boradcast over them... and there was no local frequency to over power. Besides, when it did work, there was too much static for me to enjoy the music. I would not reccomend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good transmitter--no issues yet w/poor signal","review":"I purchased this transmitter online for $16.99 and it was $50....I was worried because it was marked down so much. I got it after paying $10 shipping which I thought was outragous! It works well the only complaint I have is that the cords are so long they are cluttering up my console area in my car.

I have always been able to find a station. On long drives when I take a break sometimes I have to find a new station because I have driven into range of a station at the frequency I am broadcasting.The key is to find the best station in the range.NOTE: I do not listen to classical or jazz, as another reviewer pointed out that the device is lacking in their musical ranges.

The price was fair and I paid for expedited shipping so that I would not have to worry about getting it in time for Christmas. Unfortunately, the shipping was very late. The original shipper assigned it to another shipping company when they failed to deliver it within the expedited date. It arrived literally just in time for Christmas after several phone calls to the shipping company. Definitely a wasted expense to pay for the expedited shipping. However, the product was exactly as ordered and my daughter loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good laugh","review":"When I first read the book I was a little lukewarm toward it, but my2 1/2 year old grandson absolutely loves it.

Confusing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense is one of this Books Greatest Features","review":"This book kept me awake long past 1:00 in the morning, because it's so interesting. Ashley is a two faced demon, Floir is exciting and vibrant, Richard is definitely a radio, Bjorn is worn out, and Trish just keeps going. My favorite part of the book is when Kate is listing her mother's faults and fault #10 is, 'if it weren't for Nair my mother would have a little mustache.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressive","review":"I checked this book out of the library for a quick read, not expecting substance, but I thought it would be fun. I was right, except it wasn't fun. I usually love romance, but it was very dull in this book. I hated the way the main character told her story. It seemed like Louise Plummer was trying too hard.When I read the book A Dance For Three , I could not believe it was by the same author! So you shouldn't let this book stop you from reading a dance for three, which was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic? I think not.","review":"The entire idea behind The Unlikely Romance of Kate Bjorkman was the fact that this was a 'real' romance. She mentioned how she hated romance novels and how this was her realistic romance- it was real. But as I was reading, I couldn't help but notice that this was just another corny romance story. The tall girl with the glasses, who's always loved her brother's best friend, ends up with him. Of course, there's the gorgeous, sexy girl who is caught by the main character kissing the brother's best friend, but he's forgiven in the end. Of course he's handsome, masculine, extremely nice, funny, and smart. There aren't really any faults in his character, and Kate Bjorkman is the typical romance novel girl. I was extremely disappointed. It was way too cliche- even the names were typical! This was no way a 'real' romance, but another corny and hopelessly romantic love story that should have come from Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites!","review":"I took this book out from the library & read it, and loved it so much I had to buy it! I've read it at least 5 times-it doesn't get boring at all and it's hilarious! If you're one of those kind of people who like the long drawn-out mushy romances, this isn't really for you-but it's definitly my kind of book! even if you don't like romances at all, this book could change your mind because it is so realistic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Romance lovers and Non-Romance Lovers!","review":"This book is just awesome! Not only is it funny but it is definitly a book you can read over and over again. This book is definitly isn't a typical romance novel. The main character is a six foot tall girl who is revolted by the idea of romances. It's definitly a funny and interesting story to read. I think Louise Plummer has really made an awesome peice of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters","review":"It's really not the authors' fault, but there are so many people that worked on this case, it is confusing trying to keep everyone straight. Same with the victims. To me, this book never fully developed the characters. It's more like a rundown of what happened, but nothing of substance. This book is mainly about Malvo and Muhammed, but who are they really? At the end there is a brief conversation from Malvo that was very interesting because it gave some feedback on what he'd done, but that's it. I just felt a void, like what was really the point? By the end I was ready to be done with the book and move onto something better. I bought this from a book club and wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true story of a pair of drifters who terrorized the D.C. area for 23 days.","review":"What is the face of evil? In this sniper case, the faces are two - a 15-year-old boy and a man old enough to be his father. They are ordinary faces; yet they methodically killed and wounded as many as 5 people a day without mercy. Their movements were random, frustrating police and FBI agents. Acting on mistaken information of a white van, the officials floundered - clueless, while the pair remained invisible and deadly - shooting from a small hole in the truck of a dark blue Caprice. All around them a tempest roared.Authors Horwitz and Ruane tell us chapter by chapter what happened, who the killers were, who the victims were, and how they ultimately were captured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offers Nothing New","review":"This book takes you instead of the manhunt for the Washington area snipers, but offers nothing that has not previously been reported in The Washintgon Post or other papers.

There is no reason to spend the extra money on a high-priced HDMI cables (just make sure you get one that is rated as 1.3). Monster Cable is an evil company who sues everybody they can, massively overprices their products, and makes up terms to apply to non-existent technology they claim to incorporate.

They are ok I suppose IF YOU NEVER PLAN TO UNPLUG THEM! When trying to unplug the cable from my HDTV the supposed gold prong stays suck in the tv whilst the cable comes out with these frayed gold conecters that are impossible to salvage. The conecter is held together by a tiny dot of metal sauter and pops apart like a rubberband. I bought them through Amazon from ANT OLINE...BEWARE of this company I have been trying to get a hold of them for a week and they refuse to answer my emails...Amazon wont replace them because they were from one of thier vendors not them.

All and all, for the price and quality I would recommend this item"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink too bright","review":"The green ink of this pen is not typical pen-green ink but fluorescent green. It doesn't show up well on paper - think highlighter green. It's a shame because the ink flows smoothly, just a stupid color. I had bought this one and the extra fine point of the same color. Both write nice, but this one writes a little smoother. It's really too bad about the ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the mid 30's to 40's !!!!","review":"Rules of Engagement Season 2I have waited for a show like this for a while. When we were young The Jeffersons, All in the Family, etc. then in our teens to 20's was 30 Something, Friends. So now a little bit older and we have a funny show for the age I'm at and can relate to. All the little jokes that hit home. It will remind you when you were single and dating or engaged and at last to be married for a long time Happily too. I do like the fact that kids is not in this picture because it can take you to a mind set that I think we forget when we do have kids. So let it take you back in years or enjoy what you have, and have fun watching the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Rules of Engagement is one of those comedies that come along once every ten years. I cannot remember a single episode that didn't make me laugh out loud. Great casting for each caracter and excellent writing makes this a winner. Patrick Warburton has incredible comedic timing. Bianca Kajlich is scary hot as well. Watch and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Show!","review":"I love this show, and it seems to get better and better. I just wish they would get rid of David Spade! He's one of the most annoying, obnoxious actors around. NO ONE IS BUYING HIM AS A \\"LADY'S MAN\\"!!! In fact, Spade is the only negative in the whole show. Even as obnoxious and irritating as he is, he's not quite as bad in this show as he's been in most others, and the people running things seem to know when they're getting too much Spade, and keep it balanced pretty well. The others in the cast are excellent (I love Jeff!), and it's just plain funny.Re: this DVD set, it's very good. The whole season, plus a good deal of extras. I'm not big on extras, so those really aren't for me, but I love having the ability to watch the shows right in a row.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Show, Terrible Audio Mix","review":"I like the show, but the versions available here on Amazon have a TERRIBLE audio mix that is driving me crazy. The laugh track and music track way dominate the volume of the actors audio track. It's frustrating because you turn the volume up to hear what the actors are saying and then BAM music starts in for a cut scene and it blasts your ears off. They REALLY need to fix this. I tried adjusting my receiver mix so that the center channel (the only place the actors audio channel comes through) was louder, but the music and laugh track is REALLY LOUD on here too. You might want to go elsewhere for this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark S.","review":"Not quite as funny as Seasons 3 and forward--didn't realize how much David Spade's assistant \\"Timmy\\" brings to the show. Nonetheless, still better than 90% of the comedies currently on the various networks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I purchased one of these at Home Depot about a month ago and finally went to used it two days ago. Beside the fact that the thing was rolled up and difficult to straighten out to use, I did so and connected it to the hose and turned the water on. Within a minute, the hose had a blow out right in front of the connection and was like a geyser at one end. Needless to say, it would not work for the thin section of my lawn I purchased it for. I returned it and they let me exchange it for a new one. Took it home and tested it immediately. Same thing happened so I returned it for a refund. What a terrible product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear your mind with clearer music","review":"In today's high-tech world where it seems that only pop-music and electronica are revered and recognized by the establishment, Aerial Acoustics is the antithesis of the more common computerized rythm, sampled tracks, and non-existent melody.Aerial Acoustics is different. Deliciously different. My musical tastes have varied throughout the years. As I grow older, I relish the thought of relaxing in my quiet time with Aerial Acoustics. They have taught me more about what it means to appreciate music, rather than merely listen to it. They are complex, intense, subtle and relaxing. They are intriguing musicians will uncomparable style.I wanted introspective music. I wanted to appreciate something with more depth than the superficial mass media had to offer. I have looked all over, and it was right under my nose all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome!","review":"I got this album on the whim, and I swear I couldn't have made a better choice. It IS just video game music but totally different and real. Very nostagolic of course but there's definitely more, it has staying power. I hope to see more work from The Advantage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NINTENDO-CORE!","review":"At first, I was really looking for a band called The Minibosses. when I entered that into the search, this came up. so I bought it... I'm very glad I did. Although I prefer The Minibosses over The Advantage, I would still HIGHLY recomend this cd for anyone who likes covers of Nintendo original songs. If you like these guys, you'll love The Minibosses. Plus, there's a member in this band from the band HELLA. Another absolutely awsome band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shame","review":"I would *definitely* buy this CD, if it weren't muffled and fuzzy compared to the kickass stuff I've heard them produce before. I really like the badass guitar work and fast-paced melodic bass playing and the drumming is great, if it weren't for the drumming it wouldn't be rock n' roll!But yea, in this recording all of those great elements and the talent of the band members are muddled out. It sucks, because the faster cleaner recordings really bring back great memories of my childhood but this remastered work doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recording quality an issue","review":"The Advantage are great but I'm not sure if I like this recording. If you are familiar with the mp3's they host on their website, or with their live performances, be aware that this recording is mastered differently. The bass is too high and the newly added effects only muddle their usually very techinical style. Also, they slowed down a number of their songs as compared with their live performances and their mp3's. All in all, this cd is very good, but for some of their work, I prefer the older, faster and cleaner sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well done","review":"By well done I mean creating so much ado about so little. With so many reviewers speaking out about a record like this, I must say that Ms. Daly has managed to create a topic for discussion. When another reviewer makes a statement about the record being great and then nods to what she disgracingly calls jazz reminiscent of a rugby match, I start to understand why a project like this gets such a big following. I have to congratulate Ms. Daly on making a record filling a hole. For all of you feeling too many jazz records sound like a rugby match (and that must really be a bad thing!?!) and want to satisfy a hunger for mediocre, background restaurant jazz/music, go buy this one. For those seriously interested in jazz, try something else.The two stars are for the great George Garzone, contributing a song and two supreme, entertaining solos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre.","review":"I've listened to this album at least fifteen times now, searching for something to thrill me. The song selection is fine, and so is the sound. Garzone guesting on two tracks is the high point for me, other than that I feel the record falls a tad flat. Those who have expressed their love for this one, by giving it five stars (as one would give the most outstanding, classic albums of any genre) are looking at a life of easy satisfaction. In deed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Swing Low\\" swings","review":"I received this CD as a gift (which is a great idea for anybody out there looking for a gift for a jazz lover!) and was later lucky enough to hear Claire play in person. \\"Swing Low\\" is a fine example of her abilities, and is a very listenable recording. Claire has great control of tone, quality, and dynamics. Her playing is both senstive and powerful. I've since bought two additional copies and given them to friends, both of whom also loved the recording. Can't wait to hear more from Claire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It swings","review":"(Not everybody can be a Gerry Mulligan, Serge Chaloff, Lars Gullin (Sweden), Gary Smulyan, Ronnie Cuber (despite his sound), Nick Brignola or John Pl Inderberg (Norway). These are some truly great baritone players from around the world, alive or deceased.)This is just above mediocre. Something borrowed, something blue, nothing new. But it swings. The band is good. Garzone is great, as a couple of other reviewers have remarked. I'm sorry, Daly, you don't quite do it for me. Not yet, anyhow. I'm a listener who loves changing my opinion, and with so few good baritone players around, I will be watching your next move!"},{"rating":"1","title":"john cena = epic fail this movie = epic fail as well","review":"this movie is lame and boring this is easily one of the worst movies ever made sorry vince wwe stars can not act at all stick to booking shows not lame wwe movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"For a B rated movie","review":"I know the wrestlers and rappers really don't have the acting experience as real actors but the movie was pretty good, seeing I watch B rated movies and is a WWE fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This item came with instructions that were backward and parts taht were pictured in the instructions that there was no reference to in the written instruction.

The manufacturer did replace the item that they said must have been defective but when the new mirror came it was exactly the same. The fit and finish of the mirrors was also not up to standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating this overrated product","review":"This product was recommended to me by more than one source and is supposed to be specifically designed for exactly the application I'm using for - to remove wood-grain applique from a late 1970's station wagon. I had used a couple of cans of \\"aircraft stripper\\" from the local chain auto parts store prior to using this and quite frankly, it worked much better. When you spray this product it creates a white film over the area you want to remove and anything else nearby but very little of the woodgrain actually came up despite repeated attempts. This product comes in a large can but I used an entire can of it with very little results. I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our 14 month old loves it.","review":"Your child can finish these sentences with moo, baa, and hi (complete with a wave).

We have referred it to several of our friends who are getting married and even some who have been married a while and are having problems.

Unfortunately, not all the notes (holes) work. The #2 (E) doesn't work, and the #1 (C) and #3 (G) are spotty, so no first C chord. I can hear the air blowing through or around, but the holes seem clogged whether I'm blowing easy or hard and make a terrible sounding note (my family cringes and can tell I'm blowing that note when I try). The other notes work just fine and sound good. Most of the other reviews praise this model, but mine is defective and doesn't inspire me to practice. I don't know if it's the reed (which I suspect) or how to fix it or replace it, but I shouldn't have to in a new product. Not recommended (at least for beginners)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gigging Harmonica Period","review":"I've been playing harmonica in bands for 15 years, and nothing has ever come close to the Hohner Marine Band in terms of overall sound, volume, responsiveness, durability, and overall buyer value. There may be a few high-end harps out there (like Seydel etc.) that create instruments that sound *slightly* better, but the relatively low cost of the Marine Band in comparison makes it the best overall choice for any serious musician.The wood comb gives it a sweet, earthy, bluesy tone that will never be matched by any plastic comb. The simple construction and widely spaced cover plates allow for tons of projection and volume from these harmonicas.The only drawback is these harps are not in the \\"Modular System\\" of the other Hohners like Special 20, Pro Harp, Big River etc. So you can't save money by swapping out the old reed plates for new ones when they eventually go bad. Besides that, you can't go wrong buying one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"WOW, Ive Gotten all kinds of harps, Blues Harps, Special 20s, Lee Oskars, and Golden Melodies.

The Sound is AMAZING the ease of bending is AMAZING. I also compared the size to the Lee Oskars and it is smaller, it look to be the same size as a special 20 but it FEELS so much smaller in your hand which allows for great hand effects. If you are a prospective harp buyer and youve heard negative reviews like me about the dowsides of the Marine Band, i urge you to TRY IT and i think you will really enjoy playing it.

While Dr. Who often seems left-leaning, these episodes are clearly critical of the \\"by any means necessary\\" approach to environmentalism.As with many stories, there are captures and re-captures that tend to wear a bit thin-but when you have a lot of time to fill and a budget of six pence and a button, such is how things go."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"Its a keeper, and one that I will read again later.

The reader finds out that although he tried to make amends for his actions, he is ashamed of his behavior that caused an accident and that led to the blackmail. I thought his actions (drinking heavily, running away) in light of his history were highly plausible, and the author built up his story from previous books into this one well. His failure is in trusting the wrong person and not those truly closest to him.

If I had been in charge of producing the disc, I might have selected a few other pieces, but otherwise I cannot quarrel with what is an outstanding CD at any price, much less the ridiculously low price at which EMI offers these bargains. A must add to any collection of violin music, classical music in general, or Itzhak Perlman in particular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva el Perlman!","review":"This is simply a great cd, both because of the price and the quality of the music and playing!As always, Perlman sounds spectacular. There's nothing bad you can say about his playing here. He makes these incredibly challenging piece sound effortless.The music so much fun too! The Sarasate pieces definitely steal the show. The Carmen Fantasy is wonderful (especially the end), although I have to say that I almost favor the shorter Sarasate pieces. I feel like the de Falla Suite is a little out of place. It's considerably less virtuosic than the other pieces and not all that memorable. Perhaps these more lyrical pieces were included as a contrast to the other more \\"athletic\\" pieces, but to me, they just get overshadowed by the rest of the CD. They're fine music, but I think they're a little out of place in this collection.Overall, you can't go wrong with this. You'll love it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abilene Musicological WL","review":"There are a few things which really stick out to me about this hymnal which Mr. McCann and Jack Boyd wrote. It is only available in large printed shape notes. This versus Howard's Songs of Faith and Praise is much cleaner and is put together much beter as far as this is concerned. With the Praise and Worship tradition that is occurring rapidly throughout the churches of Christ in the United States today, the hymns in this book which are put together for an apparent \\"High Church\\" crowd are becoming strikingly obsolete. Never the less it is great for teaching the musicological aspect of our great and rich Hymnody and is a must for every worship leader's library. It is a 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra points for readability","review":"This hymnal has two specific merits: (1) it is slightly larger than many hymnals and is therefore very readable and (2) it prints Amazing Grace twice with different tenor and bass lines so you can sing the familiar form. Otherwise, it is a solid selection of primarily American hymnody with much of the standard gospel repetoire i.e. Fanny Cosby, Loveless, Sweeney etc. You won't go wrong if you're looking for a solid, American, evangelical collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Articulate Midrange with Good Bottom End","review":"These are a great \\"all around\\" string. They can fit any genre of music style.Nice articulation in the mids, while maintaining a solid bottom end. The high's aren't hyped or harsh... nice all around, string.DR rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is scale playing music?","review":"This CD is basically a recording of scale playing with not much attentionto melody or feeling. It was a showcase of technical talents and becomesnerve wracking quickly. If you like scales you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great wonders of guitar playing","review":"I am delighted to see this album available again. The harmonic and melodic variations are superb. The continuous stream of virtuosity, creativity and class is unequaled in jazz guitar playing. I have listened to other Virtuoso#X albums but this one is definely the best of the series. It has jolted my concept of guitar playing for sure not only by raising the bar very high but also, as a guitar student a few years back, it has given me a clearly transcribable encyclopedia of jazz guitar. Another jazz/accoustic recommendation similar to this one would be \\"My goal's beyond\\" by John McLaughlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Solo Jazz Guitar Album.","review":"Martin Taylor and Tuck Andress are just two the living jazz fingerstylists of our era. Their solo efforts fall within the genre in jazz guitar spurred by the late great master Joe Pass. This album, and the 2-CD Virtuoso #4, were all recorded in 3-days of November 16, 26, and 30 1973. Yet recordings from those sessions remain to be definitive, groundbreaking, and will always remain as the benchmark for the solo jazz guitar genre. The guitar playing in this album is spontaneous and unpredictable, yet the harmonic sense can only come from someone who is very fluent in the jazz language. Each cut is a gem. The classical guitar virtuoso Eliot Fisk loves this guru. Joe Pass is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"too much of a good thing","review":"I really enjoyed this cd...up to a point. I have been a guitar player for many years and can truly appreciate the skill that Joe Pass displays on this recording. The phrasing, subtlety and incredible ability are very evident here. As much as I enjoyed it though, I found myself thinking that unless you are a real guitar nut, you might find this style of unaccompanied guitar tiring. It reminded me of listening to Bach on the harpsichord. Beautiful but a little goes a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"joe pass virtuoso","review":"this album is amazing!!!!! this guy is a one man band a chord melody master......im only 17 so maybe its just me but i find this very difficult to play on the guitar..... anyways if you like jazz guitar you should check this out, along witht the others!!!! you want be dissapointed!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable but sparse","review":"Joe Pass / Virtuoso: While I appreciate this guitar album, it is certainly true that the virtuoso could have used a little instrumental help.I like this album, but I don't love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rump shaking funk","review":"If you have any love for old school funk or hip hop, you oughta check this out. Play this CD at your next party, and I guarantee everybody will be tapping their foot and bouncing around to this. This CD embodies what funk and fun hip hop is all about - music so good you can't help but dance to it. I keep this CD in my car all the time, it's great to listen to while driving. I cannot say enough good stuff about this music - I'm glad I discovered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider your beats broken!","review":"Tal M. Klein is the DJ! He's a whole lot more, too--he's a professional breaker of beats, and he's put together a great batch o' beats this time out, as well as found sounds, funky bits, samples and grooves. His earlier work was already pretty darned good, but it was a warmup for this, which is tight, funky, without a beat wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't order from Uncle Joe's","review":"I placed an order from Uncle Joe's for cookie tins for our school's cookie sale. We were promised delivery, promised tracking numbers and a week later told that the order could not be filled. Now we are scrambling to find tins to pack our cookies in. Poor Job folks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Victoria's Best!","review":"The ever-talented Victoria Holt takes what could have been a tired plot device - marriage of convenience with secret desire turning to real love - and gives it new life with hidden family secrets, the search for a fabulous lost - and cursed - priceless opal, and the adventure of the rugged Australian Outback.Jessica Clavering grows up in her staid, rigid, loveless English family but longs for a life of adventure. She finds it in an arranged marriage with the son of her secret friend and they had off to unimaginable adventure...what more could a reader ask for? This is my favorite Holt novel, and I also recommend \\"Mistress of Mellyn.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the first romance book I ever read","review":"Jessica and Joss is the first romance novel that I read- where the the bride hating the groom and they grow to love each other as the story goes on. I decided to read it again for the first time in about 12 years. It was not as good as I remembed but still good, I do not like the mystery aspect to the book. I am not big on mysteries. I am giving it a five for being the first book of this type that I read, and it brought back memories for me as a young girl reading this type of book for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Cool!","review":"This CD is so cool! I just got it for Christmas and I've already listened to it a thousand times. 'Cartoons' is sooo funny and I LOVE 'Stranded'. Some other bests are 'Get Down', Can't Live a Day', and 'Always and Forever'. You won't be wasting your money if you buy it, believe me! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Name Says It All \\"WOW!\\"","review":"I have Wow '97,'98, and Wow- Praise and Worship.

If you don't have this cd get it now! You wont regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW..is right!","review":"I own the WOW 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999....and haven't been disappointed yet! It is great to listen to such a variety of artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesOme and Wonderful cd! WOW!","review":"I like many of the songs on this album! I have looked for these songs that were hits, but I didn't want to buy a whole bunch of CDs for just one song. This album has all of my favorites on it. The best songs (in my opinion) are: Consume Me, One of These Days, and Always and Forever. All of the songs, however, are awesome, so I recommend that you go out and buy this CD! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"I like this CD (WOW HITS 2000), but in my personal opinion the latest WOW HITS CDs are better---including (but not limited to) WOW HITS 2008, 2009, 2011. 2010 & 2012 are not on this list as of now because I have not listened to them yet, but I still recommend them to all listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very special delivery","review":"A very good book.
