It holds enough water for four cups of coffee/tea, heats the water up quickly and shuts itself off when done.

It warms water quickly, the heating element is covered, it seems well built, and it is aesthetically pleasing. However, it is slightly smaller than I expected. I know it says how much water the kettle holds, but for some reason I was expecting slightly more. Completely my own fault for not converting liters into cups or ounces. I just don't want someone else to make the same mistake.I am keeping it because even though it is a little on the small side, it fits nicely in my cupboards and works well. It's a great buy for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky kettle","review":"I hope this kettle works without leaking water from the bottom! It heats up water quickly and easy to use.

I read reviews prior to purchasing and decided on this model for several reasons. First, I wanted the kettle to be cordless when not attached to the base. (I could just see myself tipping other items on the counter over with the cord as I rushed to pour my tea) Second, I wanted an automatic shut off, and finally I wanted something that would look good on the counter.

The opening is too small to put even a small hand in to wash it. The heating element is in the bottom two inches of the pot, which makes it very heavy. The plastic handle is way too big, making it even harder to lift. The floor of the pot is simply a plate stuck in it - it has a seam and rim that look like they would either collect sediment or let water through to the heating element, or both. It has a meaningless plastic filter - says it's to catch calcifications, that you aren't allowed to put tea or anything else in it, just water. The base is very lightweight, made of plastic, and the bottom of the pot is also black plastic. I wonder if the plastic would emit fumes during heating, as the metal it's in contact with should get extremely hot when the water comes to a boil. I think the combination of the weight and the size of the handle make it dangerous. You also have to unplug it after use, according to the instructions. I sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I've been using this kettle for almost a year. It's in almost daily use. Best appliance for boiling water I've found.

I had read on other reviews for other products that the kettles leaked; I wanted to spend the money on a good, study kettle that wouldn't leak. I've had my kettle for about two months now and am very happy with it. There are no leaks (even when I accidently leave water in it for a couple of days). I like that the water heats up very quickly and that the kettle shuts itself off when the water is at a good rolling boil. For tea I usually pour the water before it even gets that hot. When I take the kettle off of its base, it automatically shuts off. I'm so happy with this kettle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As expected","review":"So far so good. Convenient to use and fast to get water heated.I use it at least twice everyday.

It will just keep boiling violently enough that the unit will sway on its base. I am quite sure if left on its own it would tip itself over. A real safety risk. In addition, I note that it came with a small filter that is supposed to snap in place in the mouth but there is no bracket to hold it up - Perhaps I got a junk unit but I expect more from Amazon.

Although the plot could have been exciting and dramatic, the movie was b-o-r-i-n-g . If you are looking for an espionage thriller with sex scenes, look elsewhere. The movie loses all historical perspective, and focuses on two people for m-u-c-h t-o-o l-o-n-g.The movie was marketed to attract an audience because of the steamy sex scenes. Sorry to disappoint you, but it was like watching two unappealing people having sex, for 2 minutes in a 2 hour plus movie. Painful. I know, Tang Wei is a beautiful woman, but her beauty and acting ability are diminished in this movie due to the poor screenplay and the brief and unattractive sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel bored and disgusted at the same time.","review":"Watching an old man first rape (or pretend rape) then have explicit sex with a young woman made out to be innocent and inexperienced.Then having the woman betray her friends to help the guy she's suppose to kill.It just leaves this overwhelming feeling of disgust.It's based off of a book a woman wrote, so if this is really how women think? Makes me feel a bit depressed.Unless they used advanced CG, the torrid sex scenes seem to be real, and we can't even pretend that it's just a movie. The old greasy man is really having sex with the 20 year old (which wouldn't even be that bad if the writer/director hadn't set her up as an inexperienced virgin at the beginning).The movie is 2.5 hours long, with drawn out, unnecessary scenes that neither builds plot or reveal characterization. No real tension is built either. So it's a boring long disgusting movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good film, but what's the price?","review":"The price of this film was to see a rape victim fall in love with his abuser.

Lee aims for an epic grandeur that clashes with the traditional spy thriller - minus the sharp pacing inherent in the genre. Strong performances, impressive period detail and Rodrigo Prieto's mesmerizing photography cannot redeem the plodding narrative. By the time \\"Lust, Caution\\" reaches its downbeat conclusion, the dramatic impact has been dissipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Does Not Disappoint","review":"I really like the movies of Tony Leung, what a great actor he is and he seems like a very humble, intelligent and nice man too in interviews I have seen of him.

The music is wonderful, just enough to make your spine tingle. The problem here is Jodhi May. She turns in a endlessly one-note performance. She seems to be focussing so hard on not ever blinking, while her mouth is perpetually agape. Mr Bolt must be to blame for this, because she certainly seems a decent actor. Nonetheless, her performance drags this interesting production down into the realm of a cartoon. Unfortunate, for the children and housekeeper - and ghosts - are solid supporting cast. The script also is awkward and at times clumsy. I suspect the other reviewer is correct in ideally wanting to hear this story read by firelight - either 100 years ago, or perhaps tonight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Masterpiece Theater Production","review":"This version of Henry James's famous ghost story is well rendered and keeps the storyline while adding some subtle (or not so subtle) insight in to the mind of the unnamed governess. Knowing the plot quite well I did not find the movie particularly scary but for someone unfamiliar or who hasn't read the book in awhile there could be some real chills. And as is so often true in ghost stories the more the movie shows of the spirits the less frightening they become and the viewer gets some real good looks at both Peter Quint and Miss Jessel. Just like in James's novel the transformation of the children and the ambiguity of the whole thing causes the most spine tingles."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Turn of the Screw (Ben Bolt, director)","review":"Inevitably, I suppose, any stage or screen adaptation of James's novella must finally make a firm decision regarding what James himself is able to leave satisfyingly ambiguous on the printed page: namely, the emotional and mental stability of the governess, played here with great zest and skill by Jodhi May. Director Bolt's choice is clear enough; for him, the governess is (or becomes) an obsessed, sex-starved Freudian case study--a well-intended young woman who nonetheless ends up posing an infinitely greater peril to her charges--Miles and Flora--than do any of those ghosts she (mistakenly) thinks she sees.I myself miss the ambiguity of James's text here, but the production itself is first-rate: terrific acting, cinematography, and casting. However, if, as a reader of James, you are convinced that the governess is an eminently reliable narrator concerning the disturbing events at Bly, this directorial interpretation is likely to rankle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch \\"The Innocents\\" w/Deborah Kerr instead","review":"Jodhi May plays the same role in every movie. It's as though she's brain damaged or something, vacant stare and mouth open. One almost expects her to drool. The Innocents, upon which The Turn of the Screw was based, is bone chillingly scary. No real special effects, just good acting, directing and dialogue. Avoid this adaptation and watch The Innocents instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was so dissapointed","review":"Man I was dissapointed in this film I love Johi May and Colin Firth but this was a waste of money and the end was not very clear and the movie was rather depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIED AFTER TWO MONTHS","review":"BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE A 15 YEAR OLD SEARS CHARGER THAT I USED TO CHARGE MY BASS BOAT BATTERIES.

Very quickly, our private detective finds himself under pressure from a lot of different directions, including criminals, government agents, and crooked cops. Although any sane person would have walked away from the situation early on, our detective (for reasons he claims are ethical concerns) continues to investigate, despite the threats to him and his girlfriend. He says it's for ethical reasons, but I personally think getting your girlfriend massacred is hardly ethical.But Lutz is a good story teller and writes well, so you keep turning the pages.I think this is really more of a guy's thriller, and I prefer mysteries to thrillers, so I can only give this four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old story","review":"This was just a carbon copy of the last book I read by this author.

And I could not really tell at the end either. Yes it was a contrast of before and after 9/11 (in NYC). And for a short time their seemed to be comic like super heroes, which I was thinking the main characters might turn into somehow. Instead it returns to describing 4 characters who must move out of a flat because the orginal tentant is returning. In fact that seems to be the techinque to keep interest and the pace of the story up - introduce more and more characters, cleverly deescribing them in a few words, and their interaction with the others until I was lost.This might be more the cup of tea though of an English major, but I don't plan on finishing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random, hard to follow","review":"This book was not easy to read.

This will be a great gift for kids who love Sesame Street and music."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSICLICIOUS","review":"WE ALL LOVE THIS VIDEO. IT IS NOT ONLY FOR CHILDREN, BUT ADULTS AS WELL. IT IS ONE OF FEW VIDEOS SHE WILL WATCH FOR SHE IS NOT A TV FAN. KEEPS HER ENTERTAINED WHILE I GET DINNER READY. ITS A MUST HAVE IN MY OPINION!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Elmo movie.","review":"I got this movie for my 18 month old twins since they like Elmo and love the \\"Kids Favorite Songs\\" DVD. Unfortunately, Elmo is barely in this movie and there is more non-singing/dancing material than there is singing/dancing material. Too much time is spent trying to get a dressing room door unlocked. My kids lost interest after 2 minutes. If I show it to them now, I have to \\"fast-forward\\" to all the dance and song routines. And even some of them are kind of boring. Shawn Colvin and Kenny Loggins for 2 yr olds? Not very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best video in our collection","review":"This video seems much more geared toward older children and adults than the typical Sesame Street age child. The dialouge linking the video segments together does not hold the interest of my 19 month old. The music segments are more interesting to me than they are to her. It does very little to engage my young viewer. I would suggest Barney, Blues Clues, or Bear in the Big Blue House over this video, especially for the under three crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Rosie","review":"We were disapointed to see this video had very little of Elmo and a lot of Rosie O'Donnell. It really didn't keep me son's attention - and when Rosie broke into song - my son broke into the other room. His other Sesame Street video Let's Make Music keeps him interested even after 40+ veiwings. Elmopalooza lost his interest the first time he saw it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music with Elmo/Sesame Street as an afterthought","review":"After owning/renting numerous Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, this seemed to be among the more disappointing because:- Elmo barely appears in this video- The artists play/sing with little interaction with the characters.- Very few songs were catchy and kept my son's attention- Who said that Rosie O'Donnell could sing???This title sounds like a fun video...but it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might want to skip this one.","review":"I thought the production was quite cute, but it absolutely doesn't interest my 18-month-old daughter. The amount of time between the muppet appearances is not enough to hold her attention and there are far too few Elmo appearances for her taste! Minimal educational value as far as I can see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small kids","review":"My daughter is 10 months old and I bought this video because she loves Elmo. She has Elmo in Grouchland and doesn't take her eyes off the TV when it's on. I bought this thinking she would enjoy it as much but this video is for older kids. It doesn't hold her attention at all except when Elmo or any of the puppets appear. Maybe she'll enjoy it more in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly BAD!!!","review":"Let me start by saying our son is a big Elmo fan, and we think \\"The Best of Elmo\\" is tremendous.This DVD starts VERY VERY VERY slowly...and gets worse and worse and worse. The opening segment takes forever to get through and offers nothing to keep your child's attention or your attention. When the music finally starts, it is disappointing beyond description. Our son hated it, we hated it, and returned it after 1 abbreviated viewing. This DVD has nothing to offer for anyone in any age bracket."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Muppets, less bad actors.","review":"Not enough muppets to keep a child's interest. And when they sing a RAP version of the alphabet, the voices are mumbled and unclear, which makes it hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"Does NOT interest toddlers --sesame characters are not in video enough to keep their interest. Geared more toward older chilren"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Children","review":"This tape was not liked by my child. It's an Ed Sullivan/awards show format intended to impress adults (and not very good at that either). The Elmo critic who counts in my family is Miss Gemma Paige, 20 months. She loves Elmo, watches all his shows on PBS, watches and dances to his other videos, and exercises with glee to Elmocise. However, she was totally uninterested in this video each time we put in it the VCR so we gave up. Worst money spent on a video for Miss Gemma."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like MTV for toddlers than sesame street","review":"I just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter. I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that. It is more like a music video than a story. The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much. Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn't buy it. I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I'm sorry that we did even that. Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy. I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Sesame Street - but not this one!","review":"My son (17 months) picks up and asks to watch the DVD/Video he wants. We own 7 different Sesame Street videos and this is the only one he has never asked to watch again and actually walks away from it when it is on the TV. That is the main part of the review. As to why?, probably because the songs are not so catchy for young kids, even though the preview on the other tapes makes Elmopalooza appealing. I was suprised by the quality, usually Sesame Street is synonymous with an excellent product. Although I did like the Rosie number and it is Sesame Street, so I gave it two stars. If your child loves to dance and hear music try Sesame Street's Count 'Em 1-2-3, I think we've played it over 100 times already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not another song!!","review":"These were the words I heard every few minutes while watching this with my cousin and daughter. It is basically a collection of music videos with elmo scattered in between. The music videos were not that fun for the kids as the muppets involvement in them was very small. I don't recommend this video for elmo fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"This video just didn't cut it for us.","review":"My child LOVES Elmo. She will sit for an hour and watch Sesame Street or any Elmo video. But this one just bored her to tears (literally!).The idea behind this video is good. However, kids do not know who the celebrities are and, frankly, they couldn't care less. As soon as the puppets disappeared, my child would lose all interest. I can see an older child enjoying this more, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 2.Instead, I recommend Elmo's World videos, especially the Babies, Dogs, and More one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Adults, but unappetizing to children","review":"\\"Elmopalooza!\\" is full of the latest styles of music tastefully geared to please the whole family. Unfortunately, none of the music (except for Rosie's song) will hold the attention of a toddler. My 2 year old loves Elmo, but doesn't like this tape one bit. The music on the tape is simply not children's music. Children enjoy happy, upbeat, rhymic music that they can dance to and sing with. You won't hear that on this tape. I feel I wasted my money on this tape. You can buy this tape for your teenager, but your toddler won't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Elmo?","review":"This video is just horrible! I bought it because my 18 month old loves Elmo. Elmo is barely in the video! After 2 minutes, my toddler walked out of the room. It most definitely did not hold any interest for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you think this is another Sesame Street tape, you're wrong. There's almost nothing in this tape that has to do with Sesame Street or Elmo. I played this once and haven't played it again. It is made for MTV fans not Sesame Street fans, and it certainly is not for infants and toddlers. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"There aren't enough stars on the scale to rate this video","review":"I love this video. It is so adorable.The story is so cute.While gathering to celebrate Sesame street in song. The host of the show gets locked in the dressing room. Everyone works together to try to get him out as well as to put on a great show. The guest appearances are wonderful, and all the music is fantastic. I find myself singing and dancing these tunes during the day myself. This is a definite must have for anyone with small children. My kids range in ages from 8 months to 12 years old and all 4 of them love this video. Even my husband likes this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it Before You Buy It","review":"Our family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe :10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do Play-Doh instead. The plot if poorly contrived, the production value is low, the acting for the most part is awful, and it's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age, my son has no interest in. He did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer. But I'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip. Better bets: A Celebration of Me, Grover or Sesame Street: The Street We Live On."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Okay, my wife and I couldn't stand it, but my child, who loves Elmo, couldn't sit through it. Thank heavens for fast-forward. By the way, who ever told Rosie she could sing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This video doesn't entertain or captivate my children like the other Elmo videos we love(Best of Elmo, Wild West, and Adv. in Grounchland). Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE BOX COVER","review":"But the video is the WORST!!! This video was actually recommended to me and I was so disappointed (and so was my 17 month old son, who lost interest almost as soon as I put it on). As other reviewers said, there are too many adults and not enough Elmo or any of the other muppets. Except for the Rosie segment (which was actually pretty good, but too late in the show),the musical numbers are not appropriate for toddlers, either. They are slickly produced music videos instead of muppets dancing and singing in the studio with the singers, which is what they usually do on Sesame Street. The plot was really dumb and full of inside jokes. I am in the entertainment industry and I did not even like these jokes!... Then there were all these really brief celebrity cameos.... I can't understand how anyone could give this video a good review, but I guess to each his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Elmo's Finest Outing (But Not His Fault)","review":"The songs are pretty good, for the most part, but there aren't enough of them--and there is way too much story, with too many human people, and not enough of interest either to children or adults (unless the adult is a New York City/Broadway insider). Simply put, Elmopalooza cries out for editing. In addition to some genuine stars, the people walking in and out of this thing include too many has-beens, wannabes, and never-was-es.I mean, who (...) is John Stewart? And why waste the talents of the humans from Sesame Street by having them sit in the limo (and wuzzup wit dat?) on the way to the show, instead of having them do their thing with the muppets?If my little boy weren't a total Elmo junkie, I'd try to get my money back.Stick with the Elmo's World videos, Best of Elmo, and CinderElmo. The best stuff (IMO) seems to be on the broadcast Sesame Street shows, like the Robert De Niro/Elmo bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and disappointing","review":"Our toddler loves Elmo, and loves all the musical numbers on Sesame Street. We were looking for something that would just focus on the Sesame Street songs and videos so we wouldn't have to fish through a whole episode of Sesame Street to find them one song at a time. This video only slightly accomplishes this.It's a cute little show. It is quickly obvious that it aired on TV in the 90s. It's littered with B-list celebs with some comical appearances from those who fell off the face of the earth and a few young versions of those that are still around. There is lots of filler, and the songs are just Okay. This has all the merits of what should be free content, so my 2-star score is relative to paying $10 for the streaming/download version. Don't pay for it unless you really really really need some on-demand children's music videos. Free content is generally equal to better quality...this is just slightly more convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love This One!","review":"The music is addictive, we've had this DVD for 9 months or so now and it's one my daughter asks for by name. I've just ordered the CD for the car because she's always singing songs from it! We love the Shawn Colvin version of \\"Don't Want to Live on the Moon\\" it's very sweet and we sing it a lot together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the usual Sesame Street/Toddler set","review":"Although the bumbling story line of mishaps would certainly please the toddler crowd, the majority of songs and how they are performed are not for the young viewer. (Some of the song titles such as \\"Be Yourself\\" and \\"Mambo I, I, I\\" might tip you off - when have you NOT known a toddler to be him/herself? Why would the mambo specifically [\\"it's not the cha-cha or the tango\\"] hold the interest of a three-year-old?) There are moments here and there that are appropriate and appealing to youngsters, however, this production seems like it couldn't make up it's mind deciding whether to appeal to toddlers or their pre-adolescent siblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not baby friendly","review":"Way too much talking and real people. My child loves Elmo and all the Sesame Street characters, but this has more of Jon Stewart than Elmo. Prairie Dawn states how they will all be in \\"Deep Doo Doo\\" if the show does not go on, which is totally inappropriate for my preschooler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I Like Elmopalooza, (- by Baby Tiffany, 23 months old)","review":"I am 23 months old and am currently learning how to pottie train. I liked this video because the songs are catchy. I thought John Stewart was very funny and likeable without being condescending to us toddlers, unlike Rosie O'Donnel, who always just goes completely over the top with her forced gregariousness and unnatural repartee with children. Also, I was slightly disappointed that Elmo was pretty scarce throughout the video, but Shawn Colvin's wonderful rendition of \\"I don't wanna live on the moon\\" definitely made up for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"These albums are really great","review":"This is my second one, the first was the 8.5\\" x 11\\" because I was making my own prints on that sized paper. I ordered this 8\\" x 10\\" because I like to make 8\\" x 10\\" collages of events and order the prints instead of printing them myself. If the images from the event are on my camera I make my own collage using Photoshop. Otherwise if the images are being shared at a web based photo company (like Kodak Gallery) I have to create the collages using their online service. Either way I end up with 8\\" x 10\\" collage prints of parties etc. and they slide right into the pages of this album. I like the simplicity of these albums, and the low cost. They're not all ornate or flowery - just plain.

It kept dropping frames (that is, the video would pause and then skip forward), which is generally a symptom of an MPEG decoder that can't keep up with the bitrate of the DVD. But the DVD was authored at 7.5Mbps max (average 5.5Mbps), and the DVD Forum standards specify that a DVD player must handle 9.8Mbps. This might not matter for most commercial DVDs, which (I've heard) tend to stay below about 5Mbps in order to coddle older players; but there are plenty of titles coming out these days that go for high bitrates to provide maximum quality. If this player can't handle them, then, technically, it is not a DVD player; it should not be advertised as such, and is probably not entitled to use the DVD Forum's DVD Video logo.Of course, it's possible that the encoder I used to author my DVD was flawed; but it seems unlikely--all three of these discs played correctly in my AMW S99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure about this one","review":"Well its Rhino release but it does not sound like the originals,What gives here.Listen Closely.Could there have been two versions in original release one slower than the other?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth Spirit","review":"Looking for native American music I was drawn to Earth Spirit.

The page size & text size is tiny!I'll have a better opinion once I've magnified the interesting sections, but I don't have the time or inclination ro do that at the moment. I bought it as a bedside book to read in the evenings, to also study a bit, but the text is frankly too tiny to enjoy, even a leisurely glance.The two stars are in anticipation of me enjoying the rest of the content when I get to see it.The minus three is because of the text size.

The DK edition is a pleasure to examine (although you may need reading glasses to see the six-point type for some captions). The small format fits well in the hand and has a nice heft (504 pages at 1.3 inches thick). The paper is superb and the colored inks for the thousands of engravings brilliant and crisp. If you need a version that lays flat on your drawing table or a scanner bed, however, this one has some drawbacks. The images are very tight to the inner margins, and the glued binding difficult to keep open without breaking the back.

Plus, it's attractively designed in easy-to-follow magazine style. Witty cartoons and illustrations by Istvan Banyai, appropriate for each chapter, are another plus.One complaint: too often the authors get carried away with their facetiousness.

Therefore I do not know if there are any more albums or recordings released.Apparently it seems to be a family related album as guitarist Marino Cano carries the same last name as the two female singers hearable on certain tracks (Nena Cano & Conchita Cano). One of my favorite tracks is the catchy Rumba Flamenca \\"Ni se Pega, Ni se Rine\\" (track no.11) It makes your flamenco heart beat faster, as it already does after the first couple of measures of the opener (Buleria!) of the album. Again! It is fantastic!! Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ZAPPA -- HIS GIG AS MASTER COMPOSER","review":"A fantastic album with top notch production and perfect performances of a really original spin of old big band stuff. This is not rock. Some mighty good horn arrangements and very unique timbres. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least impressive of all the albums","review":"I have never been able to understand the popularity of this album. It's at least twice as long as the material can justify, and the solos are mediocre at best. I think it's the only Zappa album that is literally forgettable. While there are a couple of memorable themes amid the interminable soloing, those themes were developed far more memorably, years later, in later live performances that are far more interesting to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Zappa's best.","review":"You liked Hot Rats ? The grand wazoo ? What are you waiting for ?A phenomenal CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waka/Jawaka Is FZ At His Prime","review":"I'm not a Zappa-o'phile but this album is a gem. \\"Big Swifty\\" and \\"Waka/Jawaka\\" are some of the finest jazz fusion you will ever hear. You are listening to Zappa in his prime. Not everything Zappa has done is this good. Much of FZ's material is a little too silly for me as he learned to play up the bizzare to sell albums. Waka/Jawaka is as good as Hot Rats or Grand Wazoo. Jazz From Hell is another very challenging FZ album that I recommend. I had always hoped that Zappa would focus more on improvisional jazz fusion rather than the goofy and the gross. Zappa was a HUGE talent that got too caught up in anti-establishment baiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but different...","review":"Zappa in his \\"little big band\\" phase and it's outstanding. If you are looking for poop jokes and sexual innuendo that make up a lot of his catalog look some place else. This is just Zappa showing his under appreciated prowess for writing new and inventive pieces for rock music. This album along with 'Hot Rats' and 'The Grand Wazoo' are all in the same vein so if you liked those this album should be right up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolf ...","review":"Bought this little fella for my lady as a gift and she absolutly loves it! She sleeps with him when I'm away.She thinks he is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"New version","review":"I just received this stuffed animal and I noticed how some other reviews noted the whiskers on it. The one I got doesn't have whiskers, just the dots on the muzzle which I prefer, I think it makes it more cuddlier. I think my kids will like it a lot more without the spikey whiskers too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a Handsome and Cuddly Wolf!!","review":"The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating, is because It was a Christmas gift, and since the receiver lives out of town, don't have any info on longer term quality, BUT...I had read all the positive reviews, and the neg. ones about the claws being hard. After it was opened, I did check that out, no problems with that whatsoever! They were made of felt. Personally, I loved him! Held, examined, and cuddled him... Didn't notice any loose \\"fur\\" or shedding. Can't report on long term, but I certainly was pleased with what I saw and felt. Hope to be purchasing different breeds in this series....I just may keep one for myself!!Amazon was great, and delivery prompt. The Reviews were so important in my decision making!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Addition To The Family","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when this wonderful wolf arrived in the mail. It was crammed into a rather tiny box, so when I opened it up and it began to \\"expand\\" to it's full size, I was amazed. The detail is great, and it offers some rather good \\"poseability\\". Originally purchased as a gift for a wolf collector, I ended up getting one for myself to stand guard (relax) at the foot of my bed. Not really sure this is much of a toy, though I know I would have been dragging it around by the tail if I had one as a child. Does seem pretty durable, and the details are pretty accurate without looking menacing or too cartoon like. If you get this item, you will be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Wolfie Ever!!","review":"This wolf is so beautiful and floppy! It is definitely well worth the money! It's great for cuddling, hugging, and guarding your bed, and is lovely just to look at if you like wolves. What really surprised me is, this wolf is HUGE. It is every bit of 30 inches. What I like best about it is the perfect expression on the face, extremely realistic, but not scary. The fur is lifelike and very soft. The only bad thing about this wolf is that it's to big to take on vacation with you!! BOTTOM LINE: If you're going to get a plush wolf, get this one! You'll love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillow","review":"I bought this present for my boyfriend last Christmas and he currently uses it as a pillow. He loves wolves and I thought that a near-lifesize one would be a good gift. It's not so big as to be cumbersome so long as you don't try and carry it around everywhere, and doesn't have any hard or sharp bits to poke at you, so it makes a great sleeping companion. The fur on his back isn't really as soft as I would like but my boyfriend doesn't seem to mind at all. I think the rough fur may add a little bit to realism as well, if that's what you're going for. Overall I think it's a good buy for anyone who likes large stuffed animals, dogs, or wolves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kewt and kuddly","review":"I got this for my grand daughter who is 18months.

Well worth the money fast shipping and very soft and mine didn't shed at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful snuggle-buddy","review":"This plush, while the stitching is poor in some areas and had a few holes that needed fixing, is one of the softest plushies in my collection. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes stuffed animals, and wants a larger one."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Fave!!!!","review":"Just got my new wolf plush and I couldn't be happier. I am a huge wolf lover have been since I was little. If it has a wolf on it I have to have it. lol I've been searching for awhile for a really big wolf plush and when I saw this one I was ecstatic! It is exactly what I've been looking for. Its great for snuggling on the couch or when I'm asleep. It is definitely a great addition to my plush collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wolf","review":"Well, when I first received the wolf I was really amazed at how big the box was and was surprised at the size of the wolf that I was so happy. My almost 2yo niece loves playing with it by climbing on top of him like she was riding it. perfect sized and stuffing. It has been durable for the 2yrs i had it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than a real one","review":"I got mine at a store but a review is a review.overall this is a nice toy, it is a toy so it won't be an exact replica of a real wolf, its plastic eyes gaze at you as if it wants something (your cookies?) the felt claws are non threatening.though, the whiskers could come out though if you push and pull at them.its hugeness makes for lots of hugging fun, even when you are an older person, because it is so big it makes a good pillow and or cushion. its floppy nature is amusing and makes it funny to look at.the doll comes with some information about wolves on a hanging tag, these are in several languages"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a wolf!","review":"I love wolves and I love this product! Don't think this is just for kids. I'm currently 21 years old and I think it is awesome! It is very large and it's fur is soft. It does shed a bit but only makes it feel more realistic. I've had people see it and think it was real at first glance. It lays around my house and definitely a great buy. Would be a great gift as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Causes me to do a 'double-take'","review":"Bought this for our 5 year old daughter - she wanted a large stuffed wolf. Turns out, after 6 mos. this continues to be her favorite and now I've got my other kids wanting one. As everyone else notes, it is soft - really soft. Used as a pillow all the time. And, extremely realistic - I can't count the times I've noticed it out of the corner of my eye and had a split-second thought of \\"what is that?!?\\". Overall for the money it's one of the nicest stuffed animals my kids have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful plush Wolf","review":"This item is better than described. It is a beautiful large plush Wolf that is very authentic. Fast shipping. Item could not have been better. A++++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for night time hugs!","review":"Mom and I shared another stuffed toy specifically to cuddle with while going to sleep. She wanted it back, and I figured I would get a new stuffed animal to cuddle with while sleeping.This one is perfect. As a 22 year old female (Not ashamed!) I don't feel crowded with it in bed and my arms wrap perfectly around it. The thing's not heavy either, and when not under the covers, I can pose it on the bed and it stays there.I was expecting the fur to be a little smoother, but I realized with the material it was made with, it could probably be rubbed against for years (like I intend to) and still keep the same softness, unlike overly soft furred animals.I definitely like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"His a perfect replacement for my wolf boyfriend!","review":"lol jk.. My bf got this for me for our monthly gift. He's my wolf so this big stuffed animal is perfect for when he's gone so i can hug it and pretend its him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fuzzy fuzzy!","review":"Like another few reviewers, I am in my twenties and still sleep with something soft and fuzzy when I go to bed... and when I saw this, I was in love. It's solidly stuffed, so it creates a great arm support for side sleepers (like me). Soft, but seems to shed fur like the real thing... that's my only real complaint so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little friend.","review":"This big ol' guy made a great birthday gift.

I didn't think it was worth the risk of taking a known carcinogen. This warning is only sent to residents in California.

Although I am retired and am working out of a home greenhouse, I can remember years of working in commercial greenhouses where I would have killed for the info contained in this book. Because of my background in commercial greenhouses, I thought I knew it all.......little did I know. The book is 'user friendly' which is a plus for me and I have used it when giving classes for the Idaho Master Gardening program. I ALWAYS take it to class with me, and recommend it to the students. Not everyone will be able to justify the cost of the book, but if at all possible, suck up to a friend that owns a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Don't Like This, You Don't Like Music...","review":"There is something on this album for everyone. Blues, Rock, Metal, Jazz, Reggae, Funk, Folk, and not only hints of these musical themes, all the songs are gritty, tongue in cheek style that demands listening attention. Fused with some of the most hilarious lyrics I've ever heard. Personally I think its more comical then \\"Were Only In It For The Money\\", but not as merciless as far as social commentary. But this doesn't pull any punches either. The first disc is more tightly composed compositions that only Zappa could do, and the second disc seems to be more of his musical experimentation with the long guitar solo's that are simply amazing. This album is definitive Frank Zappa. A must have for any music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at first listen.","review":"Frank Zappa is a master of his trade and the most under-appreciated artist of all time. This album only proves this point. From beginning to end you will be amazed. Other people mentioned 'greatest guitar solos' and so-forth, and while this may be true, I think this one has to be looked at as a whole. I find it hard to listen in segments because I'm drawn into the story through the music every time. It's the perfect mix of everything that could possibly make an album great and everyone should own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"thumbs up","review":"I think Joe's garage is the best CD Zappa produced. It has all the most popular songs on it; Catholic girls, yellow snow. . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts Off Great, Gradually Losing Cohesiveness But Still NOT BAD!","review":"The only disappointing aspect of FZ's \\"Joe's Garage\\" is the fact that a pretty decent story begins to lose its' focus toward the end. It probably would have been better if there was only Act I, with most of the other material used out of context elsewhere. But who am I to second guess and question Zappa's creativity?This is FZ's \\"Tommy\\", if you will. I just think the storyline became too silly. On the other hand, sometimes humor DOES belong in music. This is, however, an essential FZ release. It's a shame this wasn't made into a film. I imagine Seth MacFarlane or Matt Groening could have created a great animated version to go along with the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Zappa","review":"Mr Zappa is the original rapper even though with a whisper. Great guitar, sax, jazz. Funny stories too. Great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sy Borg. Gimme Dat, Gimme Dat","review":"You already know how great this album is, so I won't ramble on about that. All I want to say is that \\"Sy Borg\\" is one of the greatest Frank Zappa compositions, and it's completely overlooked. Yes, it's completely twisted and licentious lyrically, but listen to the melody! It's insanely beautiful! Along with songs like \\"Punky's Whips,\\" \\"Sofa,\\" \\"Let's Make the Water Turn Black,\\" and \\"I Promise Not to Come in Your Mouth,\\" it displays perfectly the dichotomous nature of Zappa compositions: Inimitable musical beauty coupled with salacious or ridiculous imagery.But why four stars instead of five? Well, I gotta be honest. I always skip over \\"Outside Now\\" and \\"He Used to Cut the Grass.\\"Other than that, Joe's Garage is pretty much perfect. \\"Stick it Out\\" and \\"Keep it Greasy\\" may make you uncomfortable the first time around, but you'll get used to it.

I'm in agreement, that Zappa was a unique figure in American music.BUTThis is his weakest effort, shamelessly pandering to the same people he seems to parody. It's truly air-head rock, not much different than AOL rock, with little Zappa humor and flourishes. The humor is either dated, or aimed at pre-teens. This period of Zappa (early 80's)I enjoy the least.Zappa was brave. Zappa was brilliant. But Zappa was not occasionaly without fault.Im sure there are more meaningful performances in the Vault, than this mash-up of psuedo-reggae, glam-rock and purile humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A road map please?","review":"When the album works, it's fun. You can always enjoy the title track, or Catholic Girls. And Outside Now helps reaffirm what made Zappa a guitar legend. Aside from that, especially with the constant expositions from the Central Scrutinizer who keeps sticking his nose in (sorry, Frank) through the album, I found the album gets dull pretty fast.

Starts out strong, then turns into a sophomoric snicker fest that no one but the artist would relate to. Uninvolved, musically speaking. Only worth borrowing from a friend for the title track and \\"Catholic Girls\\", both of which can probably be found live in a better form, and hopefully around better material. After that, theres groupies, machine sex, and a world without music. Im sure The Master was trying to make a statement here, but in the end, youre not moved to care. You can almost tell Zappa knows its a tossoff. A three album tossoff, to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great anti-censorship album!","review":"Zappa's melodramatic style, sense of humor, and masterful musicianship combine on this album to create one of the most prescient and scathing political statements ever made. Predating the PMRC and preachers for profit by several years, Zappa weaves a tale of government censorship of music, officially-sanctioned sex robots, and wet t-shirt contests. The guitar work will blow your mind (Watermellon in Easter Hay, On the Bus), and you'll finish this 2 CD set with a healthy contempt for the Tipper Gores and Jerry Falwells of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I ordered the CD for my husband to replace a tired old tape he couldn't play anymore.

She emphasizes that learning should be fun for the dog and the owner, then on page 107 when she teaches SIT STAY she writes \\"He [The dog]understands that when you call him he must go to you and that if he doesn't, you will bore hime to death...\\" All in all, I would not recommend this book to any serious dog owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must-Own\\" for anyone who loves a dog!","review":"If you've ever wished you could speak with your dog in his own language, here's your chance.

Don't get me wrong, a well written sex scene can add a lot to a book, but these actually made me go \\"ewww\\" They were crude, and rather vulgar.

Where the man is the smartest and all powerful. This is one of those books. However, it also shows how much progress women have made, all on their own, fighting every step of the way and never giving up. In London, England, 1813, Kate Duncan has been stripped of her title and money but doesn't know it. She falls for Lucas, a man of wealth and power. A love potion adds a bit of intrigue to the story. Kate and Lucas sleep together again and again. This is a R rated book for me. I found the sex scenes primal and the sexual language very blunt and crude. Maybe that's exactly what the author meant it to be. Maybe the words fit the time period. I do like books with a happy ending and this has that. I will give this author another try.

The fact that Verdi did not even write an opera based on Shakespeare's Hamlet makes her synopsis all the more ingenious.

Just enough curves thrown at the viewer to keep the interest. Not your typical Hollywood movie, where the leading man is twice the age of the leading woman/child. By Hollywood standards, the leading man and woman aren't arrestingly handsome/gorgeous but who cares? It's refreshing to have an older woman/younger man theme.

Sharpe, the \\"hero\\" of the piece, attempts to shoot his fellow officer in the back, during battle, for no good reason other than Sharpe's chronic bad humor.

As it was said, this is a great intro to Zappa, it was my first album. Watch Baby Snakes too, it'll blow your mind. The band is amazing (Terry, and Tommy mars & Peter Wolf especially) and this is great, funny music that is full of soul in contrary to what that poor misguided soul Andy Reddings said. Get this and every other Zappa album.P.S. Andy Reddings- Steve Vai, who you seem to worship, got his start in Frank's band & is quite possibly the worlds biggest FZ fan. He published a book with 21 Zappa transcriptions in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crude, Rude and Abusive and Scorching too","review":"Sheik Yerbouti is a sociology study on late 70s life and other aspects of society. While, many of the lyrics are crude and offensive, that is part of their appeal and the music is complex and wonderfully executed as always.Zappa does not sing all the lyrics, which is good in some cases as we get to hear Bozzio's freaky Meat-Loafish voice and Adrian Belew as well.It's difficult if not impossible to choose a favorite track as they all mesh together into one musicial event. A track by track analysis would be quite tedious. Suffice it to say that if you are offended by the content of this album then you really shouldn't be listening to Frank Zappa or are uninformed about his general philosophy and approach to music. Whatever the case, the music is excecuted with the necessary precision to make it work as a whole. And isn't that the ultimate goal of any album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Discover The Genius Of Zappa","review":"A great mix of radio-friendly and not-so-radio-friendly songs, scorching guitar riffs, songs covering topics never before and never again covered, clever and often very humorous lyrics, and some really interesting improvisational work where you don't really know where the music's heading next -- that is the world of Frank Zappa. There is a little something for everybody. And the more Zappa you listen to, the more in awe of his talent you become.There are so many outstanding songs on this album, and I would have to say \\"Flakes\\" is among my favorite of all Zappa's songs. Dylan fans may also appreciate the little homage to Bob in this one. \\"Broken Hearts,\\" \\"Bobby Brown,\\" \\"Dancin' Fool,\\" and \\"Jewish Princess\\" always manage to put a smile on my face.This is truly some unique music by an artist that can never be duplicated.

Is he a HOMOPHOBE or what?!?! Come on frank, you are such a proponent of FREE THOUGHT. Grow up! (...).Aside from the lyrics, most of the music is kind of TRITE, not all that groovin', and there is alot of much better Zappa material out there.

That is only one of several times the reader is instructed to use MSDN, as if we all hadn't been there before we got this book.

Almost Midnight is just as good -- maybe even a little better. It's genre-bending literature at its best. It's more than a true-crime book; it's an epic story of grinding poverty, violence, white-knuckle road trips, and crazy salvation. The book takes you right inside the Ozarks outlaw culture and into the heart and soul of its main character, triple-murderer Darrell Mease. You might not like Darrel Mease once you've finished reading, but you'll sure understand him a lot better.

Because I understood the therapy process, I was able to look up recent academic research papers, read them with understanding, and in some cases, pick the flaws.Neubauer's book is now a little aged. It is very helpful to read it first, then read Paul Harch's more recent book, The Oxygen Revolution.

Sadly, their abilities are channeled into a dire reading of the Sixth. As the editorial review suggests, the piece does not undermine itself by dismissing the quiet interludes and sections committed to married love/solitude. Bernstein injects trite irony throughout the whole performance, destroying any sense of intimacy and the eclectic nature of the symphony. The last movement very much sums up the performance. He has no sense of the fateful abyss, as Karajan so wonderfully conjures up, and destroys the tragic structure, wherein lies much of the profundity and intellectual meat of this piece. Sadly, this is misconceived - Bernstein is almost always interesting and sometimes moving, but here he totally misses the mark with bland excess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a Great Gift Without Hurting the Wallet","review":"I gave this necklace to my mother as part of her Christmas and she loved it.

The arrow indicators that show when you current speed is above/below your average speed is about as fancy as it gets. Dual tire size might also appeal to some folks, though it's easier to just have a computer for each bike. The wire is extra thick compared to most wired computers and will hold up to some abuse. The main benefit of a wired computer these days is if you run high powered LED lights for night riding/commuting. I have a bar mounted headlamp and it isn't possible to position a wireless computer far enough away from it to avoid interference.

We even went to the Cateye website and looked at their chart to see if there was any information or category stating \\"front wheel only\\" for the Enduro 8. Only after doing this research did we then order the Enduro. GUESS WHAT!! The wire length is too short for a rear wheel setup on a standard size bicycle. Thus useless for a rear wheel trainer (unless you have a minibike). Rating of 2 stars is for not providing crucial information for prospective buyers. Update March 28 2007.

I bought \\"Bitter\\" (album #3) and was disappointed because it was a departure from the sound of the first two.When I saw that \\"Cookie\\" was out, I figured that I'd check itout and see if she'd gone back to the funk stuff.Answer: Nope.Artistically, I like how she chooses to talk about her topics, but I just am not all that interested in listening to the music.Bottom line: I didn't really like it because the music was different. If you're into her stuff because of the topics/poetry rather than the music, you might like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meshells best album to date","review":"On her past album shes been singing her head off and im glad she now has dedicated herself to spoken word the best songs on this album are dead nigga blvd 1 and pocketbook remix on bitter i couldnt stand her singing or anything but on this its so funky and she adresses many diffrent topics like politics and the etc........

This album doesn't set the normal jamming or tranquil mood that Me'Shell's music usual sets for me. Instead the mood seems tense and confusing. Is she trying to send a message or set a mood? Of all of her albums, the two underground albums and four released on the market, this album is clearly medicore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Very bad poetry and I have gotten sick and tired of her complaining and her bitterness towards the world.Black is the only color her music makes.This album is depressing and their is nothing on this album you can shake your rump to.

I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer, but had never read any of her work. Suggest finding another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much work","review":"I'm an avid reader and I found this book to be far too much work to read. The writing style is punishing - some combination of observation/conversation/emotion that is all strung together inside of paragraphs that require the reader to re-read them in order to follow the meaning. Yes, there is an interesting plot here but it is largely overshadowed by the author's writing style. As the parents try to cope with the knowledge that their son has committed a murder they stumble along wrapped in cotton wool. I found myself wanting to shake some sense of reality into them - force them into some reaction - which further increased my frustration with this book.If you're still interested in reading The House Gun - I'd suggest a visit to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Alternative to a Sleeping Pill","review":"This book is soporific.

This washer has no soak feature (although there is a Soak setting) and my clothes continue to get dingier and dingier as time goes by. I have some white blouses I probabably washed 10 times using Clorox, OxiClean, the \\"Whitest Whites\\" setting, etc. and they never came clean. I finally had to soak them in the kitchen sink and then carry them to the washing machine. The thought of having dirty clothes for the next 10 years or just throwing the machine away and taking a $1000 loss makes me sick. I am only giving it 1 star because zero stars was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy a Cabrio Washer","review":"This is by far the worst washer I have ever had the misfortune to use. It doesn't get my clothes clean, the most basic task of a washer. On anything but the lowest spin speed my clothes come out a mess of wrinkles and anything delicate is stretched out of shape. Someone really screwed with this design. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this reissued?","review":"Luckily, I only blew about seven bucks on this CD. I can't figure out why this was reissued, although it probably has to do the the big names involved. The vocal performances are not only rough around the edges, but rather under-characterized. But they are spectacular compared with the string performances, which can be described as amateurish at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gesualdo's music is a treat.

But after an easy install everything worked great. I am Vacuuming like never before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully researched and written but poorly edited.","review":"Mr. Isaac's book is an excellent idea and almost perfectly executed. Far from being a \\"psycho-babble\\" book, Mr. Isaac explores in a powerful fashion the life of a man in such a way that we very much get to know him. Carter is a man who we have all met, known, or even lived with at one time or another.The only thing that I disagreed with was the ordering of the book's treatment of Landon Carter. I would have appreciated a more chronological presentation. Still, I understand why Mr. Isaac wrote it using the organization based on subject matter, but I disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I read this book while on vacation at Colonial Williamsburg, Virgina. It would be hard to imagine a better atmosphere in which to consider it.The focus of the book is the conflicting world views of the patriarch, Landon Carter (whose plantation is in the Williamsburg area), his slaves, and his son. The book illuminates the cognitive disconnects and churning dissatisfactions that plagued Carter, his heirs, and their plantation slaves because of rigid social separation, institutionalized deceit, and the dissolution of personal and power relationships at the coming of the American Revolution.I generally dislike social histories -- however necessary they may be -- if only because they seem always to be selective, poorly documented, and subject to easy contradiction. This one -- perhaps because it is so concentrated on the microcosm of one Virginia family -- manages to come across as solid, scholarly, believable, and a pretty good story to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speculative psychology in the guise of history","review":"The author draws profound implications from diary passages which seldom appear to support those implications. The attempted parallel between Carter's plantation life and the revolution is labored, particularly the \\"father\\" analogy. Although one takes the point early in the book that King George and Landon Carter are both \\"fathers,\\" this point is incessantly repeated, to the point of irritation. There is little hard evidence given for the proposition that King George, who was about 24 years old, was viewed by many 50- and 60-year-old colonists as a \\"father,\\" or that the Revolution was symbolic parricide. The author spins simple diary statements into Carter's views of the cosmos, and this is seldom supported. The author also refers to Carter throughout as \\"Landon,\\" as though they were personally close. The events chronicled by the diary are, in themselves, quite interesting. It is the psychological speculation that makes the book hard to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff, no substance","review":"I found this book to provide a good introduction in the first chapter, but it was extremely wordy in describing SOA and ESB principles. The definitions were polluted with buzzwords and sales jargon to the point of being painful. It's \\"marketecture.\\"A book that provides a concise and clear definition of SOA principles is \\"Enterprise SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture Best Practices\\" by Dirk Krafzig, Karl Banke, Dirk Slama. While better than Enterprise Service Bus, this book also does not entirely meet the needs of a computer professional embarking on a large Enterprise software project.I still have not found a book that provides the necessary guidance with regard to architectural principles, architectural styles, communicating an architecture effectively and evaluating/analyzing existing architectures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book slightly before mass SOA Adoption","review":"This is a good book on ESB's but not on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). Although ESB's have become the foundation of most SOA deployments, this book was written before the majority of the market activity took place around SOA. Therefore it doesn't cover in much detail registries, repositories, governance, security and more current SOA issues. It does however provide a very good overview of ESB's.It is interesting to note that the author has moved on from Sonic Software to Oracle and now is selling the virtues of SOA-enabling Grids or SOA Grids as the next best thing proving that SOA is about to move beyond the Enterprise and impact networks. I would expect to see a book in the near future by David on this topic.Gary E. SmithTHE SOA NETWORKwww.soanetwork.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"This book is the definitive guide on ESB - excellent coverage on fundamentals, patterns and implementation models. I had read quite a few books around SOA and Web Services, some good, others not so good... but this book really stands out stressing the importance of ESB.

In the first two Hungarian Rhapsodies of Liszt, Ormandy's orchestra plays very well, but the interpretations are somewhat stiff and unimaginative. One need only hear Bernstein's recording of No. 4 to hear some of the spirit that is missing. The performances of the Enesco Rhapsodies fare rather better. These are pieces that tend to play themselves if they are effectively conducted, and Ormandy's performances are comparable to the great interprtations by Antal Dorati. It is worth noting that Ormandy's recordings of Liszt and Enesco were made in 1957-8, and feature sound that is somewhat drier than the other recordings on this CD, although they are certainly clear and relatively full sounding. The sound in both the Alfven and the Chabrier is excellent, and Ormandy's performances here are excellent, beyond cavil. In fact, I doubt I've ever heard a better performance of Espana. So, although this CD has some limitations, at its best it is very good indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dead Men Do Tell Tales\\" is much better than this!","review":"As I read this book, I felt like the author was talking down to his readers, as if they were too stupid (or such huge fans of CSI) that they couldn't fully comprehend what he was doing throughout.

However, I found this book to be a real disappointment. I did not read the first book in the series and don't feel I lost out - although characters were clearly carried over, the story was ok as a stand-alone. Unfortunately, the author seemed to spend so much time creating \\"unique\\" individuals, that they never seemed to connect with each other. The heroine's implied personality change (from what she had been like before the start of the book) was largely unexplained and as a result, was more confusing then interesting as a plot point. Finally, while love scenes can certainly be left at the bedroom door, it seems highly unrealistic that two adults who are legally married and in theory fighting a great attraction for one another would not further their relationship.Overall, the characters did not come together for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magnificent Mr Handel","review":"A superb recording - it simply has to be as it was recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by the great Sir Charles Groves.A wonderful introduction to one of the great great composers - even if you have never heard his works other than the Royal Fireworks and the Water Music this will really get you going.

The entire movie is a mess. The storyline has been drastically changed, the location of the main action moved to another country (hence the French production, who unfortunately didn't have a clue about how to make this type of movie)and most distressing of all is the total lack of suspense, even to the point of not only changing the villain, but revealing the identity well before the end of the movie. Why Mary Higgins Clark's books have not been given the production values of the film adaptations of other piopular authors, such as John Grisham, remains the biggest mystery of all to me. Based on this terrible movie, I think it is time for Mary Higgins Clark to think twice before signing any agreements for movie adaptations, unless she can negotiate a contract which protects the integrity of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE GREATEST Keillor novel EVER!","review":"WLT is one of the most moving works I have ever read by Keillor. I read it when it first came out in hardback, and recently bought the audiobook, read by Keillor; it was like hearing it for the first time. Keillor's style of reading is so believable and enthralling, that I found myself leaving earlier for work in the morning so I could hear one whole side of the tape on the way. Listening to WLT as read by Keillor is a promise that you will laugh out loud, and a moment later weep as if you've lost your best friend. Amazing. I loved it! Deeply affecting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely tale of a lost era","review":"What a lovely book and what a lovely introduction to Mr Keillor's work. I bought this for 50 English pence from a second hand stall and didn't I get a good deal!! I can't conceive of the imagination required to write a book like this. The characters, the lives they've had and the conversations they have are all outstanding. This book is a funny and sad account of the early days of American radio where the only requirement to become a radio star was to know someone who already worked there. Amateurishness ruled!! the book paints a vivid and charming rendition of the days before disc jockeys (No disc jockeys??!! - I had no idea!) and the de-basing of popular radio. Thoroughly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too crude to review","review":"That's about all I have say... I didn't even finish it. It's a shame, too, when I was really looking forward to a nice Keillor read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The human condition, as exemplified by Radio.","review":"I think the Kirkus Reviews summary has this one just about right. This book seems to me like an allegory about Life, as exemplified by the phenomenon that Radio was in its early days. Wonderful humor--Keillor's ear for Midwestern culture is as usual razor-sharp--wonderful stories, and the inevitable sadness at the limits that constrain us all. Lots of sex and dirty jokes, though not all that different from what I remember as a child growing up in Ohio. Many interesting cultural insights as well. I enjoyed this book immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where has wit gone? Answer: Mostly Minnesota","review":"Mr. Keillor seems to have lived a charmed life. How else can one explain the characters of WLT except by attributing them to real people from his life?Despite it's ferocious wit, crisp style, and captivating storytelling \\"WLT\\" is TRUE, it rings of the true absurdity of personal experienceAfter reading it I envied Mr. Keillor and wanted to live in a world of his design.That is, a world of work, of people who don't fit into neat categories, a world of bawdy and outrageous humor, of sadness, of beautiful dreams and bitter realities, a world we inhabit every day and could see if a writer would sit beside us and catalog it.But why wish for that, if G. Keillor has done it for us already.And if a good mix of tears and smiles aren't your cup of tea, then just read it for the best laugh you've had in years"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and real look at an important, historical era","review":"Between the simplistic picture painted by WWII newsreels and the overwrought, angst-induced symbolism that drips from the Hemingways and Fitzgeralds, lies reality as it was known in the American Midwest in the 1940s. That reality, in terms touching, startling, and three-dimensional, can be found in WLT: A Radio Romance. The book focuses primarily on two brothers who found and operate a small radio station, and their efforts to accommodate the unique sensibilities of their novice listeners. Keillor deftly mixes and describes a collection of fallible and loveable personalities so dear that when the book comes to its close, you'll feel as if a group of close friends has left you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WLT: A Radio Romance","review":"Although I am a Garrison Keillor fan, and although this book was recommended to me by a pastor, I was totally offended by the crudity and sexual references (I'm obviously conservative) in the first 40 pages or so and couldn't convince myself that eventually this book would be worth reading in its entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Garrison Keillor audiobook","review":"I have been listening to Garrison Keillor audiobooks for many years. This is my absolute favorite. It is warm, tender, coarse but funny, and nostalgic - as a glimpse into radio history that most of us don't remember.

WLT: A Radio Romance is a real gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"wfoul a radio flop","review":"I have always liked Keillor's radio shows and was looking forward to reading WLT a Radio Romance which was given to me by a friend. If I had not wanted to offend my friend who recommended it highly I would never have finished it. I thought it was one of the most gratuitously crude books I have read in a long time. Perhaps I am just a thick skinned New Yorker but I found nothing touching or sweet about it. None of these mitfits evoked my sympathy; they all deserved each other. The only really comical chapter was the final one which made me laugh out loud. But then perhaps I was just happy to have finally reached the end of a very dark, depressing, disappointing and disgusting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive James Dean Bio","review":"This film tells the definitive story of how Dean became the overnight sensation that he was in EAST OF EDEN.

What an invigorating experience. It should be, if all you're used to is the same ol' same ol' on you're local \\"classic rock\\" radio station.

It gave us a new perspective on what meditation is supposed to do, and provided some other options beyond what we were familiar with. Both of us still do TM but we work in other techniques from time to time. Our daughter is now 17 and feeling some pre-college stress at school. So, when she asked us about stress-reduction, and we couldn't find our old copy of LeShan, we bought her a new copy for herself. She has been reading it, and--in the few hours when we are all at home at the same time--we meditate together with her. I have suggested LeShan to many of my university colleagues, along with the first book by Eckhart Tolle. Both are highly recommended: easy to read and very practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first book on mediation","review":"If you are interested in buying just one book on meditation, this should be it.

While I have a copy in my personal library, I wanted to gift a person with this. She has since commented about it positivly. I work in the ministerial field dealing with death and dying. This book has been of particular benefit to helping me in my work. There are so many types of these books now a days most of which are about a certain technique. Various websites are also the same. This book covers the complete field quite well and does not promote any technique over another. More material of this nature needs to be made available."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best basic training manual on meditation written.","review":"Although Lawrence LeShan has degrees from three universities, he writes with a simple, completely straightforward style. The first section is on the benefits of meditation. And the next section describes how to do four different kinds of meditations.If you are interested in meditation and you want the author to get right down to business, this is your book. LeShan says what he has to say in 137 pages. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on what works and what doesn't. Meditation works, and LeShan's instructions are effective and practical. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINE EXPLORATION OF MEDITATION FORMS & STYLES","review":"LeShan wrote How to Meditate years before the hundreds of popular books presenting easier, more simplistic approaches to meditation. And being a scientist himself, LeShan was compelled to stick to a more clinical, validated -- and thorough -- approach. How to Meditate is an excellent volume for those who've been meditating for a period of time and are interested in expanding into different forms of meditation. LeShan provides sufficient background and helpful lessons for each form. Take note that his approach is not touchy-feely and his writing is borderline austere. This is a slim, but informative book you can refer back to year after year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, simple, yet comprehensive","review":"Because I have been recommending HOW TO MEDITATE for many years, it seems appropriate to add it to my reviews on amazon.com.

No need to pay for a mantra, get sophisticated instruction, or subject yourself to a guru.

Great to have on you for all those little fixes! between this, duct tape and wd-40 theres nothing you can't fix!My only gripe is, and this is completely my fault, it is not all metal like I thought it would be. I figured it would be exactly the same as the supertool that my pop has, that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars...why would they put plastic in the joints where the pliers attach? why not make them all with the metal joints for greater strength and durability.anyway, I'm happy with it, gets the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good leatherman","review":"It was everything I was expecting.

It already broke, I can't change gears anymore.Now I have to deal with the warranty what is long enough but I would never buy that tool again. I got most of the other LXT series and I am very happy with them. The hammer drill is great. The other impacts drills are great, too. The saws and grinder are great as well.But don't, don't, don't waste your money for the hybrid drill, you will have a hard time finding all the bits you need for drilling in concrete, the only way is with special adapter chucks and than you are right back with a normal drill.It really doesn't work as good as advertised.But I give 5 Stars to the rest of the Series LXT. I am a big fan of Makita battery tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattles itself apart","review":"Like an all weather tire, this expensive tool tries to do too much and comes short on all four. It literally rattled itself apart. It may be good if you want to do a few masonry holes rarely, but then you have to buy hex bit masonry bits. That, or do what I did and put a chuck on the end. This drill doesn't like that and I think the imbalance is what rattled it apart.Then I dropped it a few times and the drill broke at the handle. I am going to get the impact driver, tool only and I will probably be as happy with that as all the other LXT products I own. I think Makita over-reached on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read and a great help--","review":"Letters from Nin is a juicy exchange between a young woman and her surrogate mother, about love, loss, family secrets, and the gossipy goings-on in a midwestern town. It's a delightful novel, but also a wonderful how-to book: Nin is trying to raise adorable Max, her first baby, and Kathe, the grandmother-substitute (and child therapist) comes up with all sorts of useful advice as Max grows out of infancy into toddlerdom and beyond. There's also another sort of how-to in the book as Nin, an artist, grapples with a central feminist issue, the struggle to combine motherhood and career. Kathe has her own surprising midlife developments to keep up with, trying to find love again after the loss of her beloved husband. This book gets at all sorts of things about a woman's life in an engaging lively manner. It's a great read and a great help, especially to anyone trying to figure out how to be a parent. There's humor and pathos here, and also wisdom. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product. Grate color.","review":"This stuff is great. I love the deep even color it gives me. I love the smell of the scrub and the tanner doesn't have that overbearing sunless tanner smell. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because of the convenience factor. You have to put it on before bed, after you shower and ex foliate, wait for it to dry, and then put on full body sleep wear to not get it on your bedding. Then in the morning you have to shower it off. Because of this, I tend to use the gradual tanner more often. If you are willing to invest the time and energy into the procedure than this would be a great product. Sleeping in full body pajamas and socks can be a bit toasty in the summer though. Summer is usually the time when I would want to put energy into getting a nice sunless tan with this stuff. Just get the fan out I guess and cancel all your plans for that evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused??","review":"The first time I ever purchased a bottle of the fake bake I LOVED it. It had an instant skin stain which was similar to a deep walnut color, not orangey at all. It allowed you to get a realistic instant tan and dried pretty quickly. However, when the stain washed off in the shower, there wasn't much of the longer lasting tan effect left. However, the color was perfect. When I ordered my second bottle, it was orangey - not at all realistic especially in sunlight. Wondering if they changed their formula... I hope they go back to the original as that deep walnut color is much better than the orangey color. May try one more bottle and hope for the best before going with another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Excellent!\\"","review":"I'm very happy with Fake Bake. It was nice to purchase the trio-pack at a decent price seeing their individual prices. Most of all the fake bake self tanner works wonders! I have fair skin and it does not leave me orange! Applying it can be a little challenging and I recommend doing it infront of a full length mirror if you have one...that way you can look out for any smudges. It's nice because even though it goes on dark, it fades the next morning after applying it so it works for any skin tones. Of course apply more later if you want a darker appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"This is the best self-tanner I have used so far. It does give you a nice brown (not yellow!!) color. Yes, you still have to be careful when you put it on, you can streak yourself!

All in all, I am pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps not great but really really good","review":"J G Farrell didn't produce great literature but he certainly wrote some wonderful stories, and could be hilariously funny as he wrote about members of the British empire facing historical disasters and pondered the past, present and future of the human race.

This one seemed intriguing. I was disappointed from the start. There is not nearly enough background given and the writer expects the reader to assume or to already know.

My favorite books are political thrillers and this could have been one if the writer had written it for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot wasted","review":"The plot has so much promise, but it was all wasted on the antics of the protagonist, a journalist who single-handedly uncovers the plot, fights off death-squads and assassins, and still has time to get the girl. And the head villain is a one-dimensional stereotype.Why the general population of the West should be on the edge of supporting secession before the book even starts is only given a cursory glance. And no good reason for not splitting the country is ever explored, other than it would inconvenience the big cities on the East coast.Disappointing book in multiple ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternal Fire","review":"Calder Willingham is from my home town of Rome, Ga.

No, they do not, or at least they should be taught not to. Not to mention the behavior that is being taught... Does the author speak this way? Does her children speak and behave this way? I hope not.

The claim, \\"adjustable comfort\\" is false because of this. What you really get is a very firm and thick pillow with no more adjustability than a standard polyester rolled batting pillow. I can't imagine how overstuffed the high-loft version would be. The fiber might be more down like with half the stuffing, but it is hard to tell without ripping it open and removing it yourself. It still might not adjust like down.I would only give it 1 star, but gave it 2 because it is a natural fiber, and that might be helpful to some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Ann's Review of Songs of Deliverence","review":"I believe that music is the universal language and that the Lord God Almighty made it so that in times of tragedy and travail we have an outlet to lift up our voices to be heard and He does and is quick to respond.

The first tale, The Iliad, recounts Greece's capture of Troy and the death of Achilles and the tragic return home of Agamemnon. The second, The Odyssey describes the long journey home of Odysseus, who, for years, had been enslaved on an island. I especially recommend Fagles' version to student or readers either unfamiliar with, or intimidated by Homer's work. It's easy-to-read and demonstrates why Homer is one of the greats."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS the translation for this generation","review":"I've read many versions of this work in my long years of life, and being a modern, this is the only version that was pure pleasure to read.

Since I was beginning a new course about these books, I went searching for a more up-to-date (modern) approach.Some professors of classical studies have criticized these translations for being marred by excessive use of colloquial language and that Fagles' meter does not capture the feeling of the Homeric hexameter. That may be true but, as far as I am concerned, it doesn't matter.Fagles' translation is very easy for the ordinary American to read and that is most important as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collector's item","review":"Nicely packaged hardcover double book set, promptly delivered.This is a great translation.

All of them are so stereotypical. Mrs. Do (the character played by Hong Kong singer/actress Sammy Cheung) reminds me a little of Scarlett O'Hara: pretty, rich, spoiled rotten, whiny, trampling over all the men in her life until she loses the one she loves ... with the difference that while Scarlett eventually changed her ways, Mrs. Do never did. Then, there are the other stereotypes: the scary mother-in-law-to-be, the momma's boy (Steve), the gay detectives, the rich enigmatic tycoon (Mr. Do). Watch this movie only for a glimpse into how the rich in Hong Kong live and some nice background of the city itself. For anything else, don't bother.

I called Coby Electronics to ask for replacement handsets, which they acknowledged were defective. However since their miserly 90 day warranty period has expired they are charging me $31.00 for the handsets which is only two more dollars than I paid for the entire phone in the first place. To add insult to injury, payment must be made by money order. Money orders are costly and involve a trip to the bank. In sum, due to the hassle and large expense, I can only assume that Coby is trying it's best to discourage anyone from obtaining replacements. I am not the only person who feels this way.

The Bosch Provantage rep said they only cover drops up to 1 story high, but I didn't think the batteries were even covered against accidental drops, so kudos there.

These drills are used at the place where I work and that is one of the deciding factors on my choice. The only flaw I see and it is minor is the ring that switches from hammerdrilling to regular drilling is right where you tighten the chuck.

Camera is a bit big and heavy compared to the Tony Hawk helmet cam. But that's the cost to have better resolution and water resistance. Quality is acceptable. It works well with lots of light and very bad with low light. Sometimes image is a little wabbly. But in general its a fantastic toy for a really good price. Professional cameras are far more expensive.

Don't buy this or the tony hawk cam, if you really want a decent hemlet cam just save you money and buy a real one, you'll be disapointed if you buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Company did not perform","review":"Have not received product due to company and DHL error.

I've dropped it into pools, strapped it to scooters, and tossed it around and it still works. I haven't had it that long, but it records video just fine. Low light videos are not good. And when it makes the transfer from underwater to above, make sure there aren't big drops stuck on the lens or it'll distort your video.Overall, it's a fine camera for the price, the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because, well, yeah, the video quality is not great. But the piece of mind knowing that you can record yourself doing crazy things and not worry about the camera getting hurt is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap and easy to use","review":"The camera arrived packaged with a complement of mounting devices, and a USB cable. The resolution of the pictures is relatively low but still good. Back-lighting throws it for a loop (subject turns out too dark to recognize). It is light and easy to mount to a helmet or to handle bars on a bike or a motorcycle. It uses disposable batteries, which I like. Internal memory is very small, so resign yourself to buying a memory chip. The inability to view what you are recording while recording is a negative. It connects to a PC with no problem and the movies are easy to view. I haven't used it underwater yet but it will be awesome in or around a swimming pool or any body of water (when fishing). For the price it is unbeatable and if you are considering making movies of your activities, then this is the camera to start with. If you want more resolution then it will be time to move up to another camera at a much greater price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly bulletproof camera","review":"If you want to capture video in perilous situations, this camera isn't a bad choice but the image quality is poor. The optics are the primary problem. It is difficult to distinguish image quality differences between the maximum pixel resolution (640x480) and the lower resolutions due to the poor quality optics. The audio isn't very good either, even with the protective cap removed. Still, the camera is robust and will probably survive most abuse so it has its place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Camera - Simple Sound Quality Fix","review":"I am a police officer and I use this camera when interviewing people. I was initially disappointed with the sound quality, but found the video and capacity with the 2gig card excellent. The problem with the sound is the waterproofing. If you are not going to be using it in water or wet environments all you have to do is remove the mic cover and there is a black square rubber cover over the mic. It is 1mm or thicker and causes the sound distortion and lack of range. Remove it an re-install the cover and you get as good a sound as any other video camera. This camera is well made and a good value at the price. If it had an external mic jack it would rate five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but poor video quality","review":"Who wouldn't love a camcorder that is small, durable and shoots good quality video?

Also, the image/sound quality stinks. Objects like trees will be total silhouettes, while tints and tones will usually be overdone. If you're black, or dark skinned, you'll also be a silhouette; if you're white, you're going to be white...literally. There don't seem to be any midrange scales to this camera. Underwater shots can be creative, but, like I said, image is crappy, contrast is crappy and sound is crappy. It's a good toy for kids and a mediocre way to take videos from your bike or helmet. Don't expect much out of it. Look on YouTube for video results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sport video camera for a reasonable price","review":"I use this camera on my motorcycle, mountainbike, snorkeling, surfing and longskate. For bikes it's great, no matters weather. For snorkeling is very important a sunny day, but work very well. For surfing is a poor option, if you want to rec yourself in a wave; works better if someone else is filming you. To much movement and a high risk to lost the camera in a wipe out.

It worked, but in the end the SD Card ended up getting corrupted. At first it shot my 2 GB card to 1 GB, then proceeded to completely destroy it.I made a decent video with it, but can't keep up with the nasty habit it has of destroying expensive SD Cards. Not worth any price if you can't retrieve the data.**NOTE: I finally discovered after headache it only took FAT 16 cards, and imagine part of my headache was because I used FAT 32 on it.

It came with a nice case, and mounts although i did not like the mounts to much. The handlebar mount is the only one that i like because the helmet mounts don't work whatsoever. Overall, i was disappointed with this camera and have just ordered a drift stealth. If you are going to buy a PoV camera, don't buy this one.

Add a bike and dirt road and you can forget it, the picture becomes totally wavy and wobbly.Sound is also quite horrible. The mic is not isolated from the camera body, so even the slightest vibration becomes a hideous white noise, and when the video is reviewed later this will most often overpower the actual sound you wanted to capture. Wind noise is also picked up, but this can be reduced by taping a piece of soft foam over the mic opening.The unit is also quite large, and mounting is effectively limited to what they include in the box without some modification.Don't believe me, search youtube for ATC-2K video.

She said that the red circles would represent the negative numbers and the blue circles would represent the positive numbers. That was confusing. For me, negative was grayish and dull, while positive was red like fire with orange highlites. After that I could not use my synesthetic mind to anwser the questions she was giving.

The story follows Mia, a girl with a rare condition called synesthesia, as she struggles to find where she belongs in the world. Synestheics see the world in a unique way. Two of their senses, like vision and hearing, are crossed; so whenever a sythestheic hears a sound, he or she also sees a shape or color.

Although the general concept of the plot including synesthesia is a good idea, overall the execution was not well done. From the very beginning I had no interest in the characters and felt as if they had no depth.

So when you swallow a big gulp make sure you check the after taste, you might like it more than you thought possible...Scarlett Invocation aka Caitlin Burchto talk to the writter of this review aol im: rosepetalcandy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vaux cd... get it... enjoy it...","review":"Colorado should be proud. Saw Vaux live with BSF at Irving Plaza. They are really great & definately rock. I guess I can see the Sparta comparisons but they are different. This is much more full bodied music, heavier & for the most part louder (and fresher). The cd captures their sound & may be more finished, but live they have the same sound with much more power & enthusiasm.You should buy the cd.... listen... and catch them live if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some good hard rock","review":"This is an amazing album.

I find this CD to be upbeat, eclectic music like Checkfield and Mannheim Steamroller.Other artists I enjoy are (for example): Lightstream, Michael Gettel, David Lanz, David Foster, Vangelis.

You should start making them. I'll give you until say, next April to get them in. Yes, Iam the one who asked (forced) you to make the toys.

The band is great and plays with much inspiration, on an excellent selection of Zappa classics, from his vast output of classics. Some of Zappa's 1980s stuff had seemed a bit routine, but the sparks were really flying in this group. The jazz musicians in the group took the music to another level without leaving the foundation of the compositions behind. I have played this album numerous times without getting tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his very best, and that is saying something","review":"I have most, if not all, of the great man's work and this is right up there, top 5. If you are expecting Dave Brubeck, or Buddy Rich style jazz then move on, but if you like Miles Davis type jazz, of his latter years, buy this. It opens with Stinkfoot (not jazz), but then moves on to some extraordinary jazz instrumental passages with some enthralling guitar solos and some equally brilliant saxaphone. Two CDs, gripping from beginning to end. If you are into jazz but not necessarily FZ, buy it, you will not be disappointed and is an album any jazz fan should have in the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY PUT","review":"SIMPLY PUT, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS THAT FRANK ZAPPA EVER PUT OUT.

Nope, she played with it for about 30 seconds, and was bored! The thing is so small, that only little bitty babies could play with it while on their stomachs, and a baby small enough to play with it would not have the motor skills to do so! She attempted to pull up on it a few times, but it tips over! I noticed that as soon as I took it out of the box! NOT STURDY AT ALL! I have trouble opening some of the doors, so no way a little one could! The phone is impossible for little hands to hang up as well!

It's about the only toy she plays with on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for the youngest","review":"I bought this for my 1 year old after hemming and hawing about buying a larger play kitchen. This is really just too small for all but the youngest. My daughter played with it for a month, but now she wants to play with the cooking utensils and pots and pan, and there just isn't enough room to \\"play\\" with the kitchen. The shape sorter is nice, but there are better ones out there. My daughter, at the time was all about standing, and when she stood at this kitchen, she was taller than the small thing. This is a great kitchen for a very short time frame for the youngest. I would reccommend buying a bigger one, even if you wait a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tippy Toy","review":"My 13 month old loves her little kitchen.

She has had many hours of fun with her kitchen!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheaply made toy","review":"A friend of mine purchased this for my daughter's first birthday. She enjoys putting the shapes in the refrigerator door and making them drop down into the pot below. I felt that this toy was of very poor quality though, the microwave and oven door are very difficult for her to open/close and are made of very cheap plastic. When I think of Little Tykes I think of quality and this is one toy that is lacking that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun but only if you love ink in your carpet","review":"My daughter enjoyed this toy when she first got it at 9-months-old, but I cringe now thinking that she mouthed it at all. The first time I washed it, the ink from the stickers ran down the toy and into my carpet - staining it. This company is irresponsible in making children's toys that can result in damage to their home and possibly dangerous to their health. At the least, there should be a bold warning not to use water with this toy, which many children might want to do, it being a play kitchen. And what use is a toy for this age group that you cannot wash for fear of ruining it and your carpet - since they are prone to mouth their toys frequently. As a mother and a person who works in a professional capacity with young children, I strongly do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"My aunt bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She was a year old at the time and did not play with it at all. I figured she would play with it as she got a little older but she is almost 2 now and it is in brand new condition still. She does like putting the shapes in the shape sorter and hitting the button to make them spill out, but besides that she doesn't play with it. I agree if it were a little taller than maybe she would be intersted a little more. She is very small but still has to bend down to use it. Also it tips over very easily!! I am going to spend a little more this Christmas and get the full sized one. Hopefully she will play with that one!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"My 2 year old daughter gor this as a gift for Christams, and I got her a big kitchen.

She loved it. Her favorite thing was putting the blocks in and pressing the button. The thing that I did not like was that the phone would not stay on the side and the stove door was hard to open and shut.It actually is not even straight one side if the door is wider than the other. I guess that is why it is so hard to open and close."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter cooks up a storm with this kitchen","review":"My 11mo daughter received this for Christmas. When I took it out of the box I thought it was a bit small but my daughter loves it. She spends quite long periods of time putting the shapes in the holes and pressing the button to make them come out into the bowl. She opens and closes the fridge, microwave and oven taking things in and out. It keeps her little hands busy. As she is not yet standing it is the perfect toy for her. Yes, it does tip over but just put it against a wall or couch or table. The phone does pop off at the slightest touch but it's easy for baby to get at. The sink is a little small, but then who wants to spend all day washing dishes!! LOL!My only complaint is that the sounds (a timer bell, sizzling and boiling) are too quiet - I wish it was louder to really get the full effect of cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommy plays with it more than babies do","review":"My twin daughters received this as a Christmas present whent they were 11 months old. The first day they woke up and found this toy set up in the living room, their eyes lit up. The girls really like the shape sorter and laugh every time pushing the ice maker button makes the \\"ice cubes\\" fall out. Each of the ice cubes fits in any of the three holes, so there is less frustration for the babies, who are more interested in pressing the button anyway. Mommy likes to put pretend food and bowls in the microwave, oven and refrigerator and to \\"cook\\" on the stove and wash food in the sink. Unfortunately, the twins prefer to play by taking everything out and then turn their attention elsewhere.Best feature is the red phone, which the twins fight over. The worst is that this toy tips over pretty easily. As the girls are now walking, this kitchen is getting to be a little too small. We're going to have to get a larger one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought this sooner","review":"I bought this for my daughter on the spur of the moment (she's 14 months old now) and she just loves it. I propped the kitchen against the wall as soon as I took it out of the box so I've had no probs with it tipping over. It also doesn't tip over when she yanks or pulls open the little compartments. It's just enough toys to keep her interested without her getting confused on what to play with first. I highly recommend this to anybody. Even my three older sons enjoy sitting down and playing with her at her new kitchen. The size is perfect so she doesn't constantly have to stand (she's still wobbly) all the time just to reach anything. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy!","review":"I purchased this kitchen for my 15 month old daughter for Christmas. She loves it! So does my 4 1/2 yr old little boy. They have been playing with it non stop since Christmas morning. She cooks us meals and has us try them out. It does fall over quite easily if you have it standing out on the open floor. We solved this problem by putting it against the wall. No more falling over. Easily solved.I recommend this toy for anyone that has a toddler that loves to \\"pretend\\" cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS KITCHEN!!!","review":"We love this kitchen! It's really great for babies! My daughter got this for her first birthday and I wish we had gotten it sooner so she could have used it longer! She would sit and play with the dishes and the shapes and the sounds would make her laugh. As she got older throughout the year and a half it became more like a kitchen and she would cook for us and for her stuffed animals. It provided hours of entertainment! For Christmas when she was 2 and a half, we finally retired it to the attic and Santa brought her a big girl kitchen that she can stand at! This toy is a MUST have! It's great because it sits right up against the wall, doesn't take up too much room! It just has so much to do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Durability","review":"Our daughter received this as a Christnmas present. At 9 months she tended to tip it over when she would hold onto it and try to stand. She also shattered the green oven door when she climbed on it after she tipped it over and the pieces were hard and sharp.I was shocked at how easily the door shattered and quite disappointed. It ended up in the trash after only having it for a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun in the Kitchen","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday. She loves it.

I would definitely recommend this toy!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, could be more sturdy","review":"My daughter received this kitchen as a gift when she was 6 months old. She immediately loved playing with the pots and pans, ice cubs, and phone. She also loved the realistic kitchen sounds. As she got closer to the age this product is recommended for, however, she was able to easily pull the kitchen down on herself. As she was learning to pull up, she would try to brace herself on the kitchen. It is not nearly sturdy enough for a baby to pull up on. My only complaint about thsi toy is it should be heavier so as not to be so easily pulled down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun toy","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she was 10 months old and she loved it immediately. It has been a great learning toy for her. She loves opening up the doors and putting items in them - we keep finding her socks in the microwave! She is now 11 months old and has just figured out how to put the different shapes into the holes in the refrigerator. She also loves putting things into the pots and pans. It does tip over pretty easily so we just push it up against a wall. This is one of the few toys that she plays with daily - if you are a parent you know how fast kids get bored with their toys - so we have been very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy for our inquisitive 1 year old","review":"Bought this for our daughter's first birthday. She plays with it constantly. She really loves the little blocks that fit in the fridge. She has actually figured out how to put them in the holes and how the button works to release them. However, her favorite thing to do at this point is to tip it over and stand on the back of it. Luckily the Little Tikes products are very tough and she has not damaged it with her rough-housing. It is so cute to watch her having so much fun with this toy. We just bought her the nesting pots and pans to go with it (as someone on this site had recommended.) Now she has even more fun. She also likes to put some of her little toy animals in the sink. She also tried to whip up a little monkey stir-fry in the skillet. Definitley a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN for smaller tots","review":"My daughter received this for her first birthday and really took to it. It has been great for her to learn to push the buttons and hear the sounds it can make. She loves opening and closing the refrig door and making the ice cubes fall out. The only downside to this toy is it is small. GREAT for those that are sitting up and/or almost walking (or newly walking). But now that my daughter is walking she isn't as interested in it. It does fall over pretty easily. This is a pros/cons review (in my opinion) for the toy. $30 isn't a bad price for a \\"noise\\" maker toy. She got several months of fun play usage out of it and learned about cause and effect. Would I buy it again? Sure, but probably for a 6-9 month old versus a 12 month old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to bad of a toy","review":"I like the noises and \\"ice cubes\\" on this toy.

She likes the kitchen set she can stand at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Toy, but is Tippy","review":"I bought this kitchen set for my daughter who was one at the time. She is now almost two and still plays with it. However, we now have a 10 month old son who also enjoys playing with the kitchen which is not stable at all and with two trying to play with it it has been knocked over several times. We used to lay it down but now my husband has secured it to the wall and they are able to play with it much better and even cooperatively!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that much fun for a 10 month old","review":"I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter. Convinced she would love it. I have tried for almost a month now to get her interested in this toy to no avail. Other than chewing on the ice cubes & pail she could care less about it. For that I could have just bought her plastic blocks to chew on that are far cheaper. Also, now that she is crawling she tried to pull herself up on it and it is so weightless it toppels over. I disagree with the manufacturer recommended age. This would probably be a much better toy for a 2-3 year old child that understands the kitchen and pretend play."},{"rating":"1","title":"total waste of money !!!!","review":"I bought this for my daughter who is 17 months old. I was extremely excited since her daycare provider told me that the kitchen area was her favorite. I payed [money] for it. We put it together while she was sleeping and eagerly awaited morning to see her play with it. Huge disapointment. Within 5 minutes she was bored with it and moved on to a... ball. This thing is so tiny. The inside of the fridge is filled with \\"drawers\\" that don't pull out taking up space. The shelf in it was just big enough to fit a small box of animal crackers. The same with the oven and microwave. Even in a sitting position she had to bend to play with it. The range top was only big enough to fit the pot and pan it came with and there was no overhead room to drop play food in them. The shape sorter isn't at all educational because there are only 3 shapes and they all fit into the circle hole so there was no challenge. Bad investment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 6 months to 18 months","review":"We bought this for my daughter when she was 6 months old.

It's definitely unique in Zappa's catalog. \\"Regyptian Strut\\" is a great tune and there is a nice example of Zappa's rare acoustic guitar playing. \\"The Ocean is the Ultimate Solution\\" is a classic showcase of Zappa's guitar playing at its best.By the way, the vocal-less versions of the 3 songs - \\"Flambay\\", \\"Spider of Destiny\\", and \\"Time is Money\\", can be found on \\"Lather\\", which is also worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aaaaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhhh!!!!!!!","review":"Ms. Roe seems to like switching from character to character, setting to setting...so that a smooth, enjoyable read is impossible.

Highlight tracks are Bloodshed, Colourblind Love Affair, Breakout, Trouble and a classic rastaman anthem Statement.

Cobb has the lead role in this noirish nightmare of fate closing in. In the style of DOUBLE INDEMINITY, cop Cobb covers up for lover Jane Wyatt who kills her husband when he attempts to murder her. It seems that nothing can go wrong. The alibi is perfect, the witnesses are out in left field and a liquor store killer is ripe for the rap...However, in film noir Cobb doesn't stand a chance as his rookie cop brother figures things out. Fate, fate, fate...Great script, acting, and San Francisco locations circa 1950 make this a winner on all counts!...However, the film has fallen into public domain and although the visual is quite acceptible there are jumps and cuts/splices and the soundtrack is pretty shabby with hisses, pops and humming, though some scenes are really very good.So, if you're looking for a neat little noir then the price is right for this this mini-classic.

I found the chapters to be poorly organized, repetitious and over emphatical on small points, and vague on many important points. For a reader who has a good deal of previous exposure to behavior psychology, this may be a good text. For the majority of readers using this as a text to obtain an undergraduate degree without an emphisis on behavior, it is not. It seems to require quite a bit of previous exposure to behaviorist theories that most readers I have encountered do not have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly technical for the undergraduate, needs simplified.","review":"I found this book to be too technical and dry for the average undergraduate. It contained information that seemed both relevent and useless to the consumer. For instance, the chapters explained a mild version of the topic of discussion, then, went into detail on that topic later on. Instead of breaking the topics up so much it would be preferrable to read it all at once. I read the book numerous times, and still had some problems comprehending the exact meanings of many of the subjects.

Fortunately this is so much more than a grocery list. Other reviewers have said that this book is a disappointment, that it wasn't deep or that it strayed into areas where Kurt shouldn't have gone. I disagree.This book was written at the end of a man's life. His writing changed throughout his lifetime, along with his health, his thinking and his interests. This isn't his best book if you're measuring it against Cat's Cradle, but it is an excellent book if you're considering where the ideas came from, where the author has been, and where the author was in his lifespan when he wrote this.We will all age and grow and change. Some of that will make us wiser and more interesting, some of that will just make us different.

I had anticipated a greater effort on the author's part. He seems to be camping through much of it, and I had the impression it was published only because he needed a little cash flow."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new Vonnegut, same as the old","review":"Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors, and when I saw a new book came out, I of course bought it immediately. While most of his other books are certainly, and in many cases obviously, influenced by his anti-war and socialistic opinions, they are usually wrapped up in a fictional story. This book is rather simply a review of his opinions, taken to the much more bitter level of old age:\\"There is no reason to ever go to war.\\"\\"Everything we do is harming the environment and it will be gone very soon.\\"\\"Gas and uranium and the free market should be outlawed because they're making us all poor and dead.\\"Thrown in for good measure is prose advertisement for his screen prints and possible next novel (working title:) _If God Were Alive Today_, which I would certainly buy, because it's Vonnegut, and his fiction, which I find much more enjoyable than his collections of essays that retread the same ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic embarassment","review":"As a long-time fan of Vonnegut's writing, I was deeply disappointed and embarassed for Vonnegut. Imagine your grandfather getting drunk at your wedding and then trying to give a toast featuring a dirty joke. Vonnegut is just is no longer funny. Sadly, he has lost his wit and the genius of his early novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut is a Funny Man","review":"I liked this group of essays very much. Even though I consider Vonnegut one of the best writers writing (until very recentl) today, I don't read him very often. As anyone knows who has read Vonnegut, he presents, even in his fiction, very serious subjects. However, I tend to forget that he has a wonderful sense of humor. In my opinion it is his sense of humor carries me into his serious ideas and forces me to appreciate them more than I would if he were strictly one of the many gloom and doom writers. This group of essays brings that idea home again and again. Perhaps I laugh at the wrong things, but I shall be reading this book several more times, especially as Bush shrivels and blows away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye to ne of the greats","review":"A darker, harder Vonnegut.

Besides, history shows us that good health is no prerequisite for writers (just look at F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Last Tycoon,\\" written when he could barely even walk up a flight of stairs)--nor is it a prerequisite for American presidents (compare FDR's health to GWB's). Still, if you want a younger, healthier dose of misanthropic comedy, try Russell David Harper's absurd, understated novel \\"Bald\\" (and look for the Vonnegut-inspired hairpiece graphic on page 181)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man Who Sees His End.","review":"You can almost feel the words Mr. Vonnegut writes in his last work on this earth. He knows he is near the end, and you sense his frustration that maybe he didn't do as much as he could have done. Whatever that \\"done\\" is. But we know this isn't really Kurt's last novel.

You get what you expect -- a collection of great insights mixed in with some family history and wry witticisms. You can read the whole book in one easy sitting, however, there will be parts that may make you pause for a moment or so to let it sink in. The thing that most surprised me about the reviews of this book is that not everyone in the world has read even the basic Vonnegut. I still love Cat's Cradle, and reread it regularly. All in all, it's great to hear from this American master of prose again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, horrible reading","review":"The text of \\"A Man without a Country\\" is vintage Vonnegut, exactly what you expect and beautiful. The audio reading, though, is worse than terrible. This narrator takes an elementary-school approach to sentences that injects \\"feeling\\" into every sentence and phrase without regard for the actual feeling conveyed by the words. For two whole disks you have to endure inappropriate stresses and sophomorically exaggerated tonalities and sneery enunciations he mistakes for the sound of sarcasm, most of which have nothing to do with the sense of the sentences or the prose rhythms that drive them; it is a 3-hour demonstration of a nearly total lack of understanding of how Vonnegut's kind of humor works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I've wasted my time...","review":"The Genius has left the building.Vonnegut doesn't like the government, he witnessed the fire bombing of Dresden, and young people don't live up to his expectations...No Kidding! He has been telling us the same thing over and over for 20 years. This is no great Twain-like humorist writing here, just a complaining old curmudgeon. Gone is the genius that blew us away in his earlier stuff. Not a trace of narrative quality here...just another re-hash of his last few diatribes.If you seek to discover this great writer's genius, please find a copy of Player Piano, Cat's Cradle, Mother Night, The Sirens of Titan, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater or other works from the 20th Century that marked Vonnegut as one of the best and most original literary voices our country ever produced...Please don't form your opinion on this very, very minor and un-original tome that is not even a shadow of his former writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"kv can do no wrong","review":"this is probably kurt's softest/kindest novel. i say that because it seemed to lack the usual zingers kurt either doled out to his characters or to society.i liked his \\"guessers\\" theory to describe the way some people behave in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pleasant surprise!","review":"Well, this was a pleasant surprise.

I was surprised at how readable he is. Even when I didn't agree with him, I couldn't help enjoying myself anyway. A few times I laughed out loud at a surprising anecdote. I also learned a few things.

A friend of mine told me he had heard this book was not so good, but I disagree. I really liked it. My friend happens to be a rather politically conservative type, and after reading the book, I can see why \\"those people\\" might not like what they read here. There are several memorable lines of political commentary, a couple of which even made me laugh out loud. But don't expect anything along the lines of \\"Breakfast of Champions\\" or \\"Galapagos\\"; this is strictly memoir fare.I don't know that I'd recommend buying this book, however - I got my copy from the library, and it's so short, I would have felt a bit cheated if I had paid for it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless gem: The Author and the Book","review":"What a refreshing voice to hear once again!

What a joy.In this maddening age of the \\"dumbing down of America,\\" one can only hope that everyone will partake of this man's wonderful work! There is a little hint of much of his work introduced in these essays -- a great sampling that should make every reader hungry for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Diatribe","review":"I wanted to discover the exaulted Kurt Vonnegut and his reported mastery of prose. Instead, what I found in \\"A Man Without a Country\\" is not an articulate presentation of his views, but a ceaseless attack on political viewpoints opposite his own. My first impression of Vonnegut is a bitter old man lashing out. This book was a waste of time, thankfully only the non-fiction equivalent of a novella.I will try to read his earlier works with an open mind and not let \\"A Man Without a Country\\" sway my judgement of his creative ability. In this work it was too well concealed behind his negative advertising campaign against the Republican Party."},{"rating":"1","title":"The non-humerous curmudgeon","review":"In the opening of this book Vonnegut states that he was not planning on writing another book; he should have stuck with that plan.

He is one of the greatest authors of our generation, and he will be missed.A Man Without A Country is one of the greatest pieces of non-fiction I have ever read, and I do not enjoy non-fiction much. Kurt Vonnegut tackles a wide variety of subjects including politics, (he has a scathing portrayal of George Bush, which cracked me up) sex, literature, war, religion, and even writing, and he says it with such confidence and a lot of humor to boot. A Man Without A Country is a fantastic swan song from a great writer. The only gripe I have with this excellent piece is that it is far too short (I read it in less than an hour.)I would give this book 4.5 stars, but I'm rating it a 5 to help try to bump the overall rating to a 4.5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick, nice read for fans - send novices elsewhere","review":"Full disclosure: I am a big Vonnegut fan. Breakfast of Champions is possibly my favorite book (top 5, definitely), so I naturally had to grab what is probably going to be his last book.First reaction: Meh. It was a breezy, generally enjoyable read, but Vonnegut doesn't really hit up any new topics. Lots of contemplating the fact that he wrote Slaughterhouse-Five, lots of jabs at the Bush administration, lots of talk about how we are dependant on oil.It's just an unfocused pile of scribblings - not that that's necessarily a bad thing. Vonnegut fans will enjoy the quick read, but just send novices to his classics. I recommend Player Piano, Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, Welcome to the Monkey House, and of course, Breakfast of Champions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Much","review":"I hate to admit it, but I've read very little Vonnegut - Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse Five and Breakfast of Champions are all, in fact. It's not that I don't like him, but he's never been a personal favorite. His books are sometimes too much, if that makes any sense. That said, this collection of essays (I'm not sure what exactly to call it) more accurately reminds why he is considered such an important American author. The quotes at the first of each chapter are memorable; the depictions of life in general are at once humorous and truthful. Vonnegut's sense of humor is witty and clever, and I, for one, am going to give his novels another try."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could have met him","review":"I read the book the same day I bought it. The only downside is that it is too short. However, it's an excellent read. Reading this is like sitting next an old man telling you about the fascinating life he has lived. It is witty, pointed, and brings up some excellent food for thought. Fans of Vonnegut may notice some repeated thoughts from earlier books but this one still managed to bring up some original laugh out loud funny items.When I was finished with the book, I didn't feel as if I just read something. I felt like I had just finished talking with a wise old friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, ornery, spot on!","review":"If you feel alone and misunderstood in today's Orwellian world where \\"war is peace, freedom is slavery [and] ignorance is strength\\", you'll discover a reassuring and kindred spirit in the late, great Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. His observations may resonate uncomfortably for some but they are refreshing, honest, to the point and spot on! Would that those in power (\\"They're trashing the planet!\\") took Mr. Vonnegut's insights to heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"As of 11/04/08, Vonnegut has a country again.","review":"Reading this, it's very apparent that Vonnegut had pretty much given up on humanity. You already get that feel from most of his novels, but in this book of essays, Vonnegut leaves no doubt. The Bush years are the straw that broke the camel's back. And I have to say, my thinking was pretty much in line with Vonnegut's. But then came November 4th, 2008. Reading these essays, I was struck with a deep sadness that Vonnegut was not around to witness the magnificent manner in which the Bush era will end. I don't think Obama's election would have turned Vonnegut into a starry-eyed optimist, but I do think it might have tempered his pessimism, as it did mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I LOVE Kurt Vonnegut. I have read every book multiple times, and listened to audio versions of all I could find. I have seen Slaughterhouse-Five about seventeen times.However, perhaps he shouldn't have read his own prose.

His voice drove me nuts, and I'm usually a fan of authors reading their own work.Too bad.A Man Without a Country"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Letdown I'd Read Again","review":"The title is great. Vonnegut sold us with a great title that referred to a statement he'd made about poor (economically) men who'd come home from Vietnam finding themselves as men without a country. Watch the movie, \\"Back to School,\\" and Sam Kinison shows a little bit of this while teaching a history class.Vonnegut put what he states is the funniest joke in the world, which I have used to open talks I've given. The results have been mixed; the more educated the crowd the more receptive they are.Sadly, this very fast read is a composition of some of his already stated ideas. Frankly, I was hoping it would be a novel, as one review had said, about a man on vacation whose country is either spit out or swallowed up while he is away. The title with the content, however, leads us to believe that Vonnegut is merely stating how he feels as an American, or the work of impressive marketing, which I can certainly appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!

This album was always a bit of a conundrum. It doesn't really have a cohesion that many of the late era albums do have. Either side of this you have Man From Utopia which is a kind of B-movie related album (referentially & thematically) and Tinsletown Rebellion, which is all live and a fab all-round representation of the 1982 band.There is a lot of filler, No Not Now could've been done by Frank in about 5 minutes and Valley Girl is funny for a while. There's some great guitar playing on I Come From Nowhere and on side 2. It's an average album, if you want something from the same era that will keep you listening for hours get You Are What You Is or the earlier Joes Garage albums. Actually no, just buy the whole lot - sell your wife into slavery, I know I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite zappa cd's","review":"The ship arriving too late to save the drowning witch is one of my favorite zappa cd's. The track No Not Now is probably my all time favorite Zappa song(string beans to Utah). I really enjoy the lyrics on no not now and the way that Zappa sang it really makes it enjoyable to listen too. The second son \\"Valley Girl\\" was actually a top 40 hit for Frank Zappa with his daughter Moon Zappa performing the vocals on the track and although no kick butt guitar solos it is still worth listening too. The third track \\"I come from nowhere\\" is a really catchy track as well with some great guitar work and the title track is another song with a long instrumental and some tremendous guitar work by the great Zappa. I haven't been listening to Frank Zappa too long, but when I first heard his music it took me away and he is my favorite artist of all time. Some die hard Zappa fans may disagree with me, but I believe this cd is worth your money to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed Gem","review":"This is a real gem, great vocals (male and female) and great lyrics. Hard to catagorize but it is world with hints of etherial, dream pop and goth undertones. The female vocals will remind you of Lisa Gerrard just a hint. This is my favorite of their releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why oh Why...","review":"OH MY GOD I hated this movie! I love Holly Hunter, I love James Spader...how could such talented actors and David Cronenberg (who's latest movie Spider is phenomenal) go so wrong? I don't know...but somehow they managed to. And I managed to fall into the age old trap a movie lover says to themself: \\"It's got 2 great stars, and a great director...how bad can it be?\\" Well it can be this bad. And just as quickly as I bought this movie, I sold it. Someone here recommended it for fans of great sex scenes. I don't even see how the sex scenes worked. Ooh...scars, and broken bones, and wounds, and braces...how sexy...in bizaro world maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This May Be Art, But It's Bad Art","review":"This movie is just bad. Rarely have I watched a movie and just wanted it to be over. I can appreciate its artistic merit, but this movie had no point. Why somebody actually bankrolled this movie, I'll never know. There was plenty of sex, but the most boring sex scenes imaginable. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but I would only recommend this if you want to see just how bad and a waste of time a movie can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex, Cars, and Danger","review":"In this film, we're introduced to a fringe society of sorts who derive arousal from car crashes; watching them, reenacting them, and causing them. With no characterization by which to interpret the characters' motivations, the viewer is left with no protagonist with whom to identify. All you see is a bunch of shallow [people] who get... pleasure from bizarre and reckless behavior.If the novel upon which this movie was based held no more substance than the film itself, the two have combined to create one of the worst wastes of paper/celluloid in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken bones are not erotic, you morons.","review":"While I can give a moderate rating for the acting, and the film work is better than many other Cronenberg films, the idea of finding near fatal automobile accidents erotic is utterly perverse. This is voyeurism for idiots who have never been seriously physically wounded and know nothing about real physical pain. Break your femur and see what that does to your libido, you morons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing; stunning","review":"Probably the most daring, gutsy & creative movie I've ever seen.

That is a statement that is in effect saying that this is a work of art that either is too difficult to comprehend, ot it may make you uncomfortable. Either way, it is an insulting thing to say.\\"Crash\\" is a rough movie. It made me unconfortable. A lot of movies try to do that and fail. Is it so impotant for me to be uncomfortable? Yes. I am too complacent in my thinking. \\"Crash\\" shook that up for awhile. Good.A lot of people do not care for this film, and others may have liked it more if it had some obvious comedy ala \\"Pulp Fiction\\", but I think it may be the funniest movie I have seen in some time. Funny in the sense that laughter is a natural reaction to horror. You may not like this movie. That is fine, but I bet it will effect you in some way, which is a hell of a lot more than I can say for most movies being made today."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it fewer stars I would","review":"After reading some of these reviews, I wonder if people have seen the same film I did. I was not shocked, grossed out, or offended by this movie...I was terribly bored. The actors were trying way too hard to look sexy and mysterious. There was nothing believable or interesting at all about this film. So you want to crash cars and have sex...who cares? If you want to see a disturbing movie, see Betty Blue. If you want sex, rent a porno."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual movie","review":"Very strange movie! It seems more like an erotic fetish thriller movie than anything else.

A guesstimation of landing in print sometime late this year, should be adequate.

I have to say that sound was excellent as well as photography on the DVD version. Is is a great movie but is NOT Cronenbergs best. Spader worderful and smooth as always & Hunter incredibly sexy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this ever made?","review":"A horrible movie in every way.

Jame Spader hits Holly Hunter's car and is put into the hospital. Spader and his wife Deborah Kara Unger gets into the world of Elias Koteas and family, including a leg brace Rosanna Arquette. God, was this movie boring and I could barely hear any of the cast talking except the parts where their all doing each other. It's like, oh, look a car, let's have some sex, ok, thumbs up for the car. The only interesting thing in this was the recreating of James Dean's car crash that ended his life. Koteas is really a sicko- moefoe in this movie. Spader and Hunter are wasted. Hunter must of been wasted when she signed on for this movie. Arquette is not hot in those leg braces. Cronenberg fans might get a kick out of it but others beware. The sickest and horrible scene in this movie would be when Spader and Koteas get it on. stupid"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare portrayal of the author's real idea, a great film.","review":"David Cronenberg is good at what he does. In this case, wehave a film so solemn and intoxicating, it's hardly a cult classic ora guilty pleasure: It's like a case study from Sigmund Freud. Note that as graphic as \\"Crash\\" might be, it is hardly a pornographic film, in fact improves the image of sex. It's characterized here as truthfully as chemical dependency is depicted in \\"The Basketball Diaries\\". It's a sophisticated film to say the least. A mature film, for mature people.

You will have the depth of understanding necessary to unravel it's message or you won't. It's not a movie just about sex and car crashes, it's far more. It's a movie about the darker side of human nature sick, twisted. Crash is seductive, slowly luring you into shadow world of pain and death. The chance collision of two lives is the catalist that draws you down a dark path. Once you open the door and get in, Crash will take you into a world you have never known before. One thing is sure, as you drive down the highway of life and you see a horrible car accident, you slow down to look. Why? Because no one can resist looking at a wreck. You see the destruction, the pain, and even death but you look anyway. That is what watching this movie is like, staring a car crash with many victims. You hate to watch it but you can't help yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This movie was about sex and car crashes. The crashes weren't elaborate and the sex WAS NOT GRAPHIC. I do not understand why it received and NC-17 rating and why it was considered to controversial.

Save yourself the time and money and watch The Dead Zone again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"When I went and saw this movie with my friends we all expected an erotic thriller that barely made it into theatres. What we got was a movie that disgusted us and made us walk out of the movie before it was over.I found it's plot very poor, and some of the sex scenes completely pointless. In my eyes it was on of the worst movies I have ever seen.What got us to get up and leave the theatre was the scene in which they were making \\"love\\" in the Mercedes ............. I was disgusted, revolted, and very disapointed with Cronenberg for putting this drivel on to the big screen.If you like to see sex, now I mean A LOT of sex that is completely meaningless (yes I know that they get off by having sex in car wrecks), then go RENT this movie. However if you are like me and enjoy a somewhat intellectual movie, then borrow this one folks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This was one of the most pretentious movies I have seen in my life.

The description I heard every time the film was mentioned covers about five minutes of actual screen time and completely ignores the complexity of the characetrs involved. Cronenberg comes up with another winner-- excellent script, good pacing, and the kind of cast most hollywood-blockbuster directors dream of being able to assemble, including an (as usual) Oscar-worthy performance from Elias Koteas as Vaughan, thesociopathic leader of the band of fetishists. Definitely one worth seeing; on a par with Cronenberg's best work. ****"},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"It *isn't* a very good movie, no argument there. A few interesting ideas stewed together with some pretty explicit and sometimes weird sex, pretty much sums it up. Not much else is here: story, believable, developed characters, a sensible premise, etc. But it's interesting as a curiousity... something to see if you think it sounds at all interesting. And hey-ho, that James Spader is still rockin' strong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash Landing","review":"In Crash, director David Cronenberg's idea of foreplay includes vicious car wrecks a la Jayne Mansfield. If this kind of highway carnage doesn't get your motor revving, don't worry: there are plenty of others in the cerebral filmmaker's latest descent into the maelstrom.There's something undeniably alluring about the automobile: the chrome, the sheen, the rich Corinthian leather. All Crash is missing is Ricardo Montalban. Actually, there's something a wee bit Freudian in the movie's come-on; but for all of its psychobabble and metaphor, its still about a bunch of sexed-up blank slates doing the nasty in the front seat, the back seat; in a car wash, in a parking garage; guy on girl, guy on guy, girl on girl.It's hard to like Crash. More dry dissertation than moving movie experience, it makes you numb. Maybe that's the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jaw Dropping","review":"The is by far in the top five All Time most engrossing movies I've ever seen. Never did I see a story like this.

A name synopsis with creepy, scary and very unusual films. This movie is no exception. CRASH is disturbing. A surreal experience of sexual overdrive involving cars, crashes and extreme sex. David is quite a director. However, would you feel the same way about David's past films if his name were really Sally Cronenberg? I think not. Gives you something to ponder on though, doesn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully, ponderously bad.","review":"The problem I have with this movie is that it is so painfully self-aware. Every scene seems to cry out, \\"Look! Look how shocking and erotic and artistic this is! Wow! Aren't you shocked! Look - weird sex! How erotic and shocking! See, it's a big comment on modern life! It's art! \\". The whole movie is like something out of a \\"Sprockets\\" sketch on Saturday Night Live. I'm somewhat surprised it wasn't filmed in black and white, dubbed into French, and shown with subtitles to make it more pretentious. However, like most things that go out of their way to be shocking and artistic, this movie falls flat on its face, failing to either shock or stimulate. Had the movie backed off a bit, it would still be bad, but I might have been able to enjoy a laugh or two at the filmmaker's expense - instead, I found myself rolling my eyes and wishing the movie would just get over itself already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash (1997)","review":"This might be the worst movie of all time.

You have people who survive car crashes and are turned on by the experience. The movie takes the turn of the crash victims getting into self inflicted crashes to gain arousal.

Aside from the scene where they recreate James Dean's car crash (very Tarentino'ish) I thought the movie was a waste of time. It's more of a masochistic fetish softporn??? The dialog is weak and the acting is even WEAKER Hint: Arquette is in it. I wouldn't even recommend renting this.If you want a dark, edgy and sometimes funny movie check out \\"the Salton Sea\\" or re-watch pulp fiction ...againIf you're jones'n for some Cronenberg, the new Criterion release of \\"Naked Lunch\\" is excellent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just goes nowhere","review":"I admit the concept of David Cronenberg's Crash aroused my curiosity after reading the discription among various websites. I don't know how well this story was thought out on in the namesake novel but it certaintly isn't in this film. I could not care less about any of these characters and why they could be fascinated by car crashes. There is always a rational explanation behind what turns people on and this film has NO idea how to provide it. So instead we get sex scene after sex scene not knowing who these two perverse abstracts of humanity are; I describe James Spader's and Holly Hunter's characters as such because they are so lifeless and glossy eyed I can't accept them as human beings. Simply put, this is just a totally un-involving and dull film.

A couple who become involved with a group who stages famous crashes and become sexually aroused by the sheer thrill of it all. The characters have a serious fetish problem. At the end, I'm wondering \\"...why should I care about these people?\\" The film is sick & perverted and not a pleasant film to watch. Leave the kiddies at home!

Isn't it time for Cronenberg to do something valuable in his life, pursue another topic rather than blending sex, technology, and mortification of the flesh. Ted Turner wanted to shelf it because he hated it but his company FINE LINE has distributed it throughout Europe.

Crash is, I believe, the story of people who are in love with thier own deaths. The final image of this film is extremely unstettling.

Interestingly enough, the subtitles are not always the same as the dubbed dialogue. You'll discover this when you watch the dubbed version with English subtitles.Now, if you're wondering \\"Why Lain for a Japanese girl's name?\\" it's because her name is written in Chinese characters \\"Sound of a Bell\\" which is read \\"Rei-in.\\" Close enough to \\"Lain,\\" right? But why \\"Lain\\" and not \\"Rain\\" I have no idea. But it does sound more mysterious and certainly adds to the mystique of this amazing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realy >Anime at its best> !","review":"In addition to the other review, I'd like to say that only one other anime gave me so much to think about, hours, days and even weeks after I saw it :Neon Genesis Evangelion.Like the other previewer said, there aren't any giant robos or such, but after looking at it, you'll have to think about many things you wouldn't have expected turning up in an anime, you simply get engaged with the story ... but you have to take this anime seriously, or, like in NGE, the story won't be as half as magnificient as if you did ...Besides of NGE, this is my personal favorite anime, and not only mine ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelicious","review":"Great - in terms of abstract feel.Lain is a great example of how extreme Japanese anime can be. The plot does make some sense, but very obscure. Times to times you will feel that the creator cheats on you by giving you incomprehensible explanation that maybe even himself does not understand. However, in term of artistic view, I must give Lain 5/5. The creativity in this anime is truly amazing, the grayish tone colors are beautiful and sound effects are great.If you're looking for visual and aural satisfactions, Lain is truly a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"its very deep, not like those shallow \\"happy pretend world\\"","review":"Lain is the deepest anime i have ever seen, there are lots of points of view and wise saying that makes you think a lot, even after you finish watching it, it just stays in your head and you cant stop thinking about it!. its very interesting and superbly drawn. ARE YOU SICK & TIRED OF THOSE SHALLOW ANIMES WITH ALMOUST NO PLOT AT ALL?!!! GET THIS DVD SET NOW!!! WITHOUT THINKING TWICE,p.s: it reminds a bit \\"the matrix\\"+the artwork boxset is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wired","review":"This was quite a bizarre little series. This really isn't your typical action-packed anime with a fight scene every 5 minutes, this one has a much slower pace to it, relying more on the dialogue and development of the characters, rather than \\"who beat up who\\". It goes down to a deeper, much more psychological level. Right to the bone, in fact. This was a very rewarding series for me. While it's not entirely perfect, nor entirely flawed, I think the mood it sets for the viewer is terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Bought it, but I Don't Buy it","review":"The best thing about it is the theme song... It was very very good to start with but the suprise ending that is supposed to tie everything up falls a little short of the mark. It's... unfeasible, for lack of a better word. I just don't buy it. Maybe if it was explained better.Also, the main characters (especially the heroine) were so cold and souless I found I simply couldn't relate to any of them. I'm not saying that it's bad animation, far from it, they did it on purpose as a kind of extremely unpleasant atmosphere. But if you don't relate to the main character, how do you get drawn into the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best series I have ever seen","review":"\\"Lain\\" is one of those anime series that surpasses your expectations, leaves you speechless, confused and completely engrossed in the storyline. Lain is a teenager who gets an e-mail from a classmate that committed suicide. She tells her that she is alive, that she left the flesh and lives at The Wired. This starts Lain's quest to find out the truth about The Wired, an enormous computer network, like the Internet, but it is actually a reality apart from the physical world.Lain starts to find out the truth about The Wired and sees her life change in the process. This is an amazing series that deals with philosophy, identity, culture, reality, computers, and the ever-changing culture and way of life of people due to technology. It is truly one of the deepest and most amazing series I have ever seen. This is one to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Real....Lain?","review":"Yeah, this is one complex series. This is one show where repeated viewings are encouraged. Lots going on in every episode and, though the show gets off to a slow start, things and people change before your eyes.There IS a guide to this show (of sorts) produced by the RPG company Guardians of Order and it's a good read. Back to the DVDs-The menues are well laid out and easy to navigate. The art in this show is wonderful and understated. Good voice acting by the american cast, too. This show, along with Cowboy Bebop, Witch Hunter Robin and Samurai Champloo are a MUST for any fan of anime!It's the story of Lain, a young school girl. Her relationships with her \\"Parents\\", sister, friends and the \\"wired\\" (what they call the internet). The series starts with Lain and her friends getting email from a dead friend and gets weirder from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Series","review":"Very befuddling as all the others will note in previous reviews.I found it intriguing and wanting to put in each DVD one after another and watch all in one sitting.For those saying the price is too high, and to buy the cheap two disc set: You do realize those are good looking bootlegs right? If you want the real thing, pay for the real thing. Everyone has to make money, and it's not cheap to import. You have to do the whole move/show all over again with voice actors and packaging.I only bring it up, because if everyone went for the illegal copies, we'd see a lot less of the good authentic stuff coming over, and as it is there is only a small fraction of what has been made coming over to the US. I have to frequently import my favorite shows from a Japanese retailer because I know there is no way it's going to look financially viable to a US company to distribute it here.Please support the Anime you love!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, but you have to watch the whole thing","review":"After watching Layers 1-4, I knew that Lain was something amazing. I didn't, however, have any clue what it was about or what was going on! After watching the remaining Layers, it made sense (to an extent) and was really cool. But, you have to trust that it's amazing and watch the entire thing. Don't be turned off by the slow pace of the first disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lain for Mange addicts","review":"Lain is very deep even for manga. Unfortunately it's so deep you can fall asleep watching it. If you are expecting a bit of action don't bother. On the good side you can watch it a several times and pick up new things each time, the down side is you probably missed those parts when you fell asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow, this is also so cute","review":"i love lain in her little bear outfit. made me wish i had one of my own. my advise is if you want a movie that has everything from suicide to little girls running around in catholic uniforms this is the anime to buy. the take you into the world of neglectful parents and how our world is being run by computers. modern tecnology will be the fall of our world and Lain shows it. the wire is a little confusing if you dont devote your full attention to it. but over all lain is a kick ass movie that will make you buy the who set because if you dont, you dont seem to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this ...........! -Jult Warfell","review":"Between this and Texhnolize I lost over 600 + minutes of my life having to watch this crap. waste of a dub talented actors.

It blends wonderful imagery with haunting music to set a chilling mood. It's a stoic look at society, cyberspace, and what we deem to be reality. There is a great deal of religious symbolism, as well as bizarre imagery and themes. The animation style is very clean and crisp, and the series is very serious. There are no \\"facefaults\\" \\"Sweatdrops\\" or \\"Superdeformed\\" animation typical of many animes. It's serious anime in the same manner as Akira and Perfect Blue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good anime, interesting plot","review":"I enjoyed watching this anime, it was much better than I expected, considering many people who review anime don't all have the same tastes. I'm not sure why the anime fans out there are so focused on such terrible stuff, such as dragonball z. This is for the fan who wants more than dragonball and could use a touch of drama with a dash of euphoria. Good story line, decent characters (even though they were kids), and OK art work."},{"rating":"1","title":"All interpretation, little actual meaning","review":"Serial Experiments Lain is a Y2K fever-fueled plotless wreck. The benefits are that everyone can look at what's happening however they want- this also means that most likely any messages or plot you manage to descern when it's creators seemed to see fit to flirt breifly with lucidity are your imagination more then anything that was actually planned. If you recently won the lottery and no damage will be done wasting money and time, go for it. Otherwise your life will certainly be complete without Serial Experiments Lain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very well made, and yet...","review":"I have a lot of friends who totally love Lain, and I guess I can understand why; it's certainly an expertly crafted and well-directed series. However, there is one thing this series is lacking, and that is character. Nobody in Lain really has much of a personality. Things happen to them, but we very rarely have any idea how they FEEL about it, and frankly that makes for a rather unengaging series. Also, I find myself personally being irritated by shows that don't make sense until people explain them to you. I mean, seriously, what's the point of watching it if you don't even know what the heck is going on, or really care?Lain does, however, get bonus points for suggesting that Hayami Sho is God. Woohoo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"::CONFUSED::","review":"I can honestly say this series is deep... I like computers alot... (i'm on one now arent i?)... I got this after looking at a list of series... i can honestly say this is a very deep series... This will confuse you if you dont put any thought into it... dont take it for face value... and watch at least to episode 6 before you decide if you like it or not....Youll have to watch it several times to get it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ride...","review":"I just got the boxed set and I'm only up through the first disc and I already know that this is an amazing series. Visually as well as audibly Lain is a masterpiece. The atmosphere that the director is able to establish here remindes us that there are many things that anime excels at that cannot be reproduced by film. If you liked any of Stanley Kubrick's movies then this is definetly the series for you. Even newbies to anime will find much to like about Serial Experiments Lain. Also a nice break for the older anime fans in between episodes of Eva :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird. An acquired taste for sure.","review":"Seems like Lain is on every kind of top anime list somewhere so I knew I had to watch it eventually.The artistic direction and overall quality of this series is undeniable, and it definitely kept my attention the entire time because I just wanted to know what the heck was going on! So I definitely was not bored by it, however I cannot say that I personally found it to be very entertaining. While it was thought-provoking, I found myself confused a lot and very uncomfortable the entire time. Really it creeped me out and I consider Lain to be more horror than anything.I didn't find myself liking any of the characters of this show and overall I must say that I will probably never re-watch Lain, although it would probably make more sense if I did. I appreciate the efforts of its creators, and understand the love for it from fans, but its just not my cup of tea. Now to re-watch some Trigun to wash the weirdness off of me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Quality & Speed - Poor compatibility & Support","review":"This printer has superb quality and awesome printing speeds.

This is more instrumental, more pop, and less synthesizer, but the voice synthesized lyrics sound rip-offishly similar to Air. Try not to listen to the lyrics too hard; like Tahiti 80, they lose something in the translation--I think it's cute, someone else might find it annoying. It's more pop than jazz, although I could see a record store accidentally labling it as acid lounge; I think it best falls into a genre of late 90's early 2000's, French electro-pop. Has a sound reminiscent of the Beatles \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" meets the 3rd Mellenium. If you are considering buying this as a first time introduction to latest French sound, go with Air, if you're a collector, this is a pretty good addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear...","review":"don t think you ll like my review.the book was a bit small, limited illustrations(think there was a few), no mention of if all these rare old titles still exist or not.Very little to hold your attention..even to a details lover like myself(and it was a fairly costly book too)...and the unforgivable thing was the book only goes upto L or M in the alphabet !No mention of that in the review..and the illustration of it in the review had the words \\"volume 1\\" conspiculously erased, so you thought you were getting all of Universal s silents, but you only got half of them!Is this not misrepresentation?A big disappointment, in any case.Mark"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very, very special musical moment for me.","review":"Beautiful, flawless performance by Kenneth Gilbert of a hitherto unknown work, one that deserves far more promimence in the body of Baroque keyboard music that is performed, recorded, and heard today. While there have been numerous recordings of the opera ballet itself, hearing the harpsichord transcriptions is a rare treasure trove.Played on the beautifully refined sound of a period instrument.This set of transcriptions, the harpsichord used in this performance, and Kenneth Gilbert's rendition, are a match made in heaven.I first heard this recording on January 31, 1980 when it was presented on Music Through the Night.

He spends over 200 pages whinning about his lot in life, intertwined with his trip to the head waters of the river, then in only 12 pages he recounts a later trip to Tibet to study native horses.

It is not the best movie I have ever seen, but it is a very good flick, and I have to wonder why it was not highly promoted.Other people that made the movie more interesting: Janeane Garofalo, Dwight Yoakam, and Sheryl Crow. The singers didn't sing, and the comedienne didn't crack jokes. And yet they didn't need to, because the acting was great all around.The only part of this movie that I wouldn't have understood had it not been written on the back of the box was the two imaginary cops who showed up all the time. But unlike Mulholland Drive, this movie was not confusing on the whole. On the contrary, it gave me something to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING GOOD...","review":"...this is a disappointing movie. I found myself truly mesmerized by the first half of the movie, trying to figure out what Owen Wilson's character was motivated by; who were these two detectives (Dennis Haysbert, Dwight Yoakum) and why were they haunting him? What really was going on with the landlord's missing daughter? Why did Brian Cox off Mercedes Ruehl? What was the glib ending supposed to mean? Owen Wilson and Janeane Garafolo do fine jobs in their roles; Brian Cox as always is astounding. But why was Vann doing this?

I found the pacing of every scene to be annoying, the non-sequiters overdone, and what the heck is going on with Owen Wilsons'nose anyway?

A ride through the mind of a reserved, calmatic killer. He doesn't kill with rage or aggression but by stealth and tranquility.

The other artists present duets by Brahms and Schumann, recorded in 1974.These are lovely voices, and the accompaniments are perfectly audible. Most of the items are distinctly under-represented in the current CD market. In lieu of program notes and biographical material, the enclosed booklet provides full German/English texts.

The book is 126pp. It's a small sized book with pictures on all of the pages (the pictures are usually of the particular bench presser at some event...they are not instructive pictures describing technique). In other words there is not a lot of meat.Some of the stories are inspirationaly (which is why I gave this two stars instead of one) but at $20, you'd do better investing that money in supplements or towards your gym fee.

The only down fall of this product was that it is only half full. I am not exactly sure if the product worked. We got a flea problem after getting a new dog so we bombed some rooms and gave them all baths. This didn't seem to work completely so we got some spray and powder. It looks as though it took effect, but we still get the occassional flea.

While there is no sex, and very little nudity, the series is very raunchy. Plus, the main Golden Girl in this episode has the biggest nipples I have ever seen. Now the show is sexually funny but is in no means erotic. All sex is played strictly for laughs. There is also alot of other gross stuff (you have to see the toilet scene), but the series is generally pretty sweet. Kentaro is a nice guy who is just trying to learn about life. Half them time when he messes up he thinks he is trying to do the right thing. I think anyone who likes shows like Sakura Diaries (which is a bit more seriouse) would love this movie. I know I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Although my kids have great fun with the toy, when it works, I have been disappointed by it since its arrival.

He has a unique sound/tone to his playing and he rarely uses 4/4 time which makes his sound even more distinct. The beauty of his music, though, is his use of humor throughout his music. I can't think of many more albums I enjoy listening to more than this one. I particualry enjoy \\"Confessions of a Deprived Youth\\" but those are my '80s roots talking. the guest guitarists are phenomenol and really add to the music.

You know your scales, but your music is uninspired, highly juvenile and without soul. I should not be so harsh; some parts are somewhat funny. But I think the most hilarious thing of all is that you are convinced you are way better than the guitar players you mock in the last song of the album, Return of the Son Of IHadRatherStickMyD!@#kInACarDoor.Alright alright, I have a confession of my own to make: I bought this CD thinking the Dweeze woulda grown up a little since that Album I'd bought in the early nineties, and because Frank is one of my favorite musicians. I so confess, I am an old guy with a different set of values, one in which shredding does not equal musical talent.So let's do this: Dude call me, let's hook up and jam.

Carl Zimmer's companion volume to the PBS miniseries \\"Evolution\\" does an admirable job elaborating on some of the points briefly mentioned or not covered in the PBS program.

His completion of thru-hike was admirable, but I felt like I suffered and stumbled through every word of his just as he suffered and stumbled along the AT. I stopped reading the book several times, but like a true positive-thinking and hopeful future thru-hiker, I felt it my duty to see the book through to its end.

From the first listen to the most recent this recording (and Wagner's music) has steadily grown on me. I might be in agreement with some of the other reviewers on some of the issue's they took, such as the voice being light. Yet that agreement relates only to the fact and not the effect which is one I believe to be of extraordinary beauty. \\"Leb wohl, du kuhnes, herrliches Kind!\\" has become a genuine favorite of mine and I'll leave it to more knowledgable reviewers to point me to what they believe to be the quintessential recordings of this work.

Taking the occasional chance to read more widely in Wodehouse, however, I came across French Leave, which is delightful in every sense and repays even more than better known Wodehouse fare in becoming more tangled, involving more cultures and sensibilities, and painting a very special picture of young love.

It consists of numerous one page entries on individual species. It includes nearly all of the reptiles (including snakes) and amphibians that you would encounter in the pet trade. Although I wish it had more information on whether or not a certain animal was easy to handle or good for beginners/experts, etc, it's a good \\"shotgun\\" herp book to have since it details lots of different species not just a select few.

The care information is poor in many cases when I compared it to several other expert sources. Basic care info is missing like temperature and humidity requirements. My main reason to get this book was for the photos and species identification and in some cases that was incorrect.

The movie not only focussed on intimate relationships between lovers but the strong bond between friends. I laughed and cried, was shocked and amazed, and thoroughly immersed throughout the entire movie. I saw the movie a few more times on cable, then have rented it a few times to show other friends who have never heard of it.

I remember well listening to it as mom would load up the record changer with Christmas LPs.That said, this version of Messiah has a lot to recommend it.

This album has some terrific instrumentals that really defy categorization. Jazz influenced for sure, but certainly it is not jazz. There is a lot of humour in it at times, and some unusual sounds. Made by what, I dunno. My favourite track is the 18 minute plus \\"The Little House I used to live in\\" which features 2 fine piano solos, a violin solo and an organ solo. The organ being played by Zappa. Also included are 2 vocals, the doo-wop \\"WPLJ\\" and \\"Valarie\\".

But I enjoyed it very much and found much useful and interesting information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting to the heart of wining is more like it!","review":"I bought Mr. Blume's first book, \\"6 Steps To Successful Songwriting\\" and absolutely loved it!! So when I saw this book in the bookstore one day, I didn't hesitate to pick it up. I don't know what Mr. Blume's intentions were when he wrote this book, but it came across to me as nothing more than a b***h session on the problems he encountered before becoming a successful songwriter. Unlike his first book, this one had very few (if any) examples and advice on songwriting. If you're looking for a book that's basically a diary of a songwriter, then this is a great book. If you're looking for a book on how to write songs or hoping for a great follow-up to his first book, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to do with \\"The Heart of Creativity\\"","review":"This book is a bunch of brief essays regarding how to sell your songs, organize your songwriting ideas, pick collaborators. It has virtually nothing to do with writing good songs itself.

It is more an autobiographical account of the author's personal songwriting experiences...\\"getting to the heart of MY creativity\\" would have been a more accurate subtitle. This author clearly loves to talk about himself, and presumptuously considers his personal retellings a path \\"to the heart of creativity.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the Mark","review":"I bought this book in the hopes that the author would have suggestions for creative blocks, specific to writing songs. I have read and used Writing Down the Bones and The Artists' Way as a means to combat writing blocks. Blume's book was really misleading and it is not like Writing Down the Bones. It misses the mark when it comes to being a creative guide for writing songs.There are some useful tips about organizing songs and work material. A few good exercises on setting goals, but I did not find his writing exercises very original or inspiring.If anything, the book only confirmed that I was going in the right direction, but I was hoping for a more creative guide. I suggest The Artists' Way, over this book, for anyone who is trying to unblock their creativity when it comes to writing new lyrics and searching for new ideas.Also, he defends writing songs for Brittney Spears and The Backstreet Boys.....not in good taste, nor do I think those songs are the height of creative genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless","review":"This book is a shameless plug for his other book,which he mentions and footnotes to every other page, as well as his workshops, and CDs. It is not a book about how to write songs, it is a book about a person you've never heard of who writes songs, many of which you've never heard. Truly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title Should have been Memoirs of an aspiring writer","review":"While this book is certainly entertaining, a how-to book it isn't. I purchased this 166 page pep talk in the belief thatit would provide insights into the craft of songwriting.

No... I hate it now.","review":"Yes I actually replaced the original one TWO times. The original was purchased several years ago. In short order the button to retract the cord broke so it was fussy to make work but I used it for ages. I replaced that one eventually and the second one broke just the same way. Mind you both hair dryers continued to work but it was irritating that that darn button broke AGAIN when the retractable cord was the reason for purchasing this model. Anyway bought a THIRD one and guess what? No...actually this time, although the button isn't broken yet, the cord will NOT RETRACT all the way so I give up with Conair. I am purchasing a different brand today and hope their mechanism for retracting the cord is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UPSETTING","review":"I ordered this particular hair dryer for many reasons, one of which was the color. Clearly from the picture, the item offered was PURPLE. I specifically ordered from this company because I thought they had the old stock color of purple, not the light blue that is the current color. Not only did the hair dryer come light blue (not pictured), but I had to pay to return it....$12.65! That was 2/3 the cost of the hair dryer. If the company who sends it doesn't have the correct info for ordering, I think I should be reimbursed for the shipping charges. We'll see what they do! I will update my review if they do the right thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hair dryer","review":"I've had this hair dryer for about 5 years. It just started to heat up on me after so many years. I've been very happy with it. It's light weight, dries hair pretty fast, folds, practical when traveling, cord goes in when pressing a button, has low and high only but I normally just use the high and cool button, and yes it makes a lot of noise but it does what it is supposed to do. Pretty good for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, this and the other poor reviews are accurate.","review":"It seems that there are some very good and some very bad reviews of this product, so it might be a crap shoot. Unfortunately I got one of the crappy ones.I bought this because of the retractable cord.The retracting feature worked the first two times I used it, and then just quit working.I did not pull the cord out past its intended limit, or pull it too hard, or twist it, or abuse it in any other way. But the button that retracts the cord just stopped working at all, and the cord could not be manually \\"stuffed\\" into the handle either.As another reviewer noted, this is a rather loud hair dryer. Technically, the problem may not actually be sound level, but pitch. This hair dryer is very high pitched - which was very annoying and made me worry about damage to my hearing.I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Win Them All","review":"Of the five items I received from ..., this is the only one that did not live up to expectations. I don't think one should have to have an engineering degree to use a hair dryer. I was unable to get it to work, and even if I could have, it was much to heavy. To sum up, it was quite unsatisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud","review":"I was very disappointed with this hair dryer.

After mine broke (2 months later), I used my daughter's and it worked for maybe another 3 months. The cord didn't always retract and the motor burned out completely. The concept of the dryer is great, but the performance is poor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mine broke!","review":"I bought this blowdryer a few months ago and all of a sudden it just doesn't turn on anymore... this is after the cord retraction feature already broke earlier.

This all too brief set is classic and a true representation of what Mott The Hoople was all about.Starting with the piano pounding, \\"The Golden Age Of Rock 'N Roll\\", with the theatrical introduction, the band never lets up. \\"Marionette\\" is a campy classic with ludicrous lyrics that beg several listens. The string arrangements are perfect for this song. \\"Trudi's Song\\" is a rare endearing ballad that works, but Mott would only rarely release one such as this. \\"Roll Away The Stone\\" is the ultimate Mott with a killer chorus, back-up and clever arrangement in all it's simplicity.The extra three songs really don't add much, but it's a nice addition.

The practice tests, arguably one of the most important parts of the book, are terrible. The multiple choice questions are much more difficult than anything I saw on the AP test, and the essays were unreasonably specific and furthermore did not even follow the format used by AP.

And yes, as black woman we tend to get a little bit desperate and settle for less. But sometimes we have no choice when their are no more good men out there.(And sometimes even the married ones aren't good) Ms. Clarke tells the story in her point of view. And from one sister to the next, I commend you on your goals and accomplishments. Not to many sisters congratulate one another for that.

As she enters into relationships with these men she explains why she is so attracted to them and what her feelings are towards them. If this book were a self-help book Monica's mistakes might tell women what not to do while dating, unfortunately this book is supposed to be a novel.

Although I WOULD say the songs are actually very talent filled and well written, I prefer the old UL with songs such as Coffin Text, and Please tell me Why. This is more not Unwritten Lawish type music. If you are an actual Fan of UL and have known them for awhile, then you might be disappointed. If you just now heard of Unwritten Law b/c of Seein Red, then I guess you'll like it. I cannot appreciate this cd NEARLY as much as Oz Factor, Blue Room, and the Self Titled.

And the Raleigh songs are just plain bad. There are few bright spots, but other then that, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny","review":"These guys were just on Leno, it was very obvious the singer wasn't into it.

Their uplifting songs leave any listener in a great mood. Although their sound has been altered dramatically since \\"Blue Room\\" they still know how to please their loyal fans (unlike their sell-out counterpart \\"Blink 182\\").

Another strong cut from the album is the hit single \\"Seein' Red\\" which is an exceptional song. The rest of the album is filled with some ska, punk, a little metal, and some ballads.

Not even one good song on the entire CD. Lyrics are [awful]. The seeing red song is about a 3/10 compared to any older UL material. But I guess these days teenybopper pop-rock is popular amongst the younger generation. Definitely no longer a punk band. Go buy the self-titled if you wanna know what UL is all about.

For example can you imagine listening to someone else sing Wilson Pickett song 'I'm gonna wait until the midnight hour' when W.Pickett is on the dvd why didn't he sing the song himself because it did not sound very good listening to the guy who wrote it.

Easily this C.D., should give Slim acclaim whether its a an Eminem or 50 cent crowd, or in the hood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tha Boss of tha south Slim Thugga!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the best dirty south album this year (much better than Mike Jones who?

He's just another tatooed low life who talk like he dropped out of grade school. Bling Bling hip hop is the same as pop metal was in the 1980's and disco music was in the late 70's. it's contrived, formulaic, and shallow music that's overdone without substance.

Although Slim does have some good flows every now and then the majority of the time they're very mediocre and boring, I do think he's alot better than Flip tho b/c Flip completely sold out which is a going trend now when rappers come from the underground then get a deal and go soft cause of course they dont wanna keep talkin all that hard stuff when they reach a bigger audience and somebody decides to test them on it. Anybody who likes this CD is just from Texas or haven't heard the real kings of the rap game, but this is one of those cd's that I could listen to every few weeks or so not an everyday banger, expected alot more from this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a 3 and a half.","review":"My friend burned me this cd the other day.

This album is back to back garbage, and the only reason anyone bought it was because it was produced by the highly(and I mean HIGHLY) overrated Neptunes, who have no idea how to make a beat that doesn't sound like bubble-gum rap. Oh, who am I kidding? They invented bubble-gum rap.Instead of picking up this album, try and find some of DJ Screw's tapes and/or posthumous compilations. Any one of his 100+ tapes is better than this album, and if you're 'lucky,' you may even hear Slim Thug on one of the songs.

The songs (classic folk songs, one of the reasons this CD seemed like a perfect choice) are performed in such a way as to render them impossible to sing along with. For example, Seeger often simply recites the lyrics over the faint sounds of the audience singing them. The song \\"Weemoweh\\" contains none of the lyrics, just the chorus over and over and over, which is incredibly irritating. To top it all off, the CD contains a \\"sequel\\" to the classic \\"Froggie Went A-courtin'\\" that is completely inappropriate for children. In this song, the wedding ends in a bloody massacre in which all the animals are mutilated or killed by a cat. I am not making this up, although I wish I were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous reporting!","review":"One of the best books I have read in a long time. Excellent insight into the inner workings of one of the world's largest companies, and a great overview of how the FBI conducts an investigation. The author has documented every detail!

My congratulations go to the author for a terrific book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Begginning - Gets Better!","review":"The author has shown again that not only is he an excellent investigative reporter but a masterful writer as well.

I will read anything he puts pen to paper on."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star","review":"I rarely buy a book, preferring libraries or loaners from friends. I enjoyed the This American Life segment about this story and wanted to read a book on a 24-hour flight. So I bought the book and I've been trying to finish it for over 12 months (very unusual for me and I read all kinds of books). This book is very detailed, which some people might like, but it's way too detailed and the tone is very dry and makes the whole story uninteresting. I don't get a sense of excitement, interest or enthusiasm from the author. Often I get so excited/interested/invested in a book, that I struggle to balance comprehending and the pace of my eyes floating over the text. This hasn't happened for me with this book. I'm disappointed that I bought it and didn't just borrow it from the library, I always finish books, but... this one is a tough read. But.. since I bought it, I'll keep trying to make myself finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted truth","review":"An amazing story -- hard to put down. I have probably talked about this book to a dozen people in the last two days (since I finished it). Mark Whitacre is so disordered that I was left just shaking my head. The goverment infighting (FBI vs DOJ) is reminiscent of the fights between the DEA, FBI, CIA and DOJ in the \\"war on drugs\\". It is a mystery to me, given all the egos and stupidity in law enforcment, that criminals ever get convicted. . I agree that it would be nice to have an index because of the multitude of names and subplots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing...Absolutely Astonishing","review":"This is one of the most exciting, unbelievable and astonishing books I have ever read. Normally, I stick mostly with fiction thrillers, but a friend of mine recommended The Informant as a better Grisham thriller than the last few Grisham thrillers. And he was right. From the first page, I was totally hooked, and stunned to think that this was a true story. The best thing about The Informant is the way Eichenwald melds the true lies of the main character with the true truth of reality. Time and again, I thought I knew the truth, only to find once again that I had been fooled in this delightful hall of mirrors. After so many years of dry, predictable thrillers -- both in the bookstore and on the movie screen -- it was so refreshing to read a story that is so unpredictable and so delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Really IS Stranger than Fiction","review":"Wow. If this book were a novel, I think it might be dismissed as implausible. Yet sadly, the account of the meteoric rise and staggering demise of an executive at one of America's largest companies is all too true. The twists and turns are incredible! Very, very well written and painstakingly researched.If you are looking for a book for a hard to please fan of whodunits or suspense fiction, this will serve you well.

At the end of they day, the best thing about this story is it's true. It's hard to believe business leaders like the ones described in this book could be so flagrantly corrupt. The central figure of the story Mark Whitacre, is both comic and tragic, and ultimately sympathetic.All-in-all, a highly enjoyable and successful true suspense story.I listened to the Informant unabridged on audio CD, narrated by Arthur Morey. Morey does an excellent job keeping a suspenseful pace and bringing out the complexity of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"This book should have been cut in half, if only to save the reader from the tedious conversations that are \\"recalled\\" by the participants. But that wouldn't have even saved this book, in my opinion. Why all the hype and good sales for this atrocity? Most puzzling. This book had lots of praise and hype: \\"One of the best nonfiction books of the last decade\\" according to a New York Times review. Fair enough; sounds like this would be a good pick, right? I made it through nearly two-hundred pages (and that wasn't even half the book) before giving up. Too much boring, reconstructed dialogue and a less-than-riveting story (price fixing; oh how diabolical!) only make me crave good fiction.

I really like this dryer because it's much faster than blowing my hair dry, then using a curling iron. I use a little bit of gel first and it gives my hair so much body and fullness. My hair is above my shoulders, so it just gives my hair a very soft, loose curl. Don't expect a 'curly do'.Don't know what I did without it !

When I use this curling brush on my hair it makes my hair smooth, soft and light. It is the only curling iron I have ever used that made my hair feel like that. After using it my hair is straight with body. It does a great job. The only one downside I can think of is that if your hair is extreamly thick it may take a little time to \\"dry\\" it totally. Over all I highly recommend this product to anyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for thick and wavy hair!","review":"I've used this product for the past 8-10 years. I've been through 3 of them and now purchasing my 4th as backup. I have very thick and wavy hair. This is a necessity... along with initially using a blow dryer to remove most of the dampness. I only use the brush attachment and it truly smooths out my hair. When I try to use a curling iron, my hair gets too curly. This gives me a straight look in only minutes time. And, it easy to use. Substitute this product... instead of using a round brush with your blow dryer.Note: I've tried using this on my friend who has straight hair, thin hair and it doesn't work very well. Clearly this product is the answer to thick/wavy/curly hair.

I was very excited about the other reviews which said they could not do without this combo dryer/styler. I couldn't wait to try it. First of all, I found it very hard to handle due to the thickness of the handle. I have short, thick hair, and it was just too large to grasp the hair in the brush. Then there was the power....or lack thereof. I have an older model that generates 1000 watts. This newer version was about 300 watts. There was almost no blowing/drying power. It would have taken twenty minutes to dry my hair with this product. I tried twice to dry and style with it, realized it was never going to work, and returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This is a really neat idea but within two weeks it just quit working!

As with most electronics, it eventually died. I searched beauty supply and department stores for a similar product, but found none. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.com! Nothing works as well as the Conair Combo at taming my thick, wavy hair. (I use the attachment with \\"teeth\\" rather than the one with the bristles, since the teeth stand up to my hair). Unfortunately, the on/off switch broke the second time I used it. I read through some of the reviews and found that others have had a similar complaint. I hope that Conair fixes this problem, as the curler is great otherwise. I will purchase another one and hope to have better luck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sux -","review":"I bought this curling iron combo for a Christmas gift for my mother in December 2010. It stopped working after the 3rd time she used it. I'm waiting to see my mother again to return the item. I will not buy another again, I will look for a different brand. I have to say I am surprised it stopped working, I've never had a hair dryer or curling iron stop working after a few uses. I will send it back and see what they do for me.

Stay tuned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not heat up like older/similar Conair models","review":"I purchased this curling brush to replace an almost identical model (only difference I could see was color) that I used and loved for a few years. Unfortunately, this model does not heat up enough to create the curl and body my old Conair hot brush did so well. I have normal, straight, medium-thick hair which \\"takes\\" curl easily. This is a disappointing product since I have always used Conair curling brushes and irons in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Air Curling Iron","review":"This Conair product is not worth the money. I previously owned a Conair Hot Air Curling Iron that worked great, this is a completely different design and it fails miserably. It barely curls your hair because the bristles are all hard plastic & the hair has nothing to grab on to. The previous model had rows of the flexible bristles & rows of the hard plastic bristles. It also doesn't get very hot, so if you are going to use it to dry your hair, you should look for a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"even I can do it!","review":"I have never styled my hair mostly due to my lack of ability.

I have used the Helen of Troy version of this for several years and based on reviews decided to try this one. I like the Conair a little better because it doesn't overheat as easily; I can turn if off and on a lot when I'm styling.I have a lot of medium length fine wavy hair that needs to be straightened and I use this air brush and a 4\\" round brush to keep my hair from laying flat on my scalp. I dry from the nape to the top and then use the air brush to flip the ends up or under and the brush makes it easy to control. It looks smooth and bouncy and lasts 2 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"very heavy","review":"I've had this brush for about a week, and wish I had kept looking.

I'll probably have to replace it fairly soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have short, fine hair. I have used a styling brush, with lots of bristle brushes, for years, just not this brand. Decided to give this one a try. This type of brush will not grasp short hair.

The Conair is undoubtedly the worst of the lot. It didn't overheat; it burned out after 3 days. Even had it continued working, I was prepared to tuck it into a bottom drawer as it had so little air power that my hair had to be almost dry before use. I considered sending it back to Conair but you have to send them $7.50 for their return postage. That charge on top of my own postage charges makes their warranty worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"to late to return but it blew up","review":"I had one of these and loved it.

But is was also full of typos and I found to be too full of characters whose profiles were not adequately developed. The author made a good attempt at organizing the book via the opening and closing with the letter to her friend. However, the table of contents suggested more insightful development of the plot or more spiritual development of the main character. Neither was achieved in my opinion. The author may have written an Iyanla Vanzant-style book of self disclosure, but she forgot to show adequate personal growth of the main character. Or perhaps the point is that the main character is still struggling with these issues. A good first try. Next time have a better proof reader and an exeperienced editor to strengthen what potentially could be a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Making Music","review":"It is with great plesure that i listen to this extraordinary CD.

First of all, Glaceau is distilled MUNICIPAL water. Second of all, buying this product for the sole reason that it is distilled water isn't very advantageous to your health or is a waste of money. Distilled water does more harm than good. Drinking distilled water for a long period will remove necessary electrolytes from your body such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and several trace elements that are absolutely necessary for your health. These deficiencies can cause irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure. So what if it contains electrolytes.

I didn't lower them enough.The knives have no heft at all. The blades seem terribly flimsy. Grasping the light plastic handles provides no sense of control. These aren't impossible to use; i simply make a point of using almost anything else.Thinking it over, I probably knew that this deal sounded too good to be true, even with the Wusthf name on the package. Instead of buying three mediocre to poor knives at this price, it would be better to put the money towards a single pretty good paring knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stimulation more for the mind...","review":"More stimulating to the mind, than anywhere else! Despite the 'Flesh and the Word' banner, these stories lack the classic structure of the one-handed novel, and instead ask the reader to consider the elements of sexual obsession. As obsession is such a personal thing, some of the stories hit the spot, while others pass un-noticed. Lowenthal, since succeeding John Preston, has been taking the Flesh and the Word series in directions that increasingly ask readers to think, as well as (or even instead of) to w***; this might prove uncomfortable to some readers, but nevertheless has produced a book well worth reading and thinking over."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent collection","review":"Michael Lowenthal has done a great job of editing this exciting collection of short erotic stories. There is a little bit here for everybody. Some stories are nothing short of scalding hot others brutally honest. A whole choir of fresh gay voices singing into the night.

These Dockers aren't a pair like that, but they're comfortable, with good cushioning, and every day I wear them they feel a little bit better.

When you buy shoes online, you don't always know exactly what you're going to get. When I received them and put them on, I was very pleasantly surprised! I purchased these as my work shoes. I work a cushy office job, where I sometimes have to perform light physical labor. These shoes are comfortable for both! The only thing I can say that would even be partially negative, is that I may have been able to get away with buying a 1/2 size smaller. The shoes are just a little loose for me, and I bought the same size I normally do. That's actually good, though, if I decide to add some shoe cushions, or wear thicker socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfied","review":"I am satisfied with the Docker shoes, they are very comfortable, the only complaint is that the sides of the shoe are lower than I would like them to be, but overall I am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shoes!","review":"I bought the shoes for my husband.

I love the feel and look of the shoes, they are as comfortable as anything I've ever worn in this categoryMy only critiques of the shoe are that like others have said, the sole wears down quickly. When I had a job that required a lot of walking, these shoes barely lasted a year. Now that I'm at a desk job, they last between 2-3 years. That said, it is not stopping me from investing in a new pair as soon as I feel the support go out.Secondly, the metal eyelets at the top of the laces wear down the shoelace over time. The laces that come with the shoe don't last too long, 5-6 months top, but the cheap pair of 27\\" kiwi laces last a year or more. Of course, it may just be me pulling them too tight, but it has been an issue for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoe, but soles wear out too quickly!","review":"I am currently wearing my second pair of these shoes. They are super comfortable and the uppers super tough. However, the soles wear out much too quickly. I walk a lot and find the soles are \\"shot\\" in about six months. I took the first pair to a shoe shop for re-soling but they wanted 55 dollars so it was cheaper to get a new pair of shoes. Also, the laces do not last but that is easily fixed. I think the shoes look great, a bit shiny at first but after a while the shine goes away and they look fantastic. Good shoes with khaki pants for office work and good shoes to wear with shorts for walking. They are indeed the most comfortable and lightest shoes I have ever worn! Sorry about the soles, though. If the soles were better I would give these shoes a rating of five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Wear Out Quickly!","review":"I think the shoes look great. They were exactly what I was looking for. They aren't comfortable, but they're not exactly uncomfortable either. My major problem with them is that they wore out rather quickly. I've owned these shoes for 6 months now and I wear them about 3 times a week. The tread on the shoes is nearly gone. They are quite dangerous when walking on wet surfaces. I would not recommend these shoes unless you plan on replacing them in 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately comfortable, Terribly fast wearing","review":"The comfort level of these shoes is neither great nor poor, just average. What does stick out however is shoe life. These shoes lasted less than six months, where I usually get 12-18 months out of a pair of timberlands or Doc Martens. The insole wore through in about two months and and the tread was worn completely flat at the end of six months. The laces continually shifted to one side. Overall, not impressed at all.

I love the Shrek movies (Shrek 3 being an exception) and I was going by previous reviews to decide whether I should shell out the bucks to buy this movie. Many reviewers said it was overpriced. It is. I thought the 30 minutes would be valuable, but they weren't; it was definitely rushed. Fiona's response to Shrek's anger over having their first Christmas crashed by their rowdy, obnoxious friends was more annoying than usual because it was overly dramatic and makes her character look weak, in my opinion.

We recently built an online Arizona hunting workbook that teaches new hunters how to hunt. In compiling this workbook, we researched a lot of hunting books. Most of them give a lot of personal hunting tales on the way an individual hunts. This book way was completely different. It tells you exactly how to pin point where animals will be eating, drinking and sleeping. If you want to learn how to hunt animals and predict where to find them in the woods, this is by far the BEST HUNTING BOOK you will every buy. And while it is written about deer hunting, the same exact principles work great for hunting elk in our home state, Arizona.

This is still a very good book that a beginner and some experienced hunters can learn from. the books is one of the best books that I have read that explains what kind of terrain to look for, and where to set up your deer hunting stands.

It was so abridged there wasn't much of a storyline, let alone a plot. If the editors had put more emphasis into keeping a storyline rather than trying to condense the book into one cassette, the story might have made more sense instead of a choppy rendition of missing parts-what were the editors thinking of, trying to save trees? I felt like I was in a black hole trying to make sense of nonsense or at a three act play in which only one act was performed. But given the editing quality of the audiobook, I suspect the book in its entirely isn't much better. I've purchased books by Rosemary Rogers, some of her earlier works I have really enjoyed which were well developed in plot and style. I haven't purchased any of her newer books finding them disappointing. The Tea Planter's Bride is a definite \\"No Sale\\" and should be refundable to anyone who purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort","review":"I love to read Rosemary Rogers stories, especially the Steve and Ginny books, but Celia and Grant were no Steve and Ginny. They didn't even get to have sex till the very end of the book. Celia annoyed me through most of the book. She was always so angry, usually at Grant. Especially if there was another female in the room batting her eyelashes at him. The story got more interesting once they were in Ceylon, but instead of Grant and Celia working as a team, Celia was still at odds with him and it took away from the story. By that point they should have been together and they weren't.I'm glad I bought the book used.

If you are interested in area lighting instead of spot lighting-such as underneath a sink or in a crawl space, you cannot have a better light source.

How about putting snow chains on your tires in the dark? Just set this light in the snow by the car and go to work. On a camping trip? I dare say this wonderful light will be constantly by your side.

The flashlight is good but not up to the same standards as the rest of the excellent LXT line up. The fluorescent part works great - bright and runs for a long time on a battery charge. I am very happy with the performance of the fluorescent portion. The flashlight is virtually useless. It's about as bright as an old 6 volt lantern. You should consider this part of it non-existent. I also had problems with my first one - it would on it's own start randomly looping through the lights - fluorescent on, fluorescent off, flashlight on, flashlight off. I had to pay to send it back to Makita but they fixed it under warranty. I have had no issues with it since."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have the other Makita lxt tools and bought this light since so many batteries are nearby and available. This light belongs at 'Dollar General'. Clumsy design. Switch button difficult to operate, cycles thru on/on/off and is easily left on when you come in from the dark. The flourescent mode burns the same hours as the BML185 zenon but is not nearly as bright. It's a 'flood' as opposed to the 'spot' of the 185 and a cooler light temperature. Flimsy construction. A strap bracket is molded at the top of the grip and chafes the soft part of your hand at the base of the thumb. I wear XL gloves so perhaps my hands are too large, I dunno. The lxt tools are great, I have 3 drills, etc. But this flourscent light should sell somewhere for about $4.99 ..... without the Makita name."},{"rating":"1","title":"cordless fluorescent/incandescent flashlight","review":"I purchased this flashlight two years ago, and it has served me well, but recently the fluorescent bulb burned out, making the light useless to me. I went to Home Depot to replace the bulb, and after three different trips and three different bulbs I finally called Makita. As it turns out, Makita used a specific bulb you can only purchase through them at a hugely inflated price, plus shipping, plus the time spent waiting for the part, and plus the aggravation I went through to discover the fact in the first place.While I like that the light is rechargeable and fits in nicely with the rest of the Makita tools that I own, I am disappointed in the customer service that I received, and I am very disappointed that Makita chose to use a proprietary technology on a wear item and that that item is hugely overpriced and hard to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light","review":"Purchased this light after having experience with Dewalt's flourescent. Switched to Makita's 18V LiIon tools due to LED and lighter weight.

The illustrations are charming and feature visual puns for parents (note, for example, the \\"duck soup\\") while kids are sure to love the sweetly humourous animals. The story is told in simple rhyme, with plenty of exclamations and animal absurdity to make your toddler giggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diappointing","review":"I've had many earphones, from headsets to ear buds, and I must be honest: these are probably the most disappointing I've ever purchased.

I cannot claim to have mastered the art of photography but I am certainly thinking now before I go about taking a picture.

This album isn't authentic roots reggae like Ras Michael, Toots, or even the Wailing Souls,it is still pretty stoney.My only criticism is that a couple of songs are a bit sweet and syruppy. What does that mean to you? I have no idea, but after digging this, I definitely want to try their earlier stuff. I would give it 4 stars, but I don't think the the other 2 reviewers thought about it enough before rating it. I let the music stand on its own without comparing it to something it's not trying to be.

While I knew that this story was about sword and sorcery I didn't know it was 99% sorcery as even Elric's sword is possessed.

Was there ever any question?","review":"I cannot believe that Gerry Wood wrote the ONLY review on this absolutely wonderful book by Ben Harrison. It must be the most difficult task in the world to write an objective book about necrophelia, but Harrison is the master of the impossible. He creates an unlikely, but very real hero, Count Carl von Cosel, whose passionate love for the beautiful, but doomed, Elena Milagro Hoyos makes her immortal - at least until law enforcement bursts the bubble of imagination that protects both the Count and Elena from the harsh world of reality.I urge readers to read this intriguing book in unison with Edwin Murphy's \\"After the Funeral\\" for an understanding of the importance of the dead to the living.If Ben Harrison or author Gerry Wood [fellow reviewer and fellow author] wants to contact me I amVirginia McCullough vmccullough@hotmail.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the intrigue of all things about Key West","review":"I travel to the Keys at least once a year on my Harley.

It's criminal and insane that a man was so in love with this woman who didn't return the affection that he managed to steal her body and bring her to his home and kept prisoner after her own death for years. Even though she was well preserved, it is a bizarre story that makes you think of Ed Gein, the original psycho.

I love the leasurly way she unwinds her tails, and especially this one, which is, I believe, my favorite Elsie book. The old fashioned way of both telling, and wording, her stories is charming. And the spiritual depths are refreshing. Srtrap up: you are on an emotional roller coaster. Get ready to laugh, gasp, cry, and, most of all, SMILE. I love Elsie, Horace, Rose, and Edward. The \\"A Life Of Faith\\" Elsie books are cheap, light reading. If you want the real story, then read the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"This was the first Elsie book I read as a child about 45 years ago. I had an opportunity to go back to it and also read the first two from Amazon. I cannot imagine why I liked it when young - all my other \\"youth books\\" bore re-reading in adulthood. The sanctimoniousness puts me off most of all. Then the horrifing mentally cruel child-rearing practices exemplified in the first two books could not possibly be a good example to any parent. The other subtle unwarranted elitistic messages also jar - racism, class-ism as well as the clear religious intolerance.

The timing of the book suggests he had read the work of others in the anthroposophical domain but didn't quote them. It seems like he simply rewrote chapters and themes from other authors such as O'Neil's Human Life.

However, the fact is, Bernstein is a master at 19th Century music (and 20th as well), but falls down in Mozart and in Baroque. This CD is no exception.His conducting of The Four Seasons, is what you may expect from Bernstein. He conducts with vigor, bombast, intensity, and other elements (such as a large dynamic range) that one doesn't typically associate with Baroque music. He doesn't have a stately grace or even a slightly cold touch - both of which I feel are vital to correctly perform Baroque.So, if Bernstein's approach is your cup of tea, then you should, by all means, buy this album. You will love it. However, if you are more of a purist or traditionalist, then you should turn your attentions elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely folkloric dancing & costuming with Serena","review":"Nice DVD with several folkloric performances featuring Serena Ramzy, along with Bedouin dancers, musicians and Hossam Ramzy on percussion. Serena also included a section of succinct how-to's for 11 steps, including slow-motion demonstrations with voiceovers detailing the techniques. The how-to section also includes the same steps shown in real time. The DVD is well indexed so that you can easily select individual performances, or go to a specific step in the how-to section and see it in slow-mo or real time. It is helpful that the booklet which comes with the DVD also spells out the steps and gives further info about the background of the dances.

This dog house is pretty to look at, but if you want a heavy, well insulated house for your dog, don't buy this unless shade is all your dog needs it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Winner","review":"Strong acoustic soundtrack with excellent renditions of Al Stewart's known hits and not so known lyrical songs with vibrant acoustic backup and lead performances by one of my favorite Smooth Jazz and nylon string/steel string acoustic guitar, piano and accordian player, Peter White. Nice addition to my collection of Peter White and Al Stewart CD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Favorite","review":"I have over a dozen albums/cassettes/CDs by Al Stewart and this one is by far my favorite. The acoustic approach really brings out the music. Nothing is hidden or drowned out by other instruments. There is some very complex music here. Due to size limitations, everyone's personal favorites cannot be represented; however, nothing on this CD disappoints. While the intros may differ slightly from other recordings, they really enhance some already brilliant music.If this is not in your personal library, you are truely missing out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pour yourself some tea, get the paper and put on this CD","review":"This truly is a great album for a Sunday morning. I bought it after a recent morning I spent with my boyfriend; we made tea, ate breakfast, cuddled and napped, but I wanted some relaxing classical tunes to put on. I stumbled across this, and it certainly fits the bill.I also liked that it had a good mix of familiar songs and ones I hadn't heard before. Selections include \\"Morning\\" and \\"Anitra's Dance\\" by Grieg, \\"Serenade for Strings in E Major\\" by Dvorak, \\"Sunday Morning\\" by Britten, \\"Pavane\\" by Faure, \\"Seventeen Come Sunday\\" by Vaughan Williams, \\"Air on a G String\\" by Bach, \\"Morgenblatter\\" by Strauss, \\"The Dargason\\" by Holst, \\"Prelude a l'Apres-Midi d'un Faune\\" by Debussy, and \\"En Bateau\\" and \\"Sicilienne\\" by Faure.Don't expect any big fireworks -- there's certainly nothing rousing like \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\" or \\"1812 Overture\\" here. Pop this in for a lazy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible epic of the working class","review":"At a time in Irish history when so many novels focus on the politics of Loyalist versus nationalist, this novel deals with a much more interesting aspect - that of the haves versus the have nots. It is a rich social history of regular people and the ties that bind them. It is a beautifully interweaved story of how little events can create an incredible photograph of history and a definition of life's struggles.

Some people will say that it lacks this, that, or the other thing, but I think it's a powerful and enjoyable performance. I've heard the Karajan cycle from DG and thought that it lacked the oomph that this performance gives. Bernstein provides a passionate reading of what is, arguably, Beethoven's greatest work. You can feel the anger, the joy, the sadness, and the elation throughout the entire piece. Give it a try and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"I expected a blaring, exciting performance on Beethoven's epic Ninth Symphony in this album, with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic for CBS/Sony; it turned out to be the opposite.All the other Beethoven symphonies he recorded for CBS/Sony are great, especially the Third, the Fifth (despite an intolerably sluggish first movement), and the Sixth. But the Ninth is a complete dissapointment.Despite Bernstein's overt and fast conducting, the performance completely lacked the power Karajan had, and even the cleaniness and precision fellow conductors Szell and Ormandy had. The brass in particular wasn't as blaring as they did on the Third.The tenor was simply awful. His timbre was one of the worst I've ever heard. As for the Julliard School chorus (and Julliard is supposed to be America's No. 1 music academy), no offense but the singers sounded immature, a far cry from the rich, clean, powerful voices professional choirs utlizes.One word, TERRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple for the older kids/Too terrifying for the younger ones.","review":"The suggested reading level is 4-8 for this, but older kids will be bored by its simplicity, boring illustrations, and lack of words.But if you mistakenly buy it for a younger group, they'll never take a bath again after seeing the huge, terrifying, aggressive dinosaurs that come out of the bathtub.Unlike his book \\"Fire Truck\\" (a book which has equally dull illustrations but at least does have some merit through a counting exercise), it's less clear that the dinosaurs are a figment of the boy's imagination in this book than when the boy in the other book mutates into a fire truck. And while I like picture books that tell a story with their illustrations, there's really no story here except a boy in a tub crowded out by prehistoric beasts.There are some great dinosaur books out there for kids who love them -- and this just isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The jungle calls","review":"2 of my grandsons have read all of the books in this series plus The jungle calls & enjoyed them very much. they would like more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the Beaten Path?

The most outstanding results were in my cat's water fountain. It was so scaled over that it looked moldy and gross and that cats wouldn't use it anymore. A new one was almost $50, so I tried this first. After applying it full strength and letting it soak for a few hours the hard water deposits came right off! I let the fountain rinse under running water for about an hour, and it was like new! It also worked for my dish drainer tray and shower doors.

It's almost completely devoid of tradition and yet there's no mistaking its heritage. It comes at you with a purpose - a plan. It gets you on the first note then makes you a willing captive for the rest of the ride. And a great ride it is.

There are so many things to dislike about this turkey, not the least of which are a bad script, overacting on the parts of Blethyn and Franco, terrible music, predicatable plot and a host of other problems. Blethyn's southern accent is so overdone that it is actually humorous. And a scene with Franco in which he discovers that a woman he just had sex with is addicted to cough syrup is outright silly.

Okay, this movie \\"Sonny\\". While it's not a complete masterpiece. It trully sets mood and holds interest. The characters are full of sins and other quirks that draw you in. Acting is exceptional and real. With all the cookie cutter type films out there, this film is trully cool. While the subject is a little racy, it is done tastefully. I believe this is Nicholas' debut directorial film. He's no Kubrick but his choice of shots are intriguing and give a good flow to the scenes. The final note I have to make is on the films music. This movie should have a soundtrack. The music is exceptional and fits perfectly with its feel. If anything this film will take you somewhere different. It's up to you if you like it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"best indie","review":"Despite absolutely being obsessed with James Franco, this movie was really great.

James Franco does an amazing job, and is definitely one of the most underrated actors around today.

The lyrics are better than Top Forty allows, though. All-in-all, I think Al Stewart is a true artist. I was not disappointed with this album.

So for half the money in toner you print twice as much...not a bad gig if you can forgive the speed a little bit.if you are buying these units check with HP regarding a separator pad upgrade.They were free for a time.Basically the skid pad that separates the paper as it is fed in gets worn and the printer tends to double feed.After I did this upgrade to my units I was pushing 100,000 pages printed on some of my machines.HP is well known for its reliability, hands down I recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A combat cameraman's view of history","review":"From Danish merchant seaman to the Mexican movie industry and, for three decades, one of broadcast journalism's top combat cameraman, Carl Sorensen covered some of the toughest and most meaningful stories of the late 20th century.

There are lots of color photos featuring beautiful & unique ideas. This book makes decorating easy & enjoyable.The book starts out by introducing design principles & styles. Then you get an in-depth look at windows, window treatments, wall coverings, & flooring. I love the many facts & tips sections that explain the pros & cons of materials.The book also takes you through planning all the rooms in your house with questionnaires, layout ideas & lighting considerations. The tips on ideal shelving dimensions & ergonomics were very helpful.Throughout the book there are also over 20 great ideas sections for various areas.

The buttons are not very positive acting either, you can't tell if you've pushed them or not. But if you really deliberately test it, it will count steps.

A couple of names are the same, and Missy and Willie are further out west, but other than that, you would never know that this was based on Janette Oke's novel.Several reviews have noted Missy's change of actress. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the change. I had no real problem with January Jones' portrayal, and I believe that Erin Cottrell was a little older than her intended age in this film. However, Erin's mannerisms and less willowy build are closer to how I have always pictured the strong-willed Missy.This is a relatively family-friendly movie with references to faith in God, so that's the two stars.I could go on to list the many huge departures from the book, but other reviews have already covered the big ones.

If you read the book you will see why for she brought the Missie I read in the book. What also dissapointed me is the inaccuracy of the movie and the notion that Missie can't COOK. I believe any daughter of Marty could cook very well and since she could make corn bread pudding and fried chicken (In the first two she mentions she can make them) I believe she wouldn't burn biscuts. Erin I believe is a okay actress but I really REALLY perfer January Jones. I hope if they make Love's Abiding Joy that they would use JANUARY JONES.This movie is okay for renting or buying for it is a okay movie but wouldn't make a good sequal to the Love Comes Softly series."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the other two","review":"The first two movies in this series were far better than this one.

Runkle comes across as a meanspirited, insensitive detective who shows little consideration a loyal and injured Emma Lord. Meanwhile, the author spends far too much time lecturing us on the value of family and that \\"blood is thicker that water.\\" Combined with a weak plot, this relentless harping on family (despite the fact that Runkle has never met most of the branch of the family she is now meddling with) make this one of the least enjoyable books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item not advertised properly","review":"This is a youth arrow.

The documentation available on the respective websites is far superior.My conclusion: this book is largely superfluous and a waste of paper. If you really want to know about Spring, check out the website and read the superb, in-depth \\"Expert One-on-One J2EE Design and Development\\" by Rod Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even spell checked","review":"This book with its talk of the business \\"sponser\\" was not even spell checked.

One star is generous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Not Just for the Java World","review":"I recommend the first set of chapters in this book for EVERYONE. While it helps to know J2EE/EJB to step through the examples, the author provides a wonderful, thought-provoking and inspiring coverage of software design in general.The first pieces of the book (actually, up to Chapter 7: Hibernate) discuss the joys and perils of simplistic approaches, over-architecting, under-architecting, evaluating available libraries/APIs, etc.This is a great coverage of the software engineering process from gathering requirements to coding and from choosing a programming language to dealing with management. A simple, easy read.The downfall of the book is that it doesn't promise what it advertises: Better, Faster, Lighter Java. The primary focus is on the underlying, architectural choices, not on the Java language itself. However, my downfall was purchasing based on title (as a dual-Amazon suggestion) instead of reading the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refactoring will not save your soul","review":"The book starts off well and the author makes several good points about having lighter objects and not being tied to a particular framework, but then it digresses into refactoring evangelism. Despite what this apologist believes, design cannot be neglected altogether as refactoring becomes more and more expensive as a system grows larger and parts get more complex. Just look at all the items still left over from Java 1.0 or 1.1. How many methods has Sun deprecated that are still around? Take many of the concepts to heart up to about page 50, then just chuck the rest.Design well, but have allowance for refactoring. Build smaller pieces and not monolithic objects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"Really disappointing.I read this book because of the fame of the author : Bruce A.

This book with its daddy Walton house building and kayaking action man morality tales is all quite patronizing.The home spun tales seem to be Tate's, so I assume Gehtland does the coding. Unfortunately I don't think he read the book since he does not follow the principles that the book espouses: way too much duplication, not very OO (too many if/else; poor exception handling), unthinking dependencies on implementation (e.g Axis, Lucene).Hibernate and Spring are powerful tools that help in the real world and there are better places to go and find out about them without all the whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get the right bottle","review":"I didn't get cherry plum.

I didn't realize at the time the embroidery on it but love that! My brother and his wife were expecting a girl the same time as myself and we didn't know but both were looking at this set. I ordered it the day before we found out we both were looking at it and so they chose a differnt pattern (they didn't want the girls having the exact same room). I love it and my little girl who is now a couple weeks from two years old loves to tell us about her 'flower room'. We are expecting another baby in the spring and have decided to get the toddler set if it's a girl and give the new baby her old crib set. I'm thrilled with this set and love the non-pink pattern that is still very girly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous bedding","review":"We bought the Toddler set and love it.

Somehow, lotions always make my skin crawl; it just feels so slimy. The problem with lotions is that they all smell. Even the better Neutrogena, unscented lotions smell like lotion! Finally, my wife introduced me to the wax spa. I am extremely satisfied. Not only does the treatment soothe sore hands, but it eliminates dryness - no more white, flaky skin between the fingers, something the lotions could never affect. Among the waxes, Conair offers the highest quality paraffin. I've tried the Homedics version at my in-laws and there is no comparison. It's worse than the lotions. Conair wax is a must, and online is the only place I've been able to locate the replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mephisto men's shoe","review":"A rare find for me, a men's narrow width shoe.

But some things don't stand the test of time: what sounded fresh and interesting then now sounds too much like the rest of the triple Z jazz genre that clogs the play lists of commercial jazz stations. Put another way, this music plays well in the background but it doesn't hold up to careful listening.Mr. Becker is a heck of a guitar player, but the synthesizers and keyboards dilute instead of enhancing the music here. It all sounds pretty much the same. I would recommend both \\"Siberian Express\\" and \\"Third Time Around\\" as better testimonies to Mr. Becker's work from the early '90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of this bootleg","review":"Despite the back cover notes stating that this recording is made live at \\"Viejo Almacen\\" it is not true.

I'm reminded of the old adage \\"you get what you pay for\\" and you should too. I admit to borrowing my boyfriend's shaver when he wasn't looking and it did a great job.If you do buy a shaver, here are the features you should look for:- Rechargeable, preferably one with a stand/base- Wet/dry usage- Titanium blade coverings- Pop up trimmer- Easy to find replacement blades when necessaryWith any shaver, your skin will need time to adjust, but this shaver isn't worth the hassle.

It's just terrible.It gives a little bit of weight lifting advice: a list of recommended exercises, with NO DESCRIPTION of what they are. For example, it says to to do a \\"donkey calf raise\\" but doesn't describe it.It does have advice like (literally) \\"don't spit in the drinking fountain at the gym.\\" I didn't need that particular bit.It's very repetitive in the little bit of advice it does give -- it says to eat lots of skinless chicken breasts in about 5 different places.I don't know who would find this book useful.

Tell you what, buy the game from Best Buy (or anywhere else for 30$) and spend an extra 10 for the Headset. This was a good deal when it came out, which is why it gets the high rating. You save about 10$ and a whole lot of time that would have been spent sitting on your butt downloading them. Good game is another plus. To get my full review of the game check the normal PC review. 4 Stars for the original low price and extras anyways though. Good move by Atari and their marketing strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game, with Linux support out of box.","review":"I've been an Unreal player since the first game was released many years ago. UT2004 is the best yet. The new additions of Onslaught mode and several others bring the team game play modes to a new high. Also, most importantly, it includes Linux support right out of the box (even has the Tux penguin on the outside of the box). It is often overlooked that the PC \\"windows\\" version works 100% fine with Linux. In fact, the game plays smoother and more consistently under Linux than it does under Windows on the same hardware. So, give this game a try. Especially if you've been wise enough to break away from Windows."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst diapers ever","review":"Seriously, it's like I just took $40 and threw it out the window.

A feminist before the word was invented, Allison is also a proud card-carrying lesbian, a writer, mentor, teacher, lecturer, and a woman who is always generous to other writers.

It doesn't fold up or open easily at all, and takes up a significant amount of space in its resting position. The metal folding joints are always pinching my fingers. The hoods pop off constantly, and I have found that I really miss the child trays and adult cupholders on the singles.

To begin with the outside looks like finest hand tooled leather. The inside cover pages look like old parchment. It contains such things as photo copies of reward posters, old badges, wonderful oil painting copies, actual historical pictures of the outlaws and lawmen, diagrams of gun battles, and beautiful detailed pictures of their guns. The most important part of course is the way it was written. It is obviously written by people who have a love of documented facts, a love for the old west, and know how to tell the tale. This book was published to be a collector's item. It is a beautifully bound, well documented accountof everything you might want to know about the gunfighters of the old west."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gunfighter book","review":"A very nice compendium of the folks that made the wild west wild.

I got bored of regular sudoku because it got kind of monotonous. Killer sudoku is a lot more fun and satisfying, and you really have to think to crack hard puzzles. Conversely, at least in my view, the key to solving regular sudoku is just staring at a puzzle until you find a hole.I was looking forward to getting this book after I finished all of the puzzles in Killer Sudoku: The Deadly New Dimension. Unfortunately, I found the puzzles in the book too easy. Even many of the puzzles in the \\"harder\\" sections -- Challening and Vexing, for example -- can be solved in under 10 minutes.In this book, the puzzles just aren't challenging. If you want to try to killer sudoku for the first time, I would recommend this book.

Took about 10 minutes. So far it seems to be doing the job. It's sucking up everything on my rug. It's not blowing dirt on floor all around, but sucking it up. The light is great for dark places. I can actually go from room to room w/o turning on the lights. It gives enough light to vacuum by. I haven't tried the onboard tools yet, but they seem fine. Since it's an upright, you really can't get low enough to vacuum under anything lower than 3 inches.

No problem, it broke in the \\"on\\" position so I could just plug it in when I wanted to use it. Now the brush isn't rotating and it doesn't clean at all. I looked up the shipping costs - about $20 to return it since it is out of the Amazon warranty period.Bought this for my lower level so I wouldn't have to haul my other heavier vacuum up/down the stairs. The lower level only has guest rooms so the vacuum doesn't see much use. It did work very well until it broke. Previously I had a hand-held Dirt Devil that fell apart so I should have known better. Lesson learned.Tomorrow I will spend time talking with Dirt Devil customer support, perhaps playing mechanic and electrician. And maybe shop for a box large enough to return it in. Or just send it to a landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but loud","review":"Ordered this vacuum because we moved and left my favorite vacuum cleaner behind by accident. I didn't want to spend a lot of money on this purchase, so decided to try the Dirt Devil featherlite. It works great, but is louder than a freight train!

I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forty dollar wonder!","review":"I bought this vacuum because we were dirt poor and $40 was more then we could really afford but we desperately needed a vacuum. I figured soon we wouldn't be so poor and I could get something much batter. Three years later we are no longer poor and I still love this vacuum. A friend gave me a much \\"nicer\\" hoover. It has more attachments, fancy accessories and it's bag-less, but the hoover won't pick up the dirt, dust or dropped food from the floor. My cheap dirt devil picks it all up. My parents own an Oreck but I think my dirt devil works just as well at a small fraction of the cost. My toddler makes a mess all the time and the dirt devil makes clean up easy. I figure this vacuum probably won't last a lifetime but when it goes I will be buying another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power cord shorted out","review":"This was my third Dirt Devil in four years. The first one worked wonderfully until the power cord shorted out and started a small fire. The second one worked fine, and still does, but keeps loosing its wheels. The third one was bought on June 17 and again had a power cord short. It produced a big spark and scared my wife who was using it at the time. The short always occurs at the point where the cord enters the body of the vacuum cleaner. I think that I am going to buy another one and just put a rubber sleeve around the area to prevent the cable from fraying and twisting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"This vacuum works beautifully.

I have to go over small items like pine needles or crumbs twice to get it to pick up. It does work much better on carpet, and has very good suction. The attachments work well with good pickup.

I think I paid something like $60 or $80 at the time. It worked OKAY at first, but didn't impress me. As time went on, it picked up less and less, even though we cleaned it everytime we changed the bag. We've had it about a year, and it's now a complete piece of junk. Doesn't pick up anything on the carpets. You have to go over the same areas over and over again, and there's always stuff left behind. It works about as good as any random 10 yr old vac you'd find left out with the trash. I will never buy the dirt devil brand again. The accessories were always falling off of it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Broken Belts in 5 months","review":"For the 3rd time, within approximately 8 uses of the vacuum, the belt has broken.

DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Impressed","review":"So, I did some research on good functioning yet cost effective vacuum cleaners. Dirt Devil came up as highly rated so I shopped around for the best price. Purchased the vacuum from Amazon.com and, at the time, the price and free shipping was an outstanding value. When I received the appliance, I assembled it and to my surprise.... it was loud and switching from floor vacuuming to the hose nozzle is very awkward. So, to say the least, I'm not too impressed with this model or make."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Vaccum!","review":"This is a good vaccum for commercial use/first time vaccum. Suction power is excellent. The tool caddy is a bit hard to put tools on, but i never use it so it doesn't matter. The motor's noise is a bit loud but eventually after a few days, you get used to it.

Our old vacuum, after about 10 uses, stopped picking anything up. Since we had lost the receipt and warranty info, we wanted to get a cheap, lightweight vacuum.We got it...\\"cheap\\" being the key word. It does pick up debris off the floor....better than our last one did. But, any vacuum that works could do that. It is SUPER loud. My 2 year old son was not afraid of our old vacuum. He's afraid of this one.Also, every time I use it, it seems to flip a breaker switch...no matter where I seem to plug it in. I'm tired of having to go to the basement and switch a breaker back on every time I vacuum. We did not have a problem with our previous 2 vacuums.I haven't tried the attachments yet, but I'm afraid the other reviews are correct about them being difficult.Aside from the fact that it vacuums and it is light weight, I would not suggest this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and inexpensive","review":"I brought this vacuum 1 year ago for $39.99. I have to say it's noisy but it's definitely not noisier than whatever I had before. It does not have many optional speed or floor type selections as some other fancy vacuums but just on and off button. But it's absolutely good enough for my apartment and it works excellent! You do need to change the dust bag but it's not a big deal. I am not sure if it's suitable for a large family with many kids which might often drop some tough stuff on the floor. However I will recommend it to all others."},{"rating":"2","title":"dirt devil- upright","review":"For approximately $40 dollars its about the the best thing I have bought for the money on line.What sold me was a review stating \\"the suction will suck chrome off of a pumper.

I have cleared the hoses and to no avail, the unit still does not work.We bought it thinking how bad can it be? It stinks. Plastic pieces keep falling off. The hose connection to the main floor unit has cracked and now, no amount of duct tape can fix it.If you only need a vacuum to work for a year, this one will fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for the money","review":"It will do for my needs.

Had the fun of putting it together, and what do youknow it works just fine. It is light weight, and may not last 20 years, but itdoes a good job of cleaning. I would have liked the cord to be a bit longer, butthat is not really a problem just a preference. It is an amazing value and we areglad we chose the DIRT DEVIL."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years of service","review":"I bought my little feather lite 10 years ago when we downsized to a cabin on a lake. It replaced the high dollar dollar vacuum I had used in our larger home. It has done everything I have asked of it including traveling around the country as our motorhome vacuum. Now, after 10 years it needs its cord repaired where it enters the body of the vacuum, so my husband will fix it and it will become our permanent motorhome vacuum. As I am searching for what buy for the lake cabin, I have come to the conclusion that I may as well buy the same little feather lite all over again. It is lightweight, has plenty of power for our berber carpet, and you sure can't beat it for price and longevity. The only thing I would have liked it to have is a hand held power attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum sucks.","review":"Picks up long hair and everything on the floor after a wild party. I had to buy this vacuum because someone I know thinks the floor is a trash can. I got a bagged vacuum because... who wants to spend time washing a disgusting container every time you clean? Not me.

Once my old, metal Hoover upright finally gave out after 25 years, I had a series of vacuums, most of them not that great. I refuse to spend $800 for a vacuum. Now that I'm older and I just broke my arm, I needed a lightweight vacuum that was still strong enough to pick up the dirt & cat hair. My old Eureka upright, to its credit, didn't break, someone broke it while helping me! So the Eureka brand is a good brand.This new vacuum is fine and I can even move it around with my bad arm. The only quibble I have with it is if you have deep carpet pile, it won't work as well. I don't have carpet like that (altho' I have a deep pile area rug) so the self-adjusting element copes fine with my carpet. It picks up all the dirt & cat hair and I can even carry it upstairs.If you need an all-around good vacuum that is lightweight and has a bag (which I prefer), this is the one for you!P.S. - the price was awesome for such a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"FAST","review":"It is almost fun to clean now.

Aside from that, it seemed to work marvelously - really sucked everything up. Kudos to Amazon for a flawless, painless return.

We have an old model Dirt Devil that dates back to the early '90s that's still going strong so we felt good about buying another Dirt Devil.My husband and I have been sorely disappointed with this model though. It is indeed lightweight, which is a plus since we have to tote it up and down the narrow steps of our home. And there is onboard tool storage, but that's about the only good things I can say.The machine is extremely loud. It is useless on hard floors. It just flings the dirt in all directions since there's no way to disengage the beater bar. The hose is difficult to detach and re-engage.True, the machine was inexpensive and we got what we paid for. I would not recommend this machine except for maybe someone with a small carpeted apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"Inexpensive, light weight, easy to clean, easy to change bags, easy to replace belt (we have some long hair in our family and had I cleaned the beater brush sooner it may have taken longer for me to find out how easy the belt was to change :D) and it actually cleans the junk off the floor.

I've gone through a Shark brand vacuum that broke after 2 uses and an Orek XL that ate it's own cord but couldn't pick up Cheerios that my daughter spilled. I've had bad luck with vacuums but this one is doing just fine after 200+ uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noisy, but ideal for me.","review":"I live in an apartment and I bought a new carpet. If you've bought a carpet before you know how much they \\"shed\\" in the first few days. The hand sweeper didn't do the job, so I needed a vacuum. I calleed my daughter & she told me how much she loved her dirt devil. So I checked out the reviews & it had one of the best overall ratings so I bought one. Arrived in two days, took me ten minutes or so to read the instructions & to assemble the vac & away we went. It works great - powerful suctions & convenient to use. I like the light and the extra hook on the handle so you can loop your power cord there and avoid running over it allthetime. Only drawback is the noise. It is loud. So I put in earplugs when I vac. An easy 5 stars from this old batchelor. I'm happy! You will be too if you're looking for an inexpensive top quality vac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and inexpensive","review":"Maybe I just don't vacuum as much as people who normally review vacuums on Amazon (okay, I'm pretty positive I don't), but this vacuum has been pretty much everything I would expect and hope for out of an inexpensive vacuum. It gets all the cat hair out of my rug and does a nice job at getting the hair off of my furniture with the attachment. This is so much cheaper than all the vacuums at my local Target and I got it on sale here on Amazon.No, it isn't the best vacuum in the world. It's not designed with aesthetics in mind and hours spent agonizing over the best way to store the attachments nor does it have some fancy ball that allows you to wiggle it through a vacuum obstacle course with ease. But if you don't want to spend $300 for a vacuum that you're going to use for 10 minutes every so often, this one does its job (makes my floors clean) and that's all I can really ask for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I know it was on the cheaper side of vacuums, but this vacuum seriously did NOT suck anything up. Not even fuzz. It only really worked with the hose part. I ended up buying a Bissel that was even cheaper then this Dirt Devil that pick things up so much better! This has been demoted for the car, since the hose has the only true suction on it. I wouldn't waste your money on this product, no matter how cheap it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the price","review":"This vacuum is easy to put together and has great suction/vacuum on carpets. It doesn't perform as well on bare floors but the hose attachment takes up the slack. I have cats and it is great at getting the cat hair out of the carpeting but has a tendency to blow some of it around on the hardwood floors. I use the hose and wand to pick up the 'floaties' of hair that get blown away from the roller bar in the vacuum. All in all, it performs well and is easy to maneuver and lightweight. I bought it to supplement my expensive canister vacuum that exhausts me every time I use it - especially on the stairs. I find I'm using the Dirt Devil more and the expensive vacuum less and less."},{"rating":"2","title":"get what you pay for","review":"Good vacuum for the price - nothing special but it works well on carpeting.

The circles are spaced so far apart, that even someone with Jimmy Durante's nose, and/or a wide face like mine, will find that the circles land at least partly to either SIDE of the eyes, not ON them. I thought I could solve this problem by arching the middle piece upward so there was a lot of slack in it, and physically placing the circles where they belong with my hands. But due to the weight of the gel in the circles, and the smoothness of the plastic casing, gravity pulled them off my eyes toward the temples. I solved the problem by using a metal pinch-type clip (a strong clothespin might work also) to effectively shorten the middle part that bridges the nose. Voila! If you don't mind doing that, I can recommend this cold pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"My PCL Knee Surgery And Recovery","review":"I had pcl knee surgery and Wow, this product really saved me from countless hours of pain.

I've used this brand of cold pack for many years, but these are noticeably different. The plastic cover is much thinner and softer; hence will tear easier. The gel (when thawed) is very much oozier, making it difficult to get in the freezer in a flat position. It wants to run to one end or ends up all lumpy. AND the main issue is these do not stay cold nearly as long as my previous versions. I will probably not purchase again and will look for some other brand that is more like these used to be. One other note, why doesn't the manufacturer include a fitted, washable fabric cover for these? I'm tired of trying to wrap these in towels or something else when using. I'd gladly pay a couple of dollars more for this and it would help to protect the plastic from tearing, as well. Anyone agree?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a specific storage temp to be effective","review":"The description with the package says this should be stored at 12 degrees, but I did not see this listed on Amazon. Well, I don't have a freezer specific for ice packs, so I put it in my freezer at 2 degrees. It is unusable when stored at this temp as it does not conform to the area needing ice and is \\"frozen solid.\\"I have seen these used in physical therapy offices and they are great, but they are also stored at the recommended temp, which as a consumer, I cannot do. Of course, you could let them defrost for a short time and then use.I use them after I play tennis, and don't want to wait 30 minutes to apply, so out of luck.I would look elsewhere unless you can store at 12 degrees.

It really did keep the cold for a long time and was very comfortable against the back. However, the cold Pack started to leak after one month. I was surprised since no one else complained about this problem, and thought maybe I was unlucky.

Instead I kept it in the cabinet just above the refrigerator. I recently needed to use it, and I discovered that the gel inside the pack had diminished in volume and became quite stiff. It is now unusable.It had never leaked, and there was no evidence of gel leakage around the pack where I had stored it. My only conclusion is that the solvent used in the gel had evaporated through the plastic, leaving behind a stiff, crumbly substance. This may have been due to the increased heat above the refrigerator, accelerating the evaporative process.For the price of this product, I will not buy it again. I would recommend purchasing one of the cheaper versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"#NAME?","review":"Cold Pack - ColPaC Brand - Blue Vinyl - Eye - Shaped to Cover Both EyesThe only positive thing I can say is that it did get cold after sitting overnight in the freezer.

Of course it contains the big hit \\"Evil Ways\\", but that song really pales in comparison (maybe due to overplaying on radio) to the rest of the album. It is just brilliant, and the three bonus tracks are superb, two of which are previously unreleased. The bonus track of \\"Soul Sacrifice was released before, but not in it's entirety. Here, we are treated to 11:39 minutes of sheer genius. The 12 page booklet is excellent also. Filled with photos and a very informative essay, makes this album a must for true Santana fans.

Since the first time I listened it, I perceived it by intuition, so after thirty seven years elapsed, this recording has wrought its own landmark and enviable place among the famous status of cult recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut","review":"This is my favorite Santana album. Being their first, it is not as diverse or exploratory as others, but its consistency is solid. I am a huge fan of blues music, and this album is Santana's most outwardly bluesy album. \\"Persuasion\\" and \\"Treat\\" are wonderful. And the Woodstock cut of \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" was absolutely one of the most intense renditions of any song at that concert. And Jimi Hendrix was there. Now, to even come close to Hendrix, one must whip-a**, and \\"Soul Sac\\" does just that. Check the drum solo. Whoa. \\"Fried Neckbones\\" also teems with bubbling intensity. And for you Top 40 pop rocker dudes, \\"Evil Ways\\" should keep your unadventursome ears off of the radio for a while. Along with \\"The Doors,\\" \\"Are You Experienced,\\" and \\"Led Zeppelin 1,\\" this album is one of the finest debuts of the 60s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulsating","review":"Long before Santana realised that there were millions to be made from pop music he was actually a truely serious musician, this proves it.So its not so polished as Abraxas or Santana 3 but neither musters the sheer energy that this album does, from the first track to the legendary Soul Sacrifice, the rythm section is explosive laying down Afro-Cuban Grooves for Santana and Rolie to play over.My personal favourite is treat (which, excuse the pun is a treat) Rolies piano work is exquisite creating a late night jazz feeling and then that magnificient precussion team jumps into action giving it a real latin feel to it.The live tracks are no fillers as well, with THAT version of Soul Sacrifice they hardly could be though, and what is probably the definitive version of Fried Neckbones (Jose Areas trumpet solo is real sweet as well)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana's 1st release","review":"The Santana Debut.A brilliant combination of Rock, Latin and African influence.I have owned this album first on vinyl and later on CD.

Coville doesn't cut corners when it comes to the dark side of the story -- he doesn't linger on the more morbid dialogue, but makes it clear when someone is murdered or poisoned, etc. When seen in such a condensed form, the story is rather dark; the romantic allure of the two teens gets a little lost in the bustle, but this is still a fine adaptation, as are Coville's other works.

Fortunately there are no significant references to prior books this time around.Anyhow, this time Mrs. Pollifax finds her way to Bulgaria. Supposedly she is only taking passports to the underground there, but her boss Carstairs is strongarmed into having her taking other items, sewn into her coat, along with her without her knowing it. Complications, unsurprisingly, ensue. She falls in with a group of travelling college students (and one in particular), and leaps in to help when one of them is held by the secret police.She leads both friends and foes on a merry chase as she travels around Bulgaria. It's got to be one of the more complex plots of any of the books I've read so far, and as a result one of the most gripping.Rosenblat again does a superb job with the voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought as gift","review":"Bought it for grandma, and made her a happy lady.

But who cares, when the music she makes is so squeaky clean that the industrial solvent they used to clean it causes instant and intense waves of nausea.Also, what's with the title? Re-Joyce? Joyce? Is there a joyce in the christmas myth? Or is her mom named joyce? What's this business with \\"joyce\\"? I guess they thought they'd try and make it stand out by dividing up one word into two. This could have been clever if the either of the words added some extra meaning, but in this case it's completely extraneous and cloying for attention.Don't reward this kind of idiocy, and don't reward a music industry that tries to force this lowest-common-denominator garbage down our throats.

This is the worst Christmas album I've ever heard!! I actually surprisingly cringed while listening to it.

I am very disappointed with the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Christmasy to me","review":"I listened to all the clips and can say the only ones I liked were \\"I saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\"- it fit her voice well-childish like but sexy. The other one I did like was \\"Baby its cold outside\\" because Nick sounded great and helped the song to be enjoyable. I felt too much of a sexual overtone on the other ones especially \\"O holy Night\\" and this really turned me off. It was OK to do this on a fun song but not these more religious songs.Could just be me though. Some may like it- I don't. Sorry Jessica, not your best work. Betting you will do well though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I love Christmas Music. I own about 25 different christmas CD's and I am also a big fan of Jessica Simpson. I own two of her albums and was very disappointed in the quality of this CD. she has an amazing voice and doesn't use it. Too many songs are sung in a breathy, little girl voice. She has amazing vocal capabilities why doesn't she use them? I ended up giving it to my niece who gave it back to me because she liked Mariah Carey's Christmas CD better. Can't say I blame her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much air not enough sound","review":"I was a fan of Ms. Simpson when she first arrived on the scene. But, over the years she seems to have lost her voice but found her breath. On this album in particular, the listener hears the sound of wind coming in and out of her lungs not tones or notes. She is almost doing a Marilyn Monroe impersonation, which is sad. (O Holy Night, by the way, is not a jazz/R&B tune.) I'd go back to the drawing board and find the Jessica that came out a few years ago - the one with the set of pipes and not the cartoon character that she's become."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was so excited for this album to come out b/c I haven't found a christmas album I really like since Mariah Carey's (still my fave), but I was really disappointed in it. I just don't understand why Jessica changes up her voice so much and tries to sound so raspy. She has such a beautiful voice that it's a shame she doesn't really use it. This is not by far the worst album I have ever heard, but I do agree that if you're not a die hard Jessica fan then I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurl-a-riffic","review":"Simpson is mediocre at best, and often her vocal elaborations sound like she's choking back a gag reflex.

Jessica, stick to pop music, Christmas music is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's an idiot and I have proof","review":"Watch one episode of her stupid lame-ass mindless idiotic show and that's proof enough.

Her songs are weak and very poorly done and she just screams on every song, SHE CAN'T SING AT ALL sorry folks that's the truth.

This is a flat and spiritless Christmas release with tired vocals. Even with a somewhat joyful track \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" with hubby Nick Lachey in the Easy Listening mode, this album cannot carry itself. This album - named after Jessica's late grandmother - tries to be cute but comes out empty and sordid, much like its artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"another horribly cynical marketing exercise","review":"We all know to expect the worst at this time of year and to prove our fears were valid here comes dear Jessica's latest attempt to milk the most out of the festive season. As one commentator noted, Jessica has spent the last year or so writhing around on the bonnet of a car wearing next to nothing and now she's asking us to buy her devout Christmas CD! And it's called Re-Joyce for her recently deceased grandmother - well, as she's already exploited her marriage on reality TV, why not turn to dead nana? To be honest, Simpson once had a powerful and pure, if unsubtle, voice but on this set it's all breathiness and coy sweetness. For those who want to listen to seasonal music outside of the shopping malls, there are plenty of legitimate Christmas CDs around. But not this one. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!!!","review":"Jessica singlehandedly butchered every single Christmas song she recorded! She clearly has no idea how to sing properly.

The only breathtaking song is Little Drummer Boy, a duet with her sis Ashlee, and you are not gonna believe it but Ashlee sounds better than Jessica on this track! Poor Jessica's voice is too breathy, flat, and just annoying. Jessica has never sounded this dead on an album, what happened to that girl who could belt her heart out? She does a cover of Amy Grant's Breath of Heaven (Mary's Song) and she does not pull it off like Grant's verison. Jessica really messed this up, all the other songs sound hideous, hopefully Jessica won't release another X-mas cd ever again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Talent ................","review":"Jessica Simpson is THE most annoying person in show business and in the music business.

From her striking performances in her debut album Sweet Kisses to her disappointing breathiness on In This Skin, Simpson's career has boosted due to her hit-TV show but her vocals have gotten more sour. ReJoyce is a beautifully sung Christmas album overall, though some of her too-breathiness is a little annoying. Overall, a good effort by Mrs. Nick Lachey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CALLING ALL SENIOR CITIZENS!","review":"This C.D is very old fashioned (Hark! the herald angels sing, little drummer boy, I saw mommy kissing santa are JUST A FEW AWFUL SONGS ON THIS ALBUM, THEY'LL MAKE U WANT 2 THROW UP!). The only people I can imagine listening to this C.D are senior citizens who dig B.S music. I used 2 like Jessica Simpson (her album Sweet kisses + irresistable are AWESOME). Christian music can be cool (just check out Stacie Orrico's GENUINE album- it's filled with smooth Rn'B/hip-hop + pop songs). Jessica + Nick are basically trying 2 milk their popularity while it lasts (NEWLYWEDS, DESERT 'BEAUTY PRODUCTS', + THIS B.S c.d). IF U ARE CONSIDERING GIVING ANYONE 'RE-JOYCE' AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT THEN U REALLY MUST HATE THEM!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"southern gospel? nightclub? what is she doing?","review":"There is a hint that Jessica has a good voice, but apparently she is not sure where she belongs. Some of the songs have a southern Gospel feel, and I must confess, that personally, I do not like that wailing type of music. But, if you do, you will like SOME of the tracks. However, on other tracks, she uses this breathy quality, that I suppose, is trying to imitate a sexy nightclub singer. These two styles do not work well together. Except for die-hard Jessica fans, this is not a particularly good album. It is ho-hum pop and even less attractive as Christmas music. At times I am reminded of Marilyn Monroe singing \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. President.\\" The problem is that Marilyn was NOT known as a singer. Jessica needs to rethink her presentation.

I couldn't believe my ears, she butchered these songs with her childlike, breathy tone. If you want real Christmas music, I would suggest buying Celine Dion, Mariah Carey, or Christina Aguilera's christmas albums, not this.

I think not.These overly sexualized tracks kill the beauty of these holiday favorites. Christmas music should be pretty, or moving, not scandalous. Her hubby Nick sounds great on \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\"; however, they don't strike the balance of the male voice persuading the female to not leave so quickly. Instead, the producers (probably under duress from freaky Pa Simp) make JSimp's voice louder and more promounced, practically drowing out Nick. Sad but true.Oh, and she breaths something out with Ashlee, who was no doubt doing a hoedown dance in studio while recording. Sigh.Get Mariah Carey, Jewel, or something classical this season. Not. This."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good Christmas album","review":"This album seems really dull. Jessica didn't not do well on this Christmas album. Her vocals, to me, sounded pretty bad. I think she could have tried a bit harder to make the songs more fun, since a lot of the songs are dull ballads. I really, really did expect more from Jessica, since her other albums are really good, but this one is really dull. However, I did like Ashlee's part in Little Drummer Boy and she should make a Christmas CD. But for Jessica, this Christmas CD isn't worthwhile, and only big fans of Jess should buy. Very, very bland and boring. Only recommended for big fans of Jess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, my dear sweet Jesus","review":"I thought that Celine had the award for the massacre of \\"o Holy Night,\\" but now I must say that Jessica Simpson takes the cake.

My older boy likes to pretend shop, and it provides a lot of variety -- there are always things we \\"need\\" to buy, and we can use items from other toys (not just the small cardboard boxes that came with the toy). My younger boy likes the grating sound from the conveyor belt. However, it's hard to imagine anything more cheaply made. I was surprised at the low quality, given its high price.

The cash register doesn't stay on the scanner, it falls off continuously, making the scanner non-functioning. The number key pad on the register is one big square, not individual numbers. That was a big disappointment since I can't tell my son how much something is and have him punch in the price. The \\"food\\" it comes with is made out of flimsy cardboard (except for a couple of plastic items) which were destroyed by my son within minutes after trying to scan them. It's too bad, because this is such a cute idea, and my son really liked the scanner when it worked. It became more frustrating than fun after a little while though.

Cheap Trick is the diva of American power pop; give them a taste and you'll detect satisfying hints of the Beatles, The Who, and The Sex Pistols. Cited by icons Kurt Cobain and Billy Corrigan as a major influence, Cheap Trick is more fun, less angst. In addition to Cheap Trick's familiar radio anthems \\"Surrender\\", \\"Ain't That A Shame\\", and \\"I Want You To Want Me\\", you'll find undiscovered gems like \\"Lookout\\", \\"Oh Caroline\\", and \\"California Man\\". You also get two mini-videos from those amazing Budokan shows on this 2-disc set, to enjoy on your computer screen. A must for all rock and roll collections!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ROCKING AT THE BUDOKAN","review":"Twelve years since the Beatles' Budokan performance, here came Cheap Trick, performing songs from their ground-breaking show, that would be released in 1979, and catapulted them into world prominence. Here now is the expanded collection of all of the songs the band performed .High spots include such rockers as \\"I Want You To Want Me\\", \\"Surrender\\", \\"Ain't that A Shame\\",\\"Clock Strikes 10\\", and \\"ComeOn ComeOn\\". This set has to be on the Top Live Albums list of many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album, But What's With the Changes!?","review":"This is a great album, even greater now in its completeness. But I was shocked to hear that the version of \\"Goodnight\\" on \\"The Complete Concert\\" is different from the one on the original album. I loved how Zander's voice gave out several times during the first few lines of the song on the original album--he had rocked so hard his vocal cords couldn't hold up. Awesome! On this complete concert, his voice sounds fine all the way though! What gives!?You can hear the old version on the MP3 sample that Amazon makes available for those purchasing the original CD. Compare for yourself--the difference is marked.Anyway, I'm disappointed to find that the complete concert is not just the old album with the left-out songs added. I don't know if the version of \\"Tonight\\" is a version from a different night or if they \\"fixed\\" the original one. Either way, a disappointment. Still, overall a classic and worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles for the late seventies","review":"Just one of the most fun and enduring rock albums ever from one of the most underrated bands ever. Surrender and Oh Caroline among the highlight numbers for me. Fifty years from now when all of the Boston and Styx records are forgotten this album will remain, buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap Trick still and always will have it!!!","review":"These two CD's do a great job of representing the band at Budokan. The sound is so much better. They still have the energy and creativity that they had when they first came out with the first CD. Cheap Trick 97 showed everyone that. If you buy this you will not be disappointed. They are one of the best ever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Haydn on the Tundra","review":"Comrades, I've had this set for many years but I have never warmed to it: there is no entropy in ice-cold vinegar. One day, I'm sure, I'll open up the case and find a frozen mammoth inside.All of the innate heat has been dissipated by the mindless, life-sapping, phrase-gnawing adherence to period practice. If you were to inform me that the Quatuor Festetics consisted of Jeggy and Rene Jacobs on violins, the late Gustav Leonhardt on viola and Corporal Hogwood on the cello and their Opus 64 was recorded in Smolensk in the middle of December where these doughty musicians had been clad only in their longjohns, guess what: I would believe you.Opus 64 should not be an attempt to break the barrier of absolute zero. These masterworks are aptly served by the Mosaiques Quartet:(Haydn: String Quartets Op 64 Nos 2, 4, 5 /Quatuor MosaiquesHaydn: String Quartets Op 64 Nos 1, 3, 6 /Quatuor Mosaiques.Turn your huskies towards these warmer climes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would highly recommend this book","review":"As a U.S. Secret Service UD applicant, I would highly recommend this book. As a former teacher and peace officer, I would recommend this book be in every middle school, high school and university. Mr. Holden has explained,through words and photographs,the application process, the training, and duties of the Secret Service agent, uniform division officer, and other members that comprise the most professional and honorable division of American law enforcement. As an applicant, it helped me learn about the position that I was applying for and helped me articulate my understanding to the agents I interviewed with. The information that I obtained in this book helped me score 97% on the tests and make it to panel. Thank you Mr. Holden for writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let-down","review":"I was surprised at the low durability of this product since I had also purchased the School House from Learning Resources at the same time. The figures of the School House were much more durable. After two hours of playing with this Royal Palace, one the arms of one of the figures fell off. The heads of the figures are very wobbly too.However, I appreciated the fact that the figures are not all white people. The castle itself seems good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Royal Palace Fun","review":"Bought this for my grandson who is two and loves it. I had an old castle from Fisher Price that is 30 yrs old that he loved. This one is just as fun. Not made as well as in years past , however seems like it can survive a two yr old.

We have one at the library and if a toy can survive lots of kids playing w/ it, it's durable. It has fun details and nooks and crannies to explore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a typical fadista","review":"This album is different than other fados; I hesitate to call it fado at all. While the music definitely has its roots in fado, it is much more smooth and elegant than fado tends to be. It is a beautiful album, but don't expect the wild, expressive passion which generally characterizes this style. Her voice sounds classically trained, and the lyrics are extremely sensual. The background guitars and piano almost create a counterpoint melody and reaffirm the smooth, elegant feel. There is not much variation in the album; everything is sensual, graceful, and very low-key. Her voice is lovely, but not much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Melancholy","review":"Christina Branco may not have the passionate intensity of some fado performers, but she is a master of the pervasive melancholy that makes this Portuguese genre unique among popular musical forms. I'm sorry for those who can't melt under the spell of her sensuous voice and emotionally shaded delivery.There are some really beautiful songs on this disc (Ninfas is my favorite), but if slow is a speed you can't abide and subtlety is foreign to you, I guess you won't be able to hear them.When Amalia Rodrigues died, I thought there might be no one to replace her, but she has left us several heirs, and Branco is a standout."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressive","review":"This album is fado diluted by \\"adult contemporary\\" musical drivel.

Biafore gives links to information sources, making it easy for the reader to get more information on each of the hacks. These links alone are worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I tried it twice and threw it in the trash. The unit is awkward to hold. The wax doesn't stay the correct temperature. Very hard to clean the unit when you are done and if you don't get it clean- forget trying to use it again. I had a hard time finding replacement wax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, lousy product","review":"The idea of a roll-on hot wax applicator is really great, especially the convenience of heating the wax by simply plugging it in. The lousy thing is, the wax gets kinda sticky and clumpy instead of hot and runny, ready to spread on the stubble and top with the strip before cool and rip ALL the hair out with a heartfelt holler, the way hot waxing should be. This is more like that washable wax or gel stuff, you might like it it if that worked for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, it's pretty much okay","review":"Well, there are too many cords and it is hard to set up.

What better way to keep him occupied on the 1000 mile drive back from our relatives. Right out of the box, first time using it, I noticed that there were two rows of lines out of the display. 6 months later, the screen is riddled with lines missing! At first I thought I got a bad unit, but a friend of mine who is a big gamer said his is the same way. So much for the cheap way to have an entertainment center in the vehicle. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gamescreen","review":"I recentley purchased this item for my gamecube. It worked perfectly. It includes a car adapter for those long road trips too. But while your not in the car you can use your regular cord included with the gamecube to just plug in the wall and play on your gamescreen then. One of the other cool things you can do is hook up VCR to it and play movies on the screen. One setback on it is that it does not say you can play DVD's on it. But still it is a great gamescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Intec makes two Gamecube screens -- one 5 inch, and one 5.6 inch. The .6 of an inch is hardly the only difference -- the 5.6 inch screen (not sold on Amazon anymore) has a much crisper screen, is less bulky, has better controls, and two headphone jacks. The 5 inch is a smeary mess -- lousy picture, bulky, cheaply made housing with contrasting color \\"feet,\\" and crummy controls. Beware -- because you'll pay the same price for both of them, and the company even uses the same manufacturer's part number and UPC code number, so retailers may not even know it's a different product when they stock it and sell it to you. If you can't get the 5.6 version, then get a different add-on screen from another manufacturer. Don't support a company that tries to pull a fast one on kids and their parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I bought this monitor and i never even got a chance to test it out.

We didn't hook it up until March. That is when I found out I needed another power source for the screen (I ordered a car adapter for the Game Cube itself). I was not given any instructions on the screen needing an extra power source besides the one for the cube. That is frustrating, but we managed to find one at Radio Shack. It works really well, and my grandson is excited that he can now play it while we go on vacation. The seller needs to make sure that all info is with the product.

The author is obviously a creative spirit, which makes for an abundant supply of imaginative recipes. Every recipe is unusual and fun. They are extravagant and call for a lot of ingredients, but if you're in the mood for something unusual and delicious, the outcome is worth it.A few critiques: Serving sizes are enormous.

I can overlook that for the inspiration and fun the cookbook offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could possibly contain this dough?","review":"I got this book for Christmas because I wanted to start baking my own bread, tried a batch, and then put it on the shelf. I pulled it out again today and was reminded why it has absolutely no use for me. The author clearly did not make any effort to make these recipes relevant for a home cook. The bread recipes call for 16 cups of flour! I have a Kitchenaid, but it can't deal with that. When I made the initial batch I dove in blindly and when all that dough started to rise it was unbelievable! I actually had to get out a large size turkey roasting pan to let the dough rise because nothing else could contain it. It was like a monster. I think the bread was good-don't really remember-I was too distracted by the every growing masses of dough all over my kitchen.

HOWEVER, I have spent the entire last week reading through the manual trying to figure out how to \\"setup\\" this receiver. The manual is EXTREMELY poorly written. The person writing the manual took it for granted that the reader is high-tech, and consequently does not give good explanation in many areas of setup. Secondly, the remote control is the absolute worst that I have ever experienced, and I have owned lots of remote controls. In short, although this unit can possibly give you good sound if you are willing to spend the next six months trying to figure out how it works, you are much better off buying another brand that is easier and simple to setup. In fact, I am seriously thinking of selling my 3806 on Ebay and replacing it with an Onkyo receiver, probably the 805."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmatched Sound Quality!","review":"Despite reading many negative reviews, I purchased this receiver for the sound quality.

Bob Malach is wonderful melodic player who can burn when the tune calls for it. 2.) The material is great! There's not a weak tune on the Cd, 3.) the musicianship all around is fantastic - Russell Ferrante, Steve Gadd, Tom Harrell. Robben Ford, Will Lee, Eddie Gomez, and Dr. John need I say more. If you liked to hear one of the most truly inspired one chorus solos on record listen to Malach's heart wrenching take on \\"I Put a Spell On You\\". It's the perfect foil to Dr. John's vocals. This record is funky, it swings, and it hypnotizes you. Someone get this guy back in the limelight and get a new CD out. Check his playing on Mike Stern's CDs also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does wonders","review":"I have been using this product for many years since it is not only great for my hair, but it is not tested on animals and smells great!

It uses a pretty dumb design; the blades stick straight out from the axis of rotation.

Wow! What can I say? The results were amazing. It's quiet and very efficient, not to mention a little bit fun as well. It's like having a carnival in your nose using this baby.

This is the first nose and ear hair remover I have ever bought so I can't compare it to another one, but the blade on this is not very sharp and the motor doesn't have enough power to compensate for the dull blade.Thus it doesn't do the job.It least mine didn't.So if you need one of these you might want to try another brand or like me contiue to use your electric razor.In any case save your money and avoid this one.I would give it no stars but that was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"candid camera gag","review":"This was invented by people who are either totally incompetent or have an off-the-wall sense of humor (or both).

Although I was dissappointed in Ashes in the wind, and that was the last chance I really got to read anything since going back to work, you are still my favorite Romance Author. Now that I'm off for the summer, I plan on reading all of your books I've missed. I can tell you I'm really excited because I've just finished The Elusive Flame and I loved it! It kept my interest from begining to end! I just can't believe anyone could say anything negative about it. I will be starting Petals on the River After the 4th of July. I'll let you know if I injoyed it as much. I should add that the only thing I didn't like about Ashes in the Wind was the ending. It just ended to quickly. I had to read the last chapter twice and still thought I missed something. Please keep writing, I'll never work full time again! Kathy Browning"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still floundering","review":"It seems Kathleen Woodiwiss has forgotten what made her books successful in the first place: romance. _The Elusive Flame_ follows in _Petals on the River_'s footsteps by emphasizing plot, not the relationship between the hero and heroine. Really, who picks up a romance to read about the contrived schemes of boring villains? Yet this is what Woodiwiss' delivers in _The Elusive Flame_. More than half the book is about the hoodlums who follow Cerynise to America for greed and revenge. Worse than that, the romantic tension between Beau and Cerynise ends even before this. I lost interest after the couple realized they loved one another and there were no obstacles to hinder their relationship. Woodiwiss should remember that romances are not about the \\"happily ever after,\\" but what leads up to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flame and the Flower Redux","review":"Unimaginative retelling of The Flame and the Flower holds no surprises. This is very much a reprise! Further, the plot is silly, hard to believe and the characters one-dimensional. (How bad, bad, bad can villains be?) Woodiwiss's romance style is 20 years out of date; readers expect something more challenging and more mature. This is a throwback to an unlamented era. Her fans will probably eat it up, however!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks spice","review":"A disappointing sequel to Flame & The Flower. In Flame & Flower, I was riveted and completely caught up in the characters. Brandon and Heather were undeiably Woodiwiss' best creations. Beau and Cerynise never really captured my interest. They never developed a strong chemistry, and I never really felt strongly that they \\"belonged\\" together. This is the first time I've felt that way about 2 Woodiwiss characters. The villians were bumbling fools, and lacked the menace and sinister aura that earlier villians had. I felt like they were cartoon villians rather than the real thing. I hope, if Ms. Woodiwiss decides (and I hope she does) to do a book about the youngest sister, Brenna, it will be more interesting. I'm glad I read the book if only for the sake of reading about Brandon & Heather again. They'll always be my favorite characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!","review":"I have read every one of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's books. And have love each one. She is the ultimate writer of historical romances. My favorite was the Rose in Winter.

When I first came across \\"Rose in Winter\\" by accident many years ago, I was impressed enough to read Mrs. Woodiwiss' other works. The plausibility, consistency and motivation in \\"Rose in Winter\\" were fabulous. \\"The Elusive Flame\\" is JUNK. All of the characters are unbelievable, their speech and their communication skills are elementary. Who is Mrs. Woodiwiss writing for? Who is your new target market? Go back and read your previous fiction, then look at other believable, heart-wrenching good love stories like \\"Rebecca\\" and give us something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathleen has lost what lured me to historical romances...","review":"Kathleen Woodiwiss wrote the first historical romance I ever read. I read \\"Shanna\\" when I was 15, and it was the standard by which I judged further novels I read. 18 years later I can still remember the names of all of the 'bit players' in that book, because Ms. Woodiwiss used to spend time developing her minor characters. I have found her work since \\"Come Love A Stranger\\" to be shallow and unworthy of the steep price commanded by a new Woodiwiss novel.I have heard that six or eight years ago Ms. Woodiwiss became a born-again Christian and turned away from sensuality in her novels. All deference to her religious conviction aside, it seems that she has also turned from character development, ingenuity, and plausibility.I still have my dog-eared copies of \\"The Flame and the Flower\\", \\"The Wolf and the Dove\\", \\"Shanna\\", \\"A Rose in Winter\\", and \\"Ashes in the Wind\\", but I'll not be reading any more new Woodiwiss novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elusive Flame","review":"What happened to the Woodiwiss I remember starting with \\"The Flame and the Flower\\" \\"The Wolf and the Dove\\", etc. They were so full of passion and rich character development. The woman characters now are modern day feminist not at all resembling their female counterparts of the 19th century and the male characters are weak, spineless fools. I miss the Woodiwiss stories which were truly historical romances and not modern day tales in historical settings all caught up in being politically correct and sugar coated so as not to offend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a ghost writer for Kathleen Woodiwiss???","review":"This book caught my attention because it was a sequel to The Flame and the Flower and I bought it hoping that it would be up to par with Woodiwiss's earlier books. After reading only 3 chapters, I concluded that there must be someone else writing for Woodiwiss. This story was predictable and laughingly coincidental. Cerynise runs alone through London ending up at the seedy wharf and just HAPPENS to meet a nice man who just HAPPENS to know a sea captain that just HAPPENS to be Beau who just HAPPENS to be her childhood sweetheart. Later on the ship, Beau becomes really ill and has sex with her without knowing it? Now, this would perhaps be believable if he was stone drunk, but SICK??? I didn't even finish the book. Don't waste your time on this one unless you are looking for a book to criticize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curl up and read!","review":"One of Woodiwiss's best! She is a master at the historical romance novel, and she never dissapoints! I would definately recommend this read to anyone that likes romance novels! She can make your heart hurt for a heroine like no one else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother - Read Ashes in the Wind & A Rose in Winter","review":"How disappointing. This novel does not represent the Kathleen Woodiwiss I have loved for 15 years. I kept waiting for a story to unfold, with the rich character building and story lines that I'm used to from this author. But this book was slow, plotless, and BORING, BORING, BORING. It seemed that Ms. Woodiwiss borrowed scenes and different plot lines from many of her prior novels, then stuck them all together in this story. Read Ashes in the Wind (my copy is also quite worn) and A Rose in Winter to really appreciate what a wonderful author Ms. Woodiwiss is (was?). Petals on the River was different than her prior books, but it was a sweet, if short, story. I like that her characters are now waiting until love and marriage to have sex, rather than the typical rape scenes in these period romances. However, because of the lack of storyline in this book, I'll be hard pressed to purchase any future Woodiwiss novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Kathleen Woodiwiss I'm Accustomed To","review":"A voracious Woodiwiss reader, imagine my utter disappointment to pick this book up and find that Ms. Woodiwiss has apparently abandoned the same principles that made her a top-notch author. The dialogue is shallow, the storyline too simple, and sexual references leave nothing to the imagination. After reading this novel, I had to return to my worn-out copy of \\"Ashes in the Wind\\" to get that feeling of a true Woodiwiss storyline and heroine. Now THERE'S a great example of what makes Ms. Woodiwiss unique. Please do not deliver another \\"Elusive Flame\\" to the public - the dissapointment is more than I can bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I've missed the Woodiwiss ohenomena and when I hear she's back to writing, I pounced on this one to see if she's the great writer everyone says she is.Well, if she is, she's not my cup of tea, however. This book could've been fun and readable, but there are so many things that irritated me no end. The villian, for one, is hilariously over-the-top. He doesn't speak - he snarls, growls, stamps his feet, grabs people by the hair, et cetera. The really diabetic prose, such as love declarations complete with stars and moons, made me burst out laughing. And I can't help comparing this artist heroine to other heroines who are artists, like Rebecca in Mary Jo Putney's \\"River of Fire\\" - the latter is a REAL artist with emper tantrums and passion. Cerynise seems to be drawing for fun. Hmmm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment!! Shallow, boring,","review":"Being a reader of Ms. Woodiwiss, I'm wondering if this is the same author. I have copies of \\"The Wolf and the Dove\\", \\"A Rose in Winter\\", \\" Ashes in the Wind\\", and \\"Shana\\". These books have been read and re-read and ejoyed with every reading.The Elusive Flame is a great dissapointment. I found the story line lacking. The story itself along with the characters shallow. The villians were obviously nothing more than the Keystone Cops. The book was a total waste of time, costly and within days of reading found itself at the County Dump.Ms. Woodiwiss, if your really still there, please find your way back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I read The Flame and the Flower, Shanna etc. when I was in Hong Kong about 15 years ago. I have searched high and low for other novels by this author and was chuffed to bits to get hold of this one..........but what a disappointment, what a let down. I was really miserable by the time I finished. It didn't hold my interest at all, and I got to the point where I didn't really care what happened to the characters. Is this really by the same author??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I was disappointed......","review":"As wonderful a writer that Woodiwiss is, she appears to have lost her imagination. Gorgeous young woman suddenly alone meets hunky, usually filthy-rich man, they create an imagined problem between them which keeps them from each other sexually, but which does not stop them from toying with each other until they finally end up in the sheets where the virginal woman is suddenly the best lover the hunk has ever had and he can't imagine another, but their new found love and happiness is short-lived now the villian(s) that were briefly mentioned in the beginning of the book are now back with a vengeance, but now time the villian is being helped by a nasty, but beautiful woman who had known the hunk previously and had intentions of having him for herself. Does this sound remotely familiar???? I need more story than this same scenario book in and book out. Come on, Kathleen, you are a wonderful writer, show us what you've got!"},{"rating":"2","title":"His eye color was wrong!!!!!","review":"Overall I enjoyed the book very much but it was hard for me to get past the fact that she changed his eye color. In the Flame and the Flower Beau was born with eyes the same as his father (green and darkly lashed). How could she miss this important detail....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is better than Woodiwiss'last novel but still lacking.","review":"I found this book very hard to get caught up in. While I was glad at the end I read it I was tired of the main characters addressing each other as maam and sir. There were no 'sparks' between Cernyse and Beau. The two villains Winthrop and Rudd were heavily involved in the beginning and then did not show up until the end again which did not make much of a story line. Not the best Woodiwiss I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book~!","review":"I love all of Kathleen Woodiwiss' books. You can't go wrong buying her works. She spins a story with such detail like no other romance writer you'll ever encounter. JMO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun...","review":"This book is a sweet confection you will enjoy very much. The heroine is a strong woman, the hero is a darling dashing sweetheart. It is because of these two good characters that this book keeps going. KEW has written much better books and this seemed to me to be Romance Novel 101, as if she had been given an outline of what the publisher wanted to satisfy current sensibilities. It doesn't seem to me to be a suitable sequel to The Flame and The Flower which was much more intense, but this book has considerable charm and will delight you. It would be a nice place to start as an introduction to KEW, who is the best in the BIZ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This book was very good.

Nothing interested me after going through many authors. By chance, I came across a book review about this book and her first. I read the both of them and loved the characters of Heather and Brandon and Cerynise and Beau. For once, I didn't want a book to end and only wish there were sequels! So, I did the best thing -- I now own all her books! I am currently reading Shanna, but still love these four characters. She is such an interesting writer that you cannot put down her books and at the same time, you don't want them to end. I just loved everything about the book, but in all honesty, I think these men are absolutely gorgeous and makes my heart flutter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit!!!","review":"I have been a fan since the '70's and will remain so. I've read reviews by some of the other readers of this book and I think the ones who stated that Beau had green eyes should read the first two chapters again. \\"Beau remembers his childhood friend's hair and green eyes and Cerynise remembers that Beau had blue eyes.\\" I enjoyed this latest offering from Ms. Woodiwiss and look forward to her next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a disappointment","review":"I loved the first Woodiwiss books, The Wolf & the Dove, The Flame and the Flower, and Shanna. From there, at least for me, it went downhill. Her style of writing changed, from exciting dialogue and action between the characters, to flowery wordiness. The last three of her books I've had to force myself to keep reading, hoping that somewhere in the book is the fire that hooked me in her first book. She's gone from heroines with a can-do attitude to simpering victorian misses. What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not nearly as good as hoped","review":"I first read Shanna 25 years ago and have read every one of Woodiwiss' books since then. I have loved most of the characters, but I have to agree with other reviewers that the characters of Cerynise and Beau were lackluster and hard to warm up to. The only other problem I have with her most recent books is the excessively flowery language and the totally cliched euphemisms Woodiwiss uses in her sex scenes. I had my fill of manly chests and heaving busoms. Her villians were caricatures and there was no suspense involved at all as to whether their nefarious schemes would bear fruit. All in all, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will men learn!","review":"I enjoyed reading The Elusive Flame. I couldn't put the book down. True to Birmingham legend, Beau definitely filled the shoes of his father both with wit and temperment. I recommend this book to any hopeless romantic. Cerynise is every woman's lady. She is strong independent to a fault able to stand on her own if given the opportunity. Through her determination she overcomes great challenges and feats that most women would cower under."},{"rating":"1","title":"cool, but not a puppet!","review":"In the description and on the tag it clearly states that this is a puppet.

I would've rated it with five stars, but I deducted one because the ending seemed obvious. Other than that, The Hook is a great read. Exciting, perfectly paced and suspensful. Mr. Westlake is one of the very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Drag","review":"I have read other Westlake books and, after reading the Hook, he needs to stay with his Dortmunder series. I say this because I think he is best when he employs humor to add to his mysteries. The Hook goes nowhere. There is not much complex plotting at all--a writer who has writer's block decides to kill his wife from whom he is getting a divorce. He manuevers a writer friend to do the deed in return for taking the writer's manuscript and turning in to a best seller. Thus both will get rich and Bryce Proctorr will be rid of his estranged wife. This is a hackneyed plot and after the murder very little happens to move the story along. The characters are wooden, the setting barren, and the tone too matter-of-fact. For me this was a real comedown from The Ax, which was much more complex as a story and, it seems to me, written with more penache."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOPPED READING IT AFTER 60 PAGES","review":"Not very good, in my opinion. Stopped reading it after 60 pages and threw it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of The Hook, by Westlake","review":"As much as I admire Donald Westlake's enormous talent, this latest release just doesn't cut it. The overall rather lazy treatment of the Proctorr character; the almost immediate and complete lack of any residual guilt or horror by the Prentice character over committing murder; the matter-of-fact acceptance of the murder by Prentice's wife and her cold-blooded decision to rent Proctorr's apartment; etc., etc. The whole plot just too pat and way, way superficial. I think Westlake was in over his head on this one. The best I can say for the plot is the gradual deterioration of Proctorr over the final portion of the novel - that wasn't bad, and the ending was brutally abrupt. But, a so-so read (I finished it because Westlake wrote it!) and shallow overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"In good condition","review":"I especially love the Oh...Baby I video from Eternal.

The characters here are so obnoxious that I wouldn't want to spend more than 30 seconds in the same room with any of them. But the chaos is acceptably choreographed up to the point when the donkey is brought into the party -- at that stage, I thought that the \\"creative artists\\" responsible for this had so lost their bearings that they would have been willing to explicitly depict bestiality on screen if they had thought that they could have gotten away with it.

Greenberg captures the rough energy of the world of McGraw's Giants and their fans, and also paints an interesting picture of the unlikely friendship between the earthy McGraw and Mathewson, his college-educated ace. The story of the Kapinski brothers involves not only McGraw and Mathewson, but other, less savory characters such as Hal Chase and his associates on and off the field.A dark historical baseball novel, and one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not for Baseball buffs","review":"I bought this book many years ago.

This novel is the best baseball novel I've yet read, and I can understand how fans of the novel can consider it a religious experience. It's a story of worship, that most essential of human activities, a baseball fan's worship of the first true immortal of the game. Its details are rich without being overwhelming, its characterization classic and familiar but not trite. The dynamic between the celebrant--the jewel designer Jackie Kapinski--and the celebrated, Christy Mathewson, plays out like Greek myth or biblical narrative, and exposes the need for, and dangers of, someone to believe in."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke this book is","review":"It's funny...I read the books for the Billy Walters gambling book and never understood why everyone hated Konik so much.

He also whines about which of his gorgeous, amazing, hot girlfriends hurt him. Ha. Whatever. Listen, this guy is a major cocky prick, and that's why he never got the psychology of the game.

If you want to get into basic telephoto and learn the craft before spending the money this will work. Put your camera into aperture priority mode and off you go.

It is supposedly based on the tritonus interval, banned from all music in the Middle Ages because one beleived it to be the devil's interval. Personally I get chills every time that lonely trumpet plays the main theme. Jerry Goldsmith really put a lot of work into this one and it deserves to be remembered and played by new generations of soundtrack affectionados. There is another soundtrack out there too, but it's more like a cover version, conducted by Cliff Eidelman. Trust me, this one is the better one. There are also extensive liner notes to all tracks and a the fascinating story behind the birth of this soundtrack. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien: Original Motion Picture Score","review":"Beleive it or not, this was actually a good CD. The CD contains some very ominous music which to me sounded sort of scary at times. There was also some soothing and quite calming tracks in the soundtrack. It has a good mix of both types. My favorite track is number one. I do not think that track is the Main Titles though. I think its track 8 that is the main titles where it spells ALIEN. Probably other than that minor mix up, the album was awesome. Jerry Goldsmith is just brilliant. People might get sticker shock from how much this CD is. I have seen prices from $50 and up. That is really expensive for just a CD with 10 tracks. If you are a soundtrack collector or like the score from Alien, I would save up some money. It might sound ridiculous at first spending that much money on a CD, but once you get, you will be satisfied.

Yet for those of us whom have loved the game and the anime since it arrived this is a fun film that is a worth watching. Note only diehard Street Fighter fans should buy the DVD.

I think it could have been tweaked to become a better movie but this was not it. Grant it, I am writing this review from memory since it has been at least 4 years since I saw this. One of the most disappointing parts was the Akuma's presence in the movie. SPOILER ALERT: He was in it and everything but he wasn't even the final boss and if I remember correctly, he was defeated too easily. He played a haunting role more than a fighting role. If you're looking for a Street Fighter movie to add to your collection, then get Street Fighter: The Animated Movie or just get an old Sonny Chiba Street Fighter (non-animated and having nothing to do with the video game) movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only have it as a Fan","review":"The only reason I still have this is because Im a Street Fighter fan.

This film and it's even worse sequal Alpha Generations make me want to bang my head in to a wall.

Oh well I guess since it was only 90 minutes and not a whole series that has to be forgiven. Oh and Charlie isn't in it like I'd expected and he is one my second favorite character aside from Ryu, oh well, all in all a decent movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible excuse for a SF movie","review":"This movie was extremely hyped up. This was an extremely big disappointment.It was disappointing for these reasons:1. The movie did not follow the storyline to the Alpha series, and not enough characters were in the movie.2. The new characters should not have been included in the first place(i.e Shun!!!)3. The plot was too childish. What I mean is that Manga and Capcom should have just marketed this to kids, and removed the blood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews!!! This movie is a piece of crap","review":"This movie featured a non-relevant plot to Ryu and Ken's story that I doubt is even canon to the fighting game series. This movie uses 2 characters: Shun and the main villain that we've never seen before and never will see again along with crappy animations just to make it even worse.I would say the most interesting scene of this movie would be at the beginning with Ryu, but after that, when his \\"brother\\" comes in, it just ruins everything and the focus of the story changes regrettably. After that, most of the fighting-scenes are sub-par at best, especially Ken's where he does a shoryuken fail (more like a Sho-you-can't!) and then falls for the final battle with Ryu, the protagonist versus the antagonist.Overall, you can't even pay me enough to watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"if u liked SF2 the animated movie, then you will hate this","review":"SFA the movie is a hard to watch anime movie.

There were no real fighting scenes that would really amaze anyone,the characters were poorly drawn,the plot seemed too shallow for what it wanted to present and it was missing key characters from the games. It doesn't even have a fight scene with Akuma!! I mean, common now! That is what most people who know SFA expect.

Many of these are good, but are divided between girls' and boys' names, then are listed alphabetically. In Kenyon's book, the names are organized by origin, then male/female, then alphabetically. This 2nd edition has been expanded, although meanings of the names are short, sometimes of no value at all. Although this book will fill most needs, having other name books would not be amiss. Although, one might get by with fewer once this one is added to the shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust with extreme Caution!","review":"I checked this book out from the library to see what some of the other reviewers meant about inaccuracies before I would purchase the book. From the \\"Algonquin\\" perspective there are inaccuracies as well. I don't know the Algonquin for all the names mentioned in this book, but the name for brother the book lists as \\"Wematin\\" isn't right. I've personally read at least a couple dozen books about the Algonquin in the early 1600s and those books used these words:niwikanis - brothermawchick chammay - the best of friendsnetoppew -Friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"Meh. Not worth it. The advice was really generic and the lists are not very extensive or very useful, in my opinion. Plus, in contemporary times, names get out of date so fast (you can often tell by a person's name what decade they were probably born in) that a book would quickly become obsolete. If you want help naming your fictional characters you'd be better off looking at a few baby name books that talk about context as well as meaning; Linda Rosencrantz and Pamela Redmond Satran's books are the best ones for that. Most importantly, use the internet to look up names. That's the best source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meets Expectations","review":"This is a great resource that does exactly what I expected. It lists thousands of names with meanings. If you're looking for surnames, the treatment is light, but many first names are also surnames.Names are grouped by cultural/ethnic background and gender, e.g., Scottish Female names, Scottish Male names, and so on with Maori, Latin, Chinese and many other cultures. That grouping is useful when trying to build a cohesive feel for a segment of people in a story.The book also has a good cross-index in the back that lets you browse all of the names alphabetized. And there is a decent reverse lookup to find all names with a specific meaning in their source language, though the selection of meanings is limited. I personally don't care much what a name means in its source language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The best book that there ever was or wll be for naming characters, wouldn't trade my copy for anything when it comes to reference material for the aspiring writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"This book was written with the sad misconception that a name itself can completely define your character- that's ridiculous. Who says a Bertha or Percy can't be daring, exciting, or sexy? Who says a Gertrude can't be a Dominatrix? I bought this book for the sole purpose of helping with my character's surnames- I have dozens of baby books that I can turn to for first names, thank you, but this book doesn't bother with surnames save for a handful for most nationalities. Beside that, I had to laugh when I read in the first chapter that the author actually named one of her characters \\"Joe Q. Public\\". In her \\"suspense thrillers\\".

They are made of a high quality canvas material, and each seem is sewn three times! Not your typical dog toy here. Our dogs love playing with these toys. They've yet to destroy one.

I hear elements of Spirit, Os Mutantes, Pretty Things, Rory Gallagher, Cream, Who, Creation, and more. I've heard next to nothing of the stuff they did after this, but I know it's probably not like this. Buy this if you're a late 60's music fan. I think these albums should be rated WAY higher.

Besides the book is not as biased as the average fawning Elvis bio, which protrays the man as an untouchable Mythological Hero. This book cuts through the BS that other books keep on perpetuating, and is actually based on fact, not the myths like the other 98 % of Presley books. People dislike this book simply because they dislike the truth and want to hold onto the lies that have became the \\"Presley Myth\\".

SO, what I have done is substituted 1/4 teaspoon of salt instead of a teaspoon in the recipes and I find if I need to add more, then I haven't ruined my whole meal which from scratch, takes a lot of time that most of us don't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salsa for your appetite","review":"This book is amazing if you want an authentic Puerto rican taste to satisfy your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you'll ever need to cook perfect Puerto Rican dishes","review":"Carmen Aboy recopilates the best and most traditional recipes ever found in Puerto Rican kitchens.

I work in the construction industry, as an equipment operator, but occasionally have to handle material that is on the ground. I generally wear leather gloves, but when it rains, I have to resort to rubber gloves. Though, I don't expect rubber to hold up to rough handling, I expect them to keep my hands dry. These gloves not only keep them dry, but warm also. They have a fleece lining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Weather Sailing","review":"Bought these gloves as a low-cost cold weather ocean racing glove. The textured vinyl grips the lines easily, and seems to be holding up well, even under friction from the sheets. Very warm and flexible, much better than a ski-type glove for overall warmth and waterproofing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels Great Very Satisfied.","review":"USPS delivered my Atlas Gloves today.Temps here lower thirties, wore them outside doing casual yard work and washed one vehicle to test warmth and dexterity.

It really makes a person angry to pay a lot of money for \\"waterproof\\" gloves , then find out they're not. Forget about the high dollar waterproof gloves and try these. These gloves \\"really\\" are waterproof and they're not expensive. It's a thick flexible rubber glove that has a semi warm lining. I bought a bigger size so I could wear a thin warm glove on the inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Glove","review":"These are great gloves. They were used for doing an ice sculpture also.

They work fine and are a good alternative to expensive ski gloves. I really don't think they'll cut it in 0 deg or below weather, without liners of some sort. And speaking of liners, I went to put them on today after using them yesterday for about an hour session of blowing snow and they're very moist inside from sweat.

They are well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY recommend!","review":"It is COLD here in the winter, I have to work outside tending animals, my hands often get wet and so cold I have to stop working to come inside and warm them or it will be frostbite.

I picked up a pair of these gloves at a local co-op, and am SOLD. Dry...waterproof...warm, warm, WARM! The perfect tough glove for foul weather, especially cold...nothing gets through them, etc. I have to keep reminding myself it's OK to touch stuff that I would normally be trying to avoid.

I have!), and one extra in the house just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best New Rock Band","review":"I was a huge fan of songs: ohia, so naturally Magnolia is great.

My husband, who is turning into a real spa person, tested it out first and was extremely disappointed. We had a very hard time keeping the suction cups down and the mat kept floating in the water. The sound was so loud it gave us a headache. I took it back and got the \\"blue soft mat\\". The same problems, floating mats, no relaxation. I did not like this product at all, I am taking it back today and getting the duo jets.

It sounds like two vaccum cleaner motors going at the same time. I thought we could unwind for the day with candles and music and the bubbling tub, however you could never, ever possibly hear any music with that loud noisy motor running. It would be such an absolutely perfect product IF you could make the motor quiet. Otherwise it works in reverse--- you come out of the tub with your muscles feeling wonderful but you are so agitated from the noise that you need to find some other way to unwind from the so called \\"soothing\\" bath. My advice is to save your money until they come up with a way to take the noise away!! I was extremely disappointed in the product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"At first i was excited about it there was alot of bubbles and it looked good, but then the mat wouldnt stick. When it finally did stick as soon as the water was running it would float up, they say its the kind of tub you have but i have the kind that they said it would stick on and it wouldnt. so anyway i get in the tub sit on it to make it stop floating and its nice, but then when i put it on high a gust of cold air comes thru the bubbles, the thing blows cold air and it turned my water cold. it was a horrible experience i spent more time keeping the mat down and tryin to keep warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Product If. . . . .","review":"This is a great product to have if you are going on a trip.

There is not a single bad song on the album, an amazing experience from start to end. k-os is an artist making maximum use of his medium to the farthest artistic extent.

Love the convenience of setting the coffee to brew at night and waking up the next morning to a fresh pot without the wait.While Amazon may have the $ rebate. Krups is notorious for denying the rebate, look elsewhere if you are relying on the 20 dollars back. You probably will not get it. I have done many hundreds of offers and Krups is the only one I did not get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst kitchen purchase I ever made - coffee doesn't stay hot","review":"This coffee maker doesn't deliver on its promises!! Though the coffee is good right after it is made -- that's something any coffee maker can do -- it DOESN'T STAY HOT AT ALL. We even went so far as to fill the thermal caraffe with very hot water and let it sit for several minutes to heat up the interior. IT STILL DIDN'T KEEP IT HOT!!We purchased this at a department store and threw away the box after we thought it was OK -- what a big mistake. Now we're stuck with an ... coffee pot that gives you cold coffee and we can't return it, like some lucky reviewers did.DO NOT buy this coffee pot -- it'll be a very ... mistake if you do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner","review":"I have just received and begun to use the Krups thermal coffee maker. For the past two years I have used a Starbucks Barista Aroma coffee maker - also a thermal unit - the price of which was about $X as I recall.The Krups unit is better in all respects. The unit makes 10 cups of coffee rather than 8 - wished I'd had it before the holidays as we had lots of guests. The unit looks better than the starbucks, and the fit, feel, and operation of the unit are all smoother - for less money. The coffee is great - for less money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works okay","review":"I got this as a gift and it does keep the coffee hot for several hours without cooking it over. The taste is good for me but I dont' like strong coffee. I like the look and over all design. The only things I don't care for is if it is not aligned just right you will have coffee everywhere . Also the thermas part the directions said were not dishwasher safe. overall it meet my needs for coffee in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have owned my Krups coffee maker for a year and a half and now it will not shut off. I contacted the customer service department and basically got told, \\"so what....beyond warranty\\". I expected so much more than what I got. I would get better service from a Mr. Coffee product I purchase at Wal- Mart! Which by the way,I gave away my 15 yr. old Mr. Coffee maker that still worked when I received my new Krups. I expected more from Krups.... I guess I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid choice","review":"For the most part, this coffeemaker delivers as advertised, and is a solid choice. Coffee stays warm for several hours--not piping hot, but certainly better-tasting than coffee that has cooked on a warming burner for hours. High marks on the broad lip that keeps this carafe from dripping during pouring--a problem with many carafes. Also, most other makers with a thermal carafe are only 8-cups, vs. 10 for this one.Aroma Control really seems to work--same amount of coffee turns out stronger than on my previous Krups machines. Minor design flaw: the carafe top scratches very easily; I even noticed this on display models in retail stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool but does not work","review":"I got one of these for xmas this year and was pretty excited about getting it. I had done a bunch of research before asking for this particular model. I STILL can't find many bad reveiews of this thing and I don't get it. The one I got leaked ALL of the water I put into the resevoir onto the counter. I took it back to the chain where it was purchased but in another state from where it was originally bought. I got home with the brand new one, plugged it in, and filled it up with water just to see if it did the same thing. Sure enough, it leaked in exactly the same way all over the counter. What a hassle and a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffemaker Blues!","review":"I searched for a couple of months for a coffemaker that would do everything I wanted it to do. I hoped this would be the one. Nope. The coffee tastes very weak. Perhaps they should have not designed the \\"aroma control\\" feature. It controls it alright, no aroma at all! I miss the smell of fresh-brewed coffee that helps get me out of bed in the morning. I still haven't figured how much more beans I will need to make it strong enough. I guess I won't give my old West Bend away just yet. If there is a maker out there that will:1. Make at least 10 cups and still use a thermal carafe.2. Must be programmable.3. Steep strong coffee.4. Color available in black.5. Doesn't have a \\"gold filter\\"Please let me know! I should have checked the other reviews just before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"shattered carafe 5 hours after making coffee","review":"I've had this product for approximately 6 months. I made 4 cups of coffee yesterday morning and left about 2 cups in the closed carafe on my kitchen counter. About 6 hours later I heard a loud popping noise. I didn't notice anything at first, but later found my carafe leaking. The entire inside of the carafe had shattered and the plastic bottom cracked. I'm still not clear what happened, but there is certainly a serious design flaw with this carafe. I'll be contacting Krups this evening. I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't brew HOT coffee!!!","review":"Purchased this coffee maker after reading good reviews on your web site and looking at it at a local kitchen store. We certainly gave it enough chances to do what we expected, but the thing never made coffee that was hot enough for our liking. We even went to the extent of letting the carafe sit with hot water in it for a couple of minutes, then emptying it out before starting the brewing cycle. Doing this is definitely a drag early in the morning when all you want is a HOT cup of joe. Alas back it went and we're still searching for a thermal carafe machine that will make HOT coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Krups that did not meet our expectation","review":"I really don't like this one at all.

After just a week of using this, I'm going to shop for another one from Krups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"Makes great coffee. Very sturdy.

It is nicely designed and very easy to program, but I have replaced it with a Braun, quite simply because the darn coffee was always cold, even as it came out of the machine. I had to heat the cup and milk in order to get it to a remotely acceptable temperature, and if I was filling a larger mug, I always ended up microwaving the coffee, which in my opinion turns the coffee into something redolent of that offensive hot brown beverage found at gas stations. I even heated the filter in desperation, and ground the coffee at room temperature rather than taking it from the freezer, but still all I got was a chilly brew. My recommendation, bag it. For your simple drip coffee requirements buy a Braun or a Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice about buying this product.","review":"There is an ongoing problem with the heating coil in this unit. We purchased one in October of 2005 and in less than 6 weeks after purchase the water was only tepid after brewing and the coffee was weak. We had this problem before w/ the same model we purchased from another online vendor but it lasted a couple of years so we thought we'd give it another try. Krups will not cover the cost of sending the model back to them for a warranty repair, only the repair itself and the return shipping. They did not change their policy even though this was the second time we'd had this problem with their product and this model was less than two months old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad handle on coffee pot","review":"Very poor design of handle. We own two carafes, and attachment screws on both have come loose on the handle. We've had to pry off the cover on the handle to tighten them, which causes the cover-plastic to weaken, (because it wasn't designed to come off.) Moreover, the plastic attachment points of the handles are insufficient to anchor the handle to the carafe, and after 3-4 tightenings they break off, rendering the carafe useless. All in all, a very poorly designed handle system. We've tried to live with this coffee maker for as long as possible, but we're ready to try another brand entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like cold coffee?!","review":"Great looks and if you have a white/black/stanless steel kitchen it blends in well. The timer feature is also nice. However, the coffee is cold by the time the brewing is comleted. A very, very disappointing experience! We had another brand coffee maker with an insulated themal carafe (glas insulated) and it kept the coffee warm for half a day. This one is just worthless unless you consume the coffee immediately. If this is what we wanted then we would have purchased a regular glass carafe. I threw away the packing so now I am out $100. From now on I intend to read all reviews I can find before buying anything similar. I am soooo disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like exploding carafes","review":"Used the unit for about a year and a half; it makes decent coffee. I agree with the other reviewers who say the coffee isn't quite warm enough.The serious flaw with this product is the carafe, which has a glass thermal lining that seems prone to exploding spontaneously. Thinking that it was a fluke, I was shocked to see that this has happened to many other people who've purchased this product.Considering that the replacement carafe costs 60% of the purchase price, and it seems you will get somewhere between 5 days and 1.5 years of use out of the carafe, I'd suggest that you pass on this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hot!","review":"I was really excited about purchasing a new coffee maker with a built-in thermal carafe. My excitement dimished when I found that the product did not make or keep the coffee hot. How is this possible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"It makes good coffee but overall, I am disappointed. It is all because of the carafe. It only keeps the coffee drinkable for about two hours. After that, you are taking your chances because the coffee is lukewarm. I only wanted a coffee maker (with a carafe) that kept my coffee hot for a long time without having to worry about my happiness being ruined by the burnt,bitterness that starts after the pot sits there on a hot plate for longer than a half an hour. I had a cuisinart grind and brew before and I loved that thing but I didn't ring half the bells or blow all the whistles that came with it and I didn't feel like paying all that money for another one. This was expensive enough and I'm kicking myself. I could've bought a $20 maker at the store and got an entertaining carafe for a lot less and got the same result. ARRRGH!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well till it lasted","review":"It made good coffee except on days we did not seat the filter and caraffe perfectly. After six months thermos blewup. I am not inclined to replace it . Changing Carafe twice a year will make it as expensive as Star bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed with this machine","review":"I used a Krups carafe machine at work, so thought I would try this one when I needed a new machine. The biggest problem for me was that I would set the timer and expect to have coffee.....in the carafe when it was done. 5 out of 6 times my coffee would end up sitting in the basket and never draining into the carafe. I had really strong coffee, but not what I wanted!! The pause and brew feature is obviously very sensitive and no matter how I placed that carafe, it didn't seem to recognize that it was there. Good thing I was only brewing about 3 cups at a time or else I would have had coffee all over the counter and floor.I would not recomend this coffee pot unless you love frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Coffee!","review":"I've been disappointed with this coffee maker. My cheap drip Braun does a better job. I just wanted a thermal pot so the coffee didn't cook on a hot plate. Unfortunately I picked the wrong coffeemaker. The coffee is inconsistant with it's strength. I've noticed that when the water borrows a whole in the coffee grounds the water doesn't get dispersed among all the grounds and ends up tasting weak. The pot doesn't keep the coffee hot for more than an hour either, even when I pull the pot out from the brewer right away. Also, this is a tall unit and may not fit under your kitchen cabinets. I've had to tip it sideways to slip it under my cabinet. (Don't do this when you have water in it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller","review":"I do not know whether this is considered a heavyweight stroller, but it does not seem heavy to me.

The look and feel of it is truly great. My son is now 4 months old and whenever I go out, I make sure to always bring it with me.

It was worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY stroller I have ever purchased!","review":"I bought this stroller brand new 1/2 off at Marshall's (use to be a floor sample and the sun shade was broken). I contacted Peg Perego and they mailed me a replacement part for free! I have no desire to purchase another stoller. It is a bit heavy but the comfort my son is in is worth more. The basket underneath is great with a large diaper bag (except when the seat is reclined completely). The wheels maneuver easily even now that my son is 8 months old. As a carriage, I loved it! I had to be on the go early on with a newborn and the smooth ride was wonderful for my son. I came into this website in search of a lightweight stroller for my mom (babysitter); and wish she could handle the weight of this one because no one seems completely happy with their lightweight strollers. Eventually, I will purchase a lightweight for my mom but, I will continue to use this stroller for everyday use. Thanks Peg Perego!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product","review":"I bought this stroller because it seemed to be better thn the rest. The softness, 5 point harness and the fact that the arms swing back anf forth were very nice ... so I thought. However, this stroller turned out to be a nightmare! The arm bar is too low (I am only 5'5) and it was uncomfortable to push. The wheels did not turn properly ... ever ... and made for a terrible ride. It is VERY heavy and not good for the sidewalk. I purchased the so-called universal bar that would allow me to attach my Graco infant car seat but it didn't work!...

But no where was it ever mentioned the effectiveness on steps or public transportation. This stroller is in no way made for apartment living if you dont have a wheelchair ramp. I live on the first floor of a walk up building and have 2 short steps into the building then 4 steps to the first floor. Can you believe that the break gets engaged going up or down the steps and locks stroller onto step between step and footrest. I called the company and they said this stroller has to be totally lifted up and down the steps. How realistic is this? This has become the most expensive baby seat for in the house and can only be taken out when I have someone with me. I had to invest in a Mclaren Techno XT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, I Don't Love This Lug","review":"Do not consider this a \\"technical\\" review. Just from the gut. it looks great and the fabric is terrific and my son loves it...but the design just is not right. I live in NYC and I cannot steer this thing. Wheels are pretty bad. Storage is terrible. It is too cumbersome. Yes, it makes you feel like your baby is well-protected and he/she is, but other stroller do a good job too. My nanny hates it. We will continue to use it but we just got a second stroller (The Zippy by Inglesia) because this one alone does not cut it. One more time for the awful steeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stoller","review":"Very stylish. LOVE the reversible handles, for once baby isn't in car seat anymore. Easy to maneuver, great handling. Roomy, easy-to-access basket. Much lighter than many of my friend's strollers. Easy to fold and store.Three problems... no snack tray, insufficient visor length to shade baby properly, and boot net that tears when you look at it \\"funny.\\" In calling the manufacturer, two of these problems were aleviated, but not completely to my satisfaction. They'll send you new netting, but it will tear instantly too. And, they'll sell you an after market snack tray for [a decent price]+shipping, but it doesn't snap on to your stroller so it gets kicked off VERY frequently by baby (I stopped using it almost immediately)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stroller!","review":"This stroller is great. The reversible handle allows you to keep your baby out of the sun. It is so comfortable for baby. The five point harness keeps your baby safe without being too restrictive and uncomfortable. The option of having your baby lie flat is also great for when my son wants to sleep when we are walking. The attached blanket is a great feature, as my 6 month old likes to throw everything out of the stroller.Overall, this is a great stroller.

That is why I bought it. The material is snazzy too. I like the all weather muff and the way you can switch the bar to go from front to back. However, BEFORE you buy it WALK AROUND THE STORE SEVERAL TIMES. The design of this thing is lousey. You will, (unless you have a really short step) hit your shins on the bottom of this stroller. It seemed fine in the store. Maybe because I wasn't walking the way I usually do. But after I riped all the tags off and brought it to the boardwalk I realized how uncomfortable it is to walk with. I am not very tall, nor do I have exceptionally long legs. I was very unhappy. I will not use it again. I've had other people try it of various hieghts and they all agree.

First and foremost this stroller is extremely cumbersome. Opening and folding this large \\"hunk of junk\\" is impossible. Either the five point harness gets stuck upon opening thereby you are stuck with baby in hand and no easy way fold the stroller again so that you can retrieve the harness. It is difficult to manuver due to the small wheels around the city. In terms of going shopping forget it. It is too big and clunky to fit down any aisle in any department store. If you are traveling do yourself and your poor spouse a favor leave it home. Basically, I have found that this stroller is really useless.

Incredible clarity, great 3-dimensional imaging... it's hard to believe that after all these years, Sony hasn't been able to get so much musical information out of the mastertape for their previous releases of Abraxas and that MoFi just did.

The new features make the game really a lot more fun, and the ability to become an existing rookie in superstar mode is a great addition to the game, as it adds a certain aspect of real life and not just fake players.

I can see if you sold it with the chain but there is no chain. Why the price increase??? I have bought moonstone pendants larger than this for $35 dollars. The price is ridiculous!

I loved the plot turns, I was utterly surprised by the truth behind it, and I'm one of those people who always knows the plot after 5 minutes into a movie or tv show. I don't want to give anything away, but this book is intelligent, witty, sexy, and made laugh and cry, at different times. (For that matter the line, \\"From what year\\" will make me giggle whenever I hear it, just in recollection.) A few of the main chracters are living on a commune, so adult situations. There's a wide variety of character types, and an excellent portrayl of different people with different backgrounds living in a small community.Spider writes very much in the style of Heinlein's adult work, and the same cautions apply. If plain speaking or sex bothers you, don't read it. For adults, this book is a delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite, Wistful, Inspiring","review":"This book gave me hope.

Then I hit the four-way love scene and waded through it for a while. No, it really doesn't have all that much to do with the story line. And it's boring. And it's long. Maybe later it will turn out to be terribly relevant, but I haven't got the patience tonight. Maybe I'll come back to it when I'm in the mood for erotica. Maybe the actual book will pull me back later and I'll skip forward and read on. With thousands of books to choose from, right here in this room, maybe not.

In an obscure place I found the bulb with the right voltage but not the right wattage.

It casts a faint glow rather than a bright light needed for tweezing, extractions, etc. I wouldn't dream of using it to apply makeup. Use the AC adaptor or batteries, there is no difference between the two, you still need to be in an extremely well lit room it render it effective.

No, you will not get a true whirlpool for $50. And it's hard to get the jets positioned properly for anything other than your leg, but they are surprisingly strong. The two cords give you about 16ft total, so it's easy to find a place to plug it in in most bathrooms. The bubble effect works well and really gives a spa feel. The unit operated more quietly than I expected - just a humming noise.The unit was easy to install/adjust to fit my garden tub.I think this unit would be a pain if you don't have a separate tub/shower. I do, so I plan to just leave it in place for whenever I use the tub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected!!","review":"First off, the unit was bigger than i expected, and feels pretty solid for what it is, and the people here complaining that its not like a real spa are just way off base. You cant expect more for the money than this item.For $40-$50 its much better than i expected.I got mine off Ebay for $37 , and im thrilled with it. When the nozzles are positioned at water level or slightly above, it makes a LOT of water current, and really does give a feel of a whirlpool bath.Mine also came with a hand wand massager attachment, but the picture here of the 4 different nozzles on the unit is not accurate, perhaps it was taken from a pre-production model or something. Mine came with two Y connecters to split the 2 heads into 4 , which is cool.For under $50 , you cant beat the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should just get a straw and blow bubbles!","review":"Stinko!

What techniques did they use? This book seems to provide much of the answer. The authors discuss general techniques in the first two-thirds of the book, such as the use of key-word phrase, meta tags, and more advance topics like doorway pages and cloaking. In the remainder of the book, the authors take a close look at the strategies that apply to each major search engine. Understanding those techniques alone is not enough, a lot of hard work and much ingenuity are needed to perfect them. The reader must have basic HTML knowledge to understand the stuff presented.

I thought it was refreshing to see the women somewhat less focused on finding men and more intensely exploring their single selves. Instead of seeing the series as flat and dull, as so many seem to, I feel like it's really growing up and coming into its own. Miranda's new motherhood is fascinating to me (granted, I'm pregnant with my first child,) and seeing Samantha actually embarrassed by one of her indiscretions gives me a new respect for her character. Actually BEING ALONE is an important part of being single, and I'm glad the writers, producers, or whomever, chose to include some focus on that part of the women's lives.Yes, the season was abbreviated, which is indeed disappointing, but if that's problem for you, either rent it or buy it at Target. I only paid $29.99 there."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPED OFF!!!!!","review":"I FEEL COMPLETELY RIPPED OFF!!!!Only eight episodes for the price of a full season, What a bargain.If you buy this season beware your only getting eight episodes.

The season ends on a high note with Samantha single again, Charlotte in love, Miranda coping & Carrie finding a prospective new love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extortion City","review":"Die-hard Sex and the City fans should be too sophisticated to succumb to this ridiculous price point for what cannot even be defined as a full season. I, like many of the viewers who have posted their own comments, am a completist, but rather than round out my collection of the previous four seasons with this so-called fifth one, due to the unfortunate manner in which HBO is trying to commit highway (or should I say Fifth Avenue) robbery here I am furious enough to consider auctioning off what DVDs I've already purchased. HBO should be ashamed. This really brings new meaning to the phrase (Home) Box Office Poision!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jipped in the City","review":"I have to agree with most of the reviews. I have seasons 1-4. The 5th season is only 8 sub-par episodes. You know they could have done better ... the sixth season is awesome. I love these girls ... but I have to agree ... the price is too high for what you get. I will probably skip it and wait for the final season to come out and buy it. Maybe season 5 will come down and I'll add it to my collection later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here here","review":"I have this season on VHS, taped off HBO when it aired. That may very well be where it will stay unless I find this cheaper. This season had some good moments such as, the trip to CA and the meeting with Big, the conversion to Judaism, and the baby, but the price is outrageous compared to what you're getting in the other seasons. Yes, price is also what we are reviewing. Not just content. Maybe if they had added some 'behind the scenes' or outtakes or something like that, maybe it would be more enticing, but there doesn't seem to be any such thing on this DVD.If this show doesn't end the way everyone is hoping and expecting, season 6 may also be a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Season Ever...Here's Why...","review":"Yes, this is the worse of the seasons on DVD so far -- primarily due to the lack of good writing, attempted (but failed) character growth, and the deeply curtailed number of episodes (count them, eight). Now I LOVE Samantha's character's quick-witted sayings: \\"Vagina weights?\\" Sam: \\"Honey, my vagina waits for no man.\\" It's obvious that Season 5 really strives to be funny, but falls short; jocular arguments with Charlotte over the \\"f\\" word just aren't funny. I admit the characters have gone through a lot of growth: a baby, broken engagement, Sam's love, broken marriage. But dammit, lame themes and horrible dialog screw up good episodes! Don't pay more than $... unless you're a dedicated fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Product Has Many Sides","review":"Reviewing a DVD means reviewing all of its product details: the quality, the content, the PRICE included. With \\"price\\" mentioned, let me just say that this is one expensive DVD set for what you're getting. Had the fifth season been 18 episodes like all of its predecessing seasons, then dropping 50 dollars for this package would be as simple as before. But you can count 'em right here: 8 episodes. Logically, you would expect that since we barely got 1/2 of a regular season we should only pay for about 1/2 of the regular season DVD price but apparently, that's not how the tides turned. Understandably, capitalistic interests got in the way of this negotiation but c'mon, the fifth season wasn't even that good to begin with! To SATC fans looking to purchase this DVD, don't think I am trying to discourage your buy (it's your money!) but just remember to weigh in all the details of a product; particularly the price of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse season so far","review":"This season is not only short (8 episodes) but also it is quite boring. I love Sarah's character, but in this season is much exaggerated than ever, it seems very desperate, not cool at all, and lacking of the sense of enjoying her life. No wonder why is she single?. Any way if you have seen the previous 4 seasons you have to buy it anyway, but keep in mind that it is not close to be as good as the other ones"},{"rating":"1","title":"An HBO Cash Cow","review":"HBO has found a cash cow with these girls, which I think is why it released this pathetic attempt at a season for the same price as a regular length season. These scant 8 episodes are not engrossing and the writing is rather poor. The full bodied wit and the quality of the first four seasons is conspicuously absent here. I don't know if the writers are burned out or what, but each of these episodes is just, well, \\"off\\" for some reason. Overall, this box set (if you can even call it that) is not a good value, even if you are a fan of the series (which I am)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit your b!+c#!ng","review":"The discs are too expensive, boo hoo, wah wah! Get over it. I agree that the HBO folks SHOULD have lowered the price to make up for the fact that it was a truncated season, but the fact is that they DIDN'T. The product description clearly tells you that you're getting eight episodes. If you don't want to spend the money for eight episodes, then don't. Nobody's holding a gun to your heads. A true fan will savor every moment of the show and wouldn't think of holding it against the Fab Four that the people who produce the DVD's of their show are overcharging us. I wouldn't miss a single episode because of a few dollars. Check out Daniel Sunjata's appearance in the first episode of the season, \\"Anchors Away\\", which was his introduction to many of his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"CraPpY Price, GREAT season!","review":"DVD Price aside, this short season was just as entertaining as the prior four. The Girls still have the same chemestry as they did before, and WHO IN THIS WORLD can not recognize the fabulous scene when Samantha dresses in that *wig* and glasses to catch Richard cheating!!!???? Amazing. Not to mention the laughable and hilarious pillow-case-dress SJP was wearing at the wedding in the last episode! I enjoyed every episode of this season. As with every episode of SITC, when one storyline fails another brilliant one rises up to take its place. And for those of you contemplating this purchase, remember that when you're reading the reviews on here, you've got to find objectivity and separate the poor reviews of the price of the DVD's versus the reviews of the season itself. I would recommend this season in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"5th Season","review":"If the 5th season was any good, then the cost would not matter. This show (seasons 1-4,6) always made me feel better, especially when having relationship confusion. But this season was depressing every week. I would avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"so cynical!","review":"I think that the 5th season was very well done. Ok, so there wasn't as much sex, oh no! I was disapointed that there were only two discs, but they were very well done. The episodes were not always easy to watch, but they were very realistic and well done. Major props to HBO as always."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way!","review":"I am resisting the urge to add this DVD to my SATC seasons 1 through 4. While I do want to own every episode of this, one of my favorite shows, I cannot justify paying that much for only eight (sub-par) episodes. HBO is taking advantage of their loyal fans and it makes me wish I had never bought anything from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manolos are better priced!","review":"I'm a fan of this series, and I have the DVDs of all previous seaons. Yet I cannot fathom why Season 5, with so few episodes, is priced as much as the longer seasons. And I thought the price of Manolo Blahniks was inflated...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Pathetic!!!","review":"OMG, what a waste of time. This season was so terrible. The first time I saw SATC I thought that those women were so inspiring and free, I felt in love with all of them, too bad I can't say the same thing about this season. Carried looked older and tired and I didn't like the fact that they tried to hide her big belly, it looked obvious and ridiculous (couldnt' they wait for her to give birth?). Her jokes were not at all funny and they were kind of force. Samantha was disgusting, gosh... what a repulsive pathetic woman. The other two were kind of the same, thank God!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Expensive","review":"I love the show but season five was not worth the forty dollars I paid for it.

I saw only 2 dics and thought there must be another one somewhere! How disappointing!! You would think that they would at least charge less for this DVD than all the others, considering there is less on it. With only 8 episodes to watch, I feel very shorted. This season just didn't do it for me, how long till season 6??!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic SATC!","review":"The curl-up-in-your-bed for a girls'night classic strikes again with season 5. Classic SATC gang in comedic and entertaining situations.Gotta love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be worth a rental?","review":"I absolutely love \\"Sex and the City\\", but 8 mediocre episodes for over $30 is a crime. I admit that i was very excited to watch season 5 as I had been watching all of the episodes on DVD only. However, the fact that season 5 is only 8 episodes, still costs $32, and just didn't have the same freshness and unique feel as the first four seasons was a major disappointment. Something is just missing all around here. If you are worried about missing something, rent it, otherwise, wait for season 6."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't understand the pricing!!","review":"I've bought all of the other seasons, and although I did love season 5 (even though it was so short), I REFUSE to pay the same price for 8 episodes as I did for 18. It just doesn't make sense. I saw one store where season 4 was actually CHEAPER than season 5. The logic bewilders me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Scam","review":"This is a joke. I still do not understand why HBO didn't combine season 5 with season 4 and have it be a 4 disc collection. To charge $30 + for this abbreviated season is a complete scam. I think I will wait until they release the box set to get season 5 on DVD - I recorded it and can watch the video if I feel I need to see these forgettable episodes again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too am mad...","review":"Only 8 episodes??

If you have seasons 1-4 already and you can get this one for LESS than half price (used), consider adding it to the mix ONLY if you're a HUGE Charlotte fan and a complete SATC fanatic. Otherwise, wait until season 6 and don't feel bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total garbage... in comparison with the previous 4 seasons","review":"SATC went downhill after the fourth season.

That aside very good show highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give them some credit","review":"I know that the 5th season was definitely not great. But you have to remember that both Sarah and Cynthia were pregnant and there were probably not that many normal story lines they could do. However, I feel that Charlette's character really grows in this season as well as Samantha's. I am a huge fan of Sex and the City and not every show is going to be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame","review":"Reading all the other reviews I have decided not to buy season 5 even though I bought all other 4 seasons. I haven't seen this (5th) series but I think I can live without these 8 episodes. If the price would have been fair, I still might have considered buying it. It's a shame HBO is only trying to get as much money out of it as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"SATC is the best series ever","review":"And my boyfriend is buying this DVD for me as soon as it comes out, though I will tell him to buy it online where the price is cheaper. First of all, one person said that the other seasons were entitled to be priced so high because they all had 18 episodes -- but that person clearly has no idea what they're talking about because the first season, priced exactly the same as the rest, had 12 episodes, but no one complained then. If you love the series, and were willing to pay for season one, then there is no reason not to buy season five. Soon SATC will be over forever, and you will have all your favorite episodes to look back on... and with characters who grow and change from season to season, how can you skip one? It doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex in the City-5th Season","review":"Wonderful dvd to stay with the storyline.

I own the first four seasons and watch them all the time! But when I found out the the fifth season only had 8 episodes and cost the same amount as all the others... I was shocked! There is no way I would ever pay that much for such a small amount of episodes. I'm patiently waiting for the price to go down to at least [$] if it doesn't get lowered, I won't buy it, which makes me so sad. :( But I still love the show!!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Season cut short","review":"Since season 5 was cut short due to Sarah Jessica Parker's pregancy, I think they should combine season 5 and 6 for one price instead of charging the same thing for only 8 episodes.

No Way....better off to wait and buy it used. I knew that this season would be less volume wise, but I also thought the the price would reflect that as well.

I have the first 4 seasons and wanted this one to complete my set, but I think that I will pass for now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For this price you must be kidding!","review":"Not a great season although I loved this show, I can't believe they would even charge this much for a DVD with 8 episodes (maybe one disc) as they would for the three disc sets of the past seasons... they need to rethink this or wait for the release and add it to six, dont waste the money on this one.. not for that price... and I have them all, this is the first one I do mind paying for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sex and the City for HBO...","review":"Being a huge Sex and the City fan, I've decided not to pay into HBO's greed and buy the 5th. season on DVD. It's only 8 episodes long and double disc...why are we being charged full price? Why couldn't they put in an extra disc of extras or bloopers? Frankly, it's not worth the $33. I think I've had too much Sex and the City this time around...bye girls!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HBO Is Disappointing","review":"No doubt that the DVDs of this series is the most sought after. But HBO is just too much! Pricing $32 for 8 miserable episodes! If you want to fight piracy, you should respect people who buy original copies by pricing the DVDs reasonably! The most I'd pay for 8 episodes would be $15! And you know what? A lot of people turned to the pirated copies because of the arrogant people such as those in HBO demanded an unreasonable price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD stinks...","review":"I hope Sarah Jessica Parker is happy with herself...She just screwed her fans with this DVD...I paid 40 bucks for 8 episodes...What a ripoff...Money-grubbing-Wh*re..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Confused Here","review":"Most of you are moaning about the number of episodes in the season and the price, which I can understand, but I think you all are smoking crack when you say that this is the low point of the series!This season, despite being only a few episodes, was FAR SUPERIOR to 4 and a lot of 3. Especially 4, which was not GOOD. It was drama and bad writing--not Sex and the City worthy stuff. Season 5 was all about the GIRLS...which is what this show has always been about.

Yes, it's only 8 episodes, but that's basically what I am paying HBO right now every month to watch 4 episodes, considering you get 4 episodes a month, so just think of it that you are getting 4 episodes for free!! Makes me feel better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This show went from good to bad","review":"People are a little too emotional about this show. The first few seasons were pretty good. The characters have become tired, the dialogue repititious and the story lines predictable. It is not a matter of how much this DVD costs, or how many shows you are getting. Put away your accounting visors. It is about a show that was a fresh idea with ground breaking dialogue that became tired, dull and common. Do not buy this DVD. It says much about our culture that we continue to watch and support shows like this long after they become tired. We are conditioned by what we think is cool. This show has become so far from cool, it is the Sally Struthers of HBO series. If you are into HBO and \\"ground breaking\\" comedy, pre-order Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm. A guy that shouldn't be cool, a total nebbish, will become the coolest cat you know."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF","review":"Only 8 episodes for $32.49 - WHAT A RIP-OFF.

I bought the DVD today and after reading all these reviews I was expecting these 8 episodes to be absolutely horrible. And you know what, they aren't. They may not be the cream of the crop, and they certainly aren't the best to come out of this show, but they are still entertaining, and that's what this show it all about. It's not a life changing show with deep views and moving topics, but it's something to relax and just laugh with, and at. These are not the best epsiodes, but they are still enjoyable. I'm glad I spent my hard earned, whopping 35 dollars on it (gasp, 35 dollars-oh my! oh my!) and I plan to invest in the next season when it comes out, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.","review":"I own all four of the previous seasons, all of which I purchased for $30 or LESS, but as much as I love the show I won't be buying this season at retail.

Then, for the final Season 6, the corporate money-grubbers split it up into two overpriced \\"parts,\\" probably because they realized that that particular cash-cow was now coming to an end and they'd best milk it for all it's worth.

But when it all comes down to it, I really love the show. To complete the collection....I guess Im just gonna have to buy it. Im gonna be so sad when it ends, and I want to be able to look back on the seasons and watch them in their entirety.

As a fan, though, I am sorely disappointed that a half-season has been priced so high. I'm expecting Season 6, when it does appear, to accommodate the loss that this release will incur, so their combined prices will complete the insult to collectors worldwide. No thanks, I'm waiting for the next season.

I was eagerly anticipating this one and WOW, what a disappointment. First, it was so apparent that Sarah Jessica Parker was pregnant and it made all the sex-related scenes seem totally unbelievable. Also unbelievable were the huge tent-like outfits she wore that were supposed to stylish. This season made me feel sorry for the characters on the show because they are portrayed as dried out old scags. It wasn't nearly as funny or entertaining as the other four seasons.

How dare HBO charge the consumer the identical price of seasons 1-4. The DVD only contains 8 lousy episodes. I refuse to pay full price for half the product. It's cases like this that I say the He** with the industry crying over piracy. First they sat around doing NOTHING to be proactive about stopping piracy before it got out of control as it did. Then instead of looking at their own inactions they started to sue teenagers as a fright tactic. This DVD represents the reason why people were stealing the product. They've been raping both the consumer and artist for many years now with insanely inflated prices and pennies on the dollar for the artist. I say they got exactly what they deserved no sympathy here.

My daughter enjoys pulling out the play credit cards, putting them back in the wallet; pulling out the coins and playing with them and putting them back in the wallet.

However, realizing that David Liebman was very devoted to exploring and mastering the soprano saxophone, that alone a difficult and noble effort considering the unforgiving nature of sopranos, I purchased West Side Story Today. I expected advanced technical skill ,but that was just the beginning. This is an artistic achievement. What Mr. Liebman does here is to redefine the soprano and Bernstein's beautiful music in a single majestic effort. Before David Liebman the leading exponents of the soprano saxophone were Sidney Bechet and John Coltrane in my opinion. Now it's time to add David Liebman to this very special club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fire your masseuse","review":"Consumer opinions will vary on an item such as this, but you should know the following before ordering:1. The \\"massage\\" comes from 2 buzzing vibrators implanted in the pad, each the size of a thick silver dollar. You're definitely conscious of these 2 isolated points and of trying to position at least one of them next to the body area to be treated.2. The power supply is fairly massive and heavy. No doubt it will cover up 3 outlets on your wall plate or power strip.3. The pad, like others I've tried, doesn't get very warm, thanks to a built-in safety regulator.4. The velcro straps might be useful if you're able to wear the pad; otherwise, they quickly get in the way. Also, the detachable electrical cord has a tendency to detach itself.5. The price is about half that of a single massage administered by a professional. Is it worth it? I'm beginning to think maybe not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor massager, poor value, returning it","review":"The massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone.

With respect to the heat(ing), it does perform better, but is by no means stellar.The Pro's are its design for moisture, a better-than-average fabric/material - which holds its shape fairly well and the auto shut-off.The Con's include, as others have said, a HUGE AC-DC plug/power pack, no apparent ability to WASH the darn thing, only modest heat, annoying Velcro straps, a two-part power cord that not only must be taped to keep together, but can't be removed from the main pad for washing AND, perhaps most significantly, the fact that mine died after approx. 18 months (which, incidentally, raises yet another detractor; the Warranty is only a year, much less than many other brands)."},{"rating":"1","title":"conair massaging heatingpad","review":"Conair Massaging Heating PadUnfortunately the pad does not work and will be returned on January 22."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly thumbs down for Conair Massaging Heating Pad","review":"I bought this product for the massaging properties in conjuction with the heat.

This is a set that is so much more than just \\"background music\\". It begs to be listened to, and just gets more and more enjoyable the more you listen. And with three previously unissued tracks plus eleven tracks that have never before been issued in their entirety make this a necessity for Monkophiles.

QUESTION: What if the restored material (largely the bass and drum solos) turned out to be uninspired and mediocre? ANSWER: You now have two CD-lengths of mediocre bass and drum solos...Furthermore, I feel that both Rouse and Monk weren't really 'on' those nights, either: Rouse's solos were often interrupted by Monk's intrusions, and Monk's solos sounded unusually mechanical and derivative.

The game also doesnt take 5 hours to finish , it goes by pretty fast! The only bad part of this game is that you need a person with you (not playing the game that is) to see who put the right card down first!

If you are a Santana fan, this is a MUST!!! Self-produced, the Santana Band harnessed emotional elements of many musical sources. The recording is dated but the content is timeless. Neal Schon definitely shines and brings new life to a nucleus that was at it's peak. From 'Batuka' to 'Para Los Rumberos', this material showcases hybrid music at it's best. Uniquely Santana! Outstanding performances on 'Taboo', 'Toussaint L'Overture' and 'Guajira' make this a monumental classic. The live tracks (on the re-release) are just gravy. And, YES! that means it is a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot! Hot! Hot!","review":"A prime example of Santana's sizzling latino rock, this offering comes from the guitarist's earliest and definitive line-up. The album contains many notable classics, and the entire record is on par with their previous two - Santana and Abraxas. Just listen to \\"Everybody's Everything\\" for pure energy and fire - this music is what life is all about! \\"Jungle Strut\\" also rocks your sox off, and is nicely complemented by other more subdued and heartfelt tracks like \\"Taboo\\". \\"Toussaint L'Overture\\" is a tour-de-force, and stands to remind you what a showman/bandleader the brilliant Carlos Santana was and still is today. If cubano jazz-rock is your thing, make sure you don't miss out on this one - it's still hot as ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"end of an era for Santana","review":"A must have for Santana fans.Batuka - getting funky here. The 70's are starting to creep in.As a latin-rock instrumental it does the job.No One To Depend on - filler, with some fine jamming.Taboo - love this song.T L - Too much organ for my taste. Not as good as above.Everybody's Everything - not a fave, but still rocking.Guajira - one of my faves. I have another version on which the singer's voice is more upfront.Jungle Strut - another one of my faves.Everythings... - filler. didnt care for it.Para... - sung in Spanish. A rocking latin-rock song.After 3 latin-rock albums I can see why Carlos Santana wanted to moveinto another phase, and (supposedly) expand his musical horizons(with mixed results)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding heavy latin rock","review":"If you really want to hear a master guitar player who defined a style in top form this is the album to buy. His gripping and powerful (\\"weepingly melodic\\") style is both exciting and beautiful at the same time. Neal Schon is not half bad either. Taboo is positively thrilling as is the incredible interplay between the two guitar players on Toussaint L'Overture. The band are superb too and the wonderful latin rhythyms are a joy to listen too. This is my favorite Santana album (beating out Abraxus). Any fan of great guitar needs this album. For those who yearn a quieter more middle of the road Santana, then this may be all too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Book!","review":"Don't buy this book!

It's a common ploy among child predators to ask a child if they would like to see puppies.Maybe I sound overly cautious, but I don't want my small child learning that it's appropriate for a stranger to ask them to look at puppies.

His vocals are crystal clear and the whole recording is squeeky clean. He does my favourite vocal on 'Misty' included here. Very few singers can do justice to 'Stardust' because it's a very difficult piece to sing however Johnny makes the song his own. His hits are mostly included in this set.

Anyway, after searching the net high and low for an alternative (no boomboxes) for about two weeks, I ran into this little jewel for only $30! Couldn't believe it! Happy, happy, joy, joy.

I came very close to dropping the $150 for the Tivoli, but happened to be at Target later in the day. I have a feeling the Tivoli has a slightly better tuner/antenae, but I'm able to pick up my 6 favorites am and fm stations. Also the ability to output mp3's to the device is great! For $20, you can barely buy cheap pc speakers. This is much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the bargain I hoped it would be","review":"The Good:This thing actually does sound pretty respectable. It has a pretty powerful amplifier for a table radio, and for a radio in this price range, the sound is definitely satisfactory.The Bad:The NR31 has a poor quality, non-removable FM wire antenna. External FM or AM antennas cannot be used. FM reception is predictably poor. There is an auxiliary input, but there is no selector for it; your CD player, MP3 player, or other device will be active whenever it is plugged in. Furthermore, FM radio is audible when the aux input is in use.The Ugly:The FM/AM selector is defective. It stopped working on my unit within days. It is now impossible to listen to AM radio on my NR31, and other NR31 owners have had the same problem.I would recommend this radio to almost no one, regardless of the price. It might be worth considering if you don't do any AM listening, but many more expensive tabletop radios are ultimately a better value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Half the Price!","review":"My wife's tiny armband jogging radio has better FM reception than this thing. It was unable to receive/differentiate signals from fairly strong FM transmitters located less than ten miles line-of-sight distance. Those that were received had a fair amount of static and signal overlap. AM reception was just okay. Several locations and orientations of the radio and its single-wire FM antenna were tried with the same results. The antenna is hardwired so there's no provision for adding a decent aftermarket antenna which might help a little. Make no mistake, this is an incredibly cheap product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emerson Simplicity am/fm with companion speaker","review":"I made an error in buying this item and I immediately returned it.

Do these fundamentalist really believe that they have no responsibility for their own lives, that's it's all in God's hands?Beyond the overdone religious overtones, it's a very poorly written book. It has the worse formatting of any Kindle book I've ever read. Although a few formatting issues don't bother me, they exist on almost every page - type style changes randomly and for no discernible reason. This is truly just an awful book and either all the rave reviews are written by similarly misguided fundamentalist and will give any book that mentions God and Jesus Christ five stars, or the author has enough friends that are Amazon members to get those five star ratings.Even though it is free, don't waste your precious time even trying to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"If possible would have given more than five stars - I am a patriotic American, and thought this story excellent.

The most horrifying part of this book is how the author justifies his \\"Shoot 'em all and let God sort it out\\" message by blasphemously couching it in a pseudo 'Christian' story set against the backdrop of 9/11.The basic gist I got from Skip's Coryell's story is that it's okay to blow people to kingdom come if you profess to 'love your enemy'.Oh, and there's a nifty little love story thrown in there too for good measure.I tried to see this book through to the end, but just couldn't do it. The only saving grace is that it was a free download; however I wasted several hours of my life slogging through it. My bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful.","review":"It seemed an interesting plot but I only made it through the first few chapters before I couldn't read any more.

I did not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my valuable reading time.","review":"The underlying premise of this story had potential, but this was a very poorly written book. This felt like a first draft of a manuscript or an outline for a made-for-tv movie. The dialogue of the characters was a quirky stream of consciousness. You were subjected to the internal thoughts of the characters in place of true character development, and their thoughts were immature and boring. The book moved very slowly. Even when this book was going nowhere, I wanted to give it a chance so I didn't stop reading, hoping that it would redeem itself - it didn't. It is a travisty to give this book 4 stars, let alone 5. I highly value my reading time, and this was truly a waste. I wish I had spent my time on almost anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary!","review":"I would like to get it off my e-reader!! It is violent and full of hate propaganda. I can't believe those who profess to be Christian believe such ideas in such contrast to the love that Jesus came to bring. Free was not free! It left a really bad feeling in me, almost dirty for having believed that something would come out right and it just got worse.

The C++ STL book does not cover these topics until chapter 10, where this book covered them at chapter 3.

I don't know. I just expected the movie to be better and for the life of me can't figure out why it won awards. Maybe the films in 1950 were all poor quality and this was the best one. Or perhaps, it was because of Bette Davis. I know the reviews here are high, but I expected more and the fact that Ann Baxter was so wrong for playing Eve made it the disappointment it was for me.

I saw the new version of \\"Sunset Blvd.\\" just after seeing this film, and though \\"Eve\\" was made the same year, it looks far cleaner and crisper than \\"Sunset\\" does.

Sometimes with the old movies I get bored now and can't seem to sit through them. Not this one. It is very much a movie that transcends time. Isn't this the movie that they tried to make with Showgirls that bombed? Or any competition movie? Sad to see back in the days we think of being simple and moral that there were back stabbers undermining people who help them. But human nature. Anyway Bette Davis's character was sharp. Loved it. And who would have thought Marilyn Monroe would have showed up too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Davis Shines","review":"This is Bette Davis in top form, glamorous, somewhat vixenish, somewhat a victim, everything needed for a great performance.

Margo(Davis)also thinks Eve is trying to \\"steal\\" her longtime director boyfriend, Bill Sampson. And when she starts getting that notion get ready for the fireworks to fly!(Or in Margo's own words \\"Fasten your seatbelts, ...it's going to be a bumpy night!\\") But, when Margo finally realizes she's too old for twenty year-old parts(she's forty years old)Eve learns that essential life lesson:\\"What goes around comes around\\")This is a gem of a movie that I highly recommend if you like Bette Davis, stage acting, or just great, classic films!"},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch","review":"This is a can,t go wrong movie.

Anne Baxter plays Eve Harrington, a young fan who worms her way into Channing's life, playing the role as a devotee extraordinaire. (Marilyn Monroe also briefly appears, pursuing drinks and powerful men.) Slowly Eve becomes more important to Channing, eventually becoming her understudy, then a notable on her own merits when Channing misses a performance. Eventually Eve reaches prominence, and then has the tables turned on her - by another new fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Backstage Movie!","review":"The film is a masterpiece! Its perfect cast (with special praise to Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, Celeste Holme, and Thelma Ritter) works as a skillful ensemble, ensnared in Eve Harrington's devious fight for Broadway stardom. The dialogue is sharp and witty, the repartee worthy of Noel Coward. The film is wry and sparkling, funny and biting, a total gem.The DVD transfer is a particularly spectacular and fresh, limpid black and white and wonderful grays. Though the packaging does not indicate that this is a fresh restoration, you just couldn't hope for much better--especially on a 50-year-old film. Once again this film proves that the DVD medium is at its most spectacular with the best of black and white films.Here too is a chance to see a youthful Marilyn Monroe deliver a consumate portrayal of the blond bombshell, clawing for an acting position."},{"rating":"2","title":"All About Eve","review":"Sporting one of the wittiest, most sophisticated scripts ever created for the cinema, writer-director Joseph L. Mankiewicz's elegantly cynical portrait of life in \\"the thea-ta\\" is fully realized through a career performance by Bette Davis, who, in her return to the screen after being blacklisted by studio heads for tussling over actors' rights to choose their own material, imbues aging Broadway star Margo Channing with an amazing juxtaposition of strength and vulnerability. And there isn't a slouch among the supporting cast, which includes Thelma Ritter as Davis' quick-with-a-quip sidekick, Anne Baxter as an adoring fan, George Sanders as viperish columnist Addison deWitt, Celeste Holm as \\"just a playwright's wife,\\" Gary Merrill as Davis' director and lover, and a young Marilyn Monroe picture-perfect as \\"a graduate of the Copacabana School of Dramatic Art.\\" If you haven't seen it, you must.

(Both hands)","review":"With no pretense of objectivity here, I want to say I loved this CD. Not for the faint of heart. You may want to get a medical checkup before playing this one. My two favorite cuts are \\"Tippin' Home from Sunday School\\" and \\"Hymn to Freedom.\\" The music made my day, lifted my spirits, and had me dancing around the living room.I didn't entirely agree with the liner notes. There's more than a little Oscar Peterson influence here, but Oliver has more \\"down home\\" gospel feeling, without compromising the \\"in your face\\" confidence in his playing. Ed Thigpen delivers a solid, take no prisoners performance that swings like crazy. The bass player, Steve Wallace, knows how to walk his bass with a buoyant, 12/8 resonance that is reminiscent of that other Peterson alumnus, Ray Brown. The group is tight.The other selections are varied in tempo and rhythmic style and uniformly well-performed. What else can I say?

If you're a new Santana fan do yourself a favour and just buy some of the original albums these tracks are from, in fact most of these tracks are on the 1995 box set called \\"Dance of the Rainbow Serpent\\", so spend a few more bucks and get that, then you'll only need about three or four other cd's to get the rest of the tracks from their original albums, all of which have better sound than this best of cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superior upgrade to Santana's Greatest Hits","review":"It is very hard to condense all of Santana's well known songs to one disc. True \\"You Know That I Love You\\" and \\"Stormy,\\" as well as \\"Well..Alright\\" are missing, and the album Caravanserai seems to always get the shaft. But this does give one most of the best known songs in their full-length versions.Outstanding is the sequencing: the elusive (elusive to greatest hits) \\"Nobody to Depend On\\" has a hard edit into \\"Open Invitation.\\"This features \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Winning\\" which have never appeared on any Santana anthology in the States. The booklet has superior remastering, and a booklet with a family tree.The import Santana Collection covers more ground, more thoroughly, and hits all the albums including Caravanserai, but just misses by giving the import consumer liner notes in Dutch!!If you want one CD of great Santana music.

What a mistake! Yes, this CD has great selections from their early years, but once you hit the late 70s and into the 80s, it's a train wreck of cheesy guitar riffs and pop lyrics.

This album is a throwback to the time when experimentation was encouraged in music, where you didn't have to sound like everybody else. This is something that's sadly lacking in our music industry today. If someone put out an album with music like this on it it'd probably never even get published.

These songs were popular in my hey day. And, BW in Plano, the sound quality wasn't as good as Supernatural for the simple reason that the technology was not there when these were recorded.When I first heard Smooth and somebody told me it was Santana, I didn't believe them. But when I heard that distinct guitar sound in the instrumental portion, I had to admit it was the same distinct sound I hear on some of these tunes. The vocals on some of these share the same passion as the vocals on some of his new stuff, but this is Santana Early Years on this \\"Best of\\" collection.This guy is one of the first Hispanic music stars. The passion is there. The Latin influence is prevalent on this CD.Santana is like a fine wine...he just continues to get better with ago. He's been around for a long time.

I have nice time chat with my family and friends via it. Then, it's very easy to install. No useless and complicated software which Creative usually does. Moreover, it's save the desk space.

He was developed beautifully and promised to be quite a sensitive soul. With Claire however; he was bullish. I didn't like him so much anymore. Sure; Claire was easy to run over and very timid. She let herself be used by him. In his mind Max felt he separated business from personal when in reality he deceived Claire and used sex as the weapon. Max is a very complex and sexy man; that is for sure. Claire was just so beaten down by her insecurities that she couldn't withstand a man of such force and passion. I loved the book. Very entertaining and well written. It's a keeper and I'll read it again! Thank you Linda Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not up to Linda Howard's recent quality.","review":"I love Linda Howard's books, especially After The Night and Dream Man, but this one is not as good as her other books. Granted it's good enough for a pasttime reading, but if you really mean to enjoy Linda Howard's you'll be disappointed. I wonder why LH made Claire so weak and dependent to Max. What ever happen to the strong female character? Is Claire supposed to be happy with Max rearranging her life to his mean without having her say over the matter? To me, Max Conroy is too dominant and Claire is too meek and agreeable, there is not enough give and take in this love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standard","review":"I've read all of Linda Howard's books, and usually enjoy them very much. This is one of her earlier efforts and she certainly has improved. The thing that bothered me most about this book is why Clair, who seems like a relatively smart person, if a bit insecure, would trust or take back a man who screwed her over so completely. Beside tha plot points, Howard's dialogue is much better now, and she seems to be writing stonger female characters, which I personally prefer. Not a bad book, but see if you can get it from the library before you spend the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff and uncomfortable","review":"There are sections of \\"Almost Forever\\" that show Howard developing her ability to get inside her characters, to convey passion and deep emotion with believable urgency. Unfortunately, there are also very uncomfortable sections that show her later adoption of unpleasant themes (which sadly define her work today): an abusive alpha man, a woman who we are told is internally strong but who behaves in passive and utterly unbelievable ways. Claire is betrayed by Max emotionally and professionally and yet this woman leaves her home to follow him across the state, allowing him back into her life without a whimper. Max, on the other hand, bullies and pushes, lacking sensitivity or subtlety, yet is supposed to be irresistable.This book, written early in her career, is worth reading but not worth spending money on. Wait for the library copy, or pick it up second hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it! Great story!","review":"The author had interesting plot and characters that were refreshing. I did not predict some of the details that would happen. This book was very enjoyable, creative and different from the typical romance novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it. I don't want to give anything away because it is more fun to read without knowing what will happen. But I will provide the beginning of the plot, which is included on the back cover of the book. The setting is current day corporate world in Houston and Dallas, Texas. Max works for company \\"A\\" that plans to do a corporate takeover of company \\"B\\".

I couldn't believe that the main character Max would treat Claire with such little respect when he uses her to get information about a company! and then he expects her to just forget about that like it isn't important at all, when he knows that she doesn't open up to people easily. There was very little chemistry between the two characters also. They shared no romance or affection and then out of nowhere their is a steamy sex scene (which, in true Linda Howard form was very well written!). The sex scenes were great but other than that, their really isn't about this book that I would recommend.If you are truly a Linda Howard fan, their are many amazing books she has written that I recommend, Some of my favorites include:1.

It was filled, as I recall, with all that controlling stuff that once passed for a marker of love but now is clearly on the continuum with abuse. Of course, nothing is as bad as Howard's An Independent Wife (and whose joke was that, I'd like to know?), but this falls in the same class.

Scull, who have edited some other nice recent Tolkien books, including \\"JRR Tolkien Artist and Illustrator\\" and \\"Roverandom\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The inner workings of genius!","review":"Anyone who loves the creative spirit will draw inspiration from hearing J.R.R Tolkien relate, in his own words, the incredible journey of the spirit that gave birth to his awesome works. Also some fine advice, imparted from father to sons, on the subjects of war, loss, courage, faith, romantic love and relations between the sexes."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE!","review":"I thought this was a book about the invented alphabets of Tolkien's Middle Earth but it's NOT! It's a boring book of correspondence. Apart from the few letters where he talks a little about his invented runes and languages this is a WASTE if you are looking for more info on his runes, alphabets and calligraphy! So: BE WARNED!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a must but for any fan of Tolkien. This book is both excellent and insightful. It has many different types of letters, whether it is a letter of advice to his son, answering a question of a fan, etc. It also has a handy index in the back. I have greatly enjoyed perusing through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"I believe that no set of books is complete without this plainly marvelous book.If you are going to read other books written by him,or have read them,why not get to know more about this marvelous writer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable","review":"Chugging through this book over the last few months has been a wonderful experience for me. What better way to get right inside the mind of Tolkien himself than through these fascinating letters? They make me feel as though I'm right there alongside him in his world; in the academia, the family life, and the inner workings of the brilliant mind that created (or simply \\"discovered,\\" as he would put it, Middle-Earth). As an intimate composite sketch giving insights into all these areas, this book is absolutely indispensable for the hard-core Tolkien fan, even more so than the Humphrey Carpenter-penned Tolkien Biography. But those two volumes hand-in-hand are a delightful companion to anyone who, like me, is enraptured by _The Lord of the Rings_ and has an interest in the man who brought it into being.Can you _not wait_ until Christmas when the FOTR movie comes out??! Man alive, that's gonna be terrific..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I LOVE Tolkien and these letters are just so interesting!

A couple of years ago I went with something more similar in style to these ECCO Berlins. After a couple of years with these shoes I wanted something similar and a little more comfortable. Also I work and travel in a lot of places with rainy or snowy weather so I did a search for shoes with Gore-Tex lining. I came across the ECCO Berlins and decided to take a chance on them. I wear a 7.5D in most shoes. The ECCO comes in 7-7.5. I was worried that they might be a little too small. However when I opened the box the shoes seemed too big. When I put them on they were just right. They are extremely light and feel very nice on my feet. I've already covered quite a bit of ground in them and have had absolutely no issues. These ECCO Berlins might be the most comfortable shoes that I have ever worn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't have storing area for attachments","review":"That is another thing that is not good about this one. it has like 4 attachments, plus feet inserts that do not have any where to be stored in the unit.

The Dr. Scholl's one has a compartment for those attachments as well. I am telling you, that one is better in all ways!

Conair makes it sound like heaven! Not even close. The heat mechanism doesn't keep the water warm, it is LOUD (I have to turn the TV up insanely loud just to hear it). Now I didn't expect it to be super quiet, but I did expect to be able to hear the TV at a normal level. After only a few uses, the jets stopped working. The vibration and bubbles are great and still work fine (vibrating and bubbling lukewarm water), but that's about it. The little \\"hanger\\" thing they expect you to store your pedicure attachments on is a JOKE. It kept falling off so I just threw it away after about a week of driving myself crazy with it. And because of that, I have now lost all the attachments that came with it. This unit is terribly over priced. I don't even use it anymore.

I've had it for about 5 months and the skipping keeps getting worse and worse. It also has recently started to stop playing for a few seconds then kicking back in - very annoying. No dropping or damage of any kind has occurred to the unit, so I can only assume it's poor maunfacture quality, and, of course, all this started to happen after the warranty was up.

I purchased it from Walmart, recently marked down to $19.99. I was skeptical at first. I have relaxed but thick African-American hair and wasn't sure if the \\"velvety\\" surface would interfere. It heated quickly, in a matter of minutes. And the fabric surface actually helped my hair adhere to the roller. The rollers were not too hot to handle. The metal, u-shaped clips are a little tricky and can push back the hair a bit when pushed on, but didn't really matter in the end. The results after 10 minutes were nice, big curls. It didn't leave my hair OVER curled, like a hot curler might do sometimes. Plus my hair didn't dry out and it maintained it's shine. This set is definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conair is my favorite product for hair care","review":"My hair is straight and hard to keep a curl.

I've been using hot rollers for over thirty years - I've never had this much trouble with a set.

I started the process over and heated the curlers up again, left them in a long time, took them out and they looked great, for another 45 minutes.Now I only with I could return them.

Cool to the touch with a velvety covering. The clips that come with the rollers work really well in keeping the rollers in your hair - however, for my hair they left indentions. I also bought the jumbo clips (extra) which don't work as well as the ones that come with the rollers. They also left indentions in my hair. This could just be that my hair is so fine. The disappointment comes in that the rollers just don't get hot enough to make good lasting curls (they are limp at best) - and with my hair being so fine and usually curling too much - I can't imagine that they would work very well on someone's hair that is thick or coarse."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless product","review":"If I could I would give this product zero stars because that's how bad it is.

I've used different curlers in the past to curl my hair and these are, by far, the worst of the lot.

OMG the wire gets caught in it and if the ends of your hair happen to be there you get crimped ends. these are blacklisted as far as i am concerned.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good design","review":"The flocked surface is nice, but the design overall is not good. The clips are too short to hold rollers in place. Back in the day, such u-shaped clips were about an inch longer, and I never had a problem before with the rollers falling out. Not true now. Also, the clips are color-coded at the tip to match the size of the roller, but the colors are so close, it's hard to get the right one. The grove in the roller to hold the roller on the heating element makes it difficult to get the clip over the roller: the clip gets stuck in the grove. The heating elements are bars that go the length of the case, and when reaching to get another roller, it is easy to touch the heating element, which can be uncomfortable. There is no tray to hold the clips between uses. Overall a bad design: if the rollers won't stay in place, they don't work. Returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah...","review":"It may have just been my hair (it's really fine), but man, these rollers would not stay in my hair. They just fell out again and again. The clips are just awful at keeping them in there. It may work if you bought different clips...? I was just sick of trying though, I just returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased !","review":"Very pleased with this product ! easy to use and warms up fast, excellent for styling with little time highly recommend !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Loved the fact that the rollers were big. Nothing else was worth using. While it heats fast,the metal SHORT clips don't hold the roller in place and if you don't put enough hair on the roller, they burn your head. You would think Conair would have enough experience to know better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL metal clips don't hold rollers","review":"While the rollers themselves are great - heat up VERY quickly and hold the heat for a long time - the metal clips that come with it to hold the rollers are AWFUL. They do not hold the rollers at all, even if you use two at a time (there is only one per roller).I will be returning this item promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"These things stink--literally!","review":"Plugged 'em in, the place filled up with noxious fumes and smoke that I could taste for hours. Tried again, same thing. And again. Sent 'em back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hot Rollers","review":"The Conair jumbo rollers are exactly what I needed and work very well. They heat up quickly and the pins work just fine without bumps. The only thing I would have liked is an automatic shutoff after a period of time. But heck. I'm in such a hurry in the morning, I actually don't need a shutoff, since I need to get my hair fixed as quickly as possible. I would recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curlers stay in place as well as any hot rollers do......","review":"Despite the concerns expressed by others, I went ahead and purchased these since I needed some large/jumbo hot rollers to help de-frizz/straighten my hair. They heat up very quickly (a big plus over my 90s set...or was that the 80s.....?). I echo the concerns of others that the lid hinge is delicate (a.k.a. \\"cheesy\\").I do find that the wire clips are about 1/2 inch too short for optimal hold. However, as long as you don't break-dance, the curlers stay put reasonably well. I did not have the significant problems that some experienced making the curlers stay in---but my hair is thick and medium-long. Again, Mr. Conair could have done us all a favor by making the wire clips a tiny bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I love this! I have long layered hair and this set is fast and easy to use. It heats up in about 5 minutes (when the red spot on the large roller turns white then its ready), I set my hair (7 minutes), do my makeup, eat breakfast, then take them out and I have beautiful waves! Easier and faster than the curling iron. The rollers get pretty hot, I've burned my finge, so I would definetly recommend the plastic clips you can purchase in addition. I'm definetly satisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"The curlers burn your hands and head as you try and put them in place which would make you think you would end up with at least a good curl. However, curl does not keep. Look for hot rollers that have a claw to hold the curler in place as this product does not and doesn't keep curler in place. Seller was great but product not so hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THESE","review":"I bought this set on sale yesterday from Target------a horrible disapppointment! They don't get hot enough, and after leaving them in my hair for about 10 minutes, I barely had a limp curl. Also hard to keep them pinned in the hair. I'm returning them today and starting over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product.","review":"Heats up quickly and stays hot. Curlers are covered with a soft velvet material which is gentle on the hair. I am happy with this set overall, my only complaint is that the pins do not keep rollers tight in my hair. I bought clamps to hold them in place. I do not know how anyone can keep the curlers in with those stupid pins."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the volume","review":"this product gives great volume to layered looks. it does how ever take a bit to get the hang of using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product but not as good as older model","review":"I have the older set of these rollers but there just weren't enough rollers to do my entire hair so I bought this new set. The set is good except for two things that they changed with the new model. 1) They added in four super huge rollers which really don't do much because they are so big. 2) For some reason they got rid of the area where you can store the roller clips. So the clips basically have to be stored somewhere other than with the rollers. The spot where it should be is still there so I don't know why they wouldn't have just left the hole there.But the rollers will work very well and heat up extremely fast so overall I am basically happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"Ordered these last week for $29, now they are $19. There were NO clips included, meaning not only has it cost me $10 more; I now have to go buy clips :( Haven't tried them yet to review how they work as there were no clips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with fatal design flaws","review":"The velvet around the roller is great but, like everyone else said, the slot on the roller leaves crimps and the dumb metal clips they give you do not keep the rollers taut enough to do a good job. My hair is easy to curl and even after hairspraying it, and keeping the rollers in for 20 minutes, while the metal clips burned my scalp and neck (I literally had to lift them away from my neck so they wouldn't burn me), I still ended up with just slightly wavy hair and NO body nor curl at the top.. I'm returning them after just one try."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick with my curling iron","review":"I'm new to the roller world, but although this product is exactly as described, it is way too much of a hassle. I attempted to use the rollers for the first time over the weekend. I had trouble right off the bat getting my hair to stay in place while rolling it up. When I did manage to get the strip of hair to stay in place and roll, the pins were ill-fitting and the rollers fell out almost immediately. Additionally, I kept burning my fingers on the rollers. I would love for my hair to have more body, but this is more trouble than it's worth. I'll stick with my curling iron!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want \\"politician's wife\\" hair...","review":"I have thick, medium length hair. These curlers created way more volume than I like, giving me terrible helmet hair. I tried rolling them in different directions, and nothing seemed to help. These are too jumbo for me. Would probably work better for someone with finer/thinner hair.Pros: heats up very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great curls! No storage place for clips.","review":"This version of these rollers is an update from a previous one. Pros: It has the same sturdy, flocked rollers and soft-tipped clips. Faster heat-up than before. Cons: In this version, there is now no storage spot in the case for the clips. I find that very annoying. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat hair before, flat after","review":"I used to use my mom's hot rollers from the 70's. Hers were ceramic and gave great body that lasted all day. I was very disappointed with the results here. There was no curl and little body! My hair is long, about to my shoulder blades. I expected more. Maybe I need to use smaller rollers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for fine hair","review":"The curlers get extremely hot. Thus, if you have fine hair, they burn your scalp. The clips are very hard to get to stay in. I am sorry I bought these and wish for a great replacement. They do curl hair, so that's a point on their side, and they are quick to heat up -- to a burning temp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"I purchased this set after reading many reviews on many different products. I'm disappointed these came with the old fashioned wire clips instead of the newer claw type clips shown in the product image! I did not get what was described. This makes using the curlers much harder for me, the wire clips leave a mark in my hair. The rollers do heat up quickly and work well IF the correct clips were included I'd be very happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No place to store the curler holders","review":"These were OK, they curled my hair pretty good. But I was most frustrated because there is no little door or compartment to hold the wire holders. So my curlers are in one part of my bathroom, and my holders are in a drawer. Not convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"What took so long?","review":"Dear Conair: What took you so long to make super jumbo rollers? Most of the women I know have been wanting larger heated rollers for at least 10 years. To be even more honest you increased the size of four rollers and yet some how couldn't possible figure out how to create a receptacle for the clips? Really?This design as been around for at least 30 years and requires more functionality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch!!!!","review":"I ordered these rollers from Amazon because they were less expensive. They sent them to me, but they were the next model down that doesn't have the new clips (it has the old metal pins) and it doesn't have the ion shine mechanism. I thought it was an honest mistake, so I returned them and had them send a replacement explaining my dilemma. They very quickly sent me a new one, but it was THE SAME LESSER MODEL.I explained again and sent it back for a replacement. They sent me a note saying that they were going to refund my money instead and that they couldn't help me.Bait and Switch for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The wire clips don't go in easily","review":"The rollers heat up enough, but it is difficult to get the wire clips in the right place because of the design of the roller. It has an opening on each side from which it heats up on the machine. But then to navigate the clip away from these 2 openings is a major pain. I'm either going to buy a new set of rollers or look for a clip that clips easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Curl","review":"I love these curlers. I have long hair. The larger curler is great. I like having all the same size curlers. I never used the little ones in other sets. These heat up fast and curl great. The velvety covering really helps protect the hair. I like the pins that come with this set. I had another set with the hinge clips and they left funny little dents in my curl. These work much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great set of curlers","review":"I use these almost every morning. They're hot and ready to go in seconds. I like the nonslip surface of the curlers. Makes it so easy to set my hair, remove, and go in a matter of minutes and still have a really nice style. I like having 12 *large* rollers to handle my thick, long hair. These rollers rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought they were good for a while","review":"When I first got these this summer I thougt they were nice. They heat up quickly and I didn't mind the split down the middle. Then some of the rollers I have dropped on the floor did not seem to fit smoothly into the slot they heat up in and and the stress of pushing them in and pulling them out started to cause the rollers to break apart.Just this week the back row of rollers stopped heating up and the front row does not seem to have temperature control. The front row got so hot the silver plastic started to melt!!!!I'm disappointed because I did like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft Curls and Very Fast results","review":"I have very heavy hair and have always had a hard time finding curlers that work. After reading one of the reviews on this product I decided it was the one for me. The review stated \\"That it gave the look of hair that had been curled under with a brush and hairdryer\\". That is the look I wanted and I think (depending on the time you leave them in) you get that look. They are the perfect size and my hair looks so much healthier when I pop these in my hair in the morning. Finally a set for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST hairclips ever invented!!","review":"Great rollers that heat up fast but who invented the clips???? They are a disaster; I am using my older clips for a tighter hold. These newer clips do not work and one would think in the instruction booklet they would have a drawing to show you how to put them in securely. What planet are the folks from CONAIR living on??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hot enough","review":"These curlers do not get hot enough. The pins work just fine, but they do not get hot enough to make a lasting curl that is worth the effort or the money spent. The size of the curlers are awesome if they did get hot enough, I've even tried using less hair in each section even though I have thin hair to begin with. I would go with a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea poor product","review":"I bought the jumbo hair curlers as a quick and easy way to give my hair body during the busy morning. I really like the size of the curlers and they become hot in minutes, all positive. The frustration comes with the clips that are used to hold the curlers in place (low quality). The plastic clips are held together by a circular metal piece. They are constantly falling apart, as easily as it is to put them back together, but doing it repeatedly every morning, especially when you're in a rush is just irritating. I believe that there are better quality product out there for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad design","review":"The design for this product is flawed. The clips that hold the curlers on are: 1. way too short to hold the curler to your head, I had to use the clips from an old set or else it wouldn't work and, 2. fall all over the place because there isn't a place on the product to hold them. How hard would it be to create a few holes to hold the clips?The curlers do heat up pretty fast and I like that there are two sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Came with regular U-clips","review":"I purchased these largely because of a video review of this set on YouTube; a major selling point for me was the clips shown (with a hinge). I also saw these clips in the pictures. The product that came is the same set, but I got regular U-clips which I have never had success with! These are also the clips that are pictured on the box that the product came with. I tried out the curlers and, of course, had trouble getting the rollers to stay on my head - they loosen up and fall out. Now I have to spend another $10 plus shipping on a pack of roller clips that only come in 10-count, and there are 12 rollers in my set! My second complaint is that I really need another 4-6 rollers to get all my hair rolled. I have thick hair but it is only a little longer than shoulder length. I guess I need two sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe they do NOTHING!","review":"I have fine, wavy, medium-long hair. I let these heat for half an hour, left them in my hair for another half an hour and nothing. Maybe a slight bend in my hair. Also, the dimensions are off. They are not 1/1/2 and 1/3/4 inch diameters but about a quarter inch smaller overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DUAL VOLTAGE SYSTEM, CONAIR ROLLER","review":"I ordered this roller set and it is NOT DUAL voltage. I ordered again because I was told by Amazon was dual voltage and again (2 time) received and is ONLY 120V. Amazon should clarify this information so the client doesn't trash time and money sending it back. do\\"t RECOMMENDed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Longlasting Curls","review":"I purchased these rollers to replace an older different brand name set. I have always used hot rollers, never a curling iron. My hair was soft and bouncy after each use. I use this product daily. It heats up really fast. Great for long hair. Would recommend highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice item","review":"I like these rollers, but i would love them if they included 3-4 more rollers because 12 is not enough to do all my hair. the clips arent that bad at least with my type of hair (not too thin) if they didnt hold the first time, i moved the clips every way possible until they got a good hold. In the future i will buy other clips. The rollers get pretty hot but they ARE called Heat Rollers so you just have to be careful and they leave a nice big curl."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work for my fine thin hair","review":"I was disappointed with these curlers. They did not stay put with the included clips in my fine thin hair. I am returning them b/c it was too frustrating trying to get them to stay w/o slipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous rock star hair","review":"Every girl needs a set of these. Big bouncy curls in my normally wavy-ish frizzball. Medium-thick hair, just past my shoulders and I had two rollers that I didn't use. The velvety texture on the rollers make your hair stick but it was a little tricky with the layers; they kept falling out as I was rolling the longer hair. The clips are easy but don't hold super tight, which is fine since I want waves not tight curls. I really like these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnt my scalp","review":"The rollers got far too hot for my scalp. They burnt my scalp and were very painful to use, had to return them since they are dangerous to continue using."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not burn your fingers","review":"I love this product as it does not burn your fingers or scalp. I only wish it had more larger rollers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conair Extreme Heat rollers a disappointment","review":"I ordered this product for myself as a Christmas present. I have long hair and when I straighten it, there is not much body. I hoped these heated rollers would do the trick. Unfortunately, the rollers will not stay in. I would secure one and when reaching for the next one, the first one would fall out. Sometimes I could get as many as three in if I was careful with my movements. The strands of hair I was able to get around the rollers did look good and had the body I wanted. However, the rollers are so difficult to use, I finally gave up on them. They were a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"no curl, 20 year old set much better","review":"These do not get hot enough to set a curl. Unfortunately, the box was recycled with the other Christmas boxes so I guess Goodwill get a new set. Perhaps they will work better with another hair type. My hair has a good bit of body and is shoulder length, thick, but very fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I do not recommend these curlers.

There are no curls in my hair. I have long layered hair and the rollers won't stay in. When I take them out there isn't even any body. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless clips","review":"I purchased these rollers and just tried them today for the first time. The rollers appeared to heat up well, however, I don't know if they would curl hair or not as the clips were 100% useless.They would not stay in at all, and just moving your head a fraction of an inch sent them dropping to the floor. These clips are completely worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes nice curls, but....","review":"You need two hands to turn it on or off, one to hold the case and one to move the switch.

She tried it for a week before returning it. Even with extra clips, the curlers would fall out. Her hair is naturally curly and usually holds a curl for days, however her curls fell within minutes with this for some odd reason. This is the second conair product we've had to return. Don't think I'd buy their products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use because metal in rollers burns scalp.","review":"These rollers are heated through metal slots in the center.

Lots of big rollers!","review":"I have tons of very fine wavy hair and smaller hot rollers make me look like an elderly poodle. I want them to smooth out the kinks, add some lift, and finish the ends, and these rollers do the trick.I've used this type of pin for years and so I didn't find them difficult to use - but they take a little practice.No pin marks, no fishhook ends, no frizz, no problem!Now I wish they made a set with even bigger rollers! How about 2\\", Conair?"},{"rating":"1","title":"WISH I Liked, BUT DIDN'T","review":"I was sooo excited to get these because it seemed to have lots of jumbo rollers (more than most sets), but for some reason it didn't work on my hair. It wouldn't hold the curl no matter how long I let the set heat up. I even bought the clips that people recommended w/ this set, but still it didn't work well. I have another set that has clips that heat up w/ the rollers and that type of set seems to hold the curl for most of the day, but I just wished it had as many jumbo rollers as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor design","review":"I have been a fan of hot rollers for decades and these are the worst I have ever owned. The opening down the length of the roller makes it difficult to insert the pins and there is no place to hold the pins. All my sets in the past have had a place to hold the pins. I travel frequently and must find a separate container to hold the pins.I will replace these as soon as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to flat ironing.","review":"Now I don't have to blow dry my hair and flat iron it.

Before my first use, I practice rolling my hair and securly getting the clip on. Well, it was a disaster! I read the manual word for word, but no help there. I tried using more hair, less hair, etc but the clip would either fly off, or the hair would unravel. I tried another day to practice again, but had the same results. I returned this item because of it.I never even plugged this in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Brought this thinking wow nice big size curlers for nothing!

But the rollers themselves are awesome, they heat quickly and create nice curls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Bought these the other day. Lifted the cover and turned the rollers on and could smell burning! Tried to take a roller out of the unit but it was wayyyy too hot to the tough. Very dangerous. Unplugged the unit and returned it yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"In my personal opinion, Conair has always made so-so products, but I suppose you get what you pay for. HOWEVER, this rollers heater heats up the rollers in a very small amount of time, and then does not burn my head once I place them on my hair. At the same time though, my hair does not stay that way - perhaps it's the hairspray that I used, you never know. The rollers do add volume, but usually not for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"rollers get too hot, don't stay in","review":"These hot rollers are unusable - it is not possible to set a heat setting so they get too hot to handle very quickly; the clip to hold the roller in the hair is too flimsy to work, even if two are used, so the only way to really use the rollers is to simply hold it in place manually for several minutes and hope it takes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Roller Set!","review":"I scoured the site for recommendations and these were pretty high plus a friend had an older version of the product. They get super hot super fast and work really well. I highly recommend you buy the white plastic roller clips though because the ones that come with don't work so well - especially with the uber thick hair that I have. Great product at a great price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I was hoping the rollers would be bigger. I have long, really thick hair & the rollers are not big enough & there are not enough of them to do a good job. The clips are usless for holding the roller tight. I returned it the next day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tack an extra $10-15 on to the price: you must buy the Super Clips","review":"These heat up quickly and give big loose curls, but forget using the clips they come with. They're more like clamps, so if you have fine hair, they will literally clamp wide ridges into the roots of your hair - exactly where you're trying to create volume! What the roller giveth, the clip completely taketh away. So be prepared to buy the Super Clips, which are somewhat better (and you gotta love Conair - the Super Clips come in a set of TEN, although the roller set has TWELVE rollers). No accident, I'm sure. So if you're okay with having 10 clips for 12 rollers and paying $10-15 more than you thought you would, these might be the rollers for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!!!!","review":"I have hair that is down a little past my shoulders, and is of average thickness. I bought these rollers looking for curlers that would give me softer, larger curls than I get with my hot sticks (those end up very tight and spiral-y!). Weeell, these didn't give me a curl at all! All they did was make the very ends of my hair a little wavy, and didn't do a thing to the top of my hair! It was as straight as ever!At first, I thought maybe I had put too much hair on each curler, so I tried just curling HALF of my hair with all 12 rollers, but got the same result: No curls, just a tiny bit of body at the ends of my hair. I even left them in for 20 minutes instead of the recommended 10 minutes. I know I let them heat up long enough, too, because a few rollers burned my neck.This is the worst hair-curling product I have ever come across! Even my grandmother's foam rollers (that have no heat) work better than these things! Don't waste your money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Disappointed","review":"After having luck with a pervious set of Conair hot rollers I decided on this one. There are four jumbo rollers and eight large rollers, this is great but what isn't great are the clips! They don't fit the jumbo rollers once you get your hair wrapped around it and they leave dents in your hair. They are large, plasitc, hinged clips so storage is a pain as well, there is no storage for these clips on the set itself so I had to find a little plastic bucket for them. This will be a pain when I travel.My previous set of Conair hot rollers was pretty similar to this one except all of the curlers were the large size and they had regular metal clips with storage for the clips on the set. I wish I could find this same set again!I am sure there are other hot rollers on the market that would be a lot more convenient!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I bought these because my (thick) hair is getting longer and my arm tires from drying with the roller brush. With these rollers, I dry my hair without styling, then put the rollers in and in five minutes my hair looks great! They heat up quick, are easy to use (not too hot)and there are plenty to go around. And the clips store inside with the rollers. I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"These rollers are quick and easy - on days when there isn't time for fussing, I heat them up, put them in and I am done in minutes.

Who really cares about a relative's business dealings? I skipped over those boring pages, trying to find facts on ED's life. I didn't find much.I feel I can know more about Emily through simply reading her poetry, some of which I still find hard to understand. I admire her for not seeking fame or money through her gift of writing. She was a true artist with words.Go to this site to read her poetry online: http://www.bartleby.com/113/."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Dickinson biography","review":"Habegger's bio of Emily Dickinson is thorough, well-written, fully researched. Chronologically arranged, but it does a good job of tying together various periods of ED's life and thought. Gives a real feeling for the people in her life. May not agree with all of Habegger's comments, but they are generally reasonable, not outlandish or strained. Reads easily - almost a page-turner. Excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of different ending for Miss Silver!","review":"I have read almost all the Miss Silver mysteries, and just love this genre. I didn't think I was going to like this book at first. It's kind of different. BUT! The ending was just great! Different than most of her endings. Really loved this and recommend for Miss Silver fans. If you don't know Miss Silver, these books are rather along the same vein as Margaret Erskine books. They are pretty much post WW2, English, old country houses and village type books.

The interviews vary widely in substantive interest. Unfortunately, Swift gives us the full contents of each interview, including what he said himself. This forces the reader to wade through a lot of marginal verbiage to get to the nuggets of thought-provoking material. The book would be far more readable, and shorter, if Swift had been tougher about editing his own work. The concluding chapter provides some interesting sociological analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self published?","review":"Thanks for the tip about this being self published through Iuniverse as that make more sense about the quality.

Not sure how hot other reviewers expect their coffee, but my husband and I think it is too hot to drink immediately after brewing. Also, it stays hot for at least an hour or two. Why would anyone need it to stay hot for three or four hours? I think people's expectations are a little too high. If it takes you that long to drink a pot of coffee, perhaps you should have only made a half pot.We used a very simple Braun model with a carafe for the last ten years, and it finally stopped working. We definately wanted to get another coffee maker with the carafe/thermos. Coffee that has been warmed on a burner is just unacceptably horrible. This Krups is way ahead of the Braun in ease of use and the temperature of the coffee is much, much warmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Last Krups","review":"I've had the same issues with this coffee maker as many of the other reviewers. This is just a shoddy design. I can deal with the less than hot coffee because I expect that with a thermal carafe, but I didn't expect weak coffee due to the poor flow of water over the grounds (you can see it after brewing: the water passes straight through the center, leaving surrounding grounds untouched). I also didn't expect to have to use duct tape to keep the filter basket closed due to the flimsy metal piece that bent beyond use in 1 month. Disappointing product, and my last Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not buying it again","review":"It makes good coffee & thermos is useful, but there are a few things I didn't like:- The lid of the carafe is awkward to close sometimes. I spill coffee more compared to other carafes I've owned.- Once in a while, I don't push the filter box all the way, causing coffee to overflow - I know this is my user error, but it happens more often than usual with this machine.- Carafe handle broke after 1.5 years of use. It looks like the issue was loose screw & a piece of degraded metal that connects the carafe and handle. I was disappointed how cheaply it is made, for the price I've paid.I'm looking for something a little higher quality for my next coffee maker - I might have to pay more but if it can last more than 1.5 years it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPDATE - Can't get much worse... Nothing good about this one","review":"OK. Now the darn thing is broke (2 months old). What a defective device. About 2 cups of coffee now sit in the basket, which I have to throw out when it's done brewing. This is a realy BAD machine. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, AND GET SOMETHING OTHER THEN A KRUPS! This one is not worth the shiping cost!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this coffee maker to keep the coffee hot.....for at least an hour. Does not do it unless you preheat the caraff and brew an entire pot. A partial pot goes cold. I am aware that you need to remove the caraff from the brewer to conserve heat and I do. This machine is also very loud which surprised me. We now refer to blasting off a pot of coffee rather than brewing one! All I can say is that I'm glad I bought mine at half price. If I had paid full price I would have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good coffee","review":"This replaced a 6 year old Black and Decker Thermal coffee machine with generally positive results. We do miss the lift-out water tank the old one had, but other than that we are very satisfied with this Krups. The coffee is excellent.

This is a high priced coffee maker that you are lead to believe makes better tasting coffee. It's all marketing! Save some money and buy a less expensive unit. The coffee doesn't taste any better then less expensive coffee makers. What is aroma control anyway? Also, I don't think the coffee stays very hot for very long. You had best be prepared to drink your coffee immediately after it is brewed if you like it hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"This is a horrible product. I bought it for my mom for Christmas and the coffee did not brew hot nor did it stay even lukewarm in the carafe for more than about half an hour.

Since then, my mother has purchased the Mr. Coffee model and has been much happier with its performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"lightweight exploding carafe","review":"This thing is all plastic and so light that you must hold it down with one hand to remove the carafe.

It has all the elements of a Dickersonian novel, without the verbosity of his writing style. The characters are cruel, sinister, treacherous and duplicitous, and the plot is full of twists and turns. The description of London and the English countryside, including the inhumane treatment of inmates in a madhouse, transports you back to the 19th Century. What is so exciting is that Sara Waters captured this era and successfully wrote it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrillride in Petticoats","review":"Fingersmith is really a terrific read. People shouldn't be daunted by the 500 plus pages, they go by almost too fast. The constant plot twists leave the readers on their toes, not to mention the secrets of each of the characters. If you're bored with reading verbose Dickensian works about love and work, then try Fingersmith out, it gets down to the grit of being a villain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"Fingersmith tells a great big wonderful story, one which you can sink your teeth into and really enjoy. It started off in almost the same mode as Slammerkin. London city girl with checkered past travels to countryside to deceive people, but after that, the two stories diverge and this one is excellent. The story of Maud and Sue, two young women trapped in a web of deceipt and lies, a web woven by both themselves and others is thoroughly engrossing, filled with doublecrosses and interesting plot twists. This is a very well-done, well-told story that you can really lose yourself in. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickensian Novel with a Sexy, Feminist Twist","review":"Early on, the writer lets you know that you are reading a riff on Oliver Twist. The story begins in a 19th Century den of thieves that uses children as pickpockets; and, as a young child, the heroine is spooked by Nancy's murder when she sees a play of Oliver Twist. There are also themes of character and social class that pervade the novel, similar to those in Oliver Twist. Fingersmiths can also be read, I think, as a feminist exploration of the choices available to 19th Century women who must rely on their limited resources. Some of those choices leave little room for moral nicety.Enough faux-smarty-pants analysis. This is a fun, sexy book with great characters and a plot that will keep you glued to the page and guessing what will happen. If you are uncomfortable with a little innocent girl on girl sex, well this may not be the book for you. But otherwise, go for it. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This is a fabulous, riveting book that moves at a good clip. I am a slow reader if I am not inspired by what I am reading.

It could have ended sooner and with more impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"A dark novel in which one cannot know what to expect for one cannot foresee the dark intent of others. Repel as you like but be caught up in a world where no good truly exists and where there is madness at every turn.

This book is not only disappointing by comparison but it is hopelessly trite, silly, preposterous and boring by any measure. It is hard to imagine that such a gifted author would turn out something like this. Some friend or editor should have saved her from this embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ausicious Novel I Have Read in Years","review":"This is the first and last book I will ever read based off of its inclusion in the Booker Prize short list. Why this was ever critically aclaimed is beyond me. The storyline is preposterous (although, I admit, I was slightly engaged in the first of the three parts, but that was before the emergence of ridiculous plot twists), and the writing lacks the wisdom, insight, and, at the very least, technique to pull this novel about Victorian porno fiction into a realm that could remotely be called literary. If you want a good laugh, read this book. It has offered me many moments of amusement, but overall, it is trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was crud","review":"Fingersmith was crud I don't get It, where does the love story beings and where do It end. Part one of the book was going so good I could not wait to the reach part two but as I read on to part two of the book I was lost I have read so many review's on how this book was so good and I said to myself I have to get this book but It was a waste of my time. I did not know when Mud fall in love with Susan or when Susan fell In love with Mud. Where was the twist.Or did I read the review's wrong and It was not a love story I think not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply unbelievable","review":"This has become my favorite book of all time. I do have to admit there are some parts that feel slow, and of course, repeated, but I finished this book 2 weeks ago and I still can't think of anything else. I am haunted. Waters writes with such detail, maybe a little too over the top, but thats just what makes this book so amazing; engraving. The characters are so human, I feel like they are real people in my life, friends, and when I think about them, I have to remind myself they are only characters in a book. I not crazy. But thats just how amazing this book is. I almost wish I hadn't read it, because nothing will be able to satisfy me as much as this book, everything else is just, lifeless, and plotless. Whats in even better is that there is a movie to this book, so the adventure doesn't stop when your done with the reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fingersmith","review":"I loved this book!

Their destiny intwined when Gentleman made a deal with Maud that he can remove her from her rich upstanding ( because she is unhappy ) .As from Susan's understanding she is to make friends with Maud and make her come with Gentleman so they can deal with all of Maud's riches .

The characters are all low life petty thieves, who have no honor even among themselves. By the end, I felt that they all got what the deserved, but felt no sympathy for any of them, I was just glad I didn't have to listen to their amoral self pity anymore. Although Fingersmith has been likened to Oliver, and it seems derivative in terms of setting, Sarah Waters original additions, (the lesbian relationship, the baby dealer, and the misogynistic con-man,) mired down rather than elevated this tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious...","review":"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with many of the other reviewers of this book. It's taken me a long time to read (3wks) because my interest in it has been waning. In my view the narrative is at times turgid and flawed, dialogue implausible and the description is lacking. The few bits of heightened tension are when the two main characters have a 'liaison' whilst letting on to each other next morning that they were asleep. Also, when one of the key characters is killed. For such a fat volume there's not much going on that couldn't be tailored neatly into 100 pages. Dickensian it is not. Read this and then read anything from Dickens and then you'll realise the difference is like walking from the night into day. You get the impression that the author herself got bored with the process of writing it and only livened up at the start and towards the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I secured this book specifically because of the glowing Amazon reviews. The first 100 pages left me uninspired. I stuck w/the text though; hoping it was just off to a slow start. It does get better towards the middle, however, it never really picked up tempo, remaining redundant and constantly supplemented with non essential fluff throughout. The insane asylum piece drug on and on. \\"I'm not Maude, I'm Susan\\" torture, beating, humiliation, cold baths ensue, lather - rinse- repeat. Her escape and subsequent return to London were interesting, but the much hyped plot twists and turns were predictable. I could also do without the lesbian love affair. All around it fell flat of my five star expectations. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm lesbian romance","review":"I am afraid that I completely missed out on what is meant to be so mesmerizing about this book (judging by the other glowing reviews.) Firstly, the plot is melodramatic, verging on ludicrous and unbelievable. The two main characters, Maud (the lady) and Sue (her maid and lover) never come alive. They are like wooden dolls moving through Victorian London, and are almost interchangable. The only thing that is good is the accurate period detail and Water's ability to create atmosphere. But much of it is just padding, padding, paddding, and even when you get to the bones of it, there is nothing much there, save a few good sex scenes and some very detailed descriptions of ladies underwear.Admittedly, I gave up on this half way through. Maybe it picked up towards the end, but I doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Dragging","review":"Just because a book is by Sarah Waters (and she usually writes with more literary sense than many other lesbian authors) does not make it good literature, or even a good story.I was so happy to find this book - imagine a lesbian plot line with more than a short afternoon's read! By the end, I was so disappointed.Yes, there are many twists to the plot, but I'm sorry that I wasted my time plodding through to the end.

And yes, it manages to be original while at the same time paying homage to one of literature's greatest writers, Charles Dickens. But in my humble opinion, the best part of this book is that the author clearly had fun writing it and has managed to create an enthusiastic joy ride through Dickensian England that leaps off the page. Reading it was like riding down a hill on a terrific, old fashioned sled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but annoyng twist and turns that don't quite add up.","review":"The story is unique and interesting enough to read but not one of my favorites at all.

She is to gently push her into the arms of Mr. Rivers. Maude Lilly and Mr. Rivers get married and then put Maude in a nuthouse and make off with her fortune. On the surface that is the story. But nothing is as it seems and there are numerous twists and turns.This is a Victorian historical novel at its best. Full of dodgers, thieves, lunatics, murderers, swindlers, child marketers, charlatans,and orphans, this reads like a Dickensian book.

An engaging love story between the two female characters runs throughout, adding an element of humanity and tenderness to the story.

I am also very pleased with the design including the generous cover that does a fairly good job of keeping rain off the seed. Most, but not all, of the birds who were using my more traditional feeder have adapted to this one (but not the doves or the red-bellied woodpeckers). Its open design makes it very easy to clean thoroughly; much easier to clean than a classic tube feeder. Duncraft sells a locking chain that could be used to secure this feeder to tree branches or feeding station poles ([..])."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"When i received it, I put it together and added my seed to it.

It turns out that there is a tiny (and I mean tiny) spring which operates the cradle mechanism (resembles a very tiny version of a clothes pin spring but hairlike in dimension)which was snapped in two and would be impossible to repair.

Joe sets himself apart from the other guys with some real rocking tunes as well as downright beautiful melodies such as \\"Love Thing\\". Some of his best work since \\"Surfing With The Alien\\". Joe is what I would call the \\"musicians musician\\". Joe is a humble guy and probably doesn't realize how talented a guy he is unlike a few musicians. You can't go wrong with Crystal Planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"the master rocks","review":"After Satriani's self-titled, very different-sounding 1995 album, he released this dazzling effort. Crystal Planet is his second-greatest album, right behind Surfing With The Alien, which is THE perfect guitar album. CP has so much magic to it, so many hits, I don't know where to begin. House Full Of Bullets is fun and funky, Crystal Planet breaks the sound barrier, and Love Thing is such a beautiful love song. Anyone who thinks a song has to have vocals to it to get a message across obviously has never heard any of Joe's music. I love everything on here, but my favorite song has to be Raspberry Jam Delta-V. I've come to associate this song with my little girl. This song is playful, spirited and very energetic, just like her. No skips on this one; every song is a gem. Anyone just getting into Joe's music, get Surfing, Super Colossal (his latest) and this masterpiece. Then sit back and enjoy the magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music from a master:crystal clear!","review":"This is probably Satriani's best effort in the nineties,a brilliant statement from a musician who can combine out-of -this -world virtuosity with ideas,rhytm and,most importantly,feeling.Displaying an impressive command of the fretboard,he never forgets harmony and atmosphere.This record is a best of genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe's Best CD (next to Extremist)","review":"This CD is freakin awesome!

Well anyway, I picked it up and the cd is AWESOME! Joe really shows how awesome he is at the guitar. This cd inspired me to play the guitar and get (so far) 4 more of his cds. Trust me. IT'S WORTH IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME musicals","review":"it was all a musical CD, no vocals in it, but this guy didn't need any vocals, i mean, the way that he plays, there is no need for vocals, it would just screw everything else up .."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant...","review":"Don't let the old school Satch fans fool you: this CD blows Surfing with the Alien out of the water. Each track is good enough to be someone's favorite. Personally, I am APPALLED that only ONE person out of the 80 or so reviewers picked Trundrumbalind as the album's finest track... a good song should be able to coax a feeling or two out of the listener. The commonly overlooked Trundrumbalind is captivating and downright inspiring. This is the finest 13 bucks you will ever spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokin'","review":"Sure, this album is much like Satriani's others, consisting mostly of blazing solos and power ballads. BUT, Joe's talent with the guitar is second to none. Despite the repetition of some tracks, there's not a dull moment to be had, and at times, his axework reaches ferocious levels that are a wonder to behold. Highlights include the title track, \\"Psycho monkey,\\" and the dynamic \\"Train of Angels,\\" which proves that even a raging guitar can be harmonious. First rate guitar work all around, and some good backup efforts (esp. on bass) make this a real treat for those who enjoy Satriani. Highly recommended to Joe's fans, and those who like Steve Vai and Yngwie Malmsteen may also enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks among his best","review":"I don't quite recall how I got introduced to Joe Satriani's music, but I do know that the music from this album was the first music I heard from him. If you want to introduce someone to the wizardry that is Joe Satriana, I think this is the album to start them off with. It's accessible, with nary a weak track of the bunch (except maybe Z.Z's Song, but I don't like that one because when I listen to this album, I wanna rock and not chill). My fave songs are Ceremony, Up in the Sky and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one...","review":"I had never listened to Joe, had no idea who he was until my boyfriend and I started going on long drives up to the mountains and he was constantly playing Joe's CDs. This was the first CD to catch my attention, and I totally fell in love with it!\\"Up In The Sky,\\" \\"House Full Of Bullets\\" and \\"Crystal Planet\\" are great when you're snaking up a mountain road at about 55 mph. \\"Love Thing\\" is my absolute favorite track - actually, my favorite Joe song. Period. It's very mellow and just beautiful!From \\"Trundrumbalind\\" on, you just can't go wrong.I wish that \\"Time\\" came a little sooner in the album (#14 of 15), another excellent track - it always gets you drumming your hands on the steering wheel.I was lucky enough to see him live twice last year, and you couldn't wipe the smile off of my face!

So this album turned out to be a real let-down. Instead of continuing to break new ground, it seems like Satch is just trying to make another Surfing with the Alien. Many of the songs follow a Surfing-type formula, with obligatory modal shifts and power-chord intros. There's little evidence of any new ground being explored. He's never been good at song titles and this features some of the worst. Still, if you hated the self-titled album, you'll probably enjoy this tired rehash of his old stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"RINSE. LATHER. REPEAT.","review":"What happened to the prowess and melodies of the first 2 Satriani 'albums'? 'Crystal Planet' is OK, but ultimately, it all sounds the same, and is not memorable. Sure, there are some great hooks and riffs, but they go nowhere. Sorry Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I only just recently began listening to solo guitarists like Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. After comparing the two, I have decided that I like Satriani's work better even though they are both about equal in skill. \\"Crystal Planet\\" is definitely Satriani's best album. It mixes incredible technical guitar work with memorable riffs and solos that will impress even the most shallow of music fans. The song \\"Crystal Planet\\" is one of the most astounding guitar pieces I have ever heard, and songs like \\"a train of angels\\" and \\"ceremony\\" are equally amazing and could have done well on the radio. If you like good guitar work with excellent variety and composition, then this album is a must buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"What was I thinking??","review":"I just gave Crystal Planet another listen and I don't know why I let it collect dust since I bought it last year. Been a Satriani fan since \\"Surfing...\\" and pretty much felt Surfing was the prototypical, definitive Satriani love fest. Well... I'm enjoying the heck out of Crystal right now and would have to say it's right up there behind Surfing, and better than everything else (wow, do I really mean that?). Gems are the title song, and, well actually the first half of the CD is fantastic.. (entering the 2nd half as I type this - been a while :). One difference here is that it sounds more like a band (the drumming is fantastic) as opposed to just Joe in a studio with a drum machine. It's a bit more upbeat than the others; fast and multi-directional. You gotta love these new chord directions he takes us. So... if you're a fan (or even if you're not), what can I say.. it's worth it! Surfing would have to be a \\"5\\" - sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent, excellent!","review":"Very few albums (especially instrumental) can send shivers down my spine but this one did. There isn't a weak track on the whole CD. Joe is truly an ARTIST and not one of these Satch-wanna-bes who put out albums that are nothing but scale exercises done at warp 9. (Vinne Moore comes to mind) Satriani is (as always) an oasis in a wasteland of mainstream top 40 and \\"alternative\\" drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEAH!!","review":"GOD THIS ROCKS!

He is unlike any guitar player out there- and considering he started playing the day Jimmi Hendrix died, I think that shows just what kind of indivdual he is. Joe is the ULTIMATE in guitar players as far as I am concerned. Once you have heard him you won't be able to get his catchy ballads out of your head. He is like an addiction - always wanting more.

However good things do come to an end w/ his latest book, \\"starfighters of adumar\\", which really does not belong under the x-wing series and stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, and Totally Hilarious!","review":"Iron Fist is every bit as wonderful as I had hoped! It's completely hilarious, just like Wraith Squadron, plus there are new characters as quirky as the originals. It's a lot of fun, but the plot is exciting and worthwhile, too. There's even a brief cameo appearance by Rogue Squadron! And fans of Wraith Squadron will die laughing at the continuance and expansion of one of my favorite running jokes. Definitely a must-read. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deny Physics? A scientist maybe, but not an author","review":"To start it off simly the book made no sense. When the two SSDs were battling the Mon Remonda, they should have won in a minute. Mone Remonda doesn't have 50 turbolasers or even 30 ion cannons. An Imperial Star Destroyer has 60 turbolasers and 60 ion cannons. And Mon Remonda is battling a SUPER Star Destroyer. REalistic? I think not. If you're an author and want to learn about how NOT to write, this book is an A+ example. Otherwise, run for the hills!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First time I ever cried while reading SW","review":"I LOVE the Wraith books. However, this book was really sad. Without spoiling it for anyone, I will say that it made me cry and I stopped reading it and didn't pick it up again for almost two years! But it's a GREAT book, and I highly encourage you to read it. (But the sad part made me give it only four stars instead of five.)Oh, and once again-Face and Phanan ROCK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fantastic and engaging!","review":"July 31, 1998 Fun, fantastic and engaging! The X-Wing series just gets better and better. This story is well written, easy to follow, with great sound effects. This audio team is excited about what they are doing and it shows it the high quality of the production. The X-Wing adventure has exactly what I demand. A fun positive science fiction adventure with lots of action and engaging personal stories.This audio novel probably sounded a lot better to me as I had struggled for 15 minutes with the new Star Trek Pathways audio novel. Star Trek Pathways is one of the worst audio novels yet produced. It really makes you appreciate the level of quality in the X-Wing series.X-Wing #6 Iron Fist is a great investment and I highly recommend it. I have the entire series and this is a worthy addition. Now I can't wait for the next one!Arnold D Veness aveness@ntlabs.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"better and better","review":"Book 6 keeps this great series going. The cornerstone of this series is a great balance of humor, solid plot and of course the great star battles. A nice mix of some of the past books into the new Wraith squad keep this book interesting and fun. Great sound effects add to the aura of another solid Star Wars book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bre's","review":"Iron Fist was my first Wraith Sqaudron book and I enjoyed it very much. The story was told with a great sense of humour - something I appreciate in any book. And, yes, someone does die. (I cried but I cry in everything.)The book was an easy read, which means, in my terminology, that it was easy to understand and get involved in without being a mediocre washout or so involved in on itself that no one can understand. A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good book, but a little overdone with the enemy","review":"I thought the book was good, and I did like the first Wraith book. But how all the sudden does the Empire have all of this stuff? Where are the Super Star Destroyers coming from? I thought they were supposed to be incredibly expensive, powerful, and rare ships! From the impression I got in the movies of Star Wars, the Executer was one of a kind. It said in Darksaber that Executer nearly bankrupted the Empire. Yet now I can name a million of the things from the books, the movies, the comics, and even the video games. They were kind of neat while they were so much more incredible and powerful. But oh well. Life goes on (sigh)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stackpole shows he can really stand up to Zahn","review":"Stackpole has given us many books, all great, but this was the first one that really gave an actual person behind new caracters, something that until now only Darkhorse comix and Zahn were able to do. I think that the action oriented plot is pretty cool thoughout the X-wing and Wraith Squad, sometimes refreshing to Zahns all war tacticts books which remind me a little to much of Clancy. The only reason i didn't give this book five stars is that the main character was kinda switched and that Stackpole falls with the rest of the Star Wars writers in that he doesn't give the New Republic any challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Stackpole but still a good read.","review":"I have bought every book so far in the X-wing series and this was one of the better ones. Aaron Alston manages to make this a much more interesting and exciting novel by including more space battles, and a slightly more realistic plot than the last book (Wedge suddenly deciding that the New Republic needs a squadron full of washouts??). His style is quite different from Michael Stackpole's series, which I thought were slightly better overall, but there is still another one to come in this series, so lets hope it is the best one yet. This is a perfectly good book, and is well worth buying especially if you have read all the others, as the twisting plot makes it hard to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This action packed thriller was a great book","review":"I thought that the book Iron Fist by Aaron Alston was a great book, especially for readers wholove suspense and action. This book had everything from aliens to light speed capable ships. From hand guns that shoot lasers to self thinking robots this book stretches your imagination to it's full extent and then some. here's one example of the many thrilling scenes in this book. In this Castin Donn, a pilot and computer hacker in wriath squadroon, trys to plant a tracking device into the computer of Walord Zsinj's ship. As I said before this is jst one of the many thrilling scenes in this actioned packed book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty, but not purple or warm","review":"I chose the Plum Rose Blanket as a lilac colored blanket for my daughters lilac and green bedroom, and it is much more of a rose/pink color than the picture displays. It is not very warm either. I have another vellux blanket and this feels very different and much thinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this hat","review":"I love this cadet cap. The color of brown is just what I was looking for. It's sturdy made and fits my big head just perfectly. Shipping was fast too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product!","review":"Like the Powerwasher from the same company, this nozzle is among the worst products I have ever purchased. The one that came with the powerwasher broke after about an hour of use. I bought this one to replace the original, but it broke almost instantly - within 30 seconds of beginning the first use it split open. The plastic structure could not handle the water pressure. Do not buy this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTHLESS PIECE OF CRAPOLA","review":"The tip split open after about 1 hour...total rip off. Couldn't submit this without a rating so I gave it a 1 star.....actually it should be -5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No use at all","review":"I ordered this nozzle and also a replacement gun. They sent me a hose instead of the gun. I sent it back and they promised me a replacement. They sent a hose AGAIN, but the second time, there was no prepaid shipping to return it. I called, but the call center person could not comprehend what my complaint was. In the end, I sent it all back, so now I have nothing to show except wasted time and trouble packing boxes, driving to the post office, and looking at convoluted bills trying to understand if the refunds were correct. Not a good experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Don't waste your money. The turbo nozzel did not work. It was also the reason that I purcased this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, Junk, Junk!","review":"crappy brittle plastic, bought 2 of them & both broke upon 1st use. Hopefully Amazon has dropped this item! junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"It fit my machine fine and looked like it was going to work well, however it leaked at the joint between the nozzle and the tube. It was so bad that it sprayed back and got me wet. No amount to tightening or adjusting would make it stop.Tossed it in the trash, total waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 30 minutes","review":"This turbo nozzle/wand worked fine for about 1/2 hour on my Black & Decker electric power washer. It cracked and stopped working..Returning it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Service was real good. No problem at all..","review":"The product came on time .i did not have any problems at all. the service was real fast and easy. 100% satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"It's an alright program, for train lay out buffs. But if you want the real deal, like slowing down the flying scotsman before entering a station, real physics, and real routes. Then I suggest you go with MSTS, and ignore this simple program. There are hundreds of sites to download hundreds of new engines and routes, they only downside is that you have to create a consist for each new engine and car, but they have helpful tutorials to help you out, so I give this, 2 stars. Because of the simple control design. But, MSTS simulates the real thing, REAL engine controls, that need YOUR constent monitering. I'll probly get hateful reviews now."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice and delicate...","review":"Lily Hoshino has a very soft, delicate, and detailed drawing style. Now if anyone has seen any of her art, then her mangas might look like shota. Her semes are always masculine looking, while her ukes are typically younger looking and wear more feminine clothing. Of course I don't agree with the review posted before me, because that is complete bashing. I suggest that before you buy any manga from an unknown (to you) artist, that you look online for scans or scanlations of that manga or one from that artist. Her stories are simple and short and appeal much to the fantasy crowd, but her stories aren't so out there that one can't relate. Basically, her art is mostly soft and delicate (the style of drawing, not the stories, though it does apply somewhat) if you can't already tell from the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I have many FIRM Videos, but was wanting a new routine.This particular video is slow, boring and despite what othershave written, it was WAY too easy.

Otherwise, SKIP IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total body conditioning in under an hour","review":"I have followed the Firm workout series for the past 3 years and this is by far one of the most effective videos I have used. Using a combination of ballroom step aerobics with light conditioning you will definitely feel the effects of this workout the next day. It also includes an ab training session that will have your stomach feeling more toned and tight in just a couple of weeks. It is definitely one of the best total body workouts the FIRM offers, and is best when used in conjunction with the tortoise workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fib Finder Commercials fib about their product","review":"This toy was disappointment. When I bought it, I expected fun game with cool, original questions and a way to really be able to put my friends on the spot in a fun way and generally get aagreat party game that would please all. But the questions that they give you are so boring! The \\"fib finder\\" tool never tells the truth. You could make up a version by yourself with questions out of the top of your head and some coins to filp to see \\"if they are telling the truth\\" and get the same results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining","review":"My 8 year-old HAD to have this for Xmas but when she opened it, it was different than expected and her interest lasted about 6 minutes. She was disheartened to see that it is totally random in the \\"lie detecting.\\" It's mildly entertaining but really just a battery-powered version of the good ole' Magic Eightball!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!","review":"I had to put in at least one star. That is not true. It is not fun at all. I never play wih it! The only thing you learn is stuff the other person doesn't want to say! I wouldn't reconmend this toy to ANYBODY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh did I say 1 star? I meant 0!","review":"If you read this, listen to me. If you have (money) to spend, don't waste it on this stupid thing. It only does a pattern, it is not educational, and it is so dumb. If you was going to blow (money) and you want this toy, you might as well save your money.In my opinion this is the most worthless toy ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break....","review":"Fib Finder? Ya right! I got this for my birthday party, and let me tell you this was incredibly stupid! I am not much of a lier, but this game said i was lieing every time i was asked a question- which isnt true!!! The only reason i gave this game 2 stars was because when you asked someone if they liked someone who you know they didnt like, but the Fib Finder said they did, it was funny. All in all, this toy isnt very educational, unless if you need to know that lieing is bad, and honesty is good. If you want a garbage game to laugh about, and have to money to pay for it go ahead and buy it. For people like me, DONT BUY THIS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghhhh!","review":"This toy is a complete rip-off. I bought it, thinking it would be fun. I opened it up and played it only to get terribly disappointed. It does not really tell if you are lying, it is just a random thing. Not only that, the questions are boring! Like \\"have you ever told a lie?\\" and \\"what is your favorite ice cream flavor?\\" and \\"who do you admire as a role model?\\" and things like that.Basically, this game is boring and a waste of money.
