With ever present derby hat and cigar, The Lion was a great story teller, and here he talks about the stride piano style and his contemporaries including James P.Johnson and Fats Waller. He punctuates his anecdotes with numerous musical examples from brief demonstrations to full lengh performances. He was almost 70 when he recorded this lively session in 1967. It's an entertaining lesson from a still-feisty master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set of flatware","review":"Very sleek, unusual design. Fits nicely in the hand. The pieces have a solid feel, especially the knives, yet are not at all heavy. Even though the pieces are longer than most flatware, the bowls of the spoons and the prong parts of the forks are on the small side, which is a plus for younger family members. I particularly like the one-piece design, without any joints or grooves where water could leak into the knives or where dirt could get trapped. They seem to be withstanding water spots and retaining their shine nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"I totally agree with Davismom","review":"She said it perfectly.

Add to that writing by everyone from Bertolt Brecht to Hakim Bey to Negativland to Arnold Schoenberg to LaMonte Young to the U.S. Office of Censorship to the Emperor of Japan, and you have the most mind-opening writings I've ever seen on radio. This is not a book about pirate radio at all (though there are some good essays on that too--but for how-to I'd recommend Zeke Teflon's pirate radio manual). It's a book on radio theory, radio pranks, radio history, radio as art, telepathy as radio, radio in war, extraterrestrial radio, and a great argument for finding new things to do with radios besides listening to Britney Spears. Highly recommended for anyone interested in radio or media."},{"rating":"1","title":"What complete drivel","review":"This book merely perpetuates the many myths associated with pirate radio.

Reverend Brown, discusses the first nineteen chapters of Revelation. The book is in agreement with many others as to the menaings of some of the symbolism found in the scriptures. However, where this book really shines is in the idea that the letter to the seven churches is a prophetic picture of the church age. Historical background is utilized that cements Rev. Brown's position.It should also be noted that Rev. Brown feeels that Isreal is the focal point of the Book of Revelation (a point I fully endorse). In other words, people who feel that the Church has replaced Isreal as the chosen people may not agree with the concept presented, but I feel they should still read this book.Rev. Brown uses Scripture in correct context.I would strongly recommend thi book for any student of the Word of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"This was my first real exposure to Percy Sledge, and now I gotta taste for more!

My opinion is that you could take any song from this album have a hit. It's a crying shame Kilzer never received more acclaim than he did, although he was pretty popular in the Little Rock/Memphis area for a while. Not only was he a great song writer and musician, but a very cool dude as well who never turned down a chance to play for anyone. I saw him perform at the Pi Kappa Alpha frat house on the campus of UALR. No band - only a guitar, harmonica, and the man himself, and he is just as good live as in the studio.

It's just a shot away...\\" (the unpublicised side of all wars); and then when Mick mellows it with: \\"I said love, sister, it's just a kiss away...\\" - Beautiful.Also good to hear the studio versions of those live Get Yer Ya-Yas Out songs (Love In Vain; Live With Me; Midnight Rambler).Another must-have Stones album, from when they had variety in their music - the Wonderful Decade: 1963-1973."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when the album ends.","review":"OK, When I pressed play I was expecting to hear a rock masterpeice as so many have put it... however what I heard was anything but a masterpeice.

Being a Stones album I expected there to be plenty of country elements, but this is just a country album. Its not rock. Frankly, If you are a country fan I am sure you will enjoy it, but if you are looking for an interesting rock album, don't buy this. Its really not too impressive.

Something else that is amazing is how fast they went down hill in the late 70's.

While Beggars Banquet's restoration seemed to get more press, it's clear that the tape used to create this CD is much, much closer to source than any that's been used previously. A little experiment: turn off the left channel of your stereo, and listen to Love in Vain. Hear the guitar bleed through to the other channel? Well, this disc eliminates that...it's so clear that you can hear what sounds like construction going on in the background of that track!Get it.

I really don't think the sound quality is gonna be what they market it to be. It's definitely not going to be that good that it covers the ridiculous price that they charge.

Or at any rate, that portion of which he could still recall.Even if you never threw any rocks or did any acid, this is still a kick to listen to.

Of Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, & Exile On Main Street, I find Let It Bleed the superior. From the opening rocker 'Gimmie Shelter' to the perfect finale that is 'You Can't Always Get What You Want', Let It Bleed is a rock masterpiece. Love In Vain is THE perfect Robert Johnson cover. While I respect and immensly enjoy all of Robert Johnson's work, this is far superior to the original, because of the minor chords the Stones added to make the song more melodic. Country Hhonk is the only dispensible song on this record, and probably should have been Honky Tonk Woman. You Got The Silver is my favorite song done by Keith. Monkey Man is quite possibly on of THE BEST Stones songs ever recorded, and has my favorite breakdown of any song ever (the slide riff). YCAGWYW is a perfect ending song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Things You Need to Know","review":"1. Gimme Shelter2. Midnight Rambler3.

This is music that belongs in the analog form and the newer vinyl is too cheap and flimsy to cut the mustard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This is a new \\"SACD\\" CD, which means it will not play on your PC. If you buy this CD, you will not be able to listen to it on your PC, you will not be able to upload the tracks to an IPod player and you will not be able to rip the tracks to MP3. Record labels are pushing SACD as an \\"improvement\\" over standard CDs, hailing the sound quality as better. They've even hired \\"grassroots\\" marketeers to hail the supposed achievements of SACD on message boards like this one. Don't trust them. Sound quality isn't really what SACD is about.

Still, it is interesting to listen once again to the guys when they were at the height of their musical powers (and as high, most of the time, as Georgia pines). This album from their most creative period from 1964 to 1971, moreover, unlike let us say Bob Dylan who has produced more creative work for longer, is the \`golden era\\" of the Stone Age. While this CD has a fistful of \\"greatest hits\\" from this period and there are no really bad tracks here the stick outs are \\"Gimme Shelter\\"( as always), the title track \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"Midnight Rambler\\" and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\".

I own VHS version and I could not wait to DVD with decent quality to be released. This DVD quality is total joke. It is worse than recorded from TV or transferred from VHS to DVD. I understand this movie was not produced nor distributed by major studio. This is Canadian produced film marketed as an American film. Does it mean this movie is never gonna be released with decent quality on DVD!? I hope not.This movie had a potential to be very powerful thriller film, but script was very one demensional and failed to develop the story.

At least they made certain the advertising signs seen were in English only, whereas Montreal insists on bilinguals.The direction and the editing can best be described as smelly.

Amazon was kind enough to send another copy assuming it was just that one DVD disc and it was every bit as bad as the first one.

With just a small amount of compression the output does not vary much whether I'm 3 inches away to almost a foot away from the mic.

It definitely will not survive being immersed in water. The reflector is pretty much a joke.

For two LED's it doesn't seem to put out much light. The LED's are inside the standard cylinder of textured plastic which diffuses the light somewhat but also blasts out bits of hard light.

I was very excited to get this attachement on & not have to worry about the hassles of line anymore! I have your typical backyard with tall grass growing along the side of the house, fence & a block wall. Once I got the right product for my trimmer it was very easy to snap on. This product works great if all you are doing is trimming grass & weeds with nothing solid like rocks or walls that might be in the way. Unfortunatley as I was cutting through high grass I kept coming accross hidden rocks & everytime I hit one, either a blade would break off or the whole unit which is snapped on would come off. After this happened about 5 times I am beginning to wonder if I shouldn't just just the original line setup it came with or explore something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't install on all trimmers it says it does...","review":"The Grass Gator was supposed to end my nightmares with my string trimmer.

So now I have a brand new Grass Gator, as well as both light and heavy duty blades and they're useless to me. SO disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptions","review":"Make sure you visit Grass Gator's website to see if this unit fits your trimmer and even then be careful.

As it turns out, the blades dulled pretty quickly. It could be that the Grass Gator is made just for hittin' weeds in an open space. I was edging along my house and gardens. Anyhow, I'm not ready to say it's a bad product, but it certainly didn't do what I was hoping it would. I recommend you only buy it if you won't have it near anything that could dull the blades."},{"rating":"1","title":"The after taste is the worst ever.","review":"I tried this product about 10 years ago and again last week.

I had about 1/3 of this album on mp3 files and wanted the other songs available here.Much to my disappointment, this album does not sound very good. While completely listenable, it sounds muddy and veiled. When comparing the same track back-to-back with my mp3 files, my older files always sounded clearer with better defined bass. This was true even though the mp3 files had a lower bit rate!I am crushed, because I had hoped to obtain a \\"definitive\\" recording of these great songs.

I feel like I threw money away (though it doesn't seem there are any quality nap mats out there) and would not recommend this unless your child is skinny and less than 44 inches tall.

Apparently, nobody is checking the quality of these balls before they get sent out - I bet I ordered the same exact defective balls some other people returned!I strongly recommend either getting a medicine ball without handles or going with a different brand than Everlast if you want the handles.

But as someone who spends a great deal of time in the kitchen and with a constant stream of guests, I can say that this flatware is not only beautiful but durable and functional. While it could be slightly sturdier (ice cream frozen particularly hard will make the serving spoon bend slightly), I have gotten repeated compliments on the style and handling of the flatware and other than that slight serving spoon bend, it has held up beautifully through all sorts of different dishes. The forks in particular are worth mentioning, in that they are definetly high quality enough for those of us to tend to cut our meat with the fork edge instead of a knife; I've have no problem with any flexing or bending in that regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but elegant","review":"I love the design that conveys an elegant simplicity that goes well with any setting, whether formal or casual.

This year, I wanted to add more place settings (I only got a service for 8 the first time), so I ordered this set thinking that it would add to my current set. Unfortunately, in the last two years, Oneida has changed the manufacturer. Instead of the heavy, made in the USA set that you could purchase two years ago, Oneida is selling a similar looking lighter, made in Vietnam set. It's noticeably less good - The knives are much lighter and handles are thinner, the forks are shorter, and the serving peoples seem \\"cheap.\\" If you can get the older USA version (which by the way is the set pictured - the product that you'll receive is similar but not exact), I'd recommend it instead of this set.

Perhaps their strongest set of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third album finds an original rock 'n' roll voice","review":"After the vibrant energy of their debut (\\"In the City\\"), their second album (\\"This is the Modern World\\") was something of a disappointment. One had to wonder if Paul Weller really only had one good album in him. This third LP put that wonder firmly to rest.On \\"All Mod Cons\\" Paul Weller finds a truly original lyrical voice, based heavily on the English storytelling tradition well-worn by the likes of Ray Davies, and the band kicks in with a tremendous jump in sophistication. The love/hate of \\"To Be Someone\\" and miserable circumstance of \\"Down in the Tube Station at Midnight\\" capture the emotion of 20-something London with a closeness, a personalness, that few achieved before or after. Weller would go on to even greater brilliance (e.g., the \\"Sound Affects\\" LP), but many of his gems are here.The band's musical muscle may have been born on their debut, but \\"All Mod Cons\\" in the genesis of Paul Weller's songwriting genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cute, but arrived damaged","review":"The Memory Box itself is very cute and a good size to contain all those little newborn keepsakes.

The wood had a stress crack at the corner of the frame cutout and the upper right portion of the box and lid had a dent/scratch in it.

'Knife Play' is one of the most disturbing, depressing, and beautiful albums I've ever heard. Their sound is hard to describe, but their lead singer, Jaime Stewart, kind of sounds like Robert Smith. Musically, the band (two guys and two girls) use a multitude of instruments like synths, mandolins, drum beats, gongs, trumpets, and programming. The guitar work is excellent as well, particularly towards the end of 'Hives Hives' and 'Homonculus'. Lyrically, if you find anything darker, I don't think I'd like to hear it. Here's a snippet of their glorious song 'Suha': \\"I hate my husband, I hate my children, I'm going to hang myself...\\" Yikes. If you like your experimental pop down and dirty and are open minded to different musical art forms, 'Knife Play' will surprise you, shock you, scare the hell out of you, and maybe even comfort you."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice album","review":"This album is worth buying just for \\"She Can't Save Him\\".

This song has a classic, laid back style, and few male/female combinations in 80s R&B work as well together as James & Tawatha. However, my favorite song is \\"Sweet For You And Me (Monagamy Mix) which is basically an instrumental version of \\"You, Me & He\\".

In fact, the closing tracks on disc 1 are songs recorded live at the Budokan Hall in Japan. Two months later the Beatles were through touring. Now they could continue to develop their music even further. Here for the first time, listeners can enjoy totally new versions of songs recorded in 1965 and '66, at the height of creative minds. The emerging creative genius would soon create such powerful works as \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\" Disc 2 is full of ultra rare outtakes from that period.

The first anthology worked nicely as a cute \\"Why Did We Ever Like This?\\" reminder of just how bad this music was. Kind of like all those 'Livin in the 80s' compilations. But enough is enough. This is the 60s equivalent of Hanson today: cute, fluffy, mindless, not for people over 15.

There are some songs I had never heard, and enjoyed every track. If you like the Beatles, this is a must for your collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"great compilation!","review":"\\"Anthology 2\\" is a fine double-cd album. It simply showcases the Beatles' remarkable progression in their musical style, from the simple-structured \\"Yes It Is\\" to the complex and trance-inducing \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" (which is slower but still great as the mastered version!) and the majestic \\"A Day In The Life\\". The track selections are good, the sleevenotes are very informative, and most importantly the sound quality is excellent.It's good to know how the Beatles recorded their famous songs with such creativity, inventiveness and not to mention some sense of humor as well. Listening to this album feels like we're personally \\"witnessing\\" and hearing the band's jam sessions inside the studio, or \\"watching\\" their concerts.Overall, it's a very decent album. Definitely a must for die-hard Beatlemaniacs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for fans...but....","review":"Having grown up with the Beatles (I sat through three showings of A Hard Day's Night) this was of course a must-own for me. Is it a great album? No, not really. It's more of a curiosity. There's very little new on it- in fact, it's good evidence that the Beatles did indeed release all their good stuff. There were no hits waiting in the can.There are some great bits on this album- I love the alternate version of \\"I'm Looking Through You\\", and it's interesting to hear some of the well-known songs stripped down, with a leaner arrangement- but for the most part it's just another Beatles collectable.Buy it? Of course you should buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Anthologies","review":"Not just incomplete \\"works in progress\\" like most of Anthology one was, but rather (mostly) complete and fascinating alternate takes! I love the incredibly raw sound of \\"I Am The Walrus\\" without the overdubs, I'm Looking Through You, although different, is equally as good as its finished counterpart, and It's Only Love I feel is stronger than the Rubber Soul version. The Strawberry Fields tracks are quite amazing...do not miss this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Innovative Ride","review":"I was one of those millions that tuned into the original ABC Broadcast of Anthology and was at the record store the day of release of this event.

Encompassed with the 8 video tapes of Anthology; this series is thoroughly enjoyable to listen to as well as view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Love","review":"To some critics, this is just a grab bag of Beatles outtakes. To others like me, it's a mini-revelation of sorts, and a chance to revisit Beatles history. The milestone of this is the Beatles' final collaboration of sorts - \\"Real Love\\" - Lennon seems to drive this with real emotion and his former bandmates play with it as if they were all in the studio. It's a great, fitting tribute to the talent of the entire band.The second interesting part for me was CD 2 - the embryonic growth of Strawberry Fields Forever - revealed in three successive takes here - makes for a satisfying and different experience of the song. It feels somewhat dimensionalised.While not everything is fantastic or that different here, the Beatles were pretty consistent, and what is here makes for a complete Beatles experience. To enjoy it more, watch the companion DVD set. Worth the price of admission? Absolutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 CD's Packed Full Of Beatles Rarities and Oddities","review":"The anthology series by the Beatles has realesed tons of Beatles demos etc, that never saw the light of day, until now. On Anthology 2 you get the song, \\"Real Love\\", a song never realesed by the Beatles. You also get a rare live peformance on disc one which contains songs like, \\"Ticket To Ride\\", \\"Yesterday\\", \\"Help\\", and \\"I Feel Fine\\". You also get an extremly experimental version of, \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\", and did I mention all the demos and outtakes you get just on disc one alone. On disc two you get to hear an early version of, \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\", and some cool Sgt. Pepper demos.

Certainly this is not to disparage their brilliance within their filmic context. But I caution the potential buyer. If you're buying just one Rota score, perhaps a better choice would be to buy that of your favorite Fellini film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened ?","review":"I'm not certain why this CD is so disappointing. The selections from the films are strung together in an uninteresting way, and seem to be played at the same tempo. I plan to order Fellini soundtracks, because I love the music. Maybe a Czech symphony orchestra just can't capture Rota's sensual Italian spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Anthropological Dead End...","review":"When initially published, these essays provided a salutary textual critique of anthropology. Today they read as essays whose implications are circumscribed to the work of that generation of American cultural anthropologists who developed in the shadows of modernist giants (namely Geertz). This collection represents their mid-life crisis, rather than the field of ethnography. Most of their students (and students' students) have not repeated that generation's unreflexive ethical idealism and political naivete. This progress was not a result of these essays. The exception in this book is Tyler's innovative and actually experimental proposal for \\"writing culture\\". Otherwise, be warned. Read these critiques by baby boomer-era anthropologists with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kimmie's Very Special \\"Concept Album\\"","review":"It's important to let go of any cynicism you might have to appreciate this album fully.I am a fan of Kimmie's previous albums and at first missed the \\"gutsy rootsiness\\" present in that earlier work, as this album is musically lighter (though impeccably produced and crafted by Kimmie's son Gabe).Lyrically though, it is highly advanced and together the songs form a kind of concept album of meditations on life and death, this world and the next.The sheer positivity of the lyrics form a great recipe for living life and to see the world as Kimmie does in these songs is, in my opinion, truly a way to deep personal happiness.Kimmie is obviously not a person to be pinned down or categorised into one type of music. I look forward to discovering whatever she comes up with next and shall certainly be using this album as one of my aids to my own personal growth and happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid and Tuneless Journey","review":"After \\"West Texa Heaven\\" I was looking forward to Kimmie Rhodes' next album. Once \\"Rich From the Journey\\" was released, I waited for sample audio cuts to appear. They never materalized so I eventually took a chance. That was a mistake.I think this album was appropriatly described by a previous reviewer (Wick Smith). It is devoid of melody and nearly unlistenable. It's a big disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor From the Journey","review":"About $15 poorer.I was shocked that a CD so well received by others here, and associated in some way with Stacey Earle and Gillian Welch, could be so disappointing. This is one of the few CDs that actually made me angry as I listened to it. The lyrics are vapid \\"flower child\\" rhymes, matched perfectly to the liner visuals which are also fuzzy and incoherent. Arrangements are syrupy sweet.Musically, there is also little of interest here. It is sort of ultra-mellow folk country new age etherial wallpaper. And I have a high wisp threshold. I can happily listen to Enya or Maire Brennan, or Sarah McClaughlin. But this is even less edgy than those. Kimmie has a whispering lower register and very restricted range: something I seldom notice unless it is extreme. My verdict: this is Disney elevator dentist waiting room BGM.I'm going to read those other glowing listener comments one more time and see if I can reconcile any of it with what I heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiritualized third LP loses edge of earlier work","review":"Having so brilliantly captured the essences of West Texas on her previous LP, this effort is a huge disappointment. Rhodes abandons her edgy country sound for soft, meandering instrumentation and melodies that often go nowhere, much like new age music. The lyrical content is filled with treacly '70s spiritualism, and Rhodes often reduces her delicate voice to an overweening whisper.Those who were attracted to Rhodes' \\"West Texas Heaven\\" by the keenness of her poetic observations and the rootsy sound with which they were presented will find little to like here. Unless, of course, you also happen to like mellow, somewhat saccharine, idealism."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's different","review":"If you expect anything like Kimmie's earlier work (that I love), thendo not buy this before giving it a listen. I bought it unheard and gave it away after. This is more new age and if you like that, then this may be for you, but it did nothing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MGM dvd is the ONLY Good quality dvd release of this movie","review":"The other review on this page must be from different dvd release of this movie. My review is for the MGM dvd.This movie has fallen into public domain, so it has been released on dvd many times by many different dvd companies with many dvd covers. I have purchased other dvd releases of this movie and they all looked terrible (like vhs transfers.) But this dvd, the MGM release, is amazing, beautiful quality, and it has been remastered from the original master copy.The movie tells the story of a waitress (Lindsay Wagner) who works her way up the ladder, and eventually becomes a top publisher. She disapproves when her son marries a trashy woman (Michelle Pfeiffer).

Every one of my Sunset Annuals is spattered and bookmarked, because I use them so often.These are well bound, highly colorful editions, filled with the years collection of Sunset recipes. They are catalogued by ingredients ( vegetables, fruits,beef etc) as well as by category, so looking up a recipe is easy.The Biga Bread recipe is worth the price alone. Everything is well laid out, with lots of helpful hints to ensure success, whether you're baking a cake, or creating an exotic Asian dish.What I appreciate most about Sunset, is all their recipes are tested in their own kitchens, to make sure the average home user can recreate them easily. It gives you that extra bit of confidence when trying something new.If you want a durable, practical and highly usable cookbook, I recommend giving the Sunset Annuals a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"As others have said... buy paper locally","review":"The outfit that sold this paper did a crappy job of packaging and the corner of the ream was crushed on arrival making a third of the paper unusable. And it is worth mentioning that the \\"98\\" whiteness rating on this Hammermill product is way off. It has a yellow cast that makes it inferior to many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!","review":"Will keep this book forever. The excersizes force you to take a good, hard, honest look at the choice you made and help you to remember why the choice was right for you at that time. It felt as if it focused on the woman who experienced her abortion years earlier. I think perhaps my choice is too fresh to view so completely as the pain is deep and confusing for me still. BUT I will keep reading and rereading it until I have dealt with my issues for I believe this book can guide me to my road of peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very comforting book that also makes you think.","review":"I have experienced multiple losses and the stories in this book gave me inspiration and hope.

At times I felt (and still do) like I was going totally crazy and my feelings were unjustified or an overreaction.Kim Kluger-Bell made me understand and realise that my feelings are normal and felt by many other women out there. The way she described many of the feelings and thoughts about other people could have very well be written about myself. I could really relate to what she was saying and she has made me understand that nothing is wrong with me - the problem is with society!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $1 I paid for it","review":"This book is not worth the $1 I paid for it. Instead of being a cohesive guide for those suffering pregnancy loss, it is a jumble of random case histories of traumatized individuals that only occasionally mentions the devastation of each individual's pregnancy loss. Pages and pages of these complicated and largely unrelated and irrelevant case histories replaces content on coming to terms with and coping with the devastation of pregnancy loss. I have read a lot of books since losing my son to stillbirth, and this book is hands down the least helpful and the greatest waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of clear focus - not helpful after my miscarriage","review":"The book contained a lot of information that I didn't need or want to hear about. The author goes into great detail about pregnancy and abortion but spends little time on spontaneous abortion. Some of the subjects were not comforting to me in the weeks following my miscarriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to make the loss of miscarriage equivalent to abortion.","review":"There is a fundamental difference between someone who wants but loses the baby and someone who doesn't want a baby and chooses to abort the baby. The author tries to make the loss of miscarriage equivalent to that of abortion. Regardless of one's view of abortion rights, the book cheapens the loss that a mother feels from a miscarriage by suggesting that a mother who chooses to abort a baby is going through the same loss.This books is not going to help anyone who is feeling the loss of their unborn baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insensitive approach","review":"My son was stillborn at 26 weeks, and this was one of the books I looked at in the aftermath. I had been too upset to notice the word \\"abortion\\" in the title, so it wasn't until I was paging through the book -- and reading about a woman who chose to abort her child -- that it hit me. The author was actually treating what happened to me -- my very much wanted child died due to a cord accident -- with those women who choose to abort their children. I do think that a book dealing with the emotional aftermath of abortion would be a good topic to explore, and it might be very helpful to those women how have had abortions. But I view the death of my child as an unbearable and tragic loss, and to treat my loss the same as an abortion is not only tacky, its cruel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisting the Beatles","review":"Return to the Beatles . I say this only because it means it is not an alblum but out takes in the studio . It show you haw talented John Lennon and Paul McCartney were as wing songs and if you like to revisit history of Rock and Roll when the Beatles wereat thier top . You have to buy all three to see how they grew up as young lads from the night clubs in Germany to American soil . Its fun to listen to john as he fiddle with the notes to a song. I am note a good writer but I know quality when I see it. I grew up with the Beatles, my self and my cousin got an album every year for the holidays.

Not the original songs","review":"You might think that you are getting your favorite Beatles songs here, but beware that most of them actually are rehearsal versions, different takes (some of them partial), there are several different takes of the same song here and there, and sadly, some of the most popular songs' original versions are missing (again, replaced by annoying rehearsal versions). You are MUCH better of buying separate albums than collecting this hodgepodge of \\"takes\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to the Stones instead","review":"Sadly enough, the Beatles were never as good as The Rolling Stones. They just never reached their heights in excellence.The majority of the songs recorded by the Beatles were silly and childesh. The Beatles are one of the most overrated bands in history. Their finished albums are not even very good so how could their bloopers be any better? This is a dull album from one of the worst bands in all history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles From The Beginning","review":"When Anthology I was released in late 1995, it spawned a second round of Beatlemania. The album explores the band in it's infancy as we get a chance to listen to their earliest known recordings, from their Cavern and Hamburg days to their first demos and audition tapes. We get little snippets of dialogue from the band and Brian Epstein and live performances from after they started to get big. despite the fact some of the sound quality is below par, it is a real treat to hear the roots of the band. You can almost picture in your mind what it must have been like to have been back in those days. Even though the band had broken up 25 years earlier, the public still couldn't get enough of the Beatles as the album became their first ever to debut at number one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason this stuff was never released...","review":"Because it was bad! I am a lifelong Beatles fan, but I was incredibly disappointed with this collection when it came out, and 4 1/2 years later I'm still disappointed. Are we that hard up to hear The Beatles that we'll dig up any garbage they ever did? Just because these tracks are historical doesn't mean they are necessarily good. The only track I play from this set is Free As A Bird, a song which brought tears to my eyes when I first heard it, and still does even after the past few years. It deserves 5 stars on its own. The rest of the disc is quite average, I'll stick to the finished versions that The Beatles wanted out, not this rubbish. George Harrison even called this type of material just \\"scraping of the barrell for all the Beatles tracks people can find.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the hardcore fans","review":"Being pretty much forced to surrender my gift certificate to this rather than \\"Mellon Collie\\", I was almost put off the Beatles right off the bat. I didn't like this CD. Aside from \\"Free as a Bird\\" and some of the later tracks nearing their creative golden age, I just didn't like the songs. Maybe I'm picking bones, but at the time I wasn't a hardcore-enough fan to go ga-ga over 15 second snippets of interviews with John Lennon and some bad-sounding demos. Historic significance didn't really mean much to me back then, and it still doesn't today. Perhaps one day I will give this album a thorough listen to see if I like it, but the last time I listened to it, it still didn't click with me. Stick with the next two Anthologies, especially number 2: two discs of embryonic genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"in mono only! only for die hard fans!","review":"watch out!the songs were mixed & recorded in mono only with the bonus rough /poor studio chats, poor outtakes! where is another lennon's unreleased song? free as abird is not the only one unreleased track! there are many more Lennon lost tapes which do not appear in this cd.the cover is interresting but I dont like the recording of poor outtakes what George martin did in the EMI company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles Revisited","review":"If you love the Beatles and want to listen to some of their lesser-known tunes, this is the album for you. It starts with my favorite, \\"Free as a Bird\\". You will hear speeches by John Lennon, Brian Epstein, and Paul McCartney. Did you know that they recorded \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" and \\"The Sheik of Araby\\"? This album is full of surprises. I would have liked to have known all the song titles before ordering this album, but surprises can be a lot of fun. This is a 2-disc album with 60 tunes for your enjoyment. I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of a long overdue Anthology series","review":"What you have here are songs that are outakes or unfinished in one way or another.Several are historical songs of the Beatles very early on that were recorded on Tape Recorders and do not have the sound quality.What is interesting is that you get to hear them do songs by their idols, such as Buddy Holly and others.The songs on the CD are from the early parts of their career.Most of the songs with minor changes are very much like they appeared on their perspective albums.Freebird is also on here and along with Real Love is the first new Beatles recording in 26 years. That alone is worth the price of the CD.Another song of note is the recording of One After 909.This version in my opinion is actually better than the one that appeared later on Let It Be.There are some live recordings as well.If you are into the historical aspects of music this is a must for any Beatles collector. And for Rock and Roll historians this is a must also"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Apples","review":"A generous helping of great unreleased early material from the Fab Four. This may not be up to the standards set by the studio albums but it is a fascinating and scholarly look back to their early days up to the full flourish of Beatlemania. On its own merit, it is an enjoyable listening experience with a lot of unreleased Beatle music. With the release of the the Anthology series, the number of Beatle songs has almost doubled. Is there any more in the vaults? I have trashed out the Beatles' CD booklets on Amazon.Com in the past but for the Anthology series, they did a spendid job. Hopefully, Capitol will get around to upgrading the CD booklets of the regular releases...someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a legal collection of the best Beatles outtakes!!!","review":"The Beatles Anthology is the best CD a Beatles fan could wish for. It has a wide variety of outtakes of their live performances and studio recordings. It's interesting to hear how many of The Beatles' best songs started out in the studio and blossomed into the style and warmth that was theirs alone. Rare live performances are fun to listen to - they give you a real feel of what Beatlemania was all about. There are also brief excerpts from John, Paul, and the group's manager, Brian Epstein. Listen for the Beatles' earlist recordings and also George Harrison's first song. To top it off a colorful booklet with many pictures comes along with it, telling you much information about each track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moldy Oldies!","review":"A fascinating look into the early Beatles, before they could afford good gear. Get this set, if only to hear Leave My Kitten Alone. The live recordings offer an insight into how huge Beatlemania was. Consider this more for glimpses into the early years than for great music, and you will not be disappointed.As for Free As A Bird, it is the least reason to buy the set. Sounds more like ELO than the fab four."},{"rating":"2","title":"DBeatles are so lovely","review":"Lets face it people; their will be no other band as good as the Beatles were. Sure The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan were all great but this is the band that changed the world. The Beatles Anthology Volume 1 is a terrific choice of purchase for any and every body who loves the Beatles as much as I do. Ill admit it, Iam a KoRn fan who is 17. But these guys are so good Im not afraid to admit it. Paul McCartney is the greatest vocalist of all time. Its just a horrible thing John Lennon died. Sad sad thing.

But there still having some problems (aside from John Taylor leaving), the lyrical content is kinda lacking. Aside from the lyrics it is a great lisen, you do not have to be a Duranie to enjoy this album. The first track on Madazzaland is great, this is what the band needs to experiment with, more instrumentals and playing smaller venues (the seven and the ragged tiger days are over guys). I feel if they played clubs (when promoting this album and the ones to come) and focusing on the lyrical content this record could have been a great \\"underground\\" hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shafted Masterpiece","review":"Unfortunately the Boys' can't shake the \\"Boy Band\\" title from critics. Medazz. is chock full of poetry and skillful musicianship. In my opinion, best release since the early 80's. The ideal \\"hit\\" from this album would surely be \\"Out Of My Mind\\" which can also be found on The Saint soundtrack. It's sexy, sultry and quite powerful! True Duran form all the way to the \\"Save A Prayer\\" sample at the end. All around, Medazz. is an amazing effort that was sadly overlooked by the press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"It is so different from the Duran Duran I've known.. it's got nothing to do with \\"the reflex\\" nor any song from \\"the wedding album\\" nor \\"thank you\\", most of the songs sound as if you were listening a dialogue between a modem and a fax, space sounds, more like you are talking with R2D2 from Star Wars... When I first played I couldn't believe I had wasted my money like that, then I thought, maybe I can give it to someone else as a gift, but I would feel ashamed of giving such a low cd.... I must admit that the only song that is worth is \\"Out of my mind\\", but since I already had \\"The Saint\\" soundtrack I already had this song.. so it was meaningless to have this cd... please buy anything else but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Duran fan but this one is a letdown.","review":"Along with Pop Trash this is a poor effort. Not really anything that stands out and that includes Electric Barbarella. These guys are always willing to try something new and I think this time it just backfired. Glad that JT is back in the band and although WC is a great guitarist and did an amazing job on the wedding album I think it was time to part ways with him. The last two disc - Astronaut & Red Carpet Massacre show that the band is as fresh as ever and back to making top notch melodic pop songs....leaving behind the lackluster days of Medazzaland & Pop Trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"good enough 4 me","review":"well,i think duran are a very talented group,and therefore i gave 4 stars. butnot all the songs on here are that great like silva halo,& midnight sun. i do however find myself singing along to great songs like big bang generation,electric barbarella,and even undergoing treatment! so it's worth the dough pick up a copy today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper and Deeper...","review":"This overlooked album is deliciously odd, bouncing between contrasts of organic acoustics and dissonant electronica. It definitely does not come off as a rushed production, featuring layers of effects and instrumentation that must have taken months to construct. Simon never sounded more relaxed and flexible. Drum tracks are tight, confident and rhythmically fascinating. This has been a favorite of mine since its release, and I can confirm that stands as of 2009.The boys were not radio favorites at the time, but don't let marketing failures dissuade you from this experience. Take Medazzaland around the block for a spin. You'll love where it takes you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MEDAZZALAND","review":"I am a huge fan of this band. From the start I proudly have all the recordings I could find, even the b-sides from across the Atlantic. Arcadia is absolutely brilliant. That was just Simon and Nick.So not having the original lineup is not a reason why I cant stand Medazzaland. It is like an undercooked frozen pizza. Its like they just put it out cuz they had to put out something. Maybe they were still mourning the loss of John Taylor, (one of the two founding members who quit the band half way through the recording of Medazzaland because he was tired of being in this group) and finished it just to be done with that forever to come out project.In any case I grade it a D+. A couple good songs, but mostly undercooked filler. And while I have bought CDs for a couple good songs, I expect more from these creative geniuses.

Madazzaland being the greater of the two, this cd continues to inspire more and more fans as time moves on.

The beginning of the book was interesting. But then it became complicated and boring. There were too many details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally! A Dean Acheson biography, but there's nothing new","review":"After reading countless books about Cold War history, I noticed that there weren't any objective and comprehensive biographies of the former Secretary of State. So it was with much anticipation that I read Mr. Chace's book.Did I learn anything new about Mr. Acheson and did Mr. Chace's biography reveal any discoveries? Yes and no. This book is simply a long compilation of facts published into a book.But the book does give piercing insight into how people of prestige and high social class are constantly given benefits that they did not earn or deserve. Mr. Acheson somehow attended the prestigious Groton school, then Yale, and then Harvard Law School despite the \\"gentlemen's C's\\" throughout his educational career (as described by Mr. Chace). Of course, anyone else would have been labelled \\"lazy\\" or not \\"getting with the program.\\" I am glad to see that, in his day, a double-standard was set for Mr. Acheson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Read","review":"Acheson is a great biography and a splendid introduction to Cold War history. Unlike most political biographers, Chace manages to render a full portrait of Acheson without getting bogged down in the minutiae of his long and extraordinary public life.Prior to this book, my impression of Acheson was as the Ultimate Cold Warrior. Chace reveals him to be a far more complex and ultimately heroic character than that moniker would suggest. Aside from the Cold War chapters, what I found most fascinating were the details of Acheson's relationship with Oliver Wendell Holmes and the influence the old jurist had on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"I loved I, CLAUDIUS, and I was really looking forward to reading CLAUDIUS THE GOD. Unfortunately, I felt that this one pales in comparison to the original. The story of Herod Agrippa at the beginning of the book was very interesting, but Graves rapidly gets bogged down in tedious details as he describes Claudius' reign. He has a tendency to delve into anecdotes and engage in needlessly complex narrative structures. Although there are some amusing and interesting stories spread throughout, I felt Graves took way too much time building up exposition and describing every little detail. Overall, I was disappointed with CLAUDIUS THE GOD and vastly prefer the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not was good as \\"I, Claudius!\\"","review":"I was very excited to pick up the conclusion of the story of Claudius told so brilliantly in the first book, I, Claudius. The second book in the series fell short. For me, far short. It simply spent too much time on various campaigns, foreign lands and peoples. I was much more enthalled by the Rome-centric approach of the first book and quite often became board by the second. In fact, once I hit about page 400, I had to start skimming paragraphs and I only chose to read the parts that directly related to Rome. Not highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"if you are considering reading this book, make sure you read I, CLaudius first, that is a must. Then read Claudius the God.

Claudius/Graves rationalizes that Nero will be such a bad emperor that the people will have no choice but to reinstate the republic.This is the most idiotic logic imaginable, and it is out of character. All through the novel Claudius has shown himself brisk and firm in decision making. Claudius was perfectly capable of retiring and re-instating the republic, and yet he (according to Graves) chose not to do so because he felt that Rome needed a really bad emperor first!So, the novel was spoilt for me.Can someone please explain why Claudius behaved so uncharacteristically and bizarrely at the end of this novel? Otherwise, this masterpiece novel is ruined for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Claudius the God is good - I would recommend it to anyone - but it is not as good as the first book, 'I, Claudius'"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book helps the Roman History scholar","review":"When I finished \\"I, Claudius\\" I HAD to go out and get \\"Claudius the God\\", because I had to find out what was going to happen to Claudius.

Though not quite up to that first book in intrigue and overall flow, it is still a great book in its own right.There is a lot of rich descriptions of battles undertaken by the now Emperor Claudius that stretch for many pages. Also, Claudius has to deal with the betrayal of his friend Herod as well as his scheming wife Messalina (along with her debaucheries) while Claudius' advisor Pallus is also trying to usurp him.Claudius' grand scheme to eliminate the monarchy and restore the Republic spawns the evil Nero (though he is not quite as evil as Caligula). Should not be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You go, Graves","review":"The historical conceptions of the rule of Claudius have changed since olden times, and I think Graves might have had a hand in this. Previously, Claudius was considered a deceitful and inept ruler but is now thought of as shrewd and honest.Regardless of which school is correct, this two book series is incredible. I found the sequel more entertaining than the first, because we finally get to see Claudius at the head of the Roman state-something that I, Claudius led up to for its entirety.These are great books with both powerful, endearing and repulsive characters. I look forward to my next Graves book."},{"rating":"2","title":"...only three comments","review":"Although I can't say enough about how great this novel is, I'll limit myself to three comments:1. Along with I, Claudius, perhaps one of the greatest historical novels written in the English language that also passes muster as serious literature- both humorous and poignant at turns; thoroughly researched, based on all historical writings available to Graves at the time.2. I absolutely recommend you read I, Claudius first. Much of what is implied in Claudius the God is from the first novel-it will also make the payoff of Claudius the God that much sweeter.3. It's a dense read, and you may find the first 100 pages confusing, but don't give up until you reach pg. 252 in the Vintage International edition, or Chapter 16 which starts \\"Britain lies in a northerly position... From that point, the novel becomes a virtual page turner, hard to put down, and Grave's genius as both a writer and historian were reaffirmed to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this copy","review":"On recieving the copy of SUNFLOWER,from AMAZON.COM, produced by \\"New Star Video\\" I immediatly felt that I am in for a surprise, as the cover intrigued me.

The plot is melodramatic and predictable, the photography is kitschy, the acting (even Sophia's and Marcello's) mostly wooden--but then who could deliver such melodramatic dialog with any conviction?

Instead, the narrator jumps back and forth, following four characters, brothers and sisters, over the course of a few weeks.

My bedside table is almost as high as my bed, and with the added height of this radio, the digital readout totally disappears when I put my head on the pillow! To check the time, I have to lift my head UP out of the pillow in order to see the readout. This is the case on all three brightness settings.

You can set up to 3 different times for the alarms to go off 1 utilizing the radio, 1 the cd player and 1 the buzzer. The only thing I have found to be quite annoying with it is that the cd alarm function is quite limited. You set a track to play off the cd you have and it will play that track and only that track to wake you up unless you change it. Additionally, when you press snooze it turns it off rather than say pausing it so if you are like me and hit snooze one or two times before waking, it keeps playing the beginning of the one track you selected so instead of pausing the song so you don't hear the same 30 seconds of the intro to the song EVERY time the alarm goes off.

There is nothing easy about this clock, and the features are lacking. For example, once you set the alarm, it is very easy to un-set it, so you need to make sure it is set before you go to bed every night. And the three alarm modes are radio, buzzer, and CD...not multiple alarms that can be set to go off sequentially. Also, the user interface is not intuitive, so I would not recommend this clock for anyone who has trouble setting up a DVD player.The other issue is that is clock is pretty big.

The quartet is worth hearingIt is tuneful and melodic and dramatic and really belongs in the collections of those interrested in modern music.please excuse typos i have a neurologic disease"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool gun","review":"This a good light gun. the shotgun reload at the bottom is really cool.

There are velcro inserts that allow you to change the shape of the main compartment, which are very useful. My preference would be to have a twitch more padding on the bottom and sides, but this is typical of all camera bags, so I don't see it is a defect with this particular product.

Stine has released two novels now in the past two months; Dangerous Girls, which was released for teens. And also, The Sitter, Stine's second adult novel. Both are winners in their own respects.This book is written more along the lines of Fear Street, but Stine adds some more \\"mature themes\\" (sexual references, some language, drinking). But it also makes the story more \\"believable\\" as well.The only reason I do not give this book five stars is because I do not believe it reached its full potentional; the novel is very interesting and for the most part very suspenseful. But after reading, I feel like there could have been more.Still, never the less, a great book to pick up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enticing cover, undeveloped story","review":"I would not recommend this vampire book by Robert Lawrence Stine to my teen readers.

Twin sisters? that's so damn common it makes me want to yawn. Or maybe take a nap. then the transformation is poorly discribed even though it's an important part of the story. Oh and let's not forget the poor friends who die one by one and no one really cares.

I think this book stunk and I was really disappointed.I have read a lot of vampire fiction and I feel that this book was a real let down.I would not recommend this book to anyone.

The quality of the product is poor. Not a fan at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ned's head a little dissappointing","review":"I was a bit dissappointed with the head as it appears to have some stuffing in the picture, but is basically just fabric over a frame in reality. I imagined a loosely stuffed head that would require some searching for the items, however, once the game has been played it is pretty easy to find the piece by feeling around and choosing what to take out. I purchased this for my 5 year old nephew, and he had the hang of it in about 30 mins of play. The pieces while they sound gruesome, (ie. an icky tooth, and a lab rat) are in fact hard plastic, I think it would have been better if there was differences in the materials some gooey and softer ones that felt more yucky so that kids would have more fun playing, like if it was fun just putting your hand in the head to search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ned's head","review":"I was very disappointed in the \\"new\\" \\"What's in Ned's Head\\" game. I had seen older versions where the head was stuffed and the children could not see what was inside. This newer version is not stuffed, more like a tent, actually, and my kindergarten students, whom I bought it for, could see the objects in it before actually having to feel for them. I had hoped to use it for letter and numeral recognition games, but it was with great difficulty that we played with the pieces included. I spent money that was donated to my classroom (plus some of my own) to purchase this game and, had I known about the change, would never have purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Thought it sounded cute for my 4 year old and 7 year old.

As a practical matter this means that Ned's Head is not the big puffy thing they show on the box. It's rather a flattened, disfigured head that looks like it's been run over by a truck. You can still make it stand up well enough to play the game, but overall the manufacturing is very, very cheap. I regret that Santa brought this &*^%$#*& thing, and being Santa, now he's gotta make it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fun at all","review":"We got this game for several age levels from 2-8.

No thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun game! Great for the little kids.","review":"I bought this game because I remember, as a kid, playing a game called Feely Meely. I've looked everywhere for that game and couldn't find it. Well, this is it, only with a silly, plush head. I remembered as a young person loving the game, because it was an easy and fun game that you just have to feel around in a mysterious box to find the item on the card.

It is just weird enough to be something the whole family wanted to play with. We were disappointed in the following: Ned's head is polyester stretched over a flimsy metal frame. The fiber filling comes out through the shoddy seamwork. The items one is supposed to \\"find\\" in Ned's head are beyond cheap: the disgustingly cool looking cotton swab completely fell apart with the first round of the game; the plastic screw is hollow and came crushed; \\"the vomit doesn't even have any brown chunks in it!\\", exclaimed my daughter.All in all, we were completely disappointed in this game as the potential was definitely there. Play it once and stash it or convert it into a mask for next Halloween's trick or treating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should've made it myself!","review":"Not a big hit, really. It would be just as good to take a bunch of small toys or things around the house-put them in a bag or box- and take turns trying to find the particular item just by feel. It would have the same benefits, probably better quality, and just as much appeal (probably more because my kids found it more amusing to find things to add to Ned's Head- than actually playing with Ned's Head). I guess for the price I shouldn't complain- but now I have ANOTHER toy collecting dust on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Bad and Super Funny","review":"Buddies looking for fun. This movie provides lots of laughs in the misadventures of these not so bad kids looking for fun.

The writers and actors caught the essence of young guys on the prowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, touching and sweet","review":"The best thing is this comedy by far is the performance by Seth Rogen as one half of a crazy cop couple. On the whole, this is not the best comedy film ever and it feels a little confused at times. By that I mean, is it trying to be a bittersweet tale of what it is like to be just leaving school, or a madcap zany all out laugh-fest?It seems to be a combination of the two, but an enjoyable combination nevertheless. Although it doesn't quite reach the heights of Knocked up, Superbad features some endearing performances from new talent such as Michael Cera.I would urge you to give this film a chance, it will certainly be a rewarding evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supergood!!!","review":"This takes high school mayhem to a whole new level. This uncovers the lives of two best friends who would by all meanings of the word \\"geek\\" would apply to.

Through many, many twisted and faild plots, will these two succede? Can even the great McLovin have a shot at helping these two?This movie has plenty of places where you will be laughing so hard, you sides will hurt.

Go see this movie if you like knocked up and 40 year old virgin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I'm at a total loss as to why this film did so well at the box office. Unless the use of profanity every other word is funny and I'm just too far over the hill to think so. This film was average at best. If it wasn't for the kid who changed his name, the film would have been a total bust. However, the most shocking thing that happened to me during this movie is my 19 year old wanted to leave 15 minutes after it started because she felt is was both gross and stupid. I'm glad others enjoyed it. I guess that's why we go see for ourselves instead of just listening to what others think. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Worst Movies I Ever Saw!","review":"Super Bad was one of the worst movies I ever saw.

I liked \\"Super Troopers\\", it was definitely not the most mature movie but that was some of it's charm.This movie seemed like it was written by 13 year olds for other 13 year olds. Absolutely awful.The jokes were almost directly plagiarized from \\"American Pie\\" (which I also thought was a waste of time) they both had no redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"S U P E R B A D !!!","review":"Yep, title pretty much sums up this turkey. Only teens would titter at this juvenile garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly funny with a touching ending","review":"As a typical teen movie, I did not expect much beyond pranks and crude humor. But guess what, I ended up watching this movie twice !!! This movie is somewhat in the league of \\"Airplane\\" series of movies where you discover something new everytime you watch it.The movie has a simple theme of two about-to-graduate high-school teens looking for some \\"action with the other sex\\" that will prepare them for college. The movie has a good pace that does not make you frantic or bored at the same time. The mix of characters that come along the way (Geeky \\"McLovin\\", two dumb cops who are kids at heart) makes this movie a bit complex and well balanced.And the ending is great. I could probably see this movie again. It is well worth your time and would make a good candidate for your video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Have Neither The Technology Nor Steady Hands...","review":"I went into this movie with less than zero expectations. I admit, I typically run screaming from movies of this genre. They are usually stupid to the point of missing comedy entirety (ex: any of the American PIe schlock). Superbad, however, turned out to be surprisingly funny. This film redeemed the \\"teenage comedy\\" genre. With a message that reaches beyond the enormity of its sophomoric humor, Superbad will leave the viewer with a good feeling of entertainment. I wish this movie had been marketed differently and perhaps it would have reached an even wider audience. Let us not downplay the rampant profanity and sexual innuendo that pervades this film. But come on, it's about three, not-so-cool, high school seniors. And oh yeah, it's called FICTION for a reason. Watch it for what it is and ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"With fowl language beyond what even Martin Scorsese could conjure up","review":"Every now and again you hit on a worthy \`coming of age' comedy and Superbad is one of those. It isn't hysterically funny from start to finish, but when it does funny it does it well. More importantly it has a bucket load of new talent and a script worth a hoot.If you want to find a film that helps you remember the days when your parties slowly came to a stop and your friends went their own separate ways, then Superbad is that and then some more. Be warned though, Superbad gets downright dirty and filthy for the most of it. Prepare to leave your innocents at the door and enjoy some good natured profanity on steroids.Supergood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but....","review":"The beginning of the movie was very good and funny, towards the middle it was boring and too long.

There are occasions where they add to a scene and it actually makes it less funny than it was in the theater. I, personnaly would recommend the rated version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest movie Ever","review":"This is far and a way the funniest movie I have ever seen. I have probably seen the movie and the special features 20 times. As a kid who is now a freshman in college it so accurately matches the way kids think.

To me, it just wasn't funny. Although I love the character McLovin because he is so weird, I still wouldn't see this again nor buy it on DVD. I gave it two stars because there were a few parts that made me chuckle or smile, and I did think it clever the many manifestations of a certain male part Seth had drawn, however, that was it.

What is funny, however, are the reviews people have written calling this film \\"highbrow,\\" \\"subtle,\\" \\"sophisticated.\\" I guess if you don't throw in a kick between the crotch joke you've suddenly been elevated to the status of Woody Allen. This film is basically 90 minutes of non stop body organ jokes. Scenes run on and on where people just talk, which wouldn't be bad if they actually had something interesting to say. At least \\"Knocked Up\\" put its juvenile infatuation into the context of a story with relatively complex characters - big emphasis on \\"relatively.\\" This is a lot of recycled material that Knocked Up and the the 40 Year Virgin already played to death. Seth Rogan a genius? The guy is stuck in some strange, twisted boys only summer camp world for the arrested developed. It's like watching Mick Jagger at 60 plus years old squeeze into leather pants.

I love movies like There's Something About Mary, Dumb & Dumber, and even the Toxic Avenger movies (just to show you the level of humor I like)... however, I don't think I laughed more than once during this entire movie. Even then, it was a weak, forced laugh out of sympathy. The movie seemingly had no story whatsoever and it bored me to death. I really couldn't have cared less about the characters. A plane could've crashed on them and killed them all and I wouldn't have cared. Actually, I think I would've cheered because it would have signaled an end to this mess.I can't imagine why this is considered such a funny movie. It's nothing but three obnoxious, stupid teens trying to get alcohol. Just stroll on down to your local 7/11 and you can see that for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother!","review":"I thought when I watched this film I would get a few laughs out and I don't think I even chuckled. I have no idea what the big hype about this film was becasue I was completly bored all the way through. It was an unrealistic plot and I really did not care what happened to the characters. The film is basically about these three school students who are about to graduate and they are wanting to get with these girls from school. They think the way to do that is to buy them alcohol for a party. From there a whole lot of not so interesting things happen until they finally get to the party.

If you like hearing the F-bomb dropped hundreds of times (hilarious), people being spit on (how entertaining), police drinking while driving (it may happen in real life, but it's not funny), people being hit by cars and getting right up from it (knee slapping), and one of the main characters drawing male organs in an assortment of ways (why didn't any of the great comedy writers come up with this one sooner?), this is your movie. For me, it was a waste of time. I am not a prude, but if this is what passes for entertainment, our society is in deep doo doo. In the future, I will avoid any movie promoting itself as being associated with the makers of \\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\\" or \\"Knocked Up.\\" I've learned my lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie lives up to it's title!","review":"This has to one of the worst teen movies I have ever seen!I guess you have to under 30 years to like it.This film seemed as though much thought wasn't given at all.I am a fan good teen movies ,but this wasn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"the biggest waste of time ever","review":"I enjoyed Juno, and I enjoyed Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, so I thought I'd watch Superbad because of Michael Cera. Especially since it was a big deal for some reason, I mean McLovin shirts and everything? Well I couldn't even wait until the end of the movie to write a review for this horrible movie. It's just ending, thank God. For most of the movie I've been just watching to see if it gets better. It doesn't. I did not laugh once, which is fine- Eternal Sunshine was labeled as a comedy and I didn't laugh, but it's still a great movie- not the case here.Maybe if I were twelve I would have thought this was hilarious, but if I were twelve it wouldn't be appropriate for me to even see this. I can't wrap my brain around these five star reviews. Easily one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in my life. Right up there with \\"Out Cold\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Funniest Movies Of 2007!","review":"Now on Blu-ray dvd (NOT HD-DVD) is the comedy hit Superbad.

I watched a lot of adult comedy movies so I thought when I didn't like this, \\"it's just bad.\\" It's not bad though, I was just too young. Now I am the same exact age as the main characters and I laughed so hard. It's touching in some ways"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy it as much as other Apatow films","review":"I didn't really like this as much as Knocked Up or 40 Year Old Virgin; it just didn't hit the mark for me. However, if you like this movie and are wondering about the quality of the streaming video, that was great. It worked very well and the picture was nice and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Crude and vulgar,that's how i like my comedies.Filled with laughs.Jonah Hill brings on the funny and Michael Cera just adds condensed milk to the already sweet product.Must watch when one is feeling down,cause this will pick you up and sit you on a pedestal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"McLovin rules","review":"McLovin really steals the show from those other two guys on the cover. Jonah Hill's character is sheer vermin in this film, but his character gets what he deserves. Loads of laughs, but not something I'd watch in front of anyone with a shred of decency (not that I associate with those types of people anyway). Cool bonus feature seeing my heroes Bootsie Collins and Bernie Worrel, although somewhat boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet movie- sucky commentary","review":"Superbad is a surprisingly sweet story with very loveable characters. Plenty of vulgarity, but you knew that going in. If you don't want to hear the eff-word, or hear gross and tasteless (and honest) portrayals of adolescent boys talking (obsessing) about sex, then you'll hate this movie. Me? I loved it. Very sweet. Interesting story, funny script, and GREAT characters, with great performances all around. McLovin is unforgettable, and isn't that the mark of a great movie? Note: Although it doesn't affect your enjoyment of the movie itself, at all, the commentary on this really SUCKS. No direction to their pointless remarks, which don't really seem to be about the movie we're watching while they blather on. Zzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbad!","review":"This movie was great.

It was crude and awful and will probably appeal to teenage boys, but didn't to this twenty-something woman.

I found it completely unwatchable.It is not just lewd and vulgar but demeaning to men, to women, to humanity.The plot is asinine, the dialogue gross and not funny.I can appreciate bawdy humor as much as the next person. There's lots in Chaucer. But this demeans the intelligence of all who watch it.Far from aspiring to be our best selves, this movie glorifies our worst selves.I would be depressed if I thought this movie represented the next generation. Fortunately, I know from my own kids and their friends that it represents only the worst of their generation -- not the best, not even the average."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is One Stinky Movie","review":"After hearing all the hype, I decided to buy the Blu-ray version of Superbad without seeing it in the theater first. It was on sale so I figured, what the heck? Big mistake! This movie really stinks! I was expecting something more like Revenge Of The Nerds and all I got was this unfunny piece of garbage. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes it is Superbad, Superbad movie","review":"All this movie was, was teenagers swearing! It is extremly innappropriate. It is a coming of age movie that is so uncomfortable to be listening to. All of the characters say the F word or something even worse. The characters would be more likable if there wasnt swearing. I can take a movie with a little swearing, but every line had a swear word in it. I understand that they are trying to make more like modern times, but it just seemed to over do it too much.

Wow, now I have to re-consider Knocked Up.In the movie 3 high schoolers are Solely responsible for supplying alcohol for a party. So a party of about 50-100 people didn't know ONE person who was 21???????The movie was actually better when looking away from the TV. Has North American comedy sunk so low? Oh and the guys on the cover are goo goo over each other....nuff said.One star too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title pretty much sums it up!","review":"This movie was just plain bad. Basically every other word was \\"FU.K\\" which meant that there was no time left for an actual story line. A few times is ok. But after the 1000th time, it is just monotonous and just plain filler for the lack of imagination on the part of the script writers. If I could give it 0 stars, I would. I wish I could get my $20 bucks for movie tickets and my wasted 2 hours of my life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super-Vulgar and Boring.","review":"I love a good comedy. Toilet humor, belching, farting, sex, teen issues. All good. Cursing is fine too BUT NOT EVERY 2 SECONDS! I have to ask. To what end was the F word used in every sentence??? Not even Tony Soprano says it THAT MUCH!But then I figured, OK, maybe the funny parts will kick in and make it all worth it. Wrong again. There was one 2 second funny part in this whole miserable piece of schlock.I don't know from what planet people think this was good. I laughed more during Hostel.............Exactly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baaad","review":"This was filled with profanity and sexual situations.Couldn't watch it with anyone else in the room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but only the first couple times around","review":"Seth and Evan are on a mission to hook up with the girls they like before moving on to college. In order to do that, they have to score booze and get to the right party while the gettin' is good. On the way, they have a run-in with some incompetent cops that might just make or break their dreams.This movie cracked me up the first time I saw it. The second time around it was pretty funny too; but after that it got really stale. You know those classic comedies that you can watch over and over and always laugh the same amount. Movies like The Big Lebowski or Dumb and Dumber. Those are classic comedies. Superbad falls short of the bar set by movies like that. It's still really funny though. I recommend renting it at the very least. It's definitely worth watching, but only once or twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very few funny moments","review":"The teen comedy has really gone down hill. Since 'Napoleon Dynamite' we've been deluged with very average films that are labeled genius b/c of a few catch phrases or gross images. The whole genera is a ripped off and extremely dumbed down series of 'Rushmore' remakes. 'Superbad' is right there with the rest of them. You laugh a few times, but mostly it's just woooden acting mixed with overemotive acting, mixed with tired nether regions humor. McLovin is not funny. The big fat kid is terrible and certainly not funny. The other kid is great in 'Arrested Dev,' but in movies seems to languish in his own quicksandish personality. I don't know if it's a bit or not, but eventually he'll need to branch out from the same guy we laughed at....how many years ago? Look, I'm as big a fan as anyone of nether regions humor, but it's a craft that seems to have been lost. This movie is generally boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"F%^king funny!","review":"I never had a chance to see it in the theatre and bought it because of great reviews from friends and i can easily say... this is one of the funniest movies of the year and is one of those movies on the top of my favorite list.Blu-ray quality was inbetween good and great. I love bright colors and good contrast and i felt like the movie didn't shine in those area's. Dont get me wrong, the quality was still satisfying, i just wouldn't put it as a blu-ray demo.Sound quality was good too. Even though it wasn't an action movie it took advantage of my surround sound.Extras: I put N/A because i haven't watched everything. I'll update it when i have the chance.All in all: Superbad is worth the dough and should be in everyone's BD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess if you're a fan of clerks 2","review":"If you liked Clerks 2 then you will probably like this one. These days instead of great dialogue to carry a movie it is now just swears and over the top gross jokes. I'm no old man but these movies just phone in the \\"comedy\\" most of the time. \\"There's Something about Mary\\" had the right idea w/ subtle gross humor but made it funny dialogue also. After that it seems that movies like this just get churned out at the mill To give 15 min of funny lines a 90 minute vehicle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember Dazed and Confused?","review":"Once upon a time there was a movie called \\"dazed and confused\\" (you should either queue it or rate it). Some people simply loved this movie, while others hated it with passion. \\"Superbad\\", my friends, is the remix of dazed and confused. I watched this by myself and laughed out loud through most of the movie. This is a story about Seth and Evan. Two best friends who are on a quest to make something of themselves at one of the last \\"high school parties\\" of the year. (and one of the only ones they were invited to) The story goes from there. Like \\"dazed and confused\\", and many other great movies, the movie takes place in a single 24 hour period.

It is very funny. I went to a lot of parties when I was in high school so I know what a big production it was to score some booze. It is definetly for people who have a raunchy sense of humor and don't mind hearing the F word every 3 seconds. It is funny and I would watch it again for a good laugh.

The previews and TV spots for it made it look like a hilarious movie...then I saw it and I was extremely disappointed. This is just one of those Adult Comedies that kids who can't even drive yet go to see and think people like \\"McLovin\\" are cool. While there were a few parts that did make me laugh, I thought it was trying too hard to be funny. Basically, I think this movie has been overly-hyped.Now if you want to see something funny, rent Hot Rod when it comes out. I thought this was x10 funnier than Superbad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super-hyped","review":"I would have to say that SUPERBAD was SUPERHYPED. Overall, I didn't find this movie funny at all.

You're feeling a little depressed, a low-level malaise, you can't handle watching something that would impress anyone, you don't want a movie about a suicide with little dialogue or even French new wave or Woody Allen, you just want something that will have barely any effect on you except for making you laugh.Do not watch this movie. It's more depressing than a well-meaning movie about poor workers, believe me. I admit I only watched the first three minutes. But that's because I've watched a lot of Judd Apatow movies now, and so I know what to expect. And if it starts off being incredibly offensive and poorly observed and lacking in actual gags, it's not going to IMPROVE. Some Apatow movies do have some good observation in them, some good jokes, even, I guess, but you can just tell with this one ...I have warned you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unsatisfied!!!!!","review":"The movie itself is awesome!!

Unfortunatly they sent me another DVD that did not work. I know it is not my player because it plays other dvd's fine and one of the Superbads I got was a dual disc and the bonus feature dvd played. This company must not check their dvds before they send them out even though they mark them as \\"like new\\" because every new dvd i have had PLAYED THE MOVIE!

I laughed out loud more times than I could count, and actually found myself wiping away tears at one point. This movie encompasses all of the funniest aspects of teenaged boy humor, and that being said, it probably isn't for everyone. Teenaged boys are annoying, crude, without guile, and often have no filter. If you can't tolerate talk of sex, drugs, booze or any other thing that an 18-year-old boy is likely to have on his mind, you probably will be unable to countenance this film. But if you can take a joke for what it is--humorous--without getting all riled up, I'm sure you'll enjoy this hilarious film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fithy...but very funny","review":"Superbad is super funny and super obscene.

You can get the whole set here for the cost of one or two place settings of the really good stuff and a lot of that isn't even dishwasher safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with quality.","review":"Although I was pleased with the look of this set, the blades of the knives did not hold up. Upon washing, black spots appeared that did not come off and appeared to be some sort of tarnish. I was very disappointed and returned the set. Brand new flatware should not look like that after a week of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Rust Problems","review":"We purchased two 45 piece sets of the Oneida Satin Flight pattern about a year ago. We like the style and the feel of the piece as they are not oversize like some other patterns. However, rust spots have been appearing on many of the pieces (in fact all 16 the knifes). According to Oneida, the only recourse is to return the defective pieces and hopefully they will replace with pieces that don't rust, but we are skeptical. Also, we'll be stuck paying to the return these items which will be an added expense.Therefore, we cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant,, Classy, Great for the Hope Chest/Bridal Set","review":"Although my Satin Flight, Service for 8 is still in my hope chest I can tell you right now that this is a gorgeous, classy set of silverware.

My mom has had her same set of Onieda (still looking great through 3 kids) and shes had it for 20 years. My grandmother who's set has been through 4 kids, 11 grandkids, and 1 greatgrandchild, is still ticking and still fine.So for my granduation from high school a few years ago thats what I got. A gorgeous set of timeless silverware from Onieda in this pattern (which is by far the most classic and modern I've seen.)This is a grea hope chest/ bridal pattern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice flatware, but price increase hurts","review":"We purchased this set of flatware back in 2003 for our new kitchen. The quality of the product was fantastic and it has lasted quite well over the last three years.The styling is nice and the durability for the number of washes is impressive. We have since expanded and would like to buy an additional 8 place settings and have noticed that in the 3 years, the prices has more than doubled (even with Gold Box prices). The value of the settings at the original price would have been 5 stars. The increased price, while still an excellent set, puts the set on par with higher quality designed flatware.As to the actual product, I recommend it highly if you can afford the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is completely wrong","review":"We thought we'd get the tabs, twist-wire, and glue that are in the picture, and that is what we wanted.

Unfortunately all that we got was a stick!Edit: You can see from reading the other reviews that this product was at one time indeed a set of tabs, twist-wire, and glue, now it's a six dollar stick.

During my ownership of these clippers and especially since they broke, I never found a pair that cut half as well as this clipper design. The spring action is great on the blades and it is easy to operate. The blades are long and widely spaced when open. They easily cut through twice or maybe three times as much grass at a time than any other clippers I've tried. Other clippers are always binding up and most of them don't even cut a piece of twine reliably if you go out to tie up your tomatoes.This review may sound overboard, but I was so glad to finally find these clippers on the internet that I just had to share my opinion about this superior product. They are easily the best design on the market. I look forward to using these for the next 20+ years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a CD by it's cover","review":"While the CD cover may look a little weird, the CD seems very useful for teaching math concepts!

It covers all the basic Arabic Grammar as well as giving an up to date vocabulary. The layout style makes it very easy to read and absorb a lot of information. My father who is a Professor of the Arabic Language at Harvard University reccomends his students to buy this book along with the book 'Arabic Made Easier' written by Dr. Mustapha Muhammad and published by Awakening Publications () Both of the above books will enable a new student to learn the Arabic language effeciently and quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Start, but Inadequate","review":"I am loath to recommend this book to anybody. It seems to fairly dance across the surface of what is in fact a very difficult subject. It certainly tends to make learning Arabic appear to be a lot easier than it really is.Possibly this book will be a useful refresher for the student who already has some Arabic and needs to brush up painlessly. But for a beginner to start here would be a true deception. You certainly can't learn to speak Arabic from this book, but that's not the problem; you can't learn to speak Arabic from any other book that exclusively covers the literary language. The problem is that you can't really learn to read Arabic from it either, except maybe for the selections prepared for this book. If you're serious about learning literary Arabic on your own, start elsewhere, preferably with either Thackston, Cowan or Haywood and Nahmad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite As Bad","review":"I'm not a great fan of the \\"teach yourself\\" series, but this is not such a bad book at all. Given that I have certain advantages (I speak Urdu which has similar script and vocabulary) I find that the book tackles the subject logically and is able to explain some fairly tricky concepts with ease. I don't have the tape ...and I do feel that pronunciation (apart from grammar) is vital in being understood. The transcripts sound fairly authentic however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great book for beginers.","review":"Even though the title says teach yourself Arabic, I personally found resources on the internet that were more helpful and clearer to understand than in this book. No phonetics are used, and most is just in Arabic with English next to it, How would one know how to pronounce these words without some idea of how they sound. \\"Phonetics\\" I was not crazy about this one, more for advanced than beginners in Arabic."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent me the wrong book","review":"I wanted this book, which is no longer in print, because my personal copy is really tattered from overuse.

A very detailed and accurate account of the calender of events leading up to the early days in June. I must point out as other customer reviews mention that their is a huge negative slant put on the BBC and the British in general. All I can gather from these degrading inputs is a huge amount of jealousy from the American side. Let's face it the British have been great at exploration in the last few century's with wonderful stories of fame, fortune and disaster. I believe there is a lot of envy from the Americans because the Brits were there first.

I called Corona to verify the information on the tag and was told that it is correct. It would be very difficult to make a 2 inch diameter cut because a larger clipper would have to be used. The compound action effect of the clipper makes cutting limbs an easy task. The clipper is a bit heavy for a woman to use but no problem for a man. The clipper is well constructed and should last for many years. I use the clipper on branches within the 1 to 1 1/2 inch diameter because of the ease of use.Overall the clipper is well worth the price that I paid for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good loppers!","review":"I'm very pleased with these.

A replacement blade cost $20 plus shipping - the same as a new lopper. Rubber foam handle grips also came loose and slide up and down the handle during use. Grips have to be taped in place periodically to keep them from sliding.

I'm a fairly small woman, and wear them to run. Sound quality is okay, they're comfortable, they stay put, and they last (at least until I lose them).The clip to keep the cord close to your body is a good idea, but it doesn't always stay very well. This can be a good thing, since it will pull the cord off your shirt before it pulls out of your music player, but can also be irritating if the cord comes unclipped while you're running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for running or even general use","review":"These are too small for my ears but I'm not sure they're good in terms of sound.

I wouldn't say that the sound quality is anything to get excited about, but when you are in a noisy gym, they are perfect. They are definitely much better than the standard head phones you get with your iPod, and definitely good value considering the price. You're not getting Bose sound quality with these, but considering the price, they are worth it.I tend to wrap these around my mp3 player, hooking them into their own wire to keep them in place. After about 10 months, the wire to the speaker part began to become loose. Eventually, they became unusable. I think that this is due to my wrapping technique. The wire issue is the only reason that I'm not giving these five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and obtrusive","review":"I've tried more headphones than I care to admit, and these are definitely near the bottom of the list.The plastic ear clips are hard and too large.

They too often fall off the ear and when they do stay on are easily rattled around. The clip is very awkward and only pulls the phones off the ear when one extends/rotates their torso. Shortly after purchasing mine, the rubber-coating on one of the wires inadvertently split open, revealing the leads. The sound was eventually lost in that earpiece. I would suggest looking eleswhere for quality headphones for exercising."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better solutions out there...","review":"I've re-read existing reviews with interest - none seem to capture what I experienced with this product. Keeping the $12 price tag firmly in mind, even then I didn't like this earphone. It may be a simple matter of fit, however, I can say that the picture of this product in my ear looks nothing like the picture Sony publishes. There is no way this product fits snugly in my ear like that. The result is that it sits outside my ear, which means the presentation is extremely bass - light. I had to use all of my equalizer range to get it to work. Having done all that, it provided reasonable music for a bike rider, plus I really could hear all of the sounds around me (a plus for bike riders).The best answer for me at least, is the Burton Tech Acoustibuds over my standard earbuds. Beautiful, comfortable, fit. Wonderful music. I am done looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible fit, terrible sound, not a great design...","review":"I was very hopeful that these would be the sports headphones for me, but was sad to find that they did not stay in place on my ears or offer the quality sound I was looking for. As a female, I found the ear pieces too large to hook my ear sufficiently, and they just couldn't stay put on my ears. Every time I moved my head from side to side (even minimally) the inner bud would slip out of my ears or the hook would slip completely off my ear - not good for those long walking/jogging sessions. Also, in my opinion, the sound was really quite \\"tinny\\" and not as clear/rich as I had hoped it would be. And the sad excuse for a \\"clip\\" would not even stay on my thinnest t-shirt - total waste! I really expected better from Sony, but I find myself still searching for those perfect headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound but they didn't cost much","review":"The sound on these earbuds leaves a lot to be desired. I wouldn't recommend these earbuds if you want rich sound. So far they have stayed on my ear but they are a little loose.

They are sweatproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"comfortable, but poor sound","review":"The fit is great for wear during running or other exercise, and comfortable enough for extended wear. Unfortunately, the sound quality isn't very good. Even at very low volumes, the majority of female vocals, or any music with a little more treble in it, routinely crackles, distorts, and overloads the 'phones. If you're out jogging and don't want to hear anything but bass, you're probably OK. If you use your headphones to listen to a wider range of music though, pick a different pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!","review":"These headphones were so cheap and misleading, claiming to be \\"Sports\\" Headphones.

They're cheap, and you get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"Buy the cheaper MDR-J10. These are bulkier and don't stay in your ear as well as the J10. The cheap clip-on device for attaching the cord to your shirt makes the headphones slip out of your ear even easier. They last about as well as the J10s that I have owned in the past - they are already starting to fizzle/short out.

I have yanked on them accidentally many times and they still work great. I used them in the shower, and although they do go mute, when they dry off they are back to normal again. The sound is great too. I really don't know why anyone has any complaints about these earphones. They are simply the most durable and best fitting earphones I have ever had. Before I got these, I went through 4 pairs of other brands in the previous year. When these finally do die, I expect I will buy another pair.

With nothing to really hold them in place, standard earbuds just are not going to cut it. I can't keep earbuds in when I'm awake, let alone when I'm asleep. I prefer larger headphones-- the kind that sit on top of the ear, held in place either with clips on the ears or with a headband. Again, for sleeping, this isn't very comfortable, especially if you sleep on your side a lot. These slide onto my ears comfortably and stay in place when I go to bed. The sound quality is good enough for me, and they were very affordable. The clip to hold the wire in place on clothing does not seem to work, but it wasn't important to me. Audiophiles should probably consider higher-end headphones. If you just want something functional, affordable, and the style fits your needs, these headphones are a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"In no way are these for running","review":"I had similar problems with my headphones falling out when I ran... The way the cord is set up, combined with the less than snug fit, made it a comedy act with me continually placing the headphone back into my ear. Or even worse, running while holding the headphone in my ear... a la ghetto blaster days.

I got approximately 2 years out of these headphones, so I'm pretty happy with them. They're very light and the sound is good. I remember I didn't like them so much when I first got them because it took a while to get used to them. I have small ears and no matter what I did to adjust the clip, I couldn't get them to fit snugly.

A person pays big bucks for a great mp3 player like an IPOD and it comes with junky ear pieces that sound bad and don't stay in one's ears.This is far better than the standard earbuds. The hooks keep them from falling out of the ears and the sound quality is good.I think it is unfortunate that Apple and other companies making mp3 players don't include good earbuds in the first place, but since they don't, this is a good solution.

She is a very complex writer. It's obvious that she's experienced some of the things she writes about herself. She doesn't write with the viewpoint of many authors, treating kids like they have more to learn. Her main characters are almost always kids, and she simply tells things through the character's eyes, not her own eyes. I love this book, and all the others. However, I suggest reading Homecoming, Dicey's Song, and A Solitary Blue before taking on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of the Best From Voigt","review":"If you have read the begining of the Tillerman series you know the true end to this book, it also clarrifys many things about the first books in the series.Of All of the Tillerman books this was by far my favorite. Through Bullet's quiet and reserved nature you learn new things about yourself and about how you trully view others. The story starts slow but as I neared the end of this book I could not put it down. Bullet, Abaigail and Tamer become so real to you as you read. I recommend this to anyone looking for a quick good read and for anyone who questions, as a teenager, how they view other races/classes.An amazing novel for teens and adults alike..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review of the Runner","review":"The things that happen through out this book are very meaningful. The main character Bullet has to go through a lot. Such as getting out of the box that his father has built around him and his struggle to over come his racist out look on the people around him.

So over all I thought this book was worth reading and I recomend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"review on the runner","review":"I think this book did a great job showing the way a person reacts to things in there life. Bullet shows us how boxing a person in will only cause them to drift farther away. It did a good job of showing how Bullet wasen't sure how he was going to get out of his house, but he knew he would. He used running as away to escape many of the things that bothered him. Bullet soon would see war as his way out of the controling house his father ran. He watched his brother and sister leave, he saw no reason to why he couldn't do the same. Bullet was a strong and independent boy, and he died trying to gain more. From his father and i think from life in general. i don't think he liked many things in his life. the war seemed like away to escape that life and start a new."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Runner","review":"The Runner by Cynthia Voigt was a good book.

It has an excellent plot and you can feel what the characters feel, think what they think. The book talks about racism and democracy. The Runner shows strong feelings and emotions.

The book is bad, I dont recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best books I've read","review":"This book is extremely powerful. Cynthia Voigt interlaced and weaves many ideas about everything - racism, friendship, who you are, who you can be, being different, judging people, pushing your limits, values, ...It tells us the story about a young man named Samuel, who calls himself Bullet. He's strong willed, stubborn, and incredibly strong in his character. He lives by his own rules, which include not answering to his domineering father, his mother, or mixing with the \\"coloreds\\" at his school. He won't let no one run him - and he's willing to break all rules but his own.This is the kind of book that stays with you, it's got some very powerful messages. I couldn't sleep at night, because I kept thinking about questions this book raised in me. When a book does that to you, in my opinion, it means that it's a very good book.One of my favorite books.

Bullets dad is not a nice guy, he always boxes bullet in, by not letting him do what he wants. Bullets brother and sister were run out of the house, because their dad was that big of a jerk. Bullet was the best runner on the cross country team. Bullet being realy selfish and he ran only for himself. If the team needed help from bullet he would decline. After Bullet told the coach that he did not want to help he got kicked off the team. Lator on Bullet finally did the right thing and helped out the team and they ended up winning the championship. After all the excitment Bullet enlisted in the military and was killed for a sad ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"the runner","review":"I thought the runner was an alright novel. Cynthia Voigt is a good author but this book was hard for me to understand. Due to the fact that you have to be in bullets position. I personally can not put my self in his position so I was confused. But even though it confused me she did a good job writng it. It is a book for people that can put themselves in oter peoples position. If there is any body that can do that than I would highly suggest to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Runner\\" Sucks","review":"This is one of the worst books I ever read. Voigt obviously did zero research; you don't become a good runner by running ten miles every day forever, rare steak is the worst thing you can eat he night before a race, cross country is not a track event and the courses are clearly marked and do not vary in distance and NEVER have fences to jump over. All the characters are shallow and boring, and the ending is pointless. The only reason I even finished was because I wanted to see just how retarded it could get. The answer: completely retarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"the runner that listens to no one","review":"Bullet is a runner on the school track team. Infact, he's the best runner of them all.

Back home, his father always tries to box him in and Bullet's mother is also boxed in by his father. Bullet has tried ways to jump out. And now he's finally 18. Bullet decides to drop out of school to go to war leaving his mother with a red boat and 100 dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I did not like this book very much. I don't like the way Bullet deals with things and I don't like how he's so racist. I gave this book 2 stars in stead of 1 because I could get through this book even though it took me 2 weeks. I reccomend reading Homecoming or Dicey's Song instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great, I'm afraid...","review":"Their first album is a glossy-pop classic, full of hooks and interesting production twists. Unfortunately for all, the new one is a shallower version of that. Certainly, the first album was used as a formula for this, but all the clever inventiveness is gone.Even more damaging, there are no amazing catchy songs as on the first record. Hooks and melodies are in evidence, but nothing as universally appealing as the first.Their sexual attitudes were a help/hindrance before, now it's no real issue. They still HAVE an attitude, but it's less well-produced than before. Get the first record!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"I have been a huge t.A.T.u fan since 2002... I have pretty much all of their songs including the russian remixes (like Galoyan, Fly Dream, etc.)... and I have to say... this entire CD is western wash. It sounds absolutely nothing like their old stuff... not to mention three of the videos that they made from this CD is BORING. I miss the old t.A.T.u... I say, they get Ivan back and start dancing around in their underwear again pretending to be lesbians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good by a Long Shot","review":"I bought this album because the first one was interesting. This one sucks. What is worse is that you can't take an album back once you've opened it. I would not recommend this to anyone. There was one song that drove me bananas, Cosmos. What were they thinking. Fortunately for them, the only song I liked was No. 2. The only song written by The Veronica's. Maybe this group should go about getting The Veronica's to write all their songs because those girls are more talented than anything out right now. T.A.T.U does not write their own music, maybe they should start because their writers are screwing their career. They can't afford to make another album like this, they will be a thing of the distant past, if remembered at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dangerous\\" (purchase) \\"And\\" (not) \\"Moving\\"","review":"After their 2002 album, I thought they could make something much, much better. Even though the album has about 13 tracks, only 2 are good \\"All About Us\\" and \\"Friend Or Foe\\". This is not like the songs from their first album, these songs are weird, with strange sounds and rhythms that make them just noise for everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not reach its potential","review":"After their gleaming cross over success with \\"200 km/h in the Wrong Lane\\" Tatu comes back and delivers a much weaker sophomore album. If you have been hooked on the first CD, chances are you will appreciate some of the stuff on this one too. \\"All About Us\\", \\"Loves Me Not\\", \\"We Shout\\", \\"Obezyanka Nol\\" and \\"Dangerous and Moving\\" strike a familiar cord, but the rest of the tracks are nothing more than forgetable, pop-striving junk. I guess I expected more innovation from Tatu, but why should I even be disappointed; these are the very same girls who have lied about their sexuality to boost and promote album sales.....(how disappointing)....I wish them well; I just hope they are more honest and original next time - you can't keep on fooling your fans and expect to get away with it....Overall, this does not reach its potential...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but def. not as good as their first release","review":"I really loved their first release. Dangerous and Moving has a lot of the same catchy tunes as the first. I did listen to 30 seconds of each song (before I bought this one) and I guess I assumed the songs would be even better -full version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, a few kinks to work out.","review":"I feel this album is probably just as good as T.a.t.u's first. The single 'All About Us' is much like 'All the Things She Said' which helps tie the two albums together.Many of the songs are multi-dimensional such as 'Sacrifice' which has meaning and an interesting line. 'Dangerous and Moving' is another great song with deeper meaning. Both are great.I admit I don't like 'Gomenasai' or 'We Shout'. I feel 'We Shout' is a little flat in tune. It's not too interesting and rarely changes. 'Gomenasai' just doesn't appeal to me. Maybe it was meant for the Japanese audience.'I Only Want What I Can't Have' is an interesting song with the sweet voice of Lena then a seductive chorus. 'Cosmos' starts out in an odd way vocally with low, low notes then suddenly a higher chorus by Yulia.Althogether the CD is good. A great addition for 200 km/h."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste like Tatu...but it's a new menu","review":"Isn't Tatu great. I know there is a big machine behind these girls (that they aren't really very musically talented), but I really like the unique sound.This CD was not what I expected. I was expecting more tech dance pop music like their first CD (the russian version, not the US). This new CD is more hard hitting techno pop rock, then tech dance pop. I also noticed that it seems to have a 80's sound to it. \\"All about us\\" sounds like a theme from a rocky movie, \\"Craving\\" sounds like a bangles song, Gomenasai sounds like Tiffany.I like the new sound, but I hope they return to some of their hard dance music on the next CD. My favorite song on this new CD is Cosmos, but I think the best song is perfect enemy.Hey, anyone else notice that the \\"Dangerous and Moving\\" theme sounds like \\"not gonna get us\\" from the first CD? ofcourse....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dangerously close to an amazing album","review":"With Dangerous and Moving TaTu have proven that they arent the usual pop band. The cd has great guitar moments and amazing beats. Their vocal performances are alot better this time around. They dont sound as whiny as they did on their first cd. Not that Im saying that their last cd was bad...i liked it...this is just much better and shows that they are actually getting more mature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Moving, but not quite as Dangerous","review":"The second full length CD from t.A.T.u. is yet another highly entertaining euro-pop disc. \\"All About Us\\" is a fun and self-indulgent theme song, with its catchy ABBA influenced chorus.The edgy gem of this disc is the fourth track, \\"Loves Me Not\\" which directly questions the controversy behind the girls' relationship.While this disc starts with some great moments, much of the rest of it falls into the \\"safe\\" category. Tracks like \\"Friend Or Foe\\" and \\"Gomenasai\\" flirt far more with Adult Contemporary, than the racy image portrayed by the first disc.Fortunately, the gems are strong enough to make the trip worth while, even if not quite as dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would get the Russian version if I were you...","review":"Since they got so much MTV attention in the US and sold a billion copies of the translated version of their Russian language hit \\"200 Po Vstrechnoj\\", TATU decided to do their second album in english. Of course they also did a Russian version called \\"Ljudi Invalidi\\" which is the one I'm recommending. No, you don't have to know Russian to appreciate the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Purchasing!!","review":"This book is perfect for those teachers who want to start a Reader's and Writer's Workshop in their classrooms but are confused as to where to begin.

If you intend to purchase this CD, buy the GOLD version. It is remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Listening to Trafalger, forgot a moment that the Bee Gees were four years shy of being the world's biggest disco band. If you have ever dismissed the bands 1960's early 70's work as softened British-Invasion-ish mush, Trafalger may be the ticket.The album cuts away the psych-experimentation ofOdessaand works with mater crafted pop songs. There is orchestration, but the arrangements are sharp and lean. Hear the hit \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heat,\\" with a melody almost McCartnet-esque. It could have worked next to \\"Uncle Albert\\" onRamnext to \\"Uncle Albert.\\"High end pop from this era worked best without artsy pretense, and with Trafalger, you get this delivered in spades. Nothing is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"no saturday night fever","review":"If you're expecting the Saturday Night Fever sounds of the Bee Gees, this isn't it. Most of the tracks find them trying to imitate the Beatles, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Unfortunately the album is marred by some of the most laughable singing I've ever heard since William Shatner. Very amateurish and even painfully embarrassing on some songs. Listen to \\"When Do I\\" and \\"Walking back To Waterloo\\" for examples. Then go listen to a better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting addition to my collection","review":"I found this to be very interesting to add to my collection because I found that the releases of these songs many I don't remember them being released in the US and well it was great to have this one added to my collection and I enjoy listening to it. It shows the diversity of the Bee Gees in how they stayed in the music business so long by changing with the times of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for musical Bee Gees fans.","review":"Yes this album does have a set of songs with melodies which are beautifully put together. Especially #1, #2, #3, #4, #6, #8, #9 and #12. The ones who fall out of that level are #5 and #10. The seventh song, Trafalgar, sounds as a John Lennon copy and therefore i really don't like it. Personally. Maybe an experiment.The album has a distinct sentimental touch, or air, in it. After over one year ago since I first wrote this review I change my opinion and now I do think that the album has some silly over sentimental parts in it. However, the compositions are soft and mellow and that's why I like it.I think that the production is well done after some hesitations. Generally. But as usual on the early BG albums, you do hear strange background sounds sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bee Gees Fan Only!","review":"Besides the #1 hit \\"How Can You Mend A Broken Heart\\" and interesting song \\"Don't Want To Live Inside Myself\\", the rest of the album is somewhat uneven and lackluster. I don't mean to sound like a downer, but it could of been better. The two songs I mentioned is found in the box set which will save you from buying this album. I won't say \\"Don't waste your money on this!\\" because you might still like it, but they certainly had better albums than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*Tear Drops*","review":"Wow!!! I've seen tons and tons of anime in my life, but this one takes the cake! I heard of this DVD and borrowed it from a friend (4 months later I still have it (hehehe)).The story is about a crew of two documenters who want to interview, for the first time, a veteran actress who has performed in hundreds of movies. One of the men is in love with her and the other, the camera man, just wants to get the job done. As she tells her story, the two men encounter her life by living through them, in an astral-projection way.Full of slapstick comedy, action, mystery and, of course, love. All leading up to an unforgettable ending. The music, storyline, and characters were unbelievable, along with the voice actors. By the end of this movie, I cried. Okay, I admit it! I cried, yes, cried for an anime movie! It's that great!Go see this movie. Buy it, don't rent it. I have watched it 37 times! (Yes I kept count!) I bet you all will want to watch this movie over and over. *Tear*"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite films","review":"I actually bought this after renting it several times through the years.

It is also one of the few films that has anything to do with that period in Japan's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful storytelling","review":"I think this must have been a tough film in which to tell the story clearly, but it was done very skillfully and well. The story was compelling, fascinating, interesting, and unpredictable. It was enjoyable. Tokyo Godfathers was more emotionally affective than this film. I do think the character is a bit fanciful, and perhaps deranged to chase after a man she barely knows, but the fantastical is part of the breadth of this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Marvel of Animation","review":"Art pure and simple, this is first class story telling with very good animation and soundtrack.

I liked the flashbacks of the actresses life throughout different periods of Japanese history and would have been fully satisfied with watching how her life played out. Shji detracted from the film by inserting the interviewer and the cameraman within the flashbacks which, after awhile, became annoying. And elements that intertwined the actress's real life with her stage life was more confusing than imaginative. I suppose with an 87 minute long movie, Shji had to find some way to fill up time.The visuals were great. Everything else detracted from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time","review":"Although the animation is good, this movie had the most disappointing ending!

The man is an encyclopedia of dirty jokes, and balances his whole act with a strong grip on class, which, considering some of the content, is genius unto itself.You can find dirtier Foxx, but this collection is a great break-in point for any other purchases you might consider.

By this point, I was fed up with the doll and the shoddy way in which it was made, and although for some reason known only to my daughter, she's saved the foot in her jewelry box, she has also stopped playing with the doll since, as she puts it, \\"Ballerinas don't just hop, Mommy.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for smaller children (4-6)","review":"This doll is absolutely beautiful and looks exactly like the movie; however, my 4 year old's ability to play with it was quickly evident.

My main problem with this album is it doesn't carry my attention like past Pantera albums like Driven or Trendkill. Don't get me wrong, it was definately worth the wait, but i was a little dissapointed. Songs like \\"Yesterday Don't Mean Sh*t\\" and \\"Revolution Is My Name\\" are some of my favorite songs that Pantera has put out. But the song \\"Death Rattle\\" doesn't even seem like a Pantera song. Its too bad that Pantera is cashed.

Nearly all the songs are good on here (they cut off all the filler), the only one that doesn't really catch my attention is You've Got To Belong To It. My favorite tracks include Yesterday..., Revolution..., Uplift, and my fav It Makes Them Disappear. Dimebag's riffs are viscious, showing no mercy towards your speakers, and Vinnie Paul is awesome on drums. Although I really like this album, there are a few things that I think can be improved (which is why I waited so long to buy a Pantera album). The riffs, however great and heavy could be more melodic (as could the songs in general). The songs and the album are short in length as well, and many of the songs end basically the same. Also, I wish the lyrics would rhyme more than occasionally. Aside from those minor gripes, this is a good heavy metal album. It's not reinventing the steel, but continuing to grind the axe..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its got a little bit of Everything","review":"After The Great Southern Trendkill (Which was somewhat disappointing for me), Pantera went back into the studio (after what seemed like forever for fans) and created an album that uses elements from all of their previous albums. Suffice to say, it was worth the wait. They have used all their different sounds to create a new one that suits them right. I'm an old School CFH, and it took me awhile for this album to grow on me, but I'm sure old and new fans alike will grow to rock to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Now, as you may or may not have noticed, this isn't new stuff at all. I'm talking about PanterA selling out back in the time of Far Beyond Driven. That's when the guitars started to sound too scratchy along with Philips vocals (He'd be screaming when Dimebag fidles with the guitar). But this is a whole new level. Belive it or not, this gets to sound a little bit like Nirvana! (which you see on \\"Revolution is My Name\\"), and we don't want that, now do we? Take it from me, this along with Far Beyond Driven and The Great Southern Trendkill , is NO must get at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reinventing lacks something...","review":"Reinventing The Steel thier fifth albumReinventing The Steel overall is just boring.

I would be very [upset] ! I dont realy like being [peved]off at my favorite band but it just happen you know ? I own all of pantera's albums and i worthship all of them except this one. First of all, the production[is bad],lirycs terrible,riffs are boring and to make it worse it sure sounds like pantera is getting old and tired, it definily shows that on this [new] album.

C ya !"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISSAPOINTMENT!","review":"I should caveat this review with the fact that I am a big heavy metal fan, and was also extremely pleased with Vulgar Display of Power and Far Beyond Driven, but Pantera's latest offering with the exception of a few songs is an extreme dissapointment, while the energy is still there the creativity and song essence is not. If your looking for great new heavy metal with a lot of aggresive power, creativity, and fantastic songs...check out bands like Cradle of Filth, Dimmu Borgir, and Emperor...you wont be dissapointed ! These bands blow away Pantera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reinventing nothing as usual","review":"Well alright Pantera still has this massive elephant stomping sound. Ok, guitars are crunching, vocals are ripping. But where are the songs ? Everything on this album is so in your face that it gets boring after the first three songs. It is just unbelievable that the stuff displayed here is the only music that those guys could write within 2 years. At least \\"Trendkill\\" showed some blues influences which were very welcomed... Is this band completly dumb or do they think that their fans just need to hear the same thing over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Kickin","review":"Pantera puts out another solid album with RTS. Comparable to VDP and earlier material, the album doesn't test the waters as much as Trendkill, but it doesn't matter. Straight through, this s**t rocks, and there's nothing more to say about it. There's not one bad song on the whole album, which you'll learn by the second time through. The only thing that keeps me from giving 5 stars is the occasional lack of drive in some songs. Additionally, Kerry King's solo on GD Electric is almost unidentifiable (we all know he can do much better!)Overall, the benefits greatly outweigh the weaknesses, and RTS is a must in any collection that rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on....","review":"This album really doesn't do much. Overall, it doesn't have the anger of TGSTK or FBD and the riffs just arent as good as those found on Vulgar. The band is getting a bit long in the tooth, as it becomes evident that Pantera is actually just the AC/DC of the 90s. There IS no real aggression here. If you happen to be one of the \\"circus freak pantera fan\\" variety, this might be right up your alley. It's pretty boring, pretty short, and pretty dissapointing. This band has softened up and gone the way of Hetfield and crew. 'Tis a darn shame, I reckon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pantera delivres again","review":"to every true metalhead there are three names you need to know Black Sabbath ,Slayer and Pantera! these guys stay true to who they are and to the fans that made them, unlike some other acts whom have disappointed use all .I won't mention any names (METALLICA!!!!!)But Pantera sticks with what they do best JAM! and on the RTS album they do just that .some will say it's not as good as the other albums but I say judge for yourself the whole record rocks!! this is a must have for the true Pantera fan .buy it and see for yourself .I know it will be a long shot that anyone will actually read this but if you do get the CD you'll love it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantera not so Pantera any more","review":"I bought Panteras new album 2 days ago, hoping right when i put it in the cd player in my car, i would be blown away by Crunching guitars, loud vocals, and the amazing over all sound that Pantera can provide like no other metal band today. I heard the crunching guitars, as well as the loud vocals, but the overall sound was terrible. This CD has the potential to be one of Panteras greatest records, but in my opinion it is lacking one thing,*UNITY*. Dont get me wrong, i love metal, and i love Pantera. But if any metal record, or any type of music for that matter, lacks unity, then you have nothing. Mabye Pantera should have waited another year or so to work on this. Better luck next time guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"REINVENTING TH STEEL","review":"I thik that the new Pantera album is a dissapointment. I think it is too thrashy and lacks the melody and the guitar riffs and solos of their previous albums. The only \\"amazing\\" song on the album is \\"revolution is my name\\"I think that pantera should make more albums like vulgar display of power and cowboys from hell. They are great \\"5 star\\" albums. this is not.This new album needed some melodic songs such as \\"this love\\" and \\"hollow\\" and \\"cemetery gates\\"It also lacked power guitar eg: walk, a new level. It definitly lacked solos: walk, floods, cemetery gates, 10s, this love.anyway, although it was a big dissapointment i still love PANTERA and i would love to see them down here in Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Ok, what is up with Pantera? I am a big fan, but this cd just doesn't kick. The only catchy tune is Uplift. Do yourself a favor, go listen to Cowboys From Hell or TGSTK, those are the best two.

Don't get me wrong, I love Pantera and own all their albums. But after repeated listens I have realized that this album is great. Every song is good, there is no filler. Just 9 or 10 flat out heavy tracks. The best thing about this new album is that Pantera will now tour with Ozzy and I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Hitting Metal Music","review":"At first listen Reinventing The Steel somehow sounds different than their other albums. I would rank it up there with Vulgar Display of Power. \\"Hellbound\\" starts the album out with a grinding riff and not over the course of its ten songs does it ever let up. \\"G*damn Electric\\" mentions trust in Black Sabbath and Slayer, \\"Yesterday Don't Mean Sh**\\" and \\"You've Got To Belong To It\\" are bad to the bone thrashers. \\"Revolution Is My Name\\" is an excellent hit with some great lyrics by Phil. \\"We'll Grind That Axe For A Long Time\\" is a good and \\"It Makes Them Disappear\\" is my favorite song on the album. It is strange that this is Pantera's last album. Lately they have not been getting along. Phil left with Rex to do other projects in the band Down and Superjoint Ritual. While Dimebag and Vinnie Paul have teamed up to form Damage Plan. It isn't official that this will be the last Pantera album, but if Reinventing The Steel is their last, its a damn good way to bow out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of sound","review":"This has none of the feeling power or talent of the past albums. All the other Pantera albums are fantastic, they should have let this garbage sit in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The End of The Line","review":"Pantera, for many, signified the integrity of the heavy metal movement in America, long after it had been declared dead. After bands like Metallica and Megadeth abandoned the genre, Pantera stood firm, and delivered, both in the studio and live. Their final effort, as it turns out, would not be the best chapter in the Pantera story.This album resembles a band attempting to sound like Pantera. Few tracks are able to carry themselves, and it makes for an overall weak album. The dynamics and variety of previous albums is absent here, again pointing to the idea that Pantera was trying to be Pantera. The music does not sound natural, but it does sound forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"ITS NO COWBOYS FROM HELL","review":"Let me just say one thing, I think that Pantera got too mixed up in the whole selling out thing. They thought more about not selling out then making music and it shows on the album. This is all about we are still a metal band and not about man that song is awsome. The difference between MetallicA and PanterA is that MetallicA is and was just better musically, they never cared about this or that they just play what they feel, which is exactly how it should be. This is an decent album at best, but I'm waiting for November when MetallicA's new album is supposed to be released, James was quoted as saying that \\"Its really really heavy.\\" Can't wait for another \\"Master of Puppets\\". Thats my MetallicA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that Pantera is Through","review":"This album is good. BUT for a Pantera album it is horrible. From the best thrash metal band EVER, this is crap! Phil does not sing at all on the CD. He is one of the few that can scream and sing both very well, but on this album he kinda sells out. Not bad, but not good. DOWN's second album is way better than this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UP IN FLAMES!!!","review":"My title refers to the track record of awesome albums starting with \\"Cowboys from Hell\\" and ending with \\"The Great Southern Trendkill.\\" Should have stopped there, boys. I really wish you would have. The picture of a guy jumping through a fire with a bottle of booze COMPLETELY illustrates the lack of vision, creativity and compositional talent that went into this album. Sure Dimebag was one of the the best guitarists ever (and it's a shame that dimebag got smoked [LOL, anyone?]), but that fact alone doesn't make a good album. Their credibility as an unstoppable, solid-gold-album-churning machine has gone \\"up in flames\\" with this one. \\"Revolution is my Name\\" is a good song, but all of their previous albums had numerous GREAT songs - not just one good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"can you say CHEESE?","review":"Alright, yet another groundbreaking adrenaline macho album from Pantera.Metal has to be the cheesiest and LEAST HEAVY form of music on earth. REINVENTING THE STEEL? Give me a break, Pantera has to be the Judas Priest of the 90s (or 2000s). Cheesy!The lyrics are the usual \\"OOOH FEEL THE GLOVES OF METAL\\" and Phil is still doing his best Henry Rollins impression.The music stinks, just when you think its about to sound hardcore (heaviest form of music on earth) Dimebag Darrel (formerly named Diamond Darrel)or whoever the guitar player is throws in a cheese ball hi twiddling metal chord and ruins everything making it sound like a metal song.Though this joke band is pretty much cornball they put on great live shows living up to and surpassing the music on the album, too bad its metal.

Complete with the aggressive music, exceptional lyrics, and wonderful vocals, this CD will not be one that will soon be forgotten. Please pick it up, you'll not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reinventing the Steel","review":"Sure, I can see how somebody could say this isn't Pantera's finest effort and thats fine. But the said from the start that they wanted to make an album that was stripped down and to the point and they accomplished that mission and then some.

I also recommend Metallica (old and new and they didn't sellout)Creed,Sevendust, AIC, Staind, Godsmack, Sepultura, System of a Down, Soulfly, and STP. Those are also really great artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can seriously do so much better","review":"No wonder I hated Pantera the first time I heard them. \\"Reinventing The Steel\\" was the first full listen of Pantera I ever had. Compare this album with previous efforts and it's a flat-out joke. Sure, it's heavy, sure it's got attitude, but it has no substance at all. What happened to the band that brought us such brutal anthems as \\"5 Minutes Alone\\" and \\"Walk\\" or the melodic \\"Cemetary Gates\\" and the cover of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan?\\" Reinventing the Steel, to me, represents Pantera as going through the motions. Everything is just a rehash. Most of the songs sound the same. I think even the band know that this CD is pretty lousy, after all, when you take the CD out of the case, there's a picture behind the CD of the band laughing at you and drinking beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"First let me say that I love Pantera... they are the definitive Heavy Metal band of all time. All of their albums are not only worth buying, but spinning until they don't play anymore and buying again! BUT... Reinventing the Steel is missing something that made Pantera's other albums so great. The attitude, anger, hatred, whatever you want to call it that made Vulgar, Driven, and especially Trendkill so powerful just isn't there. A few of the songs, \\"Hellbound\\", \\"Death Rattle\\", and \\"We'll Grind that Axe for a Long Time\\" come close but don't have the same effect as classics like \\"Mouth for War\\", \\"Slaughtered\\", and \\"War Nerve\\". Oh well... Reinventing the Steel still rocks louder than anything else of the shelves these days, and it doesn't seem that Pantera are going to let up any time soon.

I have all the albums including a few that some people have never heard of. And this new one is the biggest piece of crap I have ever heard! I love Pantera, but, you can't tell me this cd is good. Songs one and two are great. And the last song is great. The other 7 songs sound like 1 big song. I really hope things turn around soon. What Phil and the rest of the guys were thinking is beyond me. And just to make it clear, Cowboys on through to Trendkill, were some of the best albums ever written. Everyone gets at least one bad album. So with any luck this was their only one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comeback after Trendkill","review":"Call me crazy, but Trendkill didn't do it for me. As soon as my friend and I went to the store and he bought this cd and put it in his cd player I was like \\"YEAHHH!!!\\" The cd was an awesome metal cd. But I guess after a 4 year break they needed something solid. This cd slows down a little, and is even a little less heavy than previous cd's, but the music tends to flow better. The heaviest song on here would be \\"Death Rattle\\" which is nothing compared to \\"Strength Beyond Strength\\".All in all this cd packs a good punch. I would recommend it to a fan, but probably not to a mainstream metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cowboys From Hell Bring a Piece of Heaven to METAL","review":"This satisfying slab of killer tunes proves once more that \\"Metal\\" is alive and well.

The album is average at best. The best song is revolution is my name which is a sad sad thing seeing as singles are typically lackluster songs. I guess they realized if they released any other song nobody would buy it. If you're just getting into pantera do yourself a favor and buy anything but this. Now that phil anselmo quit like the a-hole he's always been hopefully dime and vinny will release something more up to their high standard of writing and performance with New Found Power."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Aren't Any Cowboys or Vular Displays on this one....","review":"As a fan of the old Pantera -- the Cowboys From Hell stuff as well as Vulgar Display of Power -- I have to say that the new album is (again) a disappointment. This coming from a guy that has been spit on by Dimebag and thrashed around the mosh pits with the best of 'em. The new stuff, ladies and gentlemen, is just not the same. Much more of that screaming you hated about the last Trendkill album. There are no standouts here, though a few tracks can get your head bobbing. But for the most part, keep your hand near the 'NEXT' button and then relegate the CD to your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but don't compare","review":"Good CD, but try not to compare it to, say, Southern Trendkill. Take it for what it is, a strong, upfront metal CD from a great band. My only problem with it was that it contained \\"only\\" 10 songs. Wish there were more! And to any small-minded wannebe reviewer who must constantly compare Pantera to Metallica....give it a rest! Two different bands, two sounds, NO selling out by either, and great music. One thing, if you want a non-Korn influenced metal sound, buy this, it will be worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good if you like Panteta","review":"This album has many if not all of the qualities that make a great Pantera album. It is traditionally heavy, angry, and aggressive. My only problem is that it does not have much dimension as far as catchy songs go. Otherwise, it is a nessesity for Pantera fans. Thankgod they didn't sell out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK WHERE THEY SHOULD BE","review":"The band has finally hit it on the head again with this disc. Their best since VULGER. Getting back to the groove sound they are famous for and not going over the top like the previous releases.This should of been the follow up to Vulger Display! More substance and still waving that flag which bands like MEGADETH and METALLICA seemed to give up on. We need PANTERA to sound like this and I for one thank them for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes ya wanna break something","review":"I was one of the fortunate ones blessed with a promotional copy of this album. I must say the 5 days I had this cd before it was release it never left my cd player. Unlike some bands, who we will fail to mention here, but you know who I mean, Pantera has not and never will sell out. REINVENTING THE STEEL is Pantera's must brutal album since VULGAR DISPLAY OF POWER. Phil's vocal scream over Dimebag's thrashing guitar, with Rex and Vinnie banging along. The only down fall is that this album lacks some of the \\"harmonic\\" (i use this term loosely) melodies of Southern Trendkill and Cowboys from Hell. Overall though a must buy, for the bleak out look and the rage are all conviently packaged in circular form called Reinventing the Steel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sold out? WTF?!?!?","review":"Whoever says that Pantera sold out w/ this album obviously doesn't listen to Pantera on a regular basis as I do. The main objective of Pantera's music is to enfuriate it's listeners. If the music makes you want to jump in the pit and beat the crap out of someone..then it has served it's purpose. Now, while this album doesn't do for me what Trendkill does, it still makes my blood run hot. For me, the best part is the pinch harmonics riff near the end of Revolution is My Name. When I hear that, I feel like smashing everyones face around me. But I don't, because if I did that, then they would blame Pantera for all violence in the world[...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Vulgar Display of STEEL","review":"The four year wait was worth it. Pantera is alive and still thrashin! While it may be somewhat slower-paced than their previous album (The Great Southern Trendkill), it still manages to hold the essence of what makes Pantera so powerful. They've managed to keep their hard edge sound unlike many of other bands that started out raw and took a detour into the \\"Sellout\\" realm. Pantera will never surrender to the media. Long live the Masters of Metal. Now I'm just looking forward to their tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"HELL YEA","review":"THIS CD IS AWESOME PEOPLE, BETTER THAN THEIR LAST FOR SURE, ITS A BOT MORE OF A RETURN TO SAY VULGAR DISPLAY/FAR BEYOND... EXTREMELY HEAVY AND INVENTIVE. PANTERA SHOWS US ONCE AGAIN WHY METAL IS THE BEST FORM OF MUSIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well, even Pantera isn't perfect","review":"I absolutely love the previous 4 Pantera albums, each in their own way. This album isn't in the same league, it sounds like a copy band that's flawlessly reproducing the notes and the sounds, but doesn't come anywhere close on the music. Pantera still rocks, they always did, but there's not a single hint of the content that made previous albums so emotionally shattering. No memorable riffs or quotable lyrics. I never thought I'd have wasted money on a Pantera album, but I guess this shows even they make mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I got this album during a college prize giveaway, and all I can say is that I'm glad I didn't go out and buy it. I think Pantera is a talented metal band and their Cowboys from Hell and Vulgar Display of Power albums are timeless metal masterpieces...but this album does not impress me in the least. I've actually tried selling this album at some used CD stores, and none of them will buy it because they have too many copies of it. Apparently, not many people cared for this album, either. So, for the time being, I'm stuck with it. For great Pantera albums, this is not the one to check out. Check out anything before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I LOVED Cowboys From Hell and Vulger Display Of Power, but this alblum was missing something, I'm not sure what, but something. It just wasn't as exciting or interesting to listen to as thier last two releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pantera Goes Stale","review":"This album starts out great. Then it switches to track two. After that, this disc has nooo bite. Who is this playing anyway? I was so disappointed when this came out. Even more so becase I jam with a guy that is pretty tight with them, and he assured me that it was the best yet. Afraid not. Here is my advice. I know that I generally go for the more extreme (i.e. Nile, Suffocation). So I advise you to find a friend that already has this one and give it an extended listen before you plunk down hard-earned cash for this. You might save yourself a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me while I puke....","review":"I bought this album hoping for another leathal dose of panteras classic mayhem. Instead I got terrible songs, so so production and just an overall bad effort. Just a bad album period."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Panthera??","review":"Ever since \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" they have been more and more dissaponting. At least \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" and \\"Trendkill\\" had several good songs on each of them...\\"Reinventing the Steel\\" has Hellbound and that is it. I tried listening to the entire album over and over again - it just doesn't work. Try their previous four efforts - MUCH better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band is just plain awesome.","review":"I'm not gonna waste time here. I'm just gonna say this is one of my favorite albums of all time, and that I have been listening to Pantera since 1990. There arent any adjectives or words to describe this band. Its just Pantera. If you dont know what I mean, then dont waste your time with the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The trend is dead","review":"Pantera is the greatest band Reinventing the steel is pure rock at its greatest alot of music has been coming out that just isnt rock Phil and the boys show how us Texans like to do things reinventing the steel means to me the return of metal bottom line people should buy this album and listen to what the CFH have to say they could learn a litlle something about real music real metal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Sounds!","review":"Pantera is back with an album that combines the sounds of all of their previous studio albums. It truly is not for the faint of heart. This album will pull you in with it's groovy tunes then push you over the edge with Phil's vocals. If you are looking for some easy listening please do not buy this album. On the other hand if you are looking for some great metal to crank the knob with, look no further. Pantera is back with a long awaited album and it is all Pantera fans can hope to hear. Crank this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Decline Continues","review":"I've been listening to these guys for ten years now and it's been painful to watch the slow death of a band. Darrell totally limits himself to feedback and distorted solos that pale in comparison to the earlier solos that made you stare at your stereo in amazement (i.e.- a new level). pantera's best moments have always been when darrell and vinnie plow through everything in their path. but on this album they never really open the songs up. it's like somebody told them \\"you can't go five seconds without having vocals. the only improvement is phil, who doesn't make the cd uninintelligible and unlistenable by screaming endlessly like on TGSTK. As a whole, all the years off have done one thing, and that's put the other foot in the grave. Pantera's done."},{"rating":"2","title":"pantera delivers 100%","review":"this albums kicks ass. its nothing but pure old-fashioned southern style heavy metal. no sell-out trends here. every single song is a winner, from the opening kick-you-in-the-balls track \\"hellbound\\" to the amazing instrumental sections in \\"revolution is my name\\" to the slow, grinding, brutally heavy riffs of \\"it makes them disappear.\\" it might be my favorite pantera album, other than maybe vulgar display of power. if you are a pantera fan and are suffering from damageplan/superjoint backlash and have not yet checked out this album, do yourself a favor and buy it. it will remind you of the good ol days when pantera ruled the world of metal, and how they still would if they hadnt broken up."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY FAVORITE CD EVER","review":"I own four Pantera cd's and this one is by far my favorite. The guitar on this cd is some of the best I've ever heard. Enormous props to Dimebag Darell.

After the second time using it and following all written directions on the user manual, the same assembly gasket broke. Real quality!

When I asked what they do warranty (since it's only a blade and handles), I was told they only warranty it if it isn't working correctly when you purchase it.

I'm not a big fan of soppy platitudes about 9-11, but this movie was very touching. It dismissed a lot of the big-picture stuff in favour of the minutia of people's lives that make them worth knowing about. This is a story about humans, not heroes, which I found refreshing.Sigourney Weaver is also very good, as usual.My only complaint is that there were a few instances of repetition in the writing. I'm not sure if that was supposed to be deliberate, as in the character repeating himself out of angst and stress, or if it was bad script editing. I noticed it though because it was jarring, which means if it was supposed to be there, it wasn't handled expertly by the writer. That could have used some polishing.Other than that, I thought this was a good movie, especially if you're a LaPaglia fan as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guys","review":"This movie is meticulous, captivating, and a real tear jerker.Watch Anthony Lapaglia's eyes. You can feel the emotional depth of being lost and helpless; confused (not being able to really comprehend the why behind the act), and the immenseness of the loss resulting from the event. Sigourney Weaver is quietly compassionate, maneuvering through the confusion of feelings to find the personalities of the missing comrades. It's beautifully done and Sigourney Weaver and Anthony Lapaglia were perfect choices for the roles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but slow","review":"great movie I just wish it had more scenes then just them talking I could have listened to it in audio and got the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't kiss my a$$ then","review":"We never asked for the attention that we have received from everybody.

The only other source I have found is on the First Born soundtrack (1984) which is equally as difficult to find. Regardless of its rarity frustrations, The Talk Talk song blows all these other 80's \\"B sides\\" out of the water.

It's difficult to assess the film itself based on such a low-grade presentation. The print has all the appearance of having been transferred directly from a multigenerational VHS tape. It's dark, grainy, blurry, and frustrating to watch. Only the scenes shot in brightest sunlight hint at what might have once been a film of rare beauty. In addition, the DVD offers no special features at all. Finally, the English subtitles are rife with both distracting misspellings (\\"blackshirsts\\" for \\"blackshirts\\") and translation hexes that vary between merely baffling and downright risible (when the Italians conquer Ethiopia, we are told, \\"They'll inseminate it, with work!\\").

On the downside, there are no extras at all in the season 6 DVD set -- not even the brief textual afterthoughts of seasons 1-5 -- to explain the postwar historical context (certainly needed for these three episodes) or to comment on the production. Neither the acting nor the scripts in season 6 are up to the high standards of the wartime episodes. With one or two exceptions, the actors seem bored and just going through the motions -- even the great Michael Kitchen just phones it in this time around and seems desperate to retire Foyle even more than Foyle wants to retire. R.I.P.

Completely exceeded my expectations. Michael Kitchen is the master of conveying an incredible breadth of emotion/attitude with the nuances of his countenance and very few words. The female supporting character is uniquely interesting -- innocent, decent, adventurous, not especially pretty but attractive, and a little obnoxious. The story lines are well crafted and recall daily life along the coast of England in WWII. I've watched these twice so far, and they were just as engaging the second time through. This set of three discs may be even better than series 1-5, and that is a true compliment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I admit, I was slightly disappointed with the ending of the war in the prior series, as that meant the end of Foyle's War.

I will not describe what occurs in the episode, but I have enjoyed watching this episode multiple times, which normally I would not do, therefore I give Foyle's War Set 6 a five star recommendation.

She doesn't have the greatest accesories, her urn, and her big cloak. I prefer to keep the cloak off of her, it makes her look less bulky. She looks exactly like the Galadriel in the movie. Her hands are a bit too big, and she can't stand on her own, but still a good figure. Her outfit is a pure white with flower designs that look nice.

It can break while in use and send parts flying or break your wrists. Beware!Other than that, it is also too wobbly and imprecise for very fine work, such as making holes for bookcase shelves or other furniture work.If you are hoping you can just use this instead of buying a drill press - don't.

It worked great for about the first 10 holes then the poor materials used by WoodCraft came screaming through. Here are the issues:1. Plastic black handle broke off2. A LOT of slop in the drill bit mechanism means a LOT of imprecision in your holes. The entire reason I bought the thing.3. The chuck must be made of pop metal as the teeth have broken off and I can no longer tighten the bit using the included chuck wrench.4. Difficult to set correct angles.5. The required technique for centering the bit on the board isn't robust. Combined with the loosey goosey nature of the tool, you're mostly on your own for obtaining a center position with the bit.Essentially, it's good as a bit stop and that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first one I received had an off-center hole for the handle attachment and would not allow the handle to be screwed into the nut. This one was returned. The replacement arrived and I was able to attach the handle. However, the chuck key provided does appear to be the correct size - it is almost useless in trying to tighten the chuck.

I was going to get on Amazon and leave a positive review, but tonight I noticed that one of the small rubber feet on the bottom of the device has fallen off and been lost (swept up with wood shavings and thrown away, no doubt). So now, the drill guide wobbles and doesn't sit flat. I can probably fashion a replacement, but I shouldn't have to after only 1 week of very minimal usage. Seriously, this product is flimsy and has disappointed me. I did not have high expectations, but no product should fall apart in such a short time. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor results","review":"I purchased this guide to drill 3/4 inch dog holes in the 1 1/2 inch thick hardwood-top of my homemade workbench.Even with the guide base very securely clamped to the workbench top, the drilled holes were not vertical.Apparently there is movement within the guide frame which results in the hole being several degrees off.Instead of using this guide, I found that by bracing my arms while drilling the holes I got almost perfect vertical alignment. (My drill has a round bull's-eye leveling bubble built into it....)This drill did not serve my purpose so I returned the guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a drill press replacement","review":"I bought this to drill multiple shallow holes in the vertical sides of an entertainment center to use shelf pins for maximum shelf adjustability. For drilling the same holes repeatedly and wanting them the same this is just not the best tool. As stated by others the springs are too stiff, especially for a large number of holes (80) which will wear your arms out. The instability of the base combined with the lean \\"flex\\" of the guide rods caused as you apply the extra pressure you have to because of the springs make the difference between drilling by hand and using this device basically undetectable. I would have to say, if you're not that concerned, just drill by hand and if you want anywhere near precise, get a drill press of a better intermediate attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly useful","review":"This guide would not replace a drill press. But it will definitely help with keeping the drill square to the surface, and there is an area where it is actually works better. Try drilling a hole square to the wall overhead with your drill press !For more precise drilling, you want to drill a pilot hole, use a brad bit, and go slowly. Again, it's not a drill press, but it is definitely an improvement over drilling freehand.On a negative side, the guide has somewhat excessive play in the chuck, and a tight fit for larger (corded) drills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Kind of flimsy. Works OK with a light-cordless drill. Wobbles a lot I use one of the heavier ones, ending up with imprecise drilling.

This video starts with Chet at about a 52-years-old and ends at about age 71 displaying even at 71, the absolute, unbelievable, versatility and genius of this man. No matter where he is or what song he plays, he never misses a lick. Though it may be considered vintage or classic by some, it is still very current and tasteful. Anytime one has the chance to view this master at his work, I would suggest this, \\"don't miss the opportunity.\\" This video shows Chet at his best as always, and one does not need to be a guitarist as myself to appreciate this video over and over again. Here, one can immediately tell that Chet loved his guitar and he loved his profession. The great humbleness and talent this man had is so outspoken as shown in this video-DVD. At the end of each performance, one can only sit astounded and say with a smile, \\"WOW!\\" This is truly a great collection for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids' History Curriculum","review":"Both my boys loved this book!

Relationship movies are always interesting to me and this is no exception. Martin Sheen gives a marvelous performance as a man who's past suddenly catches up with him. The turmoil that this long-married couple must endure takes the viewer through a realistic situation that could happen to anyone; and probably has to many.

When the boy's mother dies, Sheen must admit his adultery and get to know the son he never knew he had.Blythe Danner gives a superb performance as Sheen's wife, both incredibly sympathetic and believable in her actions. Sheen doesn't fare as well, playing a rather one-note and not all that likable character. Young Sebastian Duncan does remarkably well in his poorly written role as the youngster who's life changes drastically.Overall; \\"Man, Woman and Child\\" is an OK tearjerker. The supporting cast is great with \\"Coach\\" himself Craig T. Nelson playing a sports fanatic (what else!) and the criminally underrated David Hemmings pops up in two scenes. Rather silly and overly sentimental scenes (particularly near the end) hurt the film and while it's never boring, it never quite takes off the way it should.The music is great, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is great to see- if your a masochist.","review":"I rented the film with my grandparents and some cousins in hopeful anticipation of a good comedy.

This movie has none of the above.Speaking about evolution, this movie seems to prove that comedies are evolving to become cruder, dumber, unfunny, employ low-browed humor and appeal to the lowest common denominator. This is a backward evolution. But as you will see from some of the reviews here, even this charlatan production can find some fans these days (or else it's the movies producers who are sneaking in favorable reviews to Amazon's website...)David Duchovny and Julianne Moore (a fine actress) will want to erase this movie from their resume.

It was so bad that I just want someone to admit publicly that they've done movies for either the money or to fulfill part of some other deal. I refuse to believe that mature adults read things like the this, get involved, know the words on paper will be translated to film forever and still get involved.Though I've taken jobs for money, I in no way judge others for doing the same. I just want them to admit it.Don't buy this movie and don't tape it from cable, one viewing will give you the gist of this REALLY bad X-Files/Ghostbusters dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!

I can't believe David Duchovny made this thing... I mean really, he can do oh-so-much better...just look at Kalifornia and Rapture for crying out lot!Be prepared to be grossed out and disguisted. I can't believe I let my kids watch this! Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully, comedy has evolved; or has it?","review":"When I saw this in the theater I was rather bored to tears. I remember that I saw it with my sister and her boyfriend and we were the only three in the theater and they got so bored that they started running through the theater pretending to be aliens and attacking the chairs and screaming like dinosaurs and I remember that that was the most entertaining part of the whole experience. I have since seen the film again (on cable) and it certainly has its moments, but this film does seem rather cheap in comparison to many other comedies out there. The jokes seem almost too obvious and in the end too \`gross' for their own good. I love Julianne Moore and find Orlando Jones to be a gifted comedian, but this material fails them in many ways. The special effects are nice (for the time) but there really isn't enough substance here to validate repeated viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A treacherous title!!!","review":"You can forget the title; only the very few first minutes of the movie are nice (until before the Nadine episode); all the rest is pretty disgusting indeed, lots of ugly nasty creeper cells.

By the way what's wrong with CheerLeaders ???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad.","review":"Bad script and mostly bad acting are only marginally redeemed by a droll Duchovny and decent special effects. Might be amusing to pre-teens and fans of butt jokes.

It is a fun action, adventure, comedy that is sort of like Ghostbusters meets Jurassic Park on a much smaller scale.David Duchovny, Orlando Jones, and Seann William Scott do a fine job and are pretty funny throughout the whole movie.Overall, I enjoyed this film. The special effects were great, and the quick pace of the film keeps you watching. Some people may not like the gross out humor in some scenes, but I found it pretty funny.The DVD has plenty of extras including several deleted scenes (some of which should have been in the movie, in my opinion) which make this disc worth buying.If you are looking for a light hearted adventure, similar to Ghostbusters or Galaxy Quest, you will enjoy this movie!!!Buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not Evoulutionize","review":"I really dislike this movie. The cast was good and there were like 2 good laughs but it was just worthless. The story line was very bad and the dialouge was even worse. I was about a metoer than crashed into the Earth. when they found it, it was leaking this blue stuff. When David Duchovny looked at it through a microscope he sees that it is growing exremely fast. I dont feel like telling anymore because this movie sickened me. Save your money. DONT see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alienbusters!","review":"Director Ivan Reitman delivers another special-effects laden \\"humorfest,\\" this time involving creatures from another world.Perhaps they thought this film was funny. It was about as good as I had expected it to be, which wasn't much. When the \\"best\\" scenes in the trailer aren't funny, worry. Seann William Scott's character is actually funnier than the trailer gives him credit for; he's come a long (well, not too long, I actually liked him better in Final Destination) way since American Pie.The funniest character is played by Orlando Jones, who, unfortunately is made the victim of a drawn-out (and recurring) anal probe joke. David Duchovny really looks like he doesn't want to be here, and delivers his humorous lines as if he is doubting anyone will find them funny. Julianne Moore is the token female, ostensibly around so the male characters can fantasize about her.This film had all the proper ingredients for a blockbuster science-fiction comedy except two: a funny script and a heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't laugh once!","review":"I don't review stuff too aften here, but the ratings this movie has gotten need to be countered with something more realistic. Even if you liked this movie, there is no way you could seriously give it anything above two or three stars! Even then I would doubt your sanity, or at least question your age. This movie was dreadful. Orlando Jones (who I have found hilarious since his days on MadTV) and Julianne Moore (an incredible actress) were completely wasted. The main characters are completely unlikeable; obviously they were going for the Bill Murray smart ass feel, but these characters are just jerks. The script was terrible; you've seen this movie before as Ghostbusters, and it was MUCH better then. Avoid this film at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooo Funny","review":"I watched this movie in the theatre. The entire audience laughed out loud through the whole film.

I think I may have giggled a total of about two times throughout the entire hour and forty minutes of show time.

I'm hoping this is because I simply didn't get the subtle, highly advanced humor used in this film, and not just because some people will eat up anything... that has \\"Stiffler\\" from American Pie in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AlienBusters - Not!","review":"Parts of this film were like forcing a square block through a round hole... what was up with the writing!?

I wouldn't even want it as a gift. This movie was not only one of the worst I've seen this year but it ranks up with some of the worst movies I've ever seen.I can't remember the last time I sat through something so filled with lousy dialog, poor (at best) humor and characters that have has much appeal as a living next to a city dump would inspire.

Otherwise, the movie was hilarious! *****"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Summer Gem","review":"As a fan of \\"Ghostbusters,\\" I really enjoyed this movie. Ivan Reitman just makes really entertainable movies. David Duchovny is really becoming a Cary Grant/Clark Gable kind of movie actor.

This movie can be enjoyed by men and women all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It isn't as good as it looks","review":"There were some funny parts in Evolution, however, it wasn't as good as Ghostbusters, MiB, or any other comedy movies.

David Duchovny and Orlando Jones are Junior College Prophesors that make an unbelieveable discovery. No matter what they to do to keep it a secret it still leaks out to the government. When the government gets involved so does Julianne Moore, Who is a total babe, Julianne is both a genius and a cluts, which makes for a perfect charater in this movie. Every actor in the movie is hilarious and a perfect fit.

I missed it at the box office but I couldn't imagine that it was not funny so I went ahead and ordered in on DVD. I thought, hey I bet this will be another \\"Ghostbusters\\". BIG MISTAKE! This movie sucks. I struggled through watching it. It was rarely anywhere near funny and the attrocious story and acting made it one to add to the list of worse movies.

It has everything that GHOSTBUSTERS had (neat special effects; a large cast; Ivan Reitman) except for the humor. Without Bill Murray around, GHOSTBUSTERS probably would not have worked as well, and this 'film' is proof of that...Duchovny should have stayed with the X-Files a bit longer, so that someone else could have been cast as his character. He didn't deserve this movie...The special effects are neat, but they are there only for the *WOW* factor, and that is where it fails, too.

I'm not sure if this was a comedy, an action film, a science fiction movie, or just a complete piece of garbage.Aside from a few funny parts with Sean William Scott and Orlando Jones, this movie was not funny. And aside from a few explosions and some small gunfire scenes, it wasn't an action film. Aside from a bunch of mutating aliens, it wasn't really a sci-fi flick.

Thanks again and God bless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great light hearted entertainment","review":"This is a highly entertaining movie with little substance. The cast is fun (although David Duchovny is certainly stiff in a comedic role), the story is amusing and the production qualities are high. The story by no means has any profundity to it, but its amusing and entertaining overall. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charles Darwin is rolling over...","review":"This movie is plagued by lame dialogue, bad acting, ill-advised physical comedy and more. There are a couple of laughs at the end (I won't spoil it for people who still feel the need to see this) -- and Sean William \\"Stiffler\\" Scott is always good in his stoner persona, but this was still a disappointment. Julianne Moore is hopeless as the clutzy government scientist. I was also shocked by the really inferior video quality of this DVD. The film had an ever-present dull, grainy appearance. At least a nice transfer would have made this fiasco a little more watchable. A rental at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious The Millenium's Ghostbusters And Men In Black","review":"I just saw Evolution today and I half to say this is a great movie. This Is Ivan Reitman's new comedy masterpiece.The movie is a mixture of movies Ghostbusters,Men In Black,Lake Plaid and Jurassic Park. The film stars David Duchovony and Orlando Jones who are scientists who work at a college and are sent to a desert in Arizona to a discover a meter that crashed in the desert what they discover is an alien organism that can reproduce and grow into millions and keeps growing without stopping.The film also stars Sean William Scott and Julianne Moore.Great effects and story that will keep you laughing through the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a documentary.

It's something about the curve of the handle that makes all the difference. With each of the previous two I owned, eventually the metal handle wore itself all the way through the rubber and at that point, it began to rub blisters on my palm.

It tells the story (in first person) of Jud, a wayward soul who decides to take employment as a Time Courier. Time Couriers are basically time-traveling tour guides, and are responsible for ferrying and watching over groups of tourists to famous historical events. Jud's particular fascination is ancient Byzantium, so he takes on the tour groups going back to see Emperor Justinian, the Haghia Sophia, and other sights. This to me is one area where this book shone. Silverberg made ancient Byzantium come alive for me, and sparked a whole line of discovery and amazement after I had finished the book. I have re-read this great story seven or eight times and never grow tired of it. If you like time travel stories, with a dash of humor and a teaspoon of history, GET THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"up the line","review":"I would not recommend this book unless you are 12-14 yrs. old.

And of course everyone from 12 up through the centures has sex -sex and much more sex. Sleep with your grand parents no problem it gets BORING after the first few pages. I gave it a 2 star because of the time travel other wise a 1 is to good for the book. Oh I forgot to mention the only thing time treavelers want to see is battles -death and hacking up people.

Unlike many of his contemporaries who think \\"Oh baby, yeah yeah, do it like that\\" is an example of good lyrics, Joshua TELLS STORIES.

I still thought we would play with it without the scoring. Then the leg that supports it cracked so the game became unsteady. Last the hoop cracked. I do not think we overused it or abused it.

Most are quick and short, but it's a nice introduction to those authors. There are many complete works. Enough to whet you appetite for more great reading, in my eyes.

It's a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essential Collection","review":"W.W.

Among the complete works are such timeless tales as Walden, Benito Cereno, The Scarlet Letter, and Douglass' Narrative of the Life, each a significant piece not just among American literature, but among American history.What I find particularly enjoyable is the fact that it holds so many different pieces that if there is a time in which I have nothing better to do, Norton's American Literature Anthology most likely will have something to suit my mood. Among the many poems, essays, and narratives, there is surely something new to find whether being a piece of literary work or a symbolic significance to search for within a piece I may have already looked through. It is something I plan to keep on my bookshelf to enjoy for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book purchase review","review":"I bought these a while ago for a college literature class.

Plus it is very quiet (especially compared to those ritzy ones my mom buys). If you have to use a dryer while someone else is asleep, this one is less likely to bother anyone.

The writing, story development, acting, and superb cast are genuine, not a false note anywhere. Thanks to Shout Factory for a beautiful presentation of Season 1 episodes. It's a miracle these shows hold up so well after 40 years. Marcus Welby MD was way ahead of its time, and I think surpasses so much of what's on television today.

It's inflective in its own outright, bursting with melodies and hooks despite the lack of vocals. Soothing but not tacky. It is their early sound, which is more characertized by electronic touches than it is now, but it holds strong through the end, capping in a rousing 20 minute plus lush organic blend of acoustic dexterity and subliminal ambient electronica. This is not a CD to break out at the boogie down segment of your housewarming party, but moreso for a twilight sitting in the backyard with a gin and tonic in your lap, and midwestern wind teasing the clothesline in the background.

The samples you can find will tell you, however, that the cuts are similar to one another, and lack much sense of dynamic range or shading.

Both are very poetic, and make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. However, there were a couple things that gave me pause. First of all, this book was written in the 1980's and it seems to indicate that the whole world should be enlightened by now. Clearly that is not the case. What really got me though, was the \\"narrator\\" stating that he was Jesus of Nazareth, a person for whom there is no authentic historical record other than the bible, which is a religious text of Christian mythology. Sorry...great writer, but I think I'll stick to reading books by people who don't make such ridiculous claims.

However, \\"The Third Millenium\\" takes the reader into a realm that feels both divine and yet eminently accessible in a way that far exceeds his other work. The message is poetic and reassuring. I found myself filled with a sense of awe, relief and pleasure just in the process of reading it.Anything as profoundly inspiring as \\"The Third Millenium\\" most certainly draws on the energy of a consciousness that lies beyond our normal awareness.

When I heard a fourth book to Flambards was out, I made a trip to the library and settled down to what I thought would be a great read. But it wasn't. I was very disappointed in Flambards Divided. Not to give away the plot, but let's say I wasn't at all pleased in whom Peyton decided Christina's choice of who was right for her after all.

Flambards came alive best,though, through the fabulous mini-series of the late 70's.

While the categorical language is admittedly a bit heavy for (most) physicists, the book itself is clearly written, and Geroch does a fine job of delineating the key topics. That is why I have decided to give this book 4 out of 5, thus betraying my partiality towards mathematical rigor in physics. My personal favorite is Geroch's insightful discussion of dynamical systems and topological spaces. The only objection that may be raised is the layout of the book. The main definitions and theorems are not set apart from the rest, and this makes the text appear denser than it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Doll!","review":"It is nice doll, it was purchased for a birthday gift for my nice, and it fullfiled all our expectatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretend Fire Fighter","review":"I ordered this for our grandson who is 3 for Christmas.

He's like a bad comedian who won't quit after the first chuckle: \\"Maybe you'll laugh harder if I say the same thing six or seven times, getting sillier as I go.\\" Lem compounds his crimes with garish moralizing, often dripping with condescension: \\"Hee hee! They so dumb, we so smart, me give them funny names like Stupidicus von Logarithm then tell logarithm jokes for 17 pages.\\"Despite the insufferable writing, Lem's ideas are often quite good, nudging the book into the two-star category. One wonders how the book would have turned out in the hands of an author with imagination, wit, *and* writing skills: Arthur C. Clarke, Kurt Vonnegut, or (with a few plot adjustments) Franz Kafka."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should be renamed: The Cyberetard.","review":"I actually managed to wade through several of the \\"stories\\" in this book before I gave up.For the most part, books should be enjoyable to read.This one by Lem (like many others) requires a lot of work on the readers part to sort though the jumble of non-sense words.I've never done drugs; however, I believe you have to in order to read one of his books.I understood all the words he used - I guess he just didn't put them in the right order; because it sure was tiresome to read...Better than His Masters Voice - Not by much though."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE there are several shades for this one color","review":"This polish has a pink tone.

Anything.As he quest to meet the woman of his dream intensifies, Abbott discovers abilities he never knew he had, and his love for the mystery woman could prove to be not only his own undoing, but all of mankinds.Quite possibly one of the best example of the genre, you have to read The I Inside.

The Ultimate Infatuation: You see a woman in a car as you're walking down the street, and you drop everything, literally, to meet her. Nothing can stop you. Your life is meaningless if you cannot be with her. This is how the novel starts, and set in an era when alien contact is a reality (and the aliens can teleport at will), how in a little genetic cloning, interplanetary gates, and an invasion, and you have a novel that makes ID4 look tame - you could punch the aliens in ID4, these guys just teleport away.

The new one, he did not give the time of day. The elevator was a joke and a platform would not stay on. It took up half of my dining room which I would have happily sacrificed if only he actually played with the toy. I said good bye to it last night as we donated it to a daycare in the area.

The command center has been banged around, dropped and even stood on by both my 3-year old son and my 13-month old daughter without any damage. Stands up very well to the tortures that a young boy can dish out.Secondly, this toy, along with the rest of the Rescue Heroes, are a hit with everyone. Fisher Price nailed it perfectly by offering a toy that involves rescueing instead of fighting. My son has fun rescuing everything from the Command Center. When the other kids come over to play, the Command Center gets more attention than the movies or other toys.A perfect toy to spark imagination and foster a sense of doing good instead of taking down the bad guys. Well done, Fisher Price.

He has a lot of the rescue hero action figures and four of the vehicles and I think he may be a little overwhelmed. However when someone plays with him he loves it. There are big plastic card like things you put in to change what mission the rescue heros are on. His favorite mission is the earthquake. He likes to rescue \\"people\\" in his toy cars. Also the talking action figures can change what mission they're on to coordinate with the command center. The toy took about an hour to put together, and since this was a birthday gift, next time I would probably assemble it ahead of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Mission Cards??","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas, and he just loves it. It's absolutely huge though, so be sure you have room for it! We were out shopping today, and noticed brand new Rescue Hero figures for sale.

I must say I was as excited to play with it as he was. I was a bit disappointed that the figures don't say more things when hooked up to the back pack. I thought they would say other phrases than what they normally say with their own backpack. It was also sort of a pain to put together. You had to align the tabs just so or it wouldn't pop together. Seems to me, that is a problem with most Fisher Price toys you have to assemble. It always seems like the plastic is cheap and flimsy. Once I assembled this toy though, it did seem sturdy enough.Also,there were about thirty stickers I had to apply myself. My son is three and very happy with the toy and plays with it constantly.

I would advise people not to buy it or at least be careful concerning the person selling the item. Even though the Amazon ad says that the disc will play in all regions, that isn't necessarily true.

This is apparent with the first song, \\"Bwana she no home\\" and with the classic \\"Man Smart, Woman Smater.\\" Fortunately, these songs are not the highlights on this interesting album. The standouts are \\"Calling Occuptants of Interplanetary Craft,\\" taken right from the Star Wars craze, and from Evita, \\"Don't Cry for me Argentia.\\" This version of Argentina is the best I have heard. Madonna's version isn't even in the same leauge. While Madonna sounds like she is straining for the notes, Karen hits them effortlessly and with power and feeling that Miss M can only dream about. To add more musical styles, look at the Juice Newton penned \\"Sweet, Sweet, Smile.\\" In 1978, this song took the Carpenters into the top 10 on the country charts. \\"I Just Fall in Love Again\\" adds more power to this wonderful album.This CD is a lot of fun! Don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Argentina","review":"For me, the highlight of the album is the Evita song. Wow, as others have said, Karen outsings Madonna so much that it doesn't even sound like the same song in the movie. (But don't we all know that Madonna really doesn't sing? Are we surprised? NO)I lived in Argentina for a couple of years and it's interesting that the Argentine import of this album did NOT have the Evita song, probably because so many Argentines love Evita Peron that they thought it was subversive to sing about her.Yes, the song selection is a bit strange, but the Carpenters albums always had a variety of selection from country-sound, to rock ballads, to acapella singing, etc. This is an UNDERAPPRECIATED album and I'm really excited to receive my copy, which I just ordered.

It is a book that my husband uses in the college classroom and is also a book that we used for devotions in our home for our older children. The long term commitment of missionaries of past eras has spoken loud and clear to us that today's method of \\"doing missions\\" has drastically changed, at times for the better and at times not so. All laymen should read this book to see what obstacles those of the past overcame. We have the same God and similar or even greater challenges in missions today but with the promise that greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Candid, simple presentation of missions","review":"Ruth Tucker makes world missions more interesting than most writers I've read. Some want to glorify missionaries and present them as almost infallible in their devotion, spirituality, and mission practices. But I think most missionaries would rather be presented realistically, as fallible humans who are simply trying their best to spread the Gospel by whatever means possible.I once tried to team up with a writer to write world missions curricula for schools. This book was one of my sources. But when the co-author realized I was approaching missionaries, not as perfect angelic beings, but as dedicated but fallible Christian saints, she tore into me with the most vicious dressing down I've ever received. I actually respect Christian leaders more when they're willing to admit their weaknesses and imperfections, but I guess there are some who find this unpalatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Buffy Sainte-Marie","review":"This is the CD they should have named \\"The Best of Bu ffy Sainte-Marie.\\" The songs are better than in any of her other CD's--or in most any CD's you can find anywhere.

The first CD is filled with what seem to be demo versions of songs. Usually a single member and an acoustic guitar without mixing nor accompanying harmony from other band members.While this is interesting, it has no replayablity, and leaves me yearning for the \\"finished\\" songs that are yet to come. Perhaps if the CD had the rough cut followed by the \\"real\\" version it would have some merit, but as it stands it seems a cynical ploy to sell studio tapes knowing that the public will buy anything Beatles, even though this denegrates the magic of Beatle Mania, rather than enhances it.I view this as [money] wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"money , money, money","review":"rough mixes, demo recording, studio chats.....die hard fans will be happy with this release.

A great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look...","review":"Many people are disappointed because they see hits like \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" and expect it to be a best-of collection - no, it's an assortment of rarities & alternate takes, and intended for the fans who want to catch an earful of Beatles that they haven't yet heard after these thirty or so years since the band stopped making new music together.And as far as such collections go, this is very nice. The alternate takes can be strange, but they can also give well-known songs brand new life. The new songs are excellent. It should satisfy the fans, which the Beatles had many of. Casual listeners may be dismayed at the stripped-down performances and unfinished thoughts - but that's what this album is supposed to be. It's not a greatest hits package, it's a bunch of songs that have yet to be released or odd versions of the classics. On that level, it is a success."},{"rating":"2","title":"my fave of the Anthology series","review":"After hearing this, I think the Anthology needed 1 more volume, so that #3 could be 2 discs devoted just to the White Album outtakes! Also... disc 2 of this just tantalized those of us Beatles fans who think NOW IS THE TIME for GET BACK: THE ORGINIAL ALBUM! These 2 discs are great just to listen to, and I love putting disc1 in my CD shuffle with both White Album discs, it is so fun! ...hm... this whole series is just so nostalgic... if Elvis releases new albums ever year after being dead all this time.. what of the Beatles? Come on Apple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now for the Get Back album","review":"This album is complementary to the others in the series, it doesn't stand alone. However some of the selections are puzzling, particularly the versions of Two of Us and Teddy Boy. Both are outtakes which never made it onto the aborted Get Back albums. Teddy Boy in particular is disappointing. In its original form it went for over five minutes and appeared on the first Get Back album. In edited form it appeared on the second version of Get Back. On this particular album we get a different version which breaks down halfway through. Surely the original unedited Get Back version could have been included? The same goes for Two of Us - a limp outtake which pales into insignificance when compared with the Get Back version. The only solution is to release the original Get Back album to coincide with the 30th anniversary of Let It Be's release. Beatles fans have been demanding this for many years and EMI and Apple shouldn't hold back any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Chapter","review":"Anthology 3 covers the expansive White album sessions as well as the Abbey Road and Get Back/Let it Be recordings. It is amazing that even after all the great music they made in 1966-67, they would still have such a catalog of songs. It is interesting to hear songs that would eventually appear on solo albums like \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Junk\\" in the context of a Beatles album and to her the Let It Be songs in their raw, un-Spectorized versions. A great final chapter to the revealing and enlightening Anthology series."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent screen adaptation of a play","review":"This is one of the best screen adaptations of a play I've ever seen. From the first moment the intelligence behind this film is apparent - the Prince is in the garden, in sharp focus, and the others (Elector, etc.) approach with torches, but out of focus. So you have the dreamy quality of the play established immediately. The film is shot in virtual darkness, with faces highlighted, suggesting the murkiness and ambiguity surrounding the prince. Plus excellent performances, an evocative soundtrack, and Kleist's dialogue.I was expecting to be disappointed.

I liked the idea of using a bottle of frozen water as the coolant. What's inadequate is the fan. I believe it would work much better if the fan had some power to it, which it doesn't.

It was a great idea, but it needed to be a lot more rugged. It would appear that the slightest drop on the floor or knock with a book on your desk would destroy the weak fan. 4 Things wrong with it:- Should have come with more water bottles so that you can switch.- The fan is VERY weak.- Limited 30 day warranty (or 45 or 90 day). I understand now why the warranty is so short.- It does NOT come with a power cord. Had to spend about $17 @ radio shack to get the cord and the correct adapter.I plugged another adapter (a bit overrated) and the speed of the fan increased significantly.

All a bit too sword and sorcery-like for me. Costuming for the Iceni tribe and particularly for the heroine was atrocious and unrepresentative.

My interest (and worse: the spirit of Boudicca) was brutalized by an incredibly poor script, that was brought to life by trite performances -- the result, I'm sure, of a wandering directorial view.In trying to be a combination of historical drama, historical romance, morality tale, war film, and mystical allegory, WARRIOR QUEEN ends up failing on all counts.

The Celtic costumes looked a little better; on the other hand, how hard is it to recreate a costume that resembles rags?The acting looked pretty uninspired.The sound editing was also horrid. I skipped around to see the battle scene, and it looks like they didn't even bother to add in any sound effects.Have you ever seen \\"Druids\\" (starring Christopher Lambert)?

I strongly recommend this book to anyone wholikes a good story, but has patience. By this I mean you must geet through the beginning pages to get to the interesting part of the novel. Trust me, it's worth it. One of the interesting parts of this novel is that we could actually create anartificial lifeform in a laboratory. This is what Dr. Frankenstien did. This creation that was supposed to be perfect turned ou to be a monster. Frankenstien was rejected by society because of the way he appeared. This rejection caused the monster to become violent.

They refuse to report what they did because the driver would go to jail. The four of them have to face the threats of the secrets person. Who is now sending notes?This book is good in many different ways. One reason it's good is that it's in third person, so readers can see the different story from each person! Another reason it's good is because it's interesting and has a big twist in the end that readers won't guess.

It had the same basic plot, but thats about it. As many movies that are based on books, the book is a lot better. This story is about four teens who accidentely hit a kid riding his bike while they were drunk and speeding, they did as much as they could to cover up the murder, but one year later one of the teens gets a note that says \\"I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER.\\" Next, the person that wrote the note starts blackmailing them by leaving newspaper articles about the hit and run, and pictures of them standing by the kid after the acident. Eventually he begins threatening them. The teens know that they need to find out who knows what they did, before they are either found out by police, or even worse killed by the blackmailer. This book is very suspenseful and it has a lot of twists in the plot. Its a must read for fans of any book fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"*The most boring book*.","review":"I did not like this book becauseI thought it was going to be scary.

It is more of a whodunit than a horror (unlike the awful movie release.) Lois Duncan has put together a great story and lots-o-thrills. Jennifer Love Hewitt did not come close to playing the book version of Julie James. Sarah Michelle Gellar & Ryan Phillippe would be fine though.

But if you are going to read it JUST because of the movie, you might be disapointed because some things are different. The plot is almost the same: four drunk teenagers accidently kill a boy on his bycicle. They decide to make a pact: No one will ever know what they did. So they don't see each other anymore until someone sends to one of the teens, a note saying: I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER. They become desparate and start investigating who is blackmailing them. The story has a great suspense climax and the end is very good. Still, in this book there are no deaths and I think that would of made me give this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"my book review","review":"The book was ok .

This book is about a girl named Julie James. Who was involved in hit and run freak accident with her three friends Helen, Barry, and Ray. This car accident caused the death of a pedestrian on a bicycle, or so they thought.Julie has dealt with the guilt of not saying anything to the police or anybody else about what she knows. She decided to try and push the memory out of her life because of a pact that Barry made the four of them make, saying that they swear to never mention the incident again. Julie was trying to get her life back together until one day when she got a letter in the mail saying \\"I know what you did last summer.\\" From then on the four friends continually got harassed about the situation by an unknown someone. To find out what happens you have to read the book.I think this was a good book. I would recommend it to people who like suspense and excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Troubles","review":"I Know What You Did Last Summer was a great book.

First of all, it does work. It works perfectly as long as the batterys are fresh. The only time it did things like the previous reviewers described was when the batterys were low. My son played with it all the time for three months before it started saying the wrong letters. A quick change of the batterys and it worked wonderfully again. When my son rec'd this he was just starting to learn his letters. If I remember correctly, he knew AB and C. Now he knows the entire alphabet, and will say things like D,D is for drum. The only thing I would change about this is make it so that it says more than one word for the differant letters. The toy is excellent, and I would strongly reccomend it. I will even be purchasing this product for all of my nieces and nephews. Any toy that teaches a child something is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters don't read","review":"I love to purchase fun educational toys for my children and was excited to get this home for them. When each block is dragged across the desk it is supposed to \\"read\\" each block. The blocks should say the letter, the sound it makes and a word beginning with the letter. Unfortunately, the desk doesn't always read the letters and it often took several tries before it did. There are games that can be played too, but my children never got that far since they couldn't get it to respond properly. This would be a great toy if it worked as it is described by the manufacturer. Fisher-Price needs to improve this toy before I would recommend anyone to buy this. I think the LeapFrog Read and Write Phonics desk is a better purchase if you are looking for a toy that will help with letter recognition, phonics, writing, and spelling games."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work even with fresh batteries!","review":"You have to press the letters pretty hard on the desk to get the correct response. You also have to make sure the letter starts at one end and rolls all the way to the other. You can't start the letters in the middle of the desk or roll them on just one wheel the way a 3 1/2 year old is prone to do. Even if you do roll it correctly it still might not respond to you. First I thought I needed to freshen the batteries the way everyone in these reviews said to do but it did not help at all! My child isn't the least interested in this toy and it just sits there no matter how much I get it out and try to help her with it. It is too frustrating for a child that is in their independent stage. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Learning Toy","review":"This toy works great and is helping my just turned 4 yr. old his letters and sounds. His almost 6 sister also loves it and it is helping her learn and practice her phonics. They like to play school together with this toy. Cool item and well worth it. Great price for such a good toy. Also the volume level is nice and not annoying-so many toys are so loud and annoying-not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"great 3 years & running","review":"We loved this toy. It has always worked great (for the 3+ years we've had it). We've never had a problem rolling the letters or hearing the sounds.

I bought this book to read it cause it was a top choice of many reviewers, but I didn't like it. Neither the style (short phrases, too much dialog, kind of fast-paced, very short chapters) nor the characters (single-sided and totally unlikable). The story once again features an Aztec demon guest star straight from Mictlan. One or two nice ideas but other than that not good at all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best!","review":"Okay, so it isn't pounding, gross-out, fingernails-scratching-at-walls traditional horror. This is a slow, almost gentle character study. Masterton doesn't even bother to hide where he is going. The very fact that someone does a job like Bonnie's in the real world is disturbing enough. That we like her so much we begin to descend in hell along with her is VERY upsetting. I like pulp horror too (Harry Shannon's \\"Night of the Beast\\" being the most recent example of a well done rollercoaster ride)but this one is something altogether different. Settle in for a quiet, skin-crawling text about true psychological horror and you won't be disappointed. Subtle and dazzling. I think it is one of Masterton's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I need you dont have here","review":"This little novella, all 218 pages of it, read by me in less than an hour was a perfect morsel of horror and brilliance. Masterton has a way with words, and setting the scene in your minds eye. I actually started to wonder how much money I could make cleaning up houses after bloody events!! Bonnie, our whiz at cleaning and dinner (love the included recipes by the way) has such an opposing life, by day she is doing what she loves by night she is feeding an ungrateful miserable husband and her 17 year old racist teenager. You immediately feel her pain, and her accomplishments. I wont give the books plot away, I will just say that I am again well fed by Graham Masterton and his delicious imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slapstick","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have ever read.

Very unmemorable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the right book for first time Vonegut readers","review":"I didn't know what to expect because this was my very first time reading Kurt Vonnegut's work. I hated it. It seemed silly, pointless, and strange. I couldn't deal with it. I don't ever want to read Kurt Vonnegut ever again. It's not awful. It was a shock. I've never read anything like it before, and it doesn't gently ease you into it.If you do read it, know that it's extremely quirky. If that's your style, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real dog ... what was he thinking?","review":"One of Vonnegut's worst. The plot and characters are all over the map. There is a lot of sillyness, as usual for KV, but undirected sillyness.

If this saves anyone from reading this deranged novel, then I just spent a productive five minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very eccentric style","review":"\\"SLAPSTICK OR LONESOME NO MORE,\\" by Kurt Vonnegut is a great satirical and weird story of two ugly twins named Eliza Mellon Swain and Wilbur Rockefeller Swain, who after being parted by their parents and not seeing each other in a long time, went berserk in the reunion. Ironically, neither Eliza nor Wilbur were expected to be intelligent or live more than 14 years old, but who would say that Wilbur would turn out to be the president of the U.S.A. and meet with the king of Michigan. And that Eliza would die at the age of 50 in an avalanche on the outskirts of the chinese colony on the planet Mars. This is a great story put into a bizarre way because \\"it's the closest thing that Vonnegut will ever come to an autobiography and the way he feels towards life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The irony of the poor review above.","review":"I'm sorry, but anybody who reviews a novel by Kurt Vonnegut as 'stupid,' and then follows it up with the sentence, 'I havn't gave up on Vonnegut yet' does not deserve to have their review taken seriously at all. Not only does this devalue the Amazon review forum, but it is obvious that the reviewer didn't understand one thing Vonnegut satirizes in this novel. I ain't gave up on Vonnegut either, because he's never given me a reason to gave up on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut's downhome Dadaist look at 1 of many USA futures.","review":"Vonnegut's downhome Dadaist look at 1 of many USA futures is engrossing entertaining and like a Model-A cruising in Outerspace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Vonnegut.","review":"Slapstick is a true Vonnegut classic. At its simplest, Slapstick is the story of a brother and sister isolated from their family due to birth defects (both mental & physical) and their life's journeys once they are seperated from each other. Of course with any Vonnegut story their are many twists, turns and sub-stories contained within the bigger story. Slapstick is also the comical tale of the end of the world as we know it and what leads us there.The writing of Slapstick is great and very easy to read. You can read this story in only a few sittings but as with any Vonnegut book the story can get confusing to follow at times. Although I highly recommend reading this book, If you have not read any Vonnegut before I would suggest reading either 'Mother Night' or 'Slaughterhouse 5' first to get acquainted with his unique writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"U know hi ...","review":"I thought this book was terrific that is why I give it 4 stars. There are many reasons why it deserves the 4 stars but one in particular is that Kurt Vonnegut explains how the characters (Wilbur & Eliza) felt through out there journey in captivity which is great for a person who sometimes feels the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seamless Sounding Track Selections From a Great Band!","review":"The tracks selections are identical to the other earlier \\"Diary\\" releases such as the Dutch Disky and the English Pickwick ones although the sound quality could probably do with some remastering, the overall sound quality isn't bad.This compilation album is great because the tracks all seem to run together so well that it sounds like a cohesive normal album and not like a usual jumbled up and disjointed best of compilation.The track selections represent the best work this highly underrated band has done and is a good choice if you are looking for a best of set of this band at least until they decide to remaster this.I for one would like to hear what some modern sound-cleaning technology would do for this cd.

I live in a rural area and had no trouble finding someone who knew what fibromyalgia was and is very willing to work with me on any treatments that I want. I am also seeing a pain management specialist who is the same way. Be smart, do your own research as there is plenty of reliable information out there such as the Fibromyalgia Newsletter.

Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This film may be my favorite of the whole series. This film features such an accurate representation of issue #23 of LW&C: performers, and the story itself is very moving. O-Yuki is a very sympathetic character that whose quest for revenge is even more admirable than Itto's as she was not only disgraced but violated as a woman. (...) The ending battle scene is also magnificent. (...) While the battle is not as visceral as the one in the previous entry or part 6, this film's battle is still quite magnificent. As I said before, this is my favorite film in the whole series though all of them feature spectacular amounts of bloodshed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is another in a series of Lone Wolf and Cub I have seen. I was first introduced to this series by watching Shogun Assasin. This one had a very good plot and allowed us to see more of the personality of the Cub. The fight scenes were excellent. The only one that was not up to par of all the ones that I have seen is the scene in the temple where you couldn't see clearly what was going on but know that this was realism as it would have happened that way. I have almost completed my collection of all six in the series and look forward to the last two."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the review you been looking for!!

So I see the words \\"Jam and Glam\\" and I'm thinking \\"Glam...\\"And it all seemed to fit together. Barbie is very appropriate for her age group. Needless to say, I was very pleased.

Basically, there is the evil prince john and the hero and a slew of other people, but you've got no idea what motivates the hero or prince john or anyone else for that matter.

It also has an extra pocket with plenty of storage space for things like a cell phone and keys. My only other complaint is that the clip that holds the hose in place is easy to loose if you want to drink on the go. Mine is gone. However tucking the hose in place is completely comfortable and unnoticeable, so problem solved. I take half a star away for the clip and another half star for the bounciness.

The interview with Geneen Roth again two pages, she talks about how much weight she lost over the years, and that when she was thin she still was not happy.

In this book, he gives a detailed picture of what we know of Ivorybill biology, as well as an idea of the many questions that persist. He also describes very well the decline of Ivorybills, which he attributes largely to habitat loss.Early ornithologists who saw, collected, painted, and photographed the birds are given life in these pages. Finally, Jackson describes his own careful searches for the bird, both in the southern US, as well as in Cuba: he just may have encountered Ivorybills, but the fleeting encounters are frustrating.I certainly recommend this book to those interested in birds, or endangered and extinct species, and wildlife in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring pseudoscientific drivel","review":"I really wanted to like this book.

It should be required viewing for anyone considering moving overseas, regardless of the country. Your move will be what you make of it and how much work you're willing to do to try and \\"fit in\\". The Mayle's did their best to learn the language and culture, to make friends, to attend and have parties, etc. They also learned what true friendship is all about along the way, and that patience truly is a virture. The story about the \\"big house\\" and the rooster will floor you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the French, its easy","review":"Hey, you have heard all the stories of the French...well, perhaps you will see some of that in this movie, but, you are going to understand the French a bit more after watching this wonderful movie.

The characters are entirely believable - take it from me, I've been there! And the mix of French and English keeps the interest of non-French speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light enjoyable chance to live vicariously in France","review":"This is light entertainment that can take you away from your own life for awhile. Its very well written and acted. John Thaw is wonderful as Peter Mayles and he captures the spirit of the book.However, if you are one of those people who insist on a very literal interpretation of the book, you may find fault with this dramatization. \\"A Year in Provence\\" was a small book and this DVD is four episodes in length. There is a lot of added material, but its very much in the style of Mayles' book. While I enjoyed the book very much, I found the DVD to be just as much fun with the added bonus of the scenery of Provence.When we finished watching this DVD, we missed being in Provence with the characters in the story. A warning to potential viewers- you will find yourself on the computer perusing property for sale in Provence when you've finished watching it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Year of Amusement!","review":"THis film is alot of fun and though some of it is in French and a mixture of French and English-it only increases the humor as the characters continue to misunderstand each other.

A must see for all those dreaming of living in Provence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Year in Provance","review":"What a switch from murder, grewsome operations and injury, and insane office relationships, this adventure in suttle culture shock, homeownership, hotel and guest home management is a welcomed change. Kindness, human interest, and downright picturesque scenery makes me feel as if I'd been on a one year vacation! Watching John Taw was an added treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best video's ever made!","review":"This is a \\"must have\\" video.

However, for most of us who can enjoy a film on its own merits, without comparing it to the book too closely, it is a marvelous film. This DVD will no doubt be mandatory for the many John Thaw fans who will not be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the approach!!","review":"While the ideas put forth in this book are rarely referenced to the satisfaction of a scholar, I did love her personal approach and the detail she gave on how she personally came to believe the way she does. Her 'organic' experience of paganism is very similar to my own and I related very well. I also purchased the other books in the series, Green Witchcraft II and Green Witchcraft III The Manual. I liked them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very earth-centered book","review":"I found that this book is very earthy. Moura describes a lot of basics to the Craft but then she goes into detail about what Green witchcraft is and how to go about practicing this form of wicca. I loved the rituals that I can always use and alter to my different celebrations. But I will say my favorite thing about this book is the herbal correspondences. I have never seen so many is a book before that wasn't stricty about magickal herbs. I would recommend this for anyone learning wicca or someone who has practiced wicca for some years. A good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-Kool","review":"A good friend gave this to me for christmas. Ironic, huh? =)But I love it, it's really given me a boost learning.

It's a great book - buy it! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far the Best Book I've Read in Regard to Witchcraft....","review":"This book is an absolute \\"Must Read\\"! Myself being a Witch, not a Wiccan (yes, there is a difference), I have read countless books on the Craft over the past 10 years. Although many of these books were quite interesting and offered great insight, needless to say something was missing. When I came across Green Witchcraft, I literally jumped for joy! I had finally found \\"The Book\\" or shall I say, \\"Books\\". Green Witchcraft, Green Witchcraft- part II, and the Manual, along with Grimoire for the Green Witch are indispensable! Page 75 & 76 truly hits the nail on the head...But, I won't give it away! Set aside a weekend for yourself. Curl up in your favorite chair and read this book! Brightest Blessings.... )O("},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Wiccan Essential","review":"This was the second guide to the craft I purchased and I think that it is a great resource for those in solitary practice. The most interesting thing (and perhaps unexpected)that I found in the book was the history located in the back of the book. Good detailed descriptions as well as loose suggestions on how to celebrate the 8 holidays on the witches calender were appreciated. I particularly ejoy Aoumiel's personal background and her insistence on freedom of options when it comes to choosing your rituals and reiterating the standard idea that you don't have to do anything rigid to feel confident in your practice. I also love her comparisons of traditional Wiccan holidays to those borrowed dates of Christian holidays, you know, just for a giggle and not written in a way to be superior. Most do not realize that each different religion in the world celebrates the same holidays, we just have different names for them! Good book if you are building your library on witchcraft..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I'll keep this short. I recommend this book to students of all levels.

I have incorporated some of her path into my own and have found it very rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and basic","review":"I have found this book to be a nice introduction to this path. It has rituals not often found in other books, such as those for coming of age, and a nice self dedication, and re-dedication. There is also useful info on herbs, dream interpretation, and tarot. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Green Newbies","review":"I loved this book, along with the book Green Witchcraft II.

Don't pass this one up it is wonderful :) Blessed Be!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An infant could use it! A child probably wrote it.","review":"This book is so for beginners, I would say it's for small children. It contains mostly all fluffy-bunny type material, suitable for kindergarteners. The \\"Craft history\\" presented in it is questionable, to say the least; and one could say, completely inaccurate... to... imagined. The rituals are extremely long, with \\"simple\\" purifications that could last over an hour, with only a few seconds for the actual rite, or verse for the celebration. I guess one has to fill a book up with something, right? The useful part of the book is it's cover, which has the refreshingly green picture; but one should have simply bought a picture of a green forest, instead. Otherwise, for sure, it does a fair job of offending Christians out there, of which, however, humans don't need more inaccuracy and misunderstanding in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Influenced me greatly","review":"I read this book when I was first starting off, and it didn't really seem to stick with me. A year later, I re-read it and was startled to discover that it had indeed influenced me greatly. Read this book, then re-read it a year or two later and see if it does the same for you. Green Witchcraft II is also highly recommended, read them together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Beginners","review":"I have read many books on witchcraft and wicca and this has to be one of my favorites.

She is an excellent author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not rating but responding to WhiteRaven Review","review":"I hate to tell you this WhiteRaven, but I have a christian background as well and I've taken up Wicca to study. For your information you have no right to condemn whether someone is more Wiccan than anyone. I have used Mary as a symbol of the Goddess and it doesn't matter how someone celebrates the Sabbats or any days in honour of the God and Goddess just as long as they believe and feel them inside their soul, love and respect them. You have to think twice before you condemn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"It;s alright but ot really worth buying at full price, buy it used. The information presented is alright at best but the author really dosent touch on all the subjects proclaimed in the title, One the cover part of the subtitle reads Fairy Lore, theres hardly any of this present. If you are seeking an excelent book on the green craft then I reccomend HEALING WISE BY SUSUN WEED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great History Lesson for Beginners","review":"If your looking for a book that teaches the history and relevance of Witchcraft and the World in terms of the ideals, ethics and values of the HedgeWitch look no further this is a great book.

(Walter Hill as the vocie of Mr Ford....please!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy","review":"This documentary is not worthy of a director the stature of John Ford (Feeney)and the American mythology he created that still has a stranglehold on the national and global imagination. A good deal of his work indulged in the poetry of racial extermination; first of Native Americans and then the Japanese. In this, Ford was a master propagandist for the White Protestant establishment who contract story-tellers to legitimize their power and control. And who better to ask for than the son of Irish Catholic immigrants desperate to \\"prove\\" himself to the Anglo-Protestant class that has ruled this nation with the iron hand of military conquest encased in the velvet glove of entertainment media. A critical biography and/or documentary of John Ford has yet to be produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most creative effort","review":"It may or may not be the BEST Naked Raygun record, but I find \\"Throb Throb\\" to be their most creative & original. This is the one N.R. record where they fuse the quirky/art-punk/Wire-influence of the debut, \\"Basement Screams\\", with the more melodic post-punk sound (with elevated songwriting) of the later releases (starting with the next record, \\"All Rise\\"). Songs such as \\"Rat Patrol\\", \\"Gear\\", and \\"Libido\\" veer towards the past, songs (dare I say 'anthems'?) such as \\"I Don't Know\\" and \\"Only In America\\" veer towards the future.

She complained about the Core Bar but doesn't have one. Well, I do, and I LOVE IT! The Core Bar is absotlutely useful in this workout, it gets your balance and focus in line and you feel the effects of the simple moves that generate power in the core muscles. I read other reviews from Gibby Gril, and its apparent she writes alot of negative reviews, really mean. This dvd is well worth it, it is a very sold workout and the Core Bar is a fine piece of fitness equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda weak","review":"You would have to use some serious weights to get a real impact from this video.

I'm really glad I didn't waste my money on this one. First of all, I don't have the Core bar, but it seems like another piece of unecessary equipment.The Core bar isn't necessary for the workout...there is one participant who uses dumbells. The workout itself is rather clumsy and the Core bar makes it even worse. It's like she's desparately trying to incorporate the Core bar into moves that don't need it.The production and music is awful. The movements are so awkward that you can only use light weights or risk injury. I was really disappointed by this one.If you're looking for a good 30 minute toning workout, try Crunch's Caridiosculpt or Bootcamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a couple times to get used to...","review":"I love leisa hart videos - I started when I was pregnant with her FitMama Prenatal video and loved it so much I bought the Fitmama Postnatal workout. And both kept me in great shape during and after my pregnancy! Now that I need a more challenging workout I've gotten this video and I LOVE it. I dont have the core bar so I can't comment on that, but I would like to get one. Right now I'm just using dumbbells and that's fine too. The choreography is really great and really gets you working - However, it takes a bit of learning. The cues come fast and I felt a little clumsy the first two or three times I did it, but now I can keep up. I feel SOOO good after doing her videos.

Some of the edited out portions were subtle but I knew where the cuts were. A good movie should flow smoothly. For example, the story about Amin the beggar and Abrashield were entirely cut out.

The actual tales on which the film is based are far more sensual and involved. The film takes a great deal of liberty with the original tales, so one ought not expect a \\"faithful\\" reproduction.That said, I must say that I found this film to be an absolute joy to watch. The sets and costumes are wonderful eye candy, and the stories (prior caveat aside) are a great deal of fun. The script is tightly written and the acting excellent. The tale of Aladdin is particularly well done and humourous (John Leguizamo was the perfect casting pick for the roles of the two genies). Very highly recommended for everyone (though with a warning to prudes: there is one very brief scene, a bath, in which the camera-work doesn't quite manage to obscure a rather \\"revealing moment\\" for Dougray Scott)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding movie!","review":"This movie was absolutely outstanding!

The FX were incredible, but what realy drives the story is the chemistry between Avital and Scott, especially given the *incredible* job done by the latter in not just one, but two roles. While I think ABC could have done with a 3-part story instead of 2, which would have given us more interaction between the two principal characters, that is the *only* real complaint I have.

From the gripping \\"I stand accused\\" to the sad ballad \\"Nobody\\" you'll find her in great form and power! This soulful release will have you begging for more. At 11 songs it is simply not enough.Another standout is the optimistic and upbeat \\"Declaration of love\\". Randy is known for being a subtle vocalist at times, but she lets it all hang out on the wrenching \\"Blue mood\\" and bitter \\"I hope you'll be very unhappy without me\\".The true gem is her version of Marvin Gaye's \\"Just to keep you satisfied\\". What starts out as a low key romantic pleading Randy Crawford turns into a soulful mourn. This gives the original a run for its money.

He does show how actions caused the victory or defeat in a certain engagement, but stops short of blaming one commander or another for \`what they should have known.'The author divides his book into seven specific sections. In each section, the first \`chapter' is designed to provide an overview of the subsequent \`scenes', which are used to provide greater detail of events. This style offers the reader a look at the \`big picture,' which help them to understand the significance of the more critical events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash","review":"This book is fundamentalist hogwash.

I couldn't make this up.His detailed review of table manners towards the end is quite interesting, but the book is marred by a long, metaphysical, and wholly irrelevant screed against the materialist, science-driven viewpoint that supposedly dominates our culture. Most authors in the humanities just launch into their subject without apology, but Kass' long justification of Why Science Is Insufficient distracts from, and fatally mars, what might otherwise be a very reasonable (if much shorter) review of the culture of food and eating.Curiously, the preface contains a detailed explanation of why the author was not qualified to write this book. I'm inclined to believe him on this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"edifying but inedible","review":"One reviewer described this book as \\"reductionary humanism.\\" I think that is a fitting description. The problem is that Kass ignores Freud and Levi-Strauss, for instance, despite the fact that both, it could be argued, thought about nothing but eating. \\"Identification\\" and the \\"death drive\\" are, after all, the psychological analogs of swallowing and defecating. Levi-Strauss devoted thousands of pages to the table manners and the rest, but Kass doesn't bother to cite him once. And if he really wanted to treat the hunger in the soul, what about the eating disorder's, bulimia and anorexia and the rest. Kass takes a little too seriously Leo Strauss's injunction that is better to understand the low in terms of the high--he also liked to quote Hegel to the effect that philosophy should not be edifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid design.","review":"This comes with two pads - permanent and semi-permanent.

All you can do is move the rotating holder of the GPS to the position you want. You cannot bend or move the handle fixed to your dash-board. My Earlier Windshield mount (Which broke) had that. The Product looks strong. I Started using the permanent join rather than the temporary one (As i didn't wanted the GPS unit to keep failing, Which happened so many times with the windshield mount until it broke). Over all i am giving 2 stars for the price i am paying for this and the design of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mount but should be included with the Nuvi","review":"The mount works great but why didn't they include it? It is illegal to use a glass mount in some states and if you had an older Garmin that used the dash mount, this allows the nuvi to snap into that mount. Also, using the suction mount is a pain because the cord hangs down and looks bad. If you have a Nuvi, get this mount but complain to Garmin for not including it in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Doesn't Work","review":"Amazon suggested this as an accessory for the Garmin Nuvi 670, so I ordered it. It is impossible to place the Garmin unit onto the mount. This is an expensive mistake for me, as I paid shipping and duty (I live overseas, in Bermuda), and returning it is not inexpensive either.

Frankly, anything of value will result in the deaths of millions in vain attempts to acquire it.

You did not.Now add in the fact that this device has sides on it and is somewhat elevated and you will see that it takes up more space than the cans alone.If the device worked as it appears, you could easily fill from the top and take from the bottom, which would allow warm in and cold out.

For example, the coated wire ones sold at places like Bed, Bath & Beyond were horrible and did not stack at all. These containers actually stack, but they need to be filled with cans to get a proper fit. That's not going to be an issue for most people, but I find it annoying when I empty the top container and it falls into the bottom container that I'm trying to get cans out of. I have to keep both containers full...which defeats the purpose of having stacked containers of the same thing in the pantry.The other small detail that I don't like is that they don't stack squarely. The top one sits just a tad further back then the bottom container. So, they don't fit perfectly on a shelf on other square area.Other than those two things, the containers work very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cans jam when they roll.","review":"The sides of this dispenser are quite a bit wider than the standard soft drink can.

The poles supporting the plug do not fit together well and do a poor job of positioning and stabilizing the balloon in the firebox. And the end caps that are supposed to cap the poles do not remotely fit. Even when you can get it positioned in the right spot after a long period of adjusting it, the balloon's design tends to make it twist in upon itself, creating gaps along the sides.

(I returned mine for that reason alone) I am aware that my eyes are somewhat narrow, but I had another person check them out and they were to wide for his eyes as well. Otherwise, the view is good and bright and their ability to keep focus between zooming was better than some higher priced models I have recently looked at. After experiencing the slowness of their electronic zoom, I would probably prefer a well made manual zoom, assuming that the zoom knob was located in the right spot... some are not.

I got them because I thought they would be similar to the Earth Children series by Jean M. Auel. I read this one, the first, and it was BAD. Set in a time when gods and holy men meant everything, the characters in this book totaly dismissed all beliefs.

But even after a second go through of this book (and through the second), it just isn't taking hold. Maybe I was hoping for more history. Yes, I realize that the authors will have to do a lot of guesswork at this era. But why do they seem so much like more recent natives? Like these were the same people the Europeans ran across? That doesn't mean there isn't any interesting characters within all of the visions and hocus pocus.

Where I didn't have trouble figuring out that the wind, sun and animals were in fact that and not people, an arguement early in the book among the tribe had my head spinning trying to figure out which nature name was which; and I'm pretty sure one of the people was arguing with himself. The endurance of these hardy people does seem pretty super human but ignoring that in an early wolf hunt by explicit description the only clothing the hero had on was mittens.

When an attempted coup unfolds, his striking likeness to that country's reluctant, wastrel king leads to his conscription as a stand-in monarch, a task which he meets with typical British pluck. Coleman's dual acting role is a negligible achievement, but he's fine as the hero; Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. gets in some choice scenery chewing as the oily baddie who backs the evil Duke Michael in his attempt to steal the crown. Some great, artily arranged camera shots and moody, shadowy sets, and plenty of flashy, spangly costumes. (Now... is it just me, or does Mary Astor, who plays a bad-gal-gone-good, bear a striking resemblance here to 1990s actress Julianna Moore?) Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Switcheroo","review":"From \\"The Parent Trap\\" to \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\"---Whenever a movie features lookalikes, you just know that someone is going to take somebody else's place before long!

When the prince keels over drugged by those trying to stop his coronation, the entourage convince common Ronald to impersonate the prince at the crowning. That's just the beginning, as Ronald has to match wits (and swords, eventually) with Raymond Massey and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr while falling in love with Madeleine Carroll along the way before things can be set aright. \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" has many great moments--romantic and swashbuckling--and will have no difficulty entertaining you and your doubles, anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"taken for a ride","review":"It doesn't do what it claims it is supposed to do i.e. separate the filters- what else can I say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible disappointment","review":"I was so desperate after breaking my Mr. Coffee filter grabber from the 80s that despite the overwhelming number of negative reviews on this product, I was wiling to give it a try.

As the previous reviewers have pointed out, the shape of the tips is wrong and they have no grip.

This book is a bit outdated (it was written in 1930). A third of the book is concerning the analysis of mining and railroad companies.Plus the book was very rudimentary in its writings. Not really a book on speculation as an introductary book for a 1930's investor.

It was a good tool in 1889, which is the edition usually cited today. It went out of date almost immediately, since it was written before most of the papyri and inscriptions were discovered. But not only is Thayer incomplete, it is positively misleading, since he makes claims (for example, about the words \\"agape\\" and \\"phile\\") that are now discredited...although still popularly employed in books and sermons. There is no substitute for the up-to-date work of the 3rd edition of Baur's Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and other Early Christian Literature (2000), or Mounce's Word Studies for those who do not read the biblical languages. I would not use Thayer's except as a historical curiousity.

Here is my review, for what it's worth!I was quite prepared to grant Mr. Nokes' premise that Jane Austen was not the sugary-sweet homebody that others have made her out to be, but I really do not think she or her family could really be as bad as he insists. I have, for instance, a hard time believing that Mr. Austen encouraged his daughter's writing solely on the mercenary view of augmenting the family's income. I am willing to give credence to Mr. Nokes' arguments of the Austen family's imperfections.

It wasn't as difficult to put together as I had feared, and although on occasion a piece comes apart, it's been easy to put back together. And although not all cars work with it - we have more than enough Hot Wheels cars that do work (and you really only need 4 or 5 that work). This is one toy that all 3 of my boys (ages 2, 4 & 7) love to play with together. Even my husband and a friend of his enjoyed getting in on the action.

I do not recommend this toy, and am very disappointed in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"denise leigh","review":"After reading alot of bad reviews, I was pleasantly surprised with T wrecks. Three-4-5 and 30 year old had many hours of enjoyment. But,can be dangerous. Cars FLY out of his mouth in every direction. But the kids got a big kick out of that. Was also very difficult and time consuming to put together. (hotwheels offers an interactive guide on how-to-put together via internet) Fortunately, we read the reviews and knew this and put it together before giving it as a gift. WAS definately a big hit with the kids AND mom."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish we saw the reviews before purchasing","review":"My 5 year old son received this as a birthday gift from his grandparents. I plan to return it this weekend. Very simply, time consuming to put together...tall structure is unstable...pieces come apart way too easily...noisy motor...my 5 year old and 9 year old never got a car to go through the mouth. It just does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks alot better on tv","review":"I would not have given it any stars if I had that option! I should have read the other reviews before buying. I have to agree with everyone else, it is flimsy, and unstable. The braces dont want to stay on it, and most of his cars wont fit in it. You would think that because of this, they would have included some cars with the playset. I wasnt exactly cheap, especially since I purchased it with no discounts. Do yourself a favor and avoid! Unless you like to spend hours putting something together that falls apart within minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous!","review":"We purchased this toy for our then 4 yr old son Christmas of 2003. It was impressive! The cool factor is right up there. But when I noted how fast the cars dart upwards, I didn't want it in the house. If a child was standing in the wrong spot, the cars could take an eye out! WAAAAY too dangerous IMO. Took it back the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good!!","review":"It falls apart very easily. It's defintally not worth (...)!!

It seems really cool, but you cannot move it once it is put together and we all clear the area when it is turned on. It seems very dangerous to me.

After buying the \\"must have\\" Jet City last year for my son who was 4 at the time it also fell apart. I think he was able to play with it 2-3 days max before it fell apart and the main piece broke( the airplane).

The pieces fall apart constantly. It took my son about 15 minutes to stop playing with this toy that he wanted so badly. It was a great lesson in marketing for him. Now when he sees a \\"cool\\" toy on TV I just remind him of T-Rex race track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another nightmare by mattel","review":"Well Mattel has done it again. It's bad enough that the Barbie toys that had to be put together for my girls throughout the years were a nightmare, now this stupid toy for my nephews is just as horrible. Talk about a waste of time and money. Someone should sue Mattel for ruining many a Christmas. Maybe then they'll start taking some pride in what they manufacture. Or maybe their toys should come already assembled? Wonder how long it would take them? Don't bother with this T rex toy. Didn't want to give it any stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still together.","review":"I bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son this past Christmas and Today was the first time I had to reput it together. With an all boy 3 1/2 yo and a 2 1/2 year old girl which both play with this I'd say that it has held up pretty well. It is right now sitting in my living room staring at me. He has bunches of cars and most of them work on this track. The only reason ti came apart was because they had tipped it over to run the cars down the belly part and I didn't supervise it getting put together right away. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"My mom got this for my 4 year old son for Christmas. It was a huge disappointment for him and us.

The characters are dynamic and you care about them. The story of Jameson and Angelica, and their encounter and subsequent pairing is sizzling and as some of the other reviews stated, I didn't want to put it down until the end. The stories of some of the supporting characters must be as exciting and I can't wait to read them.After reading 'Born in Twilight', I called my favorite used book store to find the out of print copies with no luck, but I will keep looking.If you love a good romance with some suspence this is the book for you. You won't be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think that Maggie Shayne is a wonderfully exciting author","review":"The story of Jameson is a great finish to a fantastic series. The Twilight series is the best vampire series I have read in a long time the only series to equal to this series would be Linda Lael Millers vampire series. The Jameson Bryant story is compelling in the sense that the heroine Angelique has to struggle with the spiritual beliefs that she has dedicated her life to, with her new nature as a vampire. It is also great to catch up with all of Jamesons family of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me!","review":"I liked the later books in this series And went back to read the earlier books so far I have not like any of them. The characters make no sense. Call for help then get mad at them for coming. the heroine spends the entire book calling the man she drained And left for dead, causling him to become a vampire a monster. Not a likeable group of people til later books, I was routing for the bad guys for awhile. Their decisions were just lacking sense! Every page I was thinking (oh please!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I got Born in Twilight, from my dad for my 14th birthday. I shrugged it off, because I've never liked romance novels. Until a couple months ago, I started to read it and couldn't put it down! It was so enchanting. I had to know what was going to happen to Jameson, Angelica, and their little baby, Amber Lily. Maggie Shayne put a whole new light upon how people view vampires today. I have one piece of advice, to all people how have not read this, Go and READ it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great vampire romance, that I couldn't put down!","review":"The characters in this book had real dimension to them and Maggie Shayne keeps you riveted to your seat because she really makes you care about what happens to these people.

Unfortunately, the quality of the production was less than I had hoped for. Not so much a problem with the DVD as with the quality of the filming itself.

Cannot recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Miss Marple, but these DVD's don't do her justice..","review":"I watched all the Miss Marple's as my Mother & I are big fans of Agatha Christie's many books. I watched the series when it ran years ago, and was looking forward with great anticiption to the DVD's. I must say this is the worst job of transferring a beautifully produced television series to DVD. There were so many artifacts from cramming everything onto single disks that they are in many cases, completely unviewable. I would recommend renting this set from Netflix or somewhere before purchasing them. This is such a major disappointment. I loved the series and waited with great anticipation for their release, only to discover they're unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Marple yet","review":"Joan Hickson is the best Jane Marple yet, and there have been several, from the primadonna Margaret Rutherford to the PBS one (can't remember her name, Gwen something-or-other). Hickson keeps me on the edge of my seat with her understated intelligence, while the other Marples are more or less unintentionally supercilious. And the Hickson productions are much better directed also - less Hollywoodish pap, more true mystery. This package is an amazig bargain for the price. My only serious criticism is the crappy sound - with all that bandwidth dedicated to the video, why couldn't they have added another 5 KHz of audio? This seems to be the case in too many dvd's that I've acquired."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm perplexed","review":"I read the first two reviews posted for this title and was extremely surprised. I consider myself to be a fairly fussy consumer and I think my eyesight is quite okay, but I wasn't away of any visual deficiencies in this release. Maybe quality control could be an issue, but that seems unlikely. I often rely on user reviews to help me decide whether to buy a DVD. I was so glad to see these appear that I went ahead and preordered them sight unseen, and I wasn't at all disappointed with the quality. I'm not saying that the other reviewers are wrong, but I definitely did not share their experience. Here's hoping more reviews will clarify this situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Batch?","review":"I ordered this DVD set and we were looking forward to many hours of enjoyable viewing. Some of the DVD's in the set, however, had digital scrambling problems, so we did the Amazon return thing, requesting that a replacement set be sent. When we received that replacement set, we were very disappointed to see that the digital scrambling was exactly the same as in the first set. I don't know if we got two from the same bad batch, or what, but now we don't have the set we were looking forward to placing in our video library."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO closed captioning/sound quality","review":"My husband, who has difficulty hearing, and I tried to watch the first episode and couldn't because the sound was not very clear.

It certainly like the Poirot we bought was a far cry from what was shown on PBS. The Rutherford version is much better, and follows the text more closely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series, but...","review":"The BBC's MISS MARPLE series is at last getting a DVD release, but A&E aren't giving it the launch that it deserves. The picture quality of these four discs vary greatly, and no clean-up work appears to have been done, (some sections of the films are full of dirt and specs). Although all the MISS MARPLE stories are available in both episodic and feature-length formats, only one of these adventures is as originally braodcast on the BBC, (THE MIRROR CRACK'D): the other three seem to have been compiled from their respective two-part versions - leading to new, video-generated captions for the story titles, (which rather ruin the effect of the wonderful opening sequence). Further more, 4.50 FROM PADDINGTON lacks about three minutes of footage, (nothing very important, but irritating).Surely A&E could spend just that little bit extra, get some new transfers from the BBC and release programmes properly???"},{"rating":"2","title":"As comfortable as a favourite sweater","review":"This Miss Marple series featuring Joan Hickson is consistently good.

This order came within the time frame mentioned with no problems with the package or the movies that I've watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth what I paid -","review":"Marple Classic Mysteries has provided many hours of comforting entertainment to me. It is a pleasant retreat from the politics, greed, violence and endless parade of scantily clad females; not to mention the incessant clubhouse trash spewing from the tube today. Even though someone dies in each episode it's okay. Ms Marple makes it okay. She is in charge with out being rude or nasty - she can put you in your place with a simple \\"look\\" - she's just cool. And its unpredictable. I love me a good Ms Marple! Especially when I've read all my books on hand and I must watch the tube. I would have rated this series 5 stars but the British are not always clear. I don't know if it is the editing or the script but something is not quite right in all things British that I see. Maybe it's me but I find myself hitting the rewind button and saying \\"what the?\\" a few times. Nonetheless - great buy. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transfer but for no subtitles","review":"I got the set from one of the resellers in good time and in the NEW quality as advertised. I just wish that somewhere in the reviews, someone would have mentioned that there are NO subtitles on the disks. Joan Hickson (Miss Marple) is one of my favorite actresses in this role, but she can be quite quiet and this makes it hard to hear what's she said, and this is irritating since it's usually one of the clues that is stumping Chief Inspector Slack.That's the only irritation I had with the set. All the episodes but for \\"At Bertram's Hotel\\" are fairly easy to view, but \\"Betram's Hotel\\" has a bit of color-change, something makes the images look tinged with sepia; the others are vivid and the image transfer is pretty good in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"a perfect Miss Marple","review":"Joan Hickson was a very fine Miss Marple, seemingly fragile, but possessed of a keen intelligence & great powers of observation! As with a number of older BBC productions, however, the audio was not always the best, making it difficult to hear & understand the dialog without having the volume turned way up. You would think this issue would be addressed by whoever puts out these programs on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan HIckson Miss Marple collections- NO CAPTIONS","review":"Marple: The Classic Mysteries Collection (Caribbean Mystery / 4:50 from Paddington / Moving Finger / Nemesis / At Bertram's Hotel / Murder at Vicarage / Sleeping Murder / They Do It with Mirrors / Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side)The Joan Hickson Miss Marple collections that I bought through Amazon are outstanding -- except for the lack of Closed Captions (for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired). I am disappointed by this arrogant lapse, no doubt to save the producers money. The aging population is growing, and I am one of many loathe to purchase any DVD without captions.

Written in the late 40's by a Chinese woman doctor, this is the home-style cooking of Anhui province (near Shanghai) adapted for the American home cook. Anhui food is considered \\"oily but generous in portions\\", and the protein-based nature of the recipes may seem a bit excessive for those who've gotten used to the spartan usages of contemporary America. Also Ms. Chao's puckishly imperfect English and frequent coinages sometimes get in the way -- I puzzled over the term \\"leaking ladle\\" until I found out it meant \\"slotted spoon\\", which is what I had been using.

For instance \\"Peck's bad boy\\", a movie I loved when I first saw it on TV years ago, has a soundtrack that doens't have a clear sound, which is the cause that some of the dialogue is impossible to understand. The last reel of the movie on this DVD is very bad, with pieces missing.Also the movie on the DVD is a 'blown up' version, probably to avoid showing the brand of a company that broadcasted this movie on TV.Alpha calls this DVD-release a 'special edition'.

However, in the second half of the book he suddenly becomes a selfish and jelous jerk. He dosn't even try to understand Megan's situation and behaves like a spoiled child. I think Megan should have dumped Justin and found a real man and one that wasn't twenty years older than her as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE A DARK, BROODING, DOMINANT HERO & A BODICE-RIPPER TOO !","review":"An alluring story of unbridled passion, young love, betrayal, a real page-turner & what a turn on ! The huge gap in age reminded me a bit of Jane Feather's characters. So what if Justin is cruel & heartless on the outside ? He's only embracing his belief that if he can't have Megan, no one can either. Just my kind of hero, a tortured soul, he put his heart up on his sleeves & came roaring back when he couldn't have her anymore. He did what his desperate mind told him to do, the only way to bind Megan to him is by kidnapping her. A rape is too harsh a description (Mrs. giggles' review) for Justin's lovemaking to the reluctant-but-as-much-in-love Megan. I just wish there were more authors as magnificent as Ms. Robards out there. Plenty of heart-pounding battles of will & toes-curling sex with an ending that'll leave U sniffling for a box of kleenex !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Original American Indie Greatness","review":"Would you believe I just asked my friend the other day if this would EVER get re-issued on cd??

I thought that the only thing American music was good for anymore was the Ramones, Social Distortion, DK, Metallica, rockabilly and hardcore. Well \\"Dinosaur,\\" as it was called at the time, opened my ears to a whole NEW U.S.A. scene that featured Husker Du & The Flaming Lips. Like I needed more bands to follow. Looking back, I think you would agree, it was all worth it.

This is very disappointing, since the original format chosen by Bob Fosse was film instead of videotape.

Don't even think twice about it, but get it as soon as you can and you will watch it over and over again. Think Ms. Minnelli's a joke, you won't after seeing this, trust me. Her dancing is SPECTACULAR, her singing is incredible and Fosse's choreography is spellbinding. In a word -- WOW!!! You'll NEVER think of Liza in the same way after seeing this wonderful gem.

I've had the soundtrack for years and have been waiting to see it for years. I have to say that the only thing I found dissapointing was the film quality. Don't kill me for saying this, but I almost wish it would have been shot on tape instead of film. It's a little to grainy. It looks like one of those 1970's documentary's. Anyways moving on to the performance...Wow! I knew I would be blown away by the performance, but I had no idea. I didn't want it to end.

Genuine talent is something to cherish and be inspired by, and Liza, Bob Fosse, Kander and Ebb, the dancers and everyone else involved in this remarkable collaborative effort deliver it in spades. In addition to the terrific singing and dancing, the camera work and editing provide a sense of immediacy from beginning to end. I particularly enjoyed the bonus feature of Liza's running commentary - it's unfailingly interesting, informative, and/or funny and adds richness and depth to the viewing experience. Having missed the show's original airing in 1972, I'm grateful for the chance to appreciate this uncommon level of artistry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!!!!!","review":"I didn't get to see the show when it originally aired, but I used to listen to the 8 Track all the time (I was ten) and just stare at the great graphic on the cover. My Mom and Dad took me to see her at the Greek not soon after and she was amazing. She even sent me an autographed Picture of her and her dogs (they autographed with a Paw print). I did catch the rerun on T.V. after that.I finally saw the show at the Museum of Television and Radio a few years ago and it was great.

This one does not fit that bill (hence the four-star rating). However, I do recommend seeing it because it is a very good one-viewing movie. Julia Roberts does a good job (although I do not like when she becomes like Meryl Streep). Denzel Washington does a superb job as a top-notch reporter (think \\"Deep Throat\\" from Watergate). The unseen villain is the kind of fear that many scary movies fail to deliver -- this one provides the suspense without giving in to flashy gimmicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray???

It captured the essence of the book without being too glosy (like a Time to Kill) or straying too far from the source material (like The Firm).Julia Roberts is terrific - so emotionally accessible and convincing as a brillant law student. Denzel Washington is solid - they have some nice chemistry. Also impressive is the supporting cast - I liked the score.Why does it get 4 stars? This DVD is one where you must flip over the disc to watch the last 50 minutes. This is a joke. Not only did this movie make nearly $200 million worldwide, but it got favorable reviews.Warner Bros. needs to re-release the picture just for the fact that I want to watch the movie without having to flip the disc over.

Just raving about her will never improve her acting skills (an oxymoron). Actually, the poor quality of this movie is astounding, considering its director, the cast (excepting our girl Julia) and the book upon which it was based. Though he's done some much better work, when Pakula threw this film together he was clearly thinking of only one thing: \\"Hmm, 'Presumed Innocent' was a winner. Let's follow that same formula and do another one. It'll sell.\\" Unfortunately, by the time the story from the book by John Grisham got to the screen, it lacked any of its original punch. As for Denzel, he should be ashamed of himself. He's about as enthusiastic in this as a turtle heading for the beach. I guess he probably needed the cash for another house. Then again, he's opposite Julia.

Unpleaseant viewing experience. Who ever heard of such a thing in 2011??? Total rip off.WHEN will they create a version of this movie that you don't have to turn over????

Now, if you go on, say, public record (or 60 Minutes) and tell everyone what you know - that is, reveal the secret - the bad guys don't have any reason to KILL YOU any more.

They play with more energy than the fine musicians of the Detroit Concert Band who sound a little bored on the complete Walking Frog set. They are a much finer ensemble, playing with greater precision and balance than Kieth Brion's British players on Naxos. The only weakness is in the documentation. There is none.

While a previous review printed here mentions queer \\"green tints\\" and audio problems, NOTHING of the sort was in evidence in the copy I viewed. Quite simply, a beautiful job was done in remastering the original video elements for this DVD presentation, and you're likely to see and hear many details that have previously gone unnoticed.

All the modes are great.However i am confused because the reason i bought it was because of this qoute as one of the features: \\"Create your own player and guide him through an elite NBA career - Train him, improve his skills, and outshine your competition to land endorsement deals and your own shoe contract \\"Which to me sounded like an awesome mode to play on. But when i bought the game i found the game mode nowhere. ????? AND THERE WAS NO 24/7 which really made me mad since i thought that was the best part of 2k6.

I really was looking forward to this movie. I thought an R rating would have been more appropriate. The PG-13 is misleading. This 2 hour movie felt like 5 hours. I was tempted to leave after the first 30-45 minutes, but I stayed just to see if it would get better. It didn't.There were moments that were entertaining - though not many. I wouldn't bother to see this movie again on regular TV. I think I will only wear my Seabiscuit ballcap around the ranch now, rather than have anyone think I would endorse this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORSEFEATHERS","review":"Big, bland, boring saga that manages to turn the excitement of thoroughbred racing into a dull pony ride. The characters are empty shells given sympathy from tragic pasts that are hammered home early in the film, and Seabisquit himself remains an anonymous animal whose only mannerisms and character are told to us through a voice over narration. Sudden artsy camera work, a purposeless, nearly silent female lead, and a constant attempt to insure the film doesn't veer into \\"Lassie Come Home\\" territory make for a sometimes visually beautiful but deadly dormant day at the track. \\"Seabisuit\\" gets scratched at the post."},{"rating":"1","title":"limp biscuit","review":"Animal abuse is the least of this movie's problems. It's slow, boring, and overrated. Basically, it's another silly movie with \\"Oscar bait\\" written on its face. There's no substance. Tobey Maguire was awesome in \\"Spiderman,\\" but he ain't working in this flick. Skip this self-important turkey and rent \\"Gigli\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal abuse was too disturbing to enjoy the film","review":"This film is full of animal abuse, and some of it even seemed to be encouraged by the writers. Breeding horses for the sole purpose of making money from racing them is just plain wrong. The acceptable practice of \\"putting down\\" or killing a horse after it is wounded is disgusting.The only reason why I gave this movie 2 stars is because the acting was pretty good and it portrayed the story fairly accurately, from a historical perspective. But if you have any love for animals at all, you will not find this film very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put away the jades, people","review":"There is a lot of unreedeming, worthless trash coming out of Hollywood these days. With that in mind, I recommend Seabiscuit as an antidote to said trash. Nowadays, anything with heart and a good message that doesn't shock, offend, or annoy should be encouraged, even though the negative comments about this film are mostly valid. Yes, it is confusing at the start as you wind up awash in characters, but it all settles down and gives you something to cheer about, which is what Seabiscuit evidently did for the Americans in the Depression. Yes, it is refrigerator magnet-like in its earnestness. Dont let that stop you from renting or buying this mostly wholesome, uplifting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. First of all, it was about a horse. Secondly, it was done well. I read the book before I saw the movie too, so that sort of ruined it a little, but I don't care. If you love horses, even if you don't like horse racing, go see it. I cried at the end and I'm not ashamed. So, if you go see it and you cry, don't worry about it. It does you some good. Sorry, I couldn't write anything about what it's like. Go see it to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GEM WORTH OWNING.","review":"The movie seems to have its share of nay-sayers (no pun intended) and yes, there here may have been a few liberties with the facts from the book but nothing is sacrificed for Hollywoodesque drama: this is a fascinating rendition of a gripping book.Wrongful expectations are placed on stunning movies like this by the overworked hoopla machine. Oprah for instance praised it because of how it \\"reinforces the American national pride.\\" Hmm.My suggestion: see the movie for what it is. Tobey Maguire truly shines in this film. The real star is not even a human being. The story (and it's a true one!) is uplifting without getting preachy. It's about achievement in the time of adversity. Funny and sad at the same time. The racing sequences are brilliant. The movie ends where it ought to end, leaving the viewer with a sense of departing nostalgia.Every proud movie buff needs to add this gem to his collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"It coulda been a contender.","review":"I think a lot of people--grown-up people, anyway--really want to like this film for what it aspires to be. And it's a movie that had a lot of potential--good actors, good characters, good concept, good sets, good cinematography, and a not too bad horse. There's lots of really good stuff. But having a lot of really good stuff doesn't necessarily make a really good movie, and Seabiscuit is Exhibit A.A lot of people have commended this movie for its unhurried leisurely pace. I say nonsense. This movie is just plain slow, and it's slow because someone wasn't willing to make the cuts necessary to tighten it up. Good story telling requires discipline, and that's where this film falls short. What's left is a potentially great film that falters at the gate. Definitely one to rent first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Movie","review":"My eight year old loves horses, and I had originally rented this movie for her.

Then, when I finally watched it, I found that it was a little bit dragged out and wasn't really focused pn the horse, but more of the jokey and it's owner's lives. It was still a good movie, just not as good as they are advertising it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Movies I've Ever Seen","review":"I love movies. I love great stories.

Thanks to each other, however, they overcome life's difficulties and prevail. The movie is set during the Great Depression of the 1930's and it is about pain and suffering, hope and second chances, but most importantly about how courage, trust, and inner strength, can lead out of situations, which might seem bleak or desperate at first glance. A great movie indeed, full of symbolism, which will surely bring tears to one's eyes! Needless to say, Tobey Maguire, Jeff Bridges and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabuscuit","review":"A good story about three men and a horse, who all change eachother's lives. Based on a true story, that I knew nothing about before watching the movie, it is set in the early 1900's.The movie does a good job of making you sympathise with all of the characters, including the horse. The dialogue and acting are both superb.The only drawback to this movie, is is predictability. Everything here has been done before in several other movies, but Seabiscuit still does it well.An overall inspiring, and moving story, that kept me interested from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Film","review":"I totally enjoyed this movie.

I wouldn't take anyone below 10 to see it, but it is a wonderful and deep movie. Chris Cooper is one of my favorite actors, and his role in Seabiscuit suited him perfectly. Tobey Maquire also impressed me. I think that they could have left out the cursing, and the brief sensuality, but it is still a great movie. I have seen it twice now, and I would go 10 more times.

I hope that does not mean I'm depressed...Seabiscuit's story is used as a metaphor for everything great about our country in that era. It is a good story, and told in a fun and engaging way.I would have given the film the 5 stars it really deserves if only the producers had been more attentive to period detail.The narrative has to hop around in time a little bit, which does the movie good service. However, it's disconcerting to look at 1939 cars in scenes title as 1931. This type of glitch took away just enough of my vast enjoyment of the film.Much to admire in the cinematography, too, although the close shots of the jockeys bobbing up and down are not very convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seabiscuit DVD","review":"I didn't hate it--I couldn't even view it---my DVD machine kept saying \\"no DVD disc--cannot be viewed\\"--so all it was worth was a waste of money and an item for the garbage.It would have cost me more to return it than it was worth.

This story of an owner and down-and-out trainer and jockey who made the impossible possible and defeated even a Triple Crown winner is all the more heartwarming because it's true. Tobey Maguire shows just how underrated he is as an actor as legendary jockey Red, and casting real champion Gary Stevens as George Wolfe adds realism to racing scenes perfectly choreographed and coordinated by Chris McCarron. Although there's some cursing, drinking and a lot of brawling, I still recommend this as a great family film. Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Sort of Grew On Me","review":"I don't like \\"feel good\\" movies. I don't like horses. I'd heard this was a good film, but was uninterested. I wouldn't have watched it, had it not been for my wife, who does like \\"feel good\\" movies.So, like a good husband, I popped the DVD into the machine and then started playing with my palm pilot while the film booted up . . .By the end of the film I was sitting on the edge of my seat and involved with the story line. The film actually touched me emotionally. Granted, the next time through won't have the same effect because I know what is going to happen. Still, I am impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slow Start - A Great Finish","review":"This movie has a very slow start for the first one hour, but you want to stay with it as it has a superb finish. It is the story of four unlikely heros who during the 1920s and 1930s defied the odds to rise to the top of horse racing. The horse owner, the horse trainer, the jockey and Seabiscuit present a heartwarming true story, against long odds but filled with courage, loyalty and great effort, as they achieve greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"This was a decent movie. Somewhat predictable, but enjoyable. Take \\"Chariots of Fire\\" and mix in a little \\"Black Beauty\\" and you get the drift. The acting is good, but not remarkable. The sound is good, as is the editing. A good \\"little engine that could\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit on HD-DVD is now the best movie I've ever seen","review":"I saw the last half hour of Seabiscuit on television - enough to know I had to buy the DVD, which I loved. Recently I bought a new condition Toshiba HD-DVD player, as much for it's value in upscaling DVD's as for playing some of my brother's HD-DVD's. I then decided to import ten of my favourite films on HD-DVD from Amazon - most were at ridiculously low prices. \\"Seabiscuit\\" is simply magnificent in HD-DVD. There's absolutely everything to like about this film, and with each viewing I am more impressed. In fact I can't think of any reason to rate any of the thousands of films which I like and respect higher than Seabiscuit.Tobey Maguire's flawless acting is probably one of the main keys to its success - and as one of the executive producers he deserves to be exceedingly proud.HD-DVD's slogan \\"the look and sound of perfect\\" is proven true in this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"airbiscuit","review":"At best, Seabiscuit is a mediocre movie. It's really baffling that it could receive a best picture nomination during such a good movie year. Even Cold Mountain, which teetered towards being too typically \\"Hollywood\\" seemed a better choice. And, I really had expected this to be a good movie. It's based on a good story and has an outstanding cast, and horse films usually allow for some powerful effects (think of The Black Stallion). The third person narration was just a signal of an uninteresting directing style and emotional spoon-feeding. 5/10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horsefeathers","review":"Biopics are hard to do when they're about people, let alone animals. Arguably, this pic was about people too; however, the star of the show was a four-footer and his race---and, sadly, the production left me wanting to drown my disappointment in a feedbag of fermented oats. I had really been looking forward to this film, so it was a double-downer. The close-ups of the horses were kind of thrilling, the stories of the people were not. The use of bogus news reels was annoying and cheesy and, while I'm a Randy Newman fan, I found his score cloying. The best of the three leads was Tobey McGuire; Chris Cooper and Jeff Bridges both looked befuddled and misdirected. Surprisingly, my favorite performer had only about 5 minutes of screen time: William H. Macy as a hyper-enthusiastic announcer---he nailed the 'tude and tone of sportscasters of yore. I think Seabiscuit could have been a good documentary or a good movie, but not both at the same time. Two thumbs down, both mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Admiral A Monster Horse? Puh-lease!","review":"Everyone else has pretty much said it all about this movie. As a young child I read all I could about horses, especially race horses. Without going into great detail, I would like to point out that there are several historical \\"inaccuracies\\" portrayed in the movie \\"Seabiscuit\\". Most can be easily explained as to why they are left out or have been changed, however ONE really, really, REALLY bugs me:War Admiral was only 15.3 hands high! Only 3\\" taller than Seabiscuit. That's it. They were BOTH small horses.While I can understand that the \\"big little horse\\" theme pretty much ran the whole movie, in reality it just doesn't wash. Surely they could have found something else to hang everything on rather than change an important historical fact -- such as the size of the rival horse? Sheesh :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seabiscuit --HD DVD","review":"Although we have an HD Sony LCD 46\\" TV and Sony BluRay DVD player, the HD DVD will not work on our system.

When I finally got around to watching it, it did not work in any DVD I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting or acurate","review":"Toby McGuire was not impressive in this movie. As far as I can remember, the acting was okay, but Toby just doesn't fit the charector of a jockey.I am a huge lover of horses and at first couldn't wait to see it, but when I did I was dissapointed. Not only was it relatively dull and boring, but my cousin and I started laughing out loud when we saw two horses being put in a stall together. Anyone who knows horses would know this is absolutely disasterous. This just goes to show that the movie was innacurate and made by someone who doesn't know equines.There is nothing outstanding about this movie, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly in the winner's circle","review":"What an absolute gem of a picture. Everything -- the writing, directing, acting, cinematography, everything -- was nearly perfect.To take a fairly old and mundane subject (come on now, it was a racing horse, after all, not a world-shaking topic or event) and turn it into a movie that reflects the history and spirit of this country, and the class rivalry at the time, was an accomplishment in itself.By making the film almost a documentary in parts was inspired. And it's amazing how the film develops character with just a few quick scenes, yet the characters never lapse into cliche or stereotypes. I liked them all (and that's important to me ... why spend 2 hours with people you don't like?)It may not be the perfect movie (which is?) ... but it is truly one of the best to come out in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a movie, but that's not the worst of it","review":"I hope this doesn't signal Jeff Bridge's ride into the sunset. There is surprisingly little dialog in this movie - mostly just history-channel style narration between TV-commercial quality moments of action. The cinematogrophy is excellent on the track, it's way too artifical off it. Better rented than owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!!!","review":"This was a great movie. I really enjoyed Tobey McGuire in it. I love horses and this was very enjoyable to watch. It also had a great meaning behind it...buy it today!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Family Tradition","review":"This movie truly touched my heart. If you are a horse lover, you'll adore this movie. If you are not a horse lover, you'll adore this movie. I was skeptical at first because I know nothing of horses or racing, but I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to follow the story and to truly feel through the superb acting and storyline. This movie inspired me to read the book from which it was based from! I highly highly recommend this picture to anyone who enjoys movies on the same level as Forest Gump or Chariots of Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was a pile of horse...","review":"This was one of the worst movies that I have ever had to suffer through. All of the performances were over done, (with the exception of Chris Cooper, who is always top notch) and the entire movie was cheesier than consession stand nachos. I am completely confused at all of the accolades that this movie has received. The true story had much more depth; they barely touched on the horse trainers alcohol problem, nor the battle with eating disorders/substance abuse that Tobey Maguire's character went through. The glossed-over finished product struggled so hard to be \\"heart-warming\\" in every scene that the potentially touching story lost all validity. Basically, it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"put this dvd in 3 different machines and did not work in any of them. Said that it did not recognize disc. will cost more to return than I paid for it so I guess I'll look elsewhere for dvds now."},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD Would Make a Great Coaster","review":"Using your copy of \\"Seabiscuit\\" to set drinks on would be a more interesting use for it than actually playing the boring thing. Oh, what a safe, boring, dull movie this is. Gary Ross obviously went to the Ron Howard school of directing, where points are pounded home with a hammer and anvil and manipulated emotions are manufactured with assembly-line rapidity. This is the kind of movie where everyone delivers lines that sound like they should be on self-help bumper stickers; homilies are handed out like parking tickets. And the movie doesn't end until each character gets to deliver at least one clunker, and most of them get to deliver many more.\\"Seabiscuit\\" isn't even really a bad movie--it's an uninteresting movie, which is much worse. Even bad movies can be fascinating, but the filmmakers here aim so low at trying to please the lowest common denominator of viewer that they've put together a batch of pandering mush that has not one genuine emotion in it.Yuck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated.","review":"I'll break it down for ya. The first hour of this movie is disjointed, tedious, and dull. The second half is basically a tired \\"underdog wins against all odds\\" type of story.

I mean, i don't liek horses but i'm not sadistic enough to torture them by riding on their backs. These s0-called people to \\"love\\" horses and ride them are insane.the only reason why i dont liek horses is because of a bad experience in which someone could have helped me or a horse, and the person helped the horse, leaving me out in the cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal's Seabiscuit Could Have Been Better","review":"Seabiscuit is yet another example of how Hollywood (in this case, Universal Studios) takes a nice story, having the potential to be a really nice \\"family\\" film, and turns it into an adult feature. I lost count of the number of irritatingly-blasphemous foul words used! As it usually goes with most movies, these words did absolutely nothing to enhance dialog at all. Discerning parents will probably want to keep their children away from this one.The DVD's packaging was another sore spot. Instead of getting the usual chapter insert and liner notes with the disk, Universal Studios decided that the purchaser would rather own a \\"barker\\" sheet for Buick! Yes, even you could win a new Buick Rainier! How poor is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total bore","review":"I thought this film was cheesy. The storyline was choppy in the beginning-and it was very predictable. I think if you like horses, by all means rent it.I just could not get into it.

Even when they nominate terrible movies (like English Patient), they are at least oscar material.But nominate such a run-of-the-mill, unoriginal, and only mildely entertaining movie?The movie was ok, Jeff Bridges was very good. Maguire was like he usualy is, and Chris Cooper is nothing amazing. I can't believe Williams H. Macy was even in the running in the globes for such a jokey role, which requires no actign at all. And he wasn't even nominated for The cooler, his best performance ever.And why the hell is Steven Soderberg doing commentary on this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seabiscuit","review":"The Movie is off quite a lot. first, war admril is not that tall only about four inches tall than seabiscuit. second, Seabiscuit's jockey was smaller and war admirls was bigger. third seabiscuit is not a great race horse, he only one 3 races war admirl was undefeted otherwise then when him and Seabiscuit raced. this movie is not very accurete. There is more about the people than the horses in this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good concept poorly executed","review":"I really wanted to like Seabiscuit, but simply couldn't. It has a phenomenal cast including Tobey McGuire and William H. Macy among others. The actors couldn't compensate for a disjointed script that tries to tell the story of too many individuals too quickly. For comparison, Apollo 13 (another historical drama), really tells the story from the Lovell family point of view with the rest of the subplots supporting that viewpoint. Seabiscuit tries to tell the owner's story, the jockey's story, and the horse's story without every drawing the viewer into any one of those stories. I never got to the point where I cared about any of these characters. And, the rivalry story line just left me flat; I didn't care whether Seabiscuit won. This movie could have used its fine cast much more effectively"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit: A lesson in Faith","review":"Against all odds Seabiscuit changes from a problem horse to win races and turns into a wonderful race horse. He did that by the love of the people around him, their knowledge of horses and Faith. They discover the horse's potential and went all the way. Only because they believed. What a lesson in faith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good but not sappy","review":"Too many short scenes early on, cutting to things that don't really make sense (bull fight, boxing, dismantling car, riding train) and have no dialogue. The Depression era newsreel updates and voiceovers were annoying, but overall it worked as a parable for Depression era, up-by-your-bootstraps hope, w/o sinking into total sentimentality - not everything works out as it would if the whole thing were scripted and Disney-esque, which I appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seabiscuit is a well made movie and arrived intact","review":"I recorded the older version of Seabiscuit when it was shown on TV a while back. The end of it was cut off and I never saw how it ended. I could not find the older version to rent - so I was glad to find this newer one with good actors and at a good price. It arrived in good condition but I haven't watched it yet so I am not giving it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ride!","review":"Seabiscuit does not disappoint. It is much more than just a story about horse racing. Seabiscuit explores a full range of human (and animal) conflicts, dreams, loss, hope and victory. The characters all experience trials and restoration. Some of the acting and set that is era-related seems staged and too made up, but the story and the main characters carry the day.I was moved emotionally by the triumph of the horse, the jockey, the trainer and the owner. This is definitely a feel-good movie, because it gives you every reason to feel good about the events in it, plus since it is based on a true story, it is totally realistic and believable--nothing in it is too good to be true--it is good and true.I think you will really enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 97 subaru impreza","review":"I bought this hitch following the CURT website and Amazon.com fit specifications. It is supposed to fit my car, IT DOES NOT FIT, the exhaust cut out does not leave room for the exhaust and the drivers side mount holes are off by an inch.I called CURT and the man on the phone basically told me I was wrong or that I had some sort of anomaly of a Subaru that had different mounting holes. He said they are all fit tested on every car, well if they fit tested this on a 97 Impreza they would know that not only are the mounting holes spaced improperly but the exhaust does not fit up into the space provided, a poor design coupled with sub par customer service equals a company to be avoided.

The dubbing is atrocious, the violence over-the-top, and the full frontal nudity extreme -- there is a LOT of male frontal nudity in this film; so much so that I suspect that either the writer or director was...well, INTO male full frontal nudity.When watching this, notice how the gang members NEVER damage the hero's (?) car -- it probably wasn't in the budget.

I was disappointed and cannot recommend it. The two main characters did not hold my interest. Nicole and Derek were attracted to each other. Each time they were together and their relationship started to grow to the next level, she would run off and hide. He was miserable and failed to find her each time except at the end. This separation cycling annoyed me. Also, there were some conflicts caused by lack of direct communication between them. One would say something and the other thought it meant something different. I don't like novels using this form of conflict development. Sexual content: strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Captain of All Pleasures","review":"This is equal to any romance novel I have ever read.

And while it seems out of the ordinary for Nicole to be a sea-woman the portrayal of her in such a roll was well done.Derek's lack luster attitude before meeting Nicole is eventually explained and actually makes sense. You actually feel bad for him because of the series of circumstances that led to where you was when Nicole ran into him.Nicole is a surprise at every step with her knowledge of the sea and her friendships among those not considered suitable for a young lady. She's a strong-willed woman who goes after what she wants.My only real complaint is that for honorable men, Cole's heroes tend to make dishonorable decisions even if they change their mind after the fact. Still Cole's writing really grabs you and keeps you interested the entire way through the story. Well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain of all Pleasures","review":"Very steamy!

Style of the LOX song is hot, The lox song is classic lox s@#t. Jadakiss gives us a shot of how his solo will be. THE best songs on the album is TWista and Drag-on , they spit real good over SWiss beats and WWIII has a banging beat. the interludes are funny like I'm a H-O-E.

For such Ruff Ryders as Eve and DMX only appear once on the album. This is as many times as other non-Ruff Ryders apear on the album. The Lox and Yung Wun are found most on the album, and niether of their styles really floats my boat. Yung Wuns shout out's get annoying at times. But all in all, the album is solidly put together. All beats on the album are put together tight, and no sub-par lyrical performances are given.

How many more beats where the strings in the back move with the same tone and melody in the chorus will we listen too? How many push-button scratches will it take for him to move to a new technique? The one thing that Swizz, who supplied the beats for the second ruff ryders compilation, usually has going for him is the MC's he works with. Most often he teams with heavy hitters Jay-Z or DMX. Not this time. His lukewarm drums and tired strings and scratches aren't masked by lyrical prowess, exposing Swizz as what he is, tragically pop, while screaming \\"ryde or die.\\" It's a shame that this CD couldn't be better, as the Ruff Ryders have so much talent in Eve, Drag-On, DMX, and Sheik of the Lox. Alas, when the dust settles, Ruff Ryders Vol. 2 falls short of it's predecessor, and thus, as a project on the whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately better than the last one, but still lacking","review":"This cd is not too bad. It gets off to a good start with World War 3, a song featuring snoop dogg, scarface, yung wun, and jadakiss who all give a good performance. This song is easily the best on the cd. The next song, 2 tears in a bucket is pretty good as well as got it all is not too bad. The next song that caught my attention was Twisted heat with drag-on and twista which is pretty strong (and fast). All of the tracks are pretty smooth. This cd only falters in one place. The places i thought the cd would be the strongest are really not very good songs. Fright night with busta and stomp are not very good songs. Not counting the bonus track, these are the worst songs.

However, I believe that the first album was by far superior. I say this as an avid listener of the whole RR crew, especially the originals like LOX, Drag-on, and Dark Man X (DMX). Expect less chant tracks (Down Bottom) and more hardcore rap styles like the \\"GO HEAD.\\" The song \\"The Great\\" is truly an atrocity to DMX, a man that has sowed the very seeds of RR with the RR Anthem. I recommend checking out something with more power rhymes, such as We Are the Streets by the LOX, three of the original Ruff Ryders. Despite my downcast attitude toward the inferior RR vol. 2, I believe hardcore rap fans will appreciate the addition of Yung Wun and solo joints by Jadakiss. All in all, blood in and blood out, this album is the hottest collaboration to hit the streets since the first volume of the Ruff Ryders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its OK...","review":"Its not better than the first...WW 3 is the best song on the whole thing.

This book, like some others in the series, can be either read aloud or sung, and there's a finger play for this one too (unfortunately hard to do while you hold a book, but oh well). In Christelow's version, instead of having the alligator actually eat the monkeys, they leap into the tree branches, to be revealed in the end for a happy picnic.The funny characters are lively and lovable, and the predictable plot is a perfect choice for the preschooler who isn't quite ready for complicated stories. Of course, the behavior of the monkeys is dangerous, but even the smallest children ought to know better than to copy the monkeys' actions -- if anything, it serves as a rather funny cautionary tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Read!","review":"Planets & peoples have been ravaged by environmental collapses & mutating diseases of the Diversity Crisis.

Chena & Teal cannot escape from their perfect paradise, so how will they survive?Sarah Zettel's gripping narrative is rare & I could not put Kingdom of Cages down - I found myself reading far into the night.Go buy this book because if you truly love SciFi - you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A comparative waste of time","review":"Readable adolescent sci-fi from an author who has done much better work. There are good ideas here and some likeable characters, but most of the good stuff is is insufficiently developed and subordinated to the rather psychotic, stunted viewpoints of a couple of main characters. We sort-of care about the characters - but not as much as we could. Meanwhile, the conflicts seem increasingly shallow as we learn more about them. Many events seem unnecessarily contrived, and the final resolution is unsatisfactory.If I sound disgruntled, it's because I really like this author and felt let down by Kingdom. This novel doesn't measure up to her earlier rough-but-thought-provoking Reclamation, her excellent Fool's War and Playing God, or (my favorite) Quiet Invasion.

That is a bit amusing, because after first listening to it... I didn't really like it.But this is true with many SY albums. After listening to them several times, you know what to expect, and you can start really listening (and enjoying) each song. In that sense, their music tends to grow on you. And, each time you listen (for me several hundred times over the years) you enjoy it.When it comes to music, this lasting quality is unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Moon Rising","review":"This album is the best that Sonic Youth ever put out. This is the fullest expression of what this band was trying to achieve with its experimental sound. Guitars drift in and out, bass lines drive pounding rhythmically, the vocals carry both a sense of yearning and disillusionment. If you listen between songs you can hear distorted cut-up samples from the Stooges first album- Intentional or not this gives a nod to the forerunners of anti-anthem garage music, who I am sure gave much inspiration to this band. If you like the poppy 90's Sonic Youth (Goo-Dirty), then this album is probably not for you, but if you like the earlier sound- the dark experimental sound, then yes you should get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ FOR COOPERMAN FANS","review":"if you like Howard Engel and Benny, this is a must read!I had no idea what had happened medically to Howard - so don't read the afterword by Oliver Sacks til AFTER.

Fun is not forgotten, either. In fact, it's a priority, along with mastering the basics. A very effective collaboration between the two authors: coach and writer, husband and wife, parents of a basketball player.

T.E. Lawrence had the sort of unhappy childhood (bastard, public school) that seems attractive if you're not personally part of it, and Languages at Oxford, among which a noted translation of Homer, and Arabic, which got him into interesting times in Ottoman Palestine. Lawrence saw no reason not to fight and kill in a field belonging to Arabs, and he brought strategy and resource to the Arab liberation, and suffering and glory to himself. He helped bring the Arabs their freedom, aided the British cause, hurt the Turks and their allies the Germans, all in the desert, among the ferocious tribes. Bully.

Not to put too fine a point on it, this movie stinks. Deeply disturbing, overblown to the point of self-parody this movie virtually endorses the sick rantings of extreme racists and homophobes. There is no sign of condemnation of their activities, this movie shows a happy community oblivious to society's disapproval. The fact that one of the lead actors committed suicide one month after the movie's release in Australia probably says it all. Russell Crowe is still trying to live this down. A year after RS (oh, how appropriate!) came out he played an openly gay man in The Sum of Us and went on TV in Australia to try and soften his image.

Romper Stomper is not about Skinheads. It's about philosophy. Sure, it's packed with violence and racial demoralization. But so was The Killing Fields and that really happened. After viewing this film several times, I always had the same conclusion. It's about philosophy. Hando (Russell Crowe) wanted to live in the past by adhering to the Nazi mantra of the Master race. Davey (Daniel Pollock) had a dream. One with a very different future. A future of hope, happiness and unrealized ambitions that were cultivated by the inception of Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie). Her presence created a conflicting wedge that helped divide Hando and Davey. It's this conflict which fuels the film to it's climactic ending. Brilliant screenplay, casting, cinematography, editing and music score. A totally underrated film. A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed and edgy","review":"Although many people freak out and think this is a very racist movie, I view it from another perspective. Although not all skinheads are of the racist form (just because you don't have hair doesn't make you a Nazi) these guys are and does not show them in a positive light at all.

This is by far one of Russell Crowe's best films and is a very good showcase of hate,friendship,and betrayel. This film is only for adults the DVD is the unrated version and has extremely graphic sex scenes and Brutal violence. The film was first rated NC-17 and than they change it to unrated with a adults only simble on the add. This film is one of the best films of the 90'es and is a great adults only film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for Thought","review":"Romper Stomper is a dangerous film. Dangerous, because it requires its viewer to think.You can watch the film, about a group of nazi skinheads and their ventures, and treat it like any other action film: Enjoy the action scenes, and sympathize with the leading characters. However, if you start thinking about what you're looking at, you'll find that you're watching a film about the illnesses of society, and what happens when these illnesses are taken to their extreme. The director leaves nothing but hidden hints to guide the viewer, and unlike the common American film (American History X is the obvious example), leaves the entire burden of interpretation on the viewer.Which is pretty much why I think Romper Stomper is a brilliant film.The DVD's technical qualities are far from top notch, leaving an overall \\"manufactured\\" feeling. I suspect, though, that this is the director's original intention."},{"rating":"2","title":"be careful which version you buy","review":"This is an amazing movie of course, a must-see for any Russell Crowe fan, or anyone who loves independent film (the studio is listed as 20th Century Fox only because they bought the rights to it after the fact). You must be VERY careful however not to get the censored version- most of the earlier versions, usually listed as \\"Unrated\\" are the full movie. The 2002 re-release (with the chain link on the cover) and any version you buy at Wal-Mart (the protector of the almighty family values) will have the nudity and sexual content cut/altered.

The piece is tough to describe; it flows definitely, tells a story (about something ?), and can put a smile on your face for sure.

The album consists of a good mix of sounds-I wish there were more than five songs. The music was original and the words had great meaning.

This boning knife is one model where better steel makes a real difference. It will take a razor sharp edge that holds up quite well, even when you scrape bone. If there is a complaint, it would be that the handle is a bit on the small side for a male chef's hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent buy","review":"The Mundial Boning Knife is extremely sharp, holds its edge, and holds its own with knives twice the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful resource for all kinds of relationships","review":"The strength of this book is its clear, concise treatment of all aspects of family relationships. It is inspirational at the same time it impresses that everyone has responsibilities and commitments. It helps men and women understand one another better, and how to relate with and raise their children. Even very tough problems are dealt with honestly and openly - and in a way that helps the reader solve them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An English gentleman's vivid account of flying over North Africa","review":"I read this in 1999, when Prof. Morley-Mower visited our WWII history class and spoke about his \\"misadventures\\" as he called them. After hearing just a few tales, I hurried to the bookstore to pick up this colorful memoir. He was not a fighter pilot, but he did fly some very dangerous recon missions over North Africa, particularly with the Aussies. I can tell you that he is every bit the English gentleman, and his trademark wit comes through in every chapter, but there are two anecdotes in particular that are some of my favorite WWII stories--one of which was published in WWII magazine. It's not the most exciting WWII book I've read, but I don't think you'll find a better book about the desert air war. If you like WWII pilot memoirs, this will be an excellent and unique addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Very interesting book about the unsung PR pilots of the North African campaign. Very well written, i would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great Christmas CD","review":"I listened to this recording and thought it sounded great. Some of my favorite songs on it are- Mary Did You Know?, Lord of the Manger, and Silent Night. I think it is the best selection of not only songs, but also instruments. If you buy it make sure to look at the pretty girl on the back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The true picture of Sandy Irvine","review":"Sandy Irvine has always been portrayed as Mallory's shadow, the bit player who followed the great man without question. If you read this book you will no longer be asking yourself 'Why Sandy Irvine?'. The answer is self explanatory. This man had personality, a history, humour and ambition. For the brief time he was on the expedition to the mountain, Everest was his peak as much as it ever was Mallory's. But there is more to Irvine than one might previously have thought: he was not only a great oarsman, rowing in the Oxford winning boat of 1923, and an intrepid explorer of the arctic, but he was also the passionate lover of his best friend's stepmother. Julie Summers pulls no punches, she does not allow her family allegiance to cloud her own vision and excellent research. Read this book to find out about the other half of the greatest mountaineering partnership of all time. I guarantee you will smile, more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I'm afraid I have to disagree with other reviewers of this book. The writing is often awkward and grammatically challenged (to use a current euphemism). And Sandy Irvine comes across as a rather ordinary young man, self centered, good at sports, and good with his hands, but lacking in any sort of intellectual sophistication. It was this very sophisitcation and intellectualism that made Mallory the interesting figure he remains. Had Mallory been a mere hearty, he would have far less interesting. In contrast to Mallory, Irvine strikes one as eactly what this biography tries to convince one he was not, i.e., a follower who had little idea of what Mallory was leading him into.Because of Irvine's commoness and the bad writing (Where oh where was an editor!?), this is hardly worth the time, and certainly not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's something missing!","review":"I'm afraid this collection lacks one of the best songs this group has ever made, \\"Different Seasons\\".

I was also please that it can with the head band as well.

The Doc costume was quality fabric with pockets and lots of accoutrements. This pirate costume looked like it might be nice, but up close it's a super cheap and cheesy costume. The shirt and belt is all just printed on the front on thin material.

No songs about squirrels or trucking here, mainly classic rock influences thrown into a blender. The childlike screaming that opens \\"Jordan, Minnesota\\" is highly reminiscant of early electro-street gang Suicide, as are the cheapo drum machine effects. \\"Kerosene\\" starts with the most frightening into ever, painting a picture of elves running round a forest on fire. \\"Bad houses\\" sounds like something from the Cure's Pornography, except without the self-pity. The whole Atomizer side is pretty strong, as are the two Heartbeat songs, Wire covers. The other songs are slightly weaker, \\" I can't beleive\\", obviously a intro sounds like the first thirty seconds of the Fall's \\"2 by 4\\" repeated three times. The other songs are okayish, but not Kerosene. The anger obviously isn't false, but exagerrated, the targets are picked for steady offence, taking and arguing outsider viewpoints for self-gratification, which is a rather good thing.Buy, Buy, Buy and tell your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...","review":"Another case of nothing really better around so it must have been GREAT, right? Albini as a writer was kind of cool, but Big Gack was always a little skimpy sounding and certainly robotic in a NOT GOOD way. Sounds like Metal Urbain from 5 - 10 years earlier, but that stuff had way more punch, fuzz and grit (besides catchier songs) and those guys were FRENCH for chrissakes!!! This stuff sounds sort of weak now and not sure Albini really \\"meant\\" any of this - just needed something to do and being in a band was \\"cool\\", so there you have it. Having said that, the \\"Bulldozer\\" stuff is OK on it's own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I can't really explain what an influence and impact that Steve Albini and Big Black have had on me. All of the Big Black albums are masterworks of whirlwind guitars being fed through a woodchipper, shredding the strings, a pounding, unrelentless drum machine, and a bass tying it all together in perfect harmony, so to speak. I understand how they have influenced so many underground bands today, and even some mainstream bands like Bush and Nirvana, who both roped in Albini as producer, oops! recorder of their In Utero and Razorblade Suitcase albums, respectably. Buy the Big Black library now, because it may change your life, and put you in a different, but better, path musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily J.Y's weakest material, a few decent songs is all is here","review":"the subject line pretty much says it all. Sounds like J.Y. was just goofing around. There are a couple decent songs for that point in time, but nothing that stands the test of time. J.Y. was certainly Styx's best guitarist and he had some great songs singing lead with them too (ie: Midnight Ride, Snowblind, Eddie, Half-Penny Two Penny, Double Life, Miss America etc, not to mention singing most of the bext songs on Styx' 1st four albums when he sang 50/50 with Dennis), but for solo stuff stick with Into the Fire & City of Holy Faith from his Raised By Wolves cd and also Still Feel Your Love from his City Slicker cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry fans not his best but ok!","review":"If this were his first solo release i'd say it was just ok but this being his second and City Slicker being soo much better and especially with the Styx harmony vocals prevailent throughout that, i'd say don't start with this release and was highly disappointed after many listens.JY never was more than a fine guitar player in Styx and the tunes he did vocal on were ok tunes at best so don't hate the writer but City Slicker is the solo release to have by JY.On a side note: Go see the Dennis DeYoung-less version of Styx for it's awesome live show...They definately rock harder than when Dennis was with them. His replacement is ok and sounds similiar but Dennis is still the best.And of course Tommy Shaw is pretty darn good these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the \\"science advisor\\" for this movie?","review":"I have little to add to the comments of other reviewers concerning characterization, intraction between them, and so on. But I had an extremely hard time getting past the movie being wrong about just about every scientific premise. For one thing, the earth's magnetic field is constantly going through a cycle of gradually increaing to a maximum value, declines (gradually) until it reaches zero, increases (gradually and with opposite polarity) then starts decreasing again. We are now in a \\"decreasing\\" mode.It is true that cosmic rays will not be deflected by a weakened EM field but it will be nothing like a blowtorch hitting a peach (as described in the movie.) There might be more cancers and mutations over a period of centuries but absolutely nothing like what was shown in this movie.My advice: love or hate the movie to your heart's content but PLEASE do not base any scientific knowledge from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper, with More Impact","review":"This movie was excellent. I had avoided it because I thought it was as the critics said. I should have known. The cast was great and worked together well.

It is, however, a great moderate-to-bad bad movie selection and one that manages to be reasonably entertaining. It's not Apollo 13 or Independence Day; it's more like 2012 or The Day After Tomorrow.

A lot of elements have changed, but it's the same plot we saw in Bay/Bruckheimer's Armageddon in 98. While Armageddon upset a lot of critics, The Core is much worse. Even if you forgive the unrealistic nature of the plot, the problem is with the script, horrible dialog, under developed characters (including the leads), the savior of it all is a hacker that has no reason to be attached to the core team, yet he decides to help them as opposed doing what everyone else is telling him, also he seems to understand knowledge of all kinds of topics outside of computer science (magnetic fields, ozone, etc...). Regardless of how thick the blinders are, this movie is just horrible. It feels like a cheap Armageddon. Everyone involved in the production (save the actors) should never be allowed to work in Hollywood again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Science but Good Movie","review":"If you can tolerate the \\"science\\" of Star Trek, then you can tolerate that of The Core.I enjoyed the idea of journeying to the Core.

Let me count the ways. No, wait. I cannot count that high. But let me try anyway. This movie is so dumb I almost stopped watching it (more than once). This movie is so dumb I regretted spending nearly 4 dollars to rent it. This movie is so dumb the dialog reads like it was written in a high school drama class. This movie is so dumb the acting appears to be taken from a Saturday afternoon 1950s Sci-Fi movie convention. I could go on and on. But won't. Simply avoid this movie like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented Actors in Lackluster Film","review":"I'm still wondering how so many talented actors got suckered into doing such a turkey of a movie.

I can't recall when I have seen such poor acting. The dialogue is so silly at times you begin to think you are watching a poorly written comedy.There is not one small tiny portion of the movie where you actually care what happens to the earth, the characters, or the core. I was hoping that everything, the core included, would just blow up and let the movie out of it's misery!If you have seen the previews, you have seen the \\"best\\" part so don't waste your money. Don't even buy the DVD. CORE has to be the worst movie of the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plan 9 move over","review":"Is it possible to give zero stars? This is my candidate for the worst science fiction movie ever made. Not only is the science fiction premise of \\"The Core\\" completely unbelievable (trust me on this, I am a geologist) but the script is sophomoric and the acting terrible. The dumb special effects do not help either. In short, this movie makes \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" look like \\"2001 A Space Odyssey\\". Is it possible that Jon Amiel was deliberately trying to make a bad movie? Is he trying to become the next Phil Tucker (who directed the 1953 classic \\"Robot Monster\\")? My advice is do not waste good money on this movie, even as a rental. Do not even waste your time! The only reason that I did was because I was trapped watching it on a transAtlantic flight. If you want to watch really bad science fiction, get something made by Ed Wood, at least it will be funny (albeit unintentionally) and have some cultural and historical value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digs it own grave, literally.","review":"Impressive opening degrades in an almost quantam fashion. By 10 minutes into this film, disbelief can no longer be suspended and it becomes a comedy, though not intentionaly. The relationships of the characters to each other have an almost comic book feel. An analogy where a peach is roasted with a can of hairspray and a lighter is probably the best place to stop this movie and run out of your house and do something rather than waste your life watching the remainder of this film.It's not quite torture, but I think the U.N. should look into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid, campy actioner","review":"\\"The Core\\" is a cinematic nightmare, remniscent of such classics as....Deep Impact\\" and \\"Armageddon\\"?

Its hangs together on the worst kind of cliches, and as previous reviewers have said, has no scientific basis at all. At the start its not that bad. The crew of a space shuttle have to land in the middle of L.A. because of the start of the Earths core slowing down, which leads the Shuttles guidance systems astray. This is done quite well although the CGI special effects aren't that great. From there its a rapid decent, excuse the pun.The film is reminisent of Armageddon in style, and amazingly probably not as good, because its even more scientifically unlikely. Quite why Hilary Swank decided to do this film is beyond me. However she and Bruce Greenwood (so good in Thirteen Days as JFK) are the only redeeming features.

It is unbelievably bad. Not so because of the acting, or other things, however. What makes this movie so detestable is the fact that almost nothing makes any sense at all. OK, so the core of the earth is going to explode, so why the heck did they jump in a shuttle and go to outer space? There's even one scene where hundreds of thousands of pigeons drop dead and plummet to the ground, causing chaos. Who thought that one up? If that scene was supposed to be scary, it wasn't because I couldn't stop laughing. And of course noone would notice a man who had harnessed the power to blast through mountains.

I personally don't want to spend all my time watching movies that require thought or reflection or serve as metaphors for cultural differences or make some type of political or artsy statement. This movie didn't try to be anything else but what it was - a good sci-fi flick. Yes, the cast is terrific - especially Stanley Tucci - and the concept was unrealistic - so what? - but the film was well-made, well-meaning, and well-done.

Lots of boring cliches here, too -- nerdy kid computer genius (who has a remarkably ugly nose by the way), unethical scientist who knows something everybody else doesn't, fish-out-of-water good guy suddenly conscripted to save the day, good black guy who dies. Plus, famous landmarks get destroyed!

And it just gets worse and worse and oh so very much worse as the film goes on, right up to its trite, lame, ridiculous end.Don't pay a cent to rent this film.

Roddy Frame's sophomore effort as front man/songwriter/guitarist/singer of Aztec Camera is truly a wonderful work. Frame's songwriting is more complex than on his debut \\"High Land, Hard Rain\\" and the songs benefit greatly from Mark Knopfler's production. The addition of keyboards to fun, upbeat tracks like \\"Still On Fire,\\" \\"Just Like The USA,\\" and \\"All I Need Is Everything\\" do not detract from Frame's playful guitar work, nor does the trumpet work on \\"Head Is Happy\\". The other tracks are on the mellow side but are well written and a pleasure to listen to. Most importantly, this CD is timeless. It does not sound dated in any respect. I am glad I rediscovered this CD think you'll find it a strong effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look to Yourself","review":"There are portions of this book that I do not subscribe to, but in whole it made me look at myself, my expectations, and lack of patience and resulting control. The stories contained illustrated the power struggles I was breeding. My ulitmate methods vary somewhat from the book, but we are definitely living in a more positive family situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information","review":"This book gives very practical, in your real world advice. I saw where I was missing it, and made corrections in my own behavior. Then I was able to see more clearly how to change my child's behavior. Their behavior feeds off of yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemous!","review":"Upon a closer examination of the rudimentary design of this \\"how-to\\" book for selfish parents, you will see that this essay has been misconstrued completely by the author, Sal Severe (who happens to be one of the most un-hip trendsetters of all time, but that's another story). Halfway into this puff piece for the esoteric agenda, one will find himself or herself wallowing in a morass of self-despair, for none of Severe's teachings follows a divine discipline; no consequent follows a feasible supposition. To make matters worse, Severe completely ignores the need for self-reflection and motivational critique. Furthermore, the complete lack of phenotypic characterizations leaves the reader asking, \\"why, Mr. Severe, do you affix such a post-generational disjunctive grappling hook (line, and sinker) to the cold-hearted buffoon?\\" Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Training Your Little Lab Rat","review":"Dr. Severe (what an oddly appropriate name) advocates a style of parenting that is behavior-focused, a theory called \\"behavioralism\\" that has been fairly well disproven. Focusing solely on actions, using a carrot-and-stick, creates people who are only looking for whether or not they will be \\"paid,\\" not what is right or wrong or true to their own values. This is great for teaching lab rats to run a maze or push a button, but is it really what you want for your child?If you are looking for a book that REALLY teaches you how to behave so your children will, I would highly recommend John Gottman's Raising An Emotionally Intelligent Child. It still gets you the results--the well-behaved child--and talks you through looking at your ownb self, but with a focus on raising a child who is self-controlled instead of being dependent on rewards and punishments to determine their behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars wasn't an option !","review":"This book is the single worst book on child-rearing I have ever read. And I've read alot of books about children's self-esteem, motivating them, having a peaceful family life, etc. This book is, by far, the most uninspiring, unmotivating, unreseached, and unhelpful book out there. It was so hard to follow the message that the author was trying to convey. He jumped around so much, I was getting so frustrated trying to read this sad excuse for a book. The author never finished a complete thought without moving on to another topic and then would jump back and try to reference previous chapters that had been left unexplained. The basic premise of the book seemed great, but definately fell flat. The author just could not adequately carry out his message and I was disappointed and wasted too much time on this book and didn't even reap any new knowledge from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking Philosophical Acumen","review":"Heidegger scholars pretty much unanimously agree that Edwards completely missed the boat on this one.

Might be too dainty for some. Good performance however for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"all the who","review":"The one good thing about this DVD is that all members are present. The sound quailty is good, but the camera work is of poor quality. All in all it has a good selection of songs,tempoand raw energy. For Who fans it is a must, as the latest Who material has a great big void, no John, as he was the driving force of the band and he will be missed along with Keith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money!","review":"Big Bummer, quality was terrible, sound and dubbing was off worse than an old Bruce Lee movie. I would not recommend this DVD to anyone and I am one of the Who's most loyal and devoted fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man, I feel sorry for those poor drums.","review":"So I finally got to see the greatest rock drummer of them all. Even better visually than he is/was recorded. So animated, so fast, so precise. Pretty funny back and forth with Pete too. Yes, this is the first time I've seen The Who, my all time fave band. Reviews here are interesting. Those who have seen them before think it's the greatest dvd due to the energy of the band, and not withstanding the shakey filming and so-so audio. I must say, it's absolutely incredible. The small stage has them all close together, which is cool. They really interact well. Seeing Keith and Pete do their things up close is something I've waited a long time for. Pete's incomparable fingerwork, Keith's legendary mastery of the skins. This is an amazing performance and I'm so glad I bought it. You will be too."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO?","review":"The only reason for 1 star is, I never got the DVD. The vender sent me a CD instead, I received a refund so maybe I purchase it later.

If this is one of their greatest shows they are very overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is new version coming out on Aug 10, 2004?","review":"Buy.com has \\"Who Live at Isle Wight\\" dvd with a scheduled release date of August 10, 2004 that is available for pre-order. Have they re-done this dvd, or have the Who played a festival there in recent years that is being released?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoot the Editors","review":"I agree with the other reviews condeming the editors of this DVD. Some songs are edited very poorly, and at times the camera effects and audience shots can be extremely distracting.Despite all this, I am unable to dislike this DVD. Leave it to The Who to transcend a bad film. The music is amazing, they were truly at top form during this concert. I especially reccomend the outstanding performances of 'Water' and 'Young Man Blues'.As long as you don't expect the film quality of TKAA, you wont be disapointed. It's a way to get the outstanding musical performance while still being able to enjoy John's classic skeleton suit and watch Roger tangle himself in that insane net of fringe.If you are new to the Who, I reccomend starting with Stein's 'The Kids are Alright', but if you are already familiar with this behemouth of a rock band, this DVD is not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy Concert","review":"This is an awsome concert. It is so good, in fact, that even if you hate THE WHO (if that's possible) you will love this concert. It's just that good. The sound quality is perfect, and when they play the popular rock opera Tommy it's just like you're at the concert. Its a totally groovy experience, buy it and be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who - 'Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970' (Image)","review":"I give it 4 1/2 stars.Running time:85 minutes.The Who's performance at the Isle Of Wight Festival took place on August 30,1970 and this DVD is a superb way of reliving that unforgetable experience.The less-than-perfect editing job certainly does NOT effect the enjoyment of watching this film.At least I didn't think so.The audio 2-CD release of this title(see my review)is just as good.Tunes that will forever live on with fans are \\"I Can't Explain\\",\\"I Don't Even Know Myself\\",\\"My Generation\\",\\"The Acid Queen\\" and \\"Tommy Can You Hear Me?\\".A must-have for all Who fans old and young alike.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concert-Terrible Film","review":"We have here what could have been the ultimate document of a Moon-era Who show but instead get a concert film that is barely watchable. Not only is song order altered and numbers deleted, but some of the songs themselves are actually edited down. Also, the presentation really needs to be in letterbox format like the \\"Message to Love\\" DVD. I got dizzy watching this claustrophobic display. Skip the video until it gets a better treatment. In the meantime buy the CD. It doesn't compromise as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still no \\"Amazing Journey?!\\"","review":"This is the Who at their prime. I love the original DVD, and am looking forward to this one. But I couldn't believe that the original left off Amazing Journey/Sparks.

Moon is on the loose","review":"Awesome concert, some tech flaws hear and there, over all a rocking show!! Great to to see the Who in there glory days, I was 4 when this concert happened. At times there a various camera angles. Purists will be angry , set list of show mixed up. But its from 1970!! I finally get a better concert to see Keith moon !!! Also, John is wearing the infamous skeleton suit.A very nice show..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to buy the Blu-ray version","review":"Was so excited to hear this was coming out on Blu-ray, as it might be the best one-band rock concert I've ever seen recorded for posterity on video.But if you already own the DVD version of this, there's no real reason to spend the extra money on the Blu-ray version. There's no extra footage nor bonus features on it compared to the DVD, and no real distinctive sound improvement from the DVD 5.1 remaster on the special edition. Even the cover is 99% identical to the DVD version. The video quality is virtually identical as well.Bottom-line- if you haven't bought either yet, I can't recommend this concert enough. But if you already own the DVD version Special Edition, don't waste your money on the Blu-ray as well. I guess there's only so much you can do with video and audio recorded in 1970."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic concert DVD","review":"I have been a fan of the Who for over 40 years and saw them live at the Hollywood Bowl a few years ago, which was fine but was not too happy that they only did one song from Tommy - Pinball Wizard. In this recorded concert, they do 14 tracks from Tommy which was a total delight for me! I would highly recommend this ultra high energy performance (how does Keith Moon do it???) by the much younger Who."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"Great album, no doubt about it. I love the lyrics. They are clever and not meaningless.The rythms are great and each musician plays at their best.The downside would be the lack of hits besides 1 and 7, but then again I think that because this album was done between tours the material is more \\"live\\" stuff and has a mixed bag of different styles.Favorite tracks are 1,2,3,5,7,9 and 8. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pop rock masterpiece and a must-have - most people will love it","review":"Despite how you feel about Sting, this album is simply a must have. Every track on this CD is great, and the guitar style is one of my favorites (you know what I mean if you've heard \\"Voices In My Head\\"). Every band member is a great musician and it really shows in this album. Sting once again proves that he is one of rock's greatest singers (his voice is also incredibly sothing). Their hit songs \\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\" and \\"De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\\" are both great but the rest of the album is definitely on par with these two. The lyrics are generally very good and easily quotable which makes singing along easy and great fun. If you're a fan of The Police/Sting, interested in the history of music, or even just a music fan, you can't go wrong with \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\".Highlights include:the whole album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Dynamic!","review":"The Police always had a great sence of rhythm to their music,wheather the style be light reggae,pop or ska.And thisalbum matches all of those styles into a spicy little stew saddled with great pop hooks.\\"Don't Stand So Close To Me\\" and\\"De Do,Do,Do,De,Da,Da,Da\\" are perfect examples of superb early80's pop and stand up alot better then much from this era!Thereis also an instrumental,some R&B; inflected songs and even stabsat ska like \\"Canary In A Coalmine\\" and the cryptic \\"Man In ASuitcase\\".With their brainy lyrics and ascew musical sence I'msurprised much of what this band did ever caught on.But it did,they had alot of pop singles and alot of people forgot how greattheir albums could be!Well if that's the case come back torevisit 'Zenyatta Mondatta\\" emmediatly-it will thrill the sences!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Must-Have CD","review":"My 12 year old saw Sting perform live and commented that he had a pretty great voice for an old guy. Bought the CD version of the album to give her a glimpse into Sting's musical past and a sense of the band's influence on modern artists. If you only have one Police CD this should be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no sound at all","review":"This is one of of Police records I like most. Unfortunately, there is something wrong with SACD Amazon sent. It is not recognized by my McIntosh MPV861, so I get not sound at all. I tried to send it back from my country but Amazon's shipping agent in Venezuela (UPS via Aerocav) is charging almost USD 120 to return it, so at the end it is cheaper to keep this not sounding sacd here at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess this is the \\"re-reissue\\"...","review":"Okay, so lessee... the original CD came out in the 80's some time, which sounded like junk. Then the remastered version came out in 1995, which sounded fine. So what, if I buy it a third time, will they come and play at my house? Uh 'scuse me, isn't there something better you folks could do with your time? It's no wonder Universal has to cut prices on their CDs, what with brilliant reissue projects like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Police - Another Solid Effort","review":"By this time the Police were truly becoming monsters in both album sales and on the concert trail. The band were playing all over the world to huge crowds and this album would help to propel them to superstar status. This is another good one. I think that just about every song on this disc got played on AOR radio and several of the tracks were huge top 40 hits. The reggae influence is still here, but The Police were definitely developing their own unique sound at this point. A lot more politics and overall social issues begin to make it into the lyrics on this one as well. This is another must own for Police fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"more police","review":"I don't know which Police album is their best, but this is probably the one I listen to the most. It's also the one that had some really popular songs still played to this day, and songs that bring back the most memories of my childhood many years ago (which seem like only yesterday- I wish they were!)The songs you haven't heard from this album are probably the best ones. I think you will find that out when you hear it. In fact, \\"Canary In A Coalmine\\", \\"Bombs Away\\", and \\"Behind My Camel\\" are my three favorite songs. The rest of the album is just very good melodic early 80's rock and roll. A band that probably deserves all the positive attention they have received over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goin' Back: Very Best of Dusty Springfield","review":"Excellant CD. Dusty really knew how to pick the songs. Her voice is gold. There cannot be a \\"Very Best of Dusty Springfield\\", all her CD's are truly \\"solid gold\\". Each time I think I have found a favorite CD, I buy another one, and am just amazed how many songs she has sung that should have been selected to have air time and were not. She has alot of number one hits sitting there. Her fans need to do something to bring back these songs and get some air time, they still have a \\"life\\". Just becuase the CD in some peoples minds was not gold, doesn't mean individual songs will not soar to the top. Her music does not have an expiration date on them. This generation is missing some quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAS ALL OF DUSTY'S HITS IN THE UK","review":"If you want just one CD to give you all of Dusty's hits then this is it.So why not 5 stars,well,I can never understand why CD producers choose not to put tracks in chronological order,also some earlier tracks are mono and do not have very good sound quality.The reason for this is the original master tapes have been lost,so with just a couple of exceptions,any Dusty compilation will suffer the same fate.In my case I found a CD with these earlier tracks in stereo and bought it,however it only covers her earlier work,see \\"Stay Awhile-I Only Want to Be with You/Dusty Stay Awhile-I Only Want to Be with You/Dusty.\\"I have done a review of this CD,there are 2 version of it,you want the Taragon one,not the Philips one.With these 2 CDs,you will have all of Dusty's hits plus plenty more fabulous music and ALL IN HIGH QUALITY STEREO.The Taragon CD is easier to find on the USA Amazon site,do see my other Dusty reviews.(I live in the UK,more reviews are on the .co.uk site)"},{"rating":"1","title":"desole!","review":"okay, so this movie is unforgettable, beautiful, the world of film is changed because of its existence-- BUTto not have put it in letterbox is a CRIME!

I am a tent camper. Although the title implies that this book was written for those travelling with an RV or tent, it is primarily for the RVer. It does mention when tent camping is an option but gives little or no information beyond that fact. The writers do give RVers a good idea of what to expect, providing decent descriptions of campground setup, condition, and facilities. They go so far as to tell you what part of the campground you will likely find a spot and whether shady sites are available. They give very little detailed information regarding tenting conditions. If you are planning tenting trip to Mexico, this may be a very usual guide simpy to locate the campgrounds but for little else. If you are planning a RVing trip to Mexico, I would not go without this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"We used this guidebook constantly!","review":"We recently spent 6 weeks roaming in a small Toyota camper, off the beaten tourist paths, down the Gulf Coast to Veracruz, then inland to Teotihuacan and back via various cities. This book led us to a number of delightful (umm... and otherwise, but hey they worked) campgrounds we wouldn't have otherwise found, and I appreciated its directions for bypassing Mexico City and Tampico. We were somewhat more adventurous than the Churches recommend about finding places to boondock, but we do speak enough Spanish to ask the locals, which we always did.I have a list of resources in an ebook I've written about Mexico, and this one literally tops the list -- for RVers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Source Book for Mexican Camping","review":"This is the best book that I have found for traveling in Mexico, both in an RV and on a motorcycle.

When the initial DVD box sets came out for this series I snatched them up at a lightning pace. It was nice to watch these again on DVD and know that the quality would not diminish. The problem was the DVD versions were nothing great to look at. This blu-Ray set is mind boggling. I really haven't seen any old shows that have looked this good on blu-ray. Whatever A&E did to improve the quality is amazing. Right from the opening credits you can tell how vibrant the colors are and how clean everything looks. There are some fans who tend to like their old shows with all of the grit that older film transfers tend to have. I am not one of those fans. The Prisoner blu-ray set is unbelievably clean and lacks any grime or grit or really any imperfections that a show of this age would have.

I guess we can't complain to much since it was an added feature.)I think a nice touch would have been to include the soundtrack with the 10 disc set. It might have been to tall of an order for A&E to fill though. I know they had 2 versions of the soundtrack floating around on vinyl years ago. I was lucky enough to obtain one of them.

Contrary to the one star reviews that were written before the Blu-ray release by people that had not seen the Blu-ray set yet, I can definitively say the picture and sound quality is top notch and is 100x better than the previous US dvd releases. (which I also own and compared it too.)There really is no comparison here. The previous dvd's were muddy and the picture quality was severely lacking. The image on the Blu-ray release is crisp, clear and looks absolutely amazing. It looks like it could have been filmed yesterday.I think if I had one complaint it would be that the fifth disc that contains many of the extras is a regular DVD and not in HD.

I love this series - don't let my review of the set keep you from wanting to watch The Prisoner. A & E fumbled the mastering of the DVD for it is rife with digital artifacts. (This - for the new DVD owner - means that the program you watch is consistently interrupted with audio/visual glitches). It is unfortunate that the artifacts are so numerous for there are many features that would keep Prisoner fans satisfied.

Even those not aired in the US. Not to be outdone the box set includes documentaries on the show's production and influences. Part of the mystique of 'Prisoner' is that no one knows for sure what it is all about. The documentaries raise the questions, highlight the deep issues that may be being alluded to, but in the end the questions thankfully remain unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am sorely disappointed in this product. I have been a fan of the Prisoner since the beginning but this product did not endear me to its creator.The video is marginal and the sound simply horrible.

Most of the DVDs have some foggy blotches on them and cause the episodes to skip. To rate the series: ***** stars. The series is subject to very interesting political interpretation. McGoohan has some terrific moments as an actor with his facial expressions.Did I say I like the series? That's an understatement. I truely enjoyed it. Moments are inspirational.

There is a great variety and everything has been easy to make, but more a slow cooker cookbook for cooks, than one for someone that wants to plop some food in and have it cooked when they get home from work.

The \\"vegan-friendly\\" recipes I've tried have been fine, but nothing I felt drawn to return to.So for those who are looking for great food that's healthier, lower in fat, more sustainable, this may not be your cookbook.

Will Devour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recipes for stressed working parents!","review":"Great book for working parents who want healthy families! True, there is some precooking required for recipes, but every good slow-cooker recipe out there requires SOME preparation...I usually do the prep while I'm getting dinner ready the night before, then refrigerate overnight and pop it in the slow cooker as I'm walking out the door (most recipes work this way). It's great to come home to the smell of dinner cooking, and knowing you have very little left to do to get dinner on the table!For those with the larger cookers, like my oval Corning, get a timer to get it right. My first attempt at the mushroom lasagne was overcooked. Got it right the next time with the timer. Lesson learned. The kids LOVED it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The thing that I love about slow cookers is, you throw everything into the pot, turn it on and at dinner time you have a meal. It's simple, easy and tastes GREAT. Unless you like to cook, then put it into the crockpot, i would not recomend this book. You might as well cook the whole meal, you are already doing half of the cooking anyhow. Also.....the recipes in here have a LOT of ingredients, not very practicle for my family. We can't afford to cook gourmet meals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Slow Cooker afterall","review":"When I read the review of this cookbook, it seemed perfect. When I read through the recipes after it arrived, it appears that the recipes require additional cooking outside of the slow cooker. Just about all of them require sauteeing, boiling down first, some sort of cooking before you actually slow cook. That is not slow cooking to me. I need to put the ingredients in the pot and come home to the recipe made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, easy to use book","review":"You don't need any weird ingredients to follow the recipes in this book. I have a slow cooker with stoneware that I can use on stove-top, in the microwave and in the oven. Therefore I do not mind that the recipes include prep steps. I put my onions in my stoneware, place it on the stove and then I place it in the slow cooker and I'm done. And the food tastes so much better when you follow the prep steps. Overall a real good vegetarian slow cooker book."},{"rating":"1","title":"125 Best Vegetarian Slow cooker Recipes","review":"Recipe for Mushroom Cholent on p 133 was a horrible experience.

I own two vegetarian slow cooker cookbooks and this is the only one I use. In the year that I've owned this book I've made close to 30 of the recipes. The photos in the book are enticing and the recipes are easy to follow and for the most part have been flavorful and popular with my family. I especially like the spicy recipes like Caribbean Pepper Pot Soup and Red Lentil and Carrot Soup with Coconut. There have been a few duds- Cannelloni with Tomato Eggplant Sauce didn't turn out well from my slow cooker. I have come to really embrace the technique of precooking the vegetables as suggested by Finlayson since this lends much better flavor and texture to the finished dishes. I am back today to purchase a copy for my sister, also a vegetarian and soon to be a regular slow cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star, since I won't be using this book","review":"I obviously purchased this book for recipes to make in my slow cooker. Since just about every recipe requires pre-cooking, I simply won't be using it; it's just more trouble than I'm willing to go through. It's not just browning onions in the slow cooker, but cooking eggplant, peppers, etc. If I were going to go through all that, I don't need to add another step of using the slow cooker. This was just not what I was hoping, or looking, for."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is FANTASTIC","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this book because I'm Vegan and I spend a lot of my time revamping vegetarian cookbooks to fit that lifestyle, having to omit and replace, but this book was fantastic! There are many, many items in the book that are vegan \\"friendly\\" and I have to say, they are totally delicious. Last night I made the Sweet Potato and Barley Risotto - outstanding. Needed just a little dab of soy milk (or soy butter) for a creamier texture, but it was fantastic and didn't require any salt for flavor whatsoever.The only shock for me was the amount the recipe made. The recipe suggests it serves 4. Even as a main dish, if that was a serving, I would be big as a house. It could easily serve 8-10 with 1 cup servings. 1 1/2 cups barley really expands when cooked!I am thrilled I bought this and would recommend it to vegetarians, vegans, and meat-eaters trying to find variety alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED AND STUCK WITH IT","review":"I have an HP printer that requires these ink cartridges.

It is impossible to guide the cursor with precision. Completely unusable in practice.

To that they coupled sharp but not over-the-top social/political observations (my favorite - from \\"Are You Trying to Be Funny?\\" where a well to do man preserves his conscience by praying \\"may the bad things in life come in twos and not threes\\") - themes later covered later with less subtlety by the Housemartins.

If you liked the original version of \\"Missing\\" definitely pick up on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pen And Sword Together","review":"This is an amazingly dense, humorous, weird, horrifying, and subtle discussion of swordplay.Think of it as a stupendous compendium of dojo (salle) stories with integral links to manners, morals, politics, skullduggery, and sport.He falls down in the Japanese section (seduced by popular views of Zen) but forgiveably because he still manages to extract some quite interesting points.Wanna know where the decisive blow in the Rob Roy film duel came from? You'll find it.Wanna know who the model was for Cyrano de Bergerac? You'll find it.Wanna find out why Abe Lincoln was so formidable?

Being an expert sport fencer niether makes one a swordsman nor a historian. This book is a glaring example of something I've seen all too often. Someone gains notoriety in a given subject and uses this notoriety to promote their opinions on other subjects. People see the \\"experts'\\" credentials and assume that the statements made by said \\"experts\\" must be true. The danger comes when future authors use such writings as research for their own works. These new authors' credentials are added to the list and the more they are quoted, the more credence is given to their statements, however unfounded they may be. The subject becomes exponentially corrupted until the truth becomes a hazey footnote that is all but impossible to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly inaccurate","review":"As some of the mistakes in this book have been listed, I will just deal with the Hollywood stuff, which is TOTALLY INCORRECT:- Errol Flynn was NOT an accomplished swordsman- Tyrone Power was an EXPERT swordsman who NEVER - read this - NEVER used a double. Basil Rathbone, also an expert swordsman, said \\"Tyrone Power could fence Errol Flynn into a cocked hat.\\" Rathbone and Power's swordfight in \\"The Mark of Zorro\\" is considered the best ever filmed.I have no idea where Mr. Cohen got his information, but I can personally attest that it is completely inaccurate and an insult to Power to boot, whose expertise was well known."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to keep in mind while reading -- check his facts","review":"This could have been a definitive book, a book of fencing for our times -- but it is riddled with numerous factual/historical inaccuracies. Just two examples a few pages apart: Cohen writes (on page 151) that the film \\"Duel at Ichijoji (1964)\\" was the \\"first of that trilogy\\" -- when the title is actually \\"Duel at Ichijoji Temple\\" and it is the second of the trilogy and the year should be 1956. A major blunder though is Yukio Mishima being called a \\"Nobel-laureate\\" (p. 155). Strange that none of the professional reviewers picked up on that one or warns readers about similar errors. It's been an annoying read, having to second-guess and stop to double check Cohen's facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice attempt, but quite bad overall","review":"I'm a non-European fencer, having studied Japanese Swordfighting instead. I picked this book up because it purported to have information on Japanese fighting, and I was interested in reading about it.So that was thrown out the window pretty quick, as this book is a definite European Fencing book. It has 2 chapters on japanese work, and it is very high level and not useful.But I read the book anyway, attempting to learn about European fencing. Overall, the author tries hard, but the book is unorganized and tries to use a shotgun, when a rifle would have been suited. It seems like the author was attempting to put a feather in his already immpressive career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary, Sloppy","review":"As a fencer and as a reader of serious non-fiction I must say this clunky, dense and aimless book is a disappointment.Cohen's history is as deep as cocktail party anecdote and his writing is often patronizing and windy.

When it's there it's so-so, static-y most of the time with small periods of clean sound. I mostly listen to audio books and it's very distracting. The stereo hook up works but you have to have the sound on the ipod all the way up and turn your stereo all the way up (way past any level I use in any other listeneing scenario) but the sound here is fine.

I bought a $20. heater half the size of this one, from Walmart, and it heats my bathroom in 10 minutes.

If you like the ramones at all you will love this book. The best part about it is that is is an easy read all chapters are less than 20 pages long...short like a ramones song! Long live Dee Dee Ramone, may he rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an addict's story folks","review":"For those who are complaing that this book is not a comprehensive history of The Ramones, you are missing the point. This is the story of one Dee Dee Ramone, a man who lived part of his life as bassist for the band, and lived his whole life as a drug addict. Ego? Of course. As addicts, we are insecure egomaniacs and if we don't have our sobriety, we have no chance of building a better life from this chaos.Dee Dee never found what he needed. The only irony is that the word \\"Surviving\\" is in the title. Like thousands before and after him who are still suffering, Dee Dee did not survive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollow Victory Speech","review":"I opened this book knowing that Dee Dee Ramone had died of a heroin overdose. So, when he teed-off with all of this \\"I've finally found peace with myself\\" and \\"one day at a time\\" banter, I couldn't help but question the memoir's sincerity right out of the gate.The book simply exposes Dee Dee Ramone for what he was--a gluttonous fool who tripped into a pile of fame and blew it.The guy was simply stupid and clueless and the narrative reinforces this at every turn. The relentless war stories are nothing more than a pathetic attempt to convince readers that he was truly hard-core, the real McCoy. It's just run-of-the-mill re-habber self-promotion that grows incredibly stale incredibly quickly.If you want to read about punk (or the Ramones, for that matter,) read \\"Please Kill Me.\\" Forget this book. Unless you're truly a die-hard Ramones fan (or a die-hard \\"higher power\\" type,) you will despise it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slip into the shoes of Dee Dee Ramone","review":"I liked the book for it was - an honest and straight from the horses mouth telling of how it was being Dee Dee Ramone. You get a great sense of who he is and how he works, he holds nothing back in regards to the things he's done in his life that he is not proud of. The book's got a ton of personality behind it and it reads as if Dee Dee is talking right to you directly. What I didn't like was that there were very few stories regarding THE RAMONES themselves. I know, then don't read a Dee Dee book, read a RAMONES tell all! But the book lost points for lacking more and by more - most of the book is just Dee Dee talking about running around for drugs and feeling bad for himself. I loved the honesty, just hungered for more.

Does f--k even have to be on the outside jacket reviews. I think Dee Dee should stop trying to appeal to morons and realize that his audience has a brain; maybe the Ramones would have been bigger if they didn't try so hard to look stupid.I will keep the book because I am a collector and a fan, but I warn all buyers to BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lobotomy: Surviving the Ramones","review":"Boy, did this book suck.

It does not recognize small (few pound) changes in weight in repeated measurements. It reads the same until \\"reset\\" by a significantly different measurement. I purchased this product several weeks ago and weigh myself every morning. I became suspicious when my weight was identical every day for a week (weight is displayed to 0.2 pounds.) So I weighed myself then picked up a 12 oz tooth paste tube and reweighed, identical total weight. I added my electric tooth brush, again no change. These two items should have added just under 2 pounds. When I grabbed something weighing about 5 pounds I got a new weight. I now cycle the scale with something light, wait for it to reset, weigh myself, then wonder what I really weigh."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy","review":"We got the scale just as described, on time,and in good working order.

My brother and mother had the same problem it was 10-25 under their actual weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a light weight...","review":"This product looks nice and weighs great if you're under 350lbs. However, I purchased it because I weigh around 400 and it said it would go up to 440. When I got it home and started using it, it would take 10 tries just to get one valid reading. Let me tell you, this is very discouraging if you're trying to lose weight and your scale keeps giving you errors instead of lbs. It never did an overload msg, just an error msg. So I had to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the price!","review":"Got the scale a few days ago and it works better than the other Taylor scale I had and looks much more contemporary. The read-out has a backlight which is far easier to see then the older models that do not have it. The weight increment is .2 lb. which is also better than the older models that had up to .5 lb. increments. Setup took about 5 seconds so really you just need to let it zero out once and your're good to go. The glass top is thick so it feels solid and it makes the scale look less obtrusive on the floor while the silver bars prevent you from not seeing the scaling and accidently stubbing a toe which might be something that occurs when you have a scale that is mostly glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use!!!","review":"This is so easy to use, easy to read and accurate. As always we order through Amazon and that always makes shopping easier too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very accurate and adequately sized","review":"Just bought this at Costco with $10 off coupon for $14. Compared its weight reading with full size balance beam scale (doctor office type) and the reading was within 0.2 lbs. repeatedly. There is no way to calibrate it; I assume the electronics do that automatically - will treat it gently to maintain its accuracy. Nicely sized. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few uses and I'm not a huge person!","review":"Got this scale and after a few uses it started giving random weight measurements (off by 60-80 lbs). Then it stopped working and would only give a reading of 0.00. We tried pulling the batteries out several times and resetting, but it will now only read at 0.00. Returning to Amazon for a refund. Also, the scale had rubber feet on the bottom that had some give to them, so it had to always be on a perfectly flat surface to give an accurate reading. I buy close to a dozen items a month with Amazon and am a prime member and this is only the 3rd thing I've ever returned. Disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"too big and heavy; did not weight accurately","review":"Besides the size and weight, a disadvantage if you don't want to keep it out all the time, it began with a 7 lb on the scale when I set it on the floor. Thinking this was due to uneven floor, moved it around, yet any time I used it began with this same 7 lb registered on the digital readout and then added that 7 lbs to the total weight when I stepped on it. I put my 8 lb dumbell on the scale and it weight 6.9 instead of 8 lbs. What a piece of junk right out of the box! I have an older Taylor scale that works fine, but best to let this one go to countries where people don't mind an extra 7 lbs added to their total weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine unless you have to put it away every day","review":"My experience with the scale is that it has been wildly inaccurate, but after reading the other reviews it seems people are happy unless you have my situation, which is that your bathroom is too small to leave the scale out in one place. Every time I pull it out of the cupboard I have to re-set it, which is an annoying process of stepping on and off the scale three times with intervals of waiting. I always place it around the same flat spot but I have found that if I shift it over just a few inches I can weigh seven pounds more or less. Now that is just not accurate enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money - I've only had it for a month,nice looking design but wildly inaccurate, automatic shutoff doesn't shut off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"Poor packaging, both inner and outer. The batteries were rolling around loose in the product box and the metal parts of the scale were loose from the glass. Looked to me like the scale was shoved into its box carelessly and that's why it came apart. The outer packaging was also terrible -- the product was at the bottom of a big box and the rest was only partially padded. Decided not to try another one because the way it's constructed looked cheap. Can't comment on accuracy, since it arrived broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so accurate","review":"It's a weighty scale with a nice, modern look. I like the LCD blue backlit display because it makes it easier to see the number. However, form factor aside, this is not an accurate scale.As others have mentioned, the scale # will not budge much.

I stepped off, move the scale a bit to make sure it was flat on our tiles, and then stepped back on, the scale showed I gained 10lbs in the half a second!

I have had it for two weeks now and every morning I have tried weighing myself multiple times within 2-3 minutes and I get results which vary among themselves by as much as 3-5 pounds. This is a relatively high percentage of error given my body weight (2-3%) and makes the scale absolutely useless for monitoring weight. I have the scale on a hard tile floor as instructed.

No one is supposed to get hurt, and since the money is insured no one really suffers. Unfortunately, the dispatcher's boyfriend Wolf(Stephen Baldwin, playing a ruthless thug) gets wind of the scheme and wants the money for himself.

Fine for maybe 12 and under."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie - NOT First Time Out","review":"This was a Made-for-TV movie, actors & plot as desctibed. It succeeds beautifully at showing that Santa doesn't take the Christ out of Christmas (he's our scapegoat.)

It does a charming job of explaining many of the origins of the myths associated with Santa Claus, how he came to use reindeer, how he aquired his traditional outfit, how stockings came to be used and many others.This is a charming, multi-cultural tale that leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, hard to find album!","review":"This is a must for any Aretha Franklin collector.

The music is a little more subtle and Eric Martin's voice is in great shape. The instrumental virtuosity is a little better blended with the songs this time around. The songs of course are great with lots of patented Mr. Big harmonies. Different sort of sound, but the all around best that they've done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets us Groove and ROCK","review":"This album is so hip, it probably led to the demise of such talented musicians in a group together. Listen to Pat lay down some ballsy, in your face, groove the night away rhythms. Billy and him are like glue. Guitar work and vocals kick it up another few notches. Yea it took two casual listens and then my ears were dancing. It is too bad that the formulas to make music and money is so redundant and boring. Hats off to a band that was willing to step up and step out and play with such virtuosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE ALBUM!!!!!!","review":"This is the worst Mr Big's works, sounds bad. First, Richie Kotzen sounds very weak and ALL the songs sounds like Creed or a new pop group. Instead of this album, you should be buy other Mr Big cd because this album it's too bad and Eric Martin sings like Ricky Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have 'em back!","review":"This is what I've been waiting for! They're back. Though without Paul, but Richie is good as well. Richie influence their music with added some bluesy style on few songs such as \\"Hiding Place\\" and \\"Mr.Never In A Million Years\\". \\"Static\\" proved that Richie got his high technique, is not lose to Paul. Anyway, both of 'em can't be caompared, they're got they own style. Pat does his best at the album, and Billy got his best shots here. Eric still got his voice high and strong. I don't like blues much, so I gave 'em 4 stars. Hey, it's my private opinion anyway!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UPSET","review":"I just got my order in the mail today.

My son didn't even play with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"This toy is SUCH a waste of money. It is very poorly constructed; the pieces will NOT stay together, which is very frustrating for a little boy (and his parents)!

Needless to say, he lost interest on the same day he received it.

The toy is good sized, rolls well, and the batman figures fits relatively easy in the car. However, the less plaible Robin figure is difficult to get in the motorcycle unit. Also, the rear fins, are always falling or being pulled off, and every child I know has taken the rocket engine off, as it falls off anyway. The fins and rear engine simply don't stay in place as well as the should. It is also an expensive toy for $. If your child must have it is ok. Otherwise, buy a leapster instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have listened!!!!!","review":"Please do not buy this toy for a child under the age of 9 or 10. I read the other reviews that said what a piece of junk this toy is but I thought \\"They can't all be like that\\". And my 5 year old is such a Batman nut that he would love this toy. But it is an absolute waste of money. It constantly falls apart. I tried to Super Glue the pieces together but it still doesn't work. My son ends up frustrated and in tears. This toy was definitely not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Without Action Figures","review":"I totally agree with the reviewer who pointed out that the Robin action figure is \\"hard to find.\\" Actually, you can buy him all day long -- on eBay! I've had the same problems with some Barbie items. I've emailed Mattel about both the Barbie & Batman \\"collector\\" issues & I encourage ALL parents to let Mattel know we're ready to boycott their products! My son couldn't figure out why Santa would give him a Batmobile that has a special motorcycle for Robin, but didn't leave a Robin action figure to ride on it! I felt lucky to at least get a Batman that fits into the car. A lot of the Batman dolls don't even fit! No little boy wants a Batmobile to put on the shelf or own \\"Mint In Box.\\" They want to PLAY with toys! If Mattel is done making toys for kids, then I guess I'm done with Mattel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and prevent disappointing your child!","review":"My husband purchased this toy online for our son. He was overseas so I was the one who had the task of putting it together. First of all, it was very hard to assemble. The pieces had to snap into one another which seems easy but is not. I finally took it to my neighbor who is fairly strong and he also had a hard time, but finally succeeded. Not only was it hard to put together but you had to be careful while assembling it so that you would not loose an eye. The ends are very pointed. As hard as it is to put together it is equally hard to keep together. I am continuously reassembling it, even though each time gets a little easier, it gets more annoying. My son gets frustrated every time it falls apart. I have never in my life had such an awful toy. Today I assembled the toy for the last time and hung it on the wall. Again, due to the ends being so pointed I hung it fairly high on a wall. In conclusion, SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"6'' figures Do Not fit!","review":"My six year old son,who loves cars,had to have this for his collection. After putting it together and not having figures to put in the car we rushed out to get Batman and Robin. No Robin anyplace and two different batman's[6\\"]did not fit in seats. Legs were too wide for passenger seat and top would not close down over figure in driver's seat. Figure's were returned and considering returning the batmobile too! Wasted much of my time running around searching and returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommy can you please fix this!","review":"I bought this toy for my son on his fifth birthday. He had been wanting it for a while and his enthusiasm was short lived when he finally got it. He lost most of the pieces right away and the parts that are not lost continue to fall off of the mobile. Also, the car is so low to the ground that it can not be pushed across the carpet without the fins getting snagged. I wish I would have known that it was not intended to be played with before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of sharp objects!","review":"After we took this out of the box, we couldn't believe how sharp and rigid the tail pieces were. We cut off the points to make the ends blunt for a little piece of mind seeing that it would be in the hands of a four year old. But why should the consumer need to spend a great deal of money on a child's toy and then have to make it safer? And finally-WHERE IS ROBIN?

It's so poorly made. Plus, it doesn't specify on the box what size Batman fits in it and there are so many to choose from.

When she is done with school she can not go home because something has happen to her home. They are taking the blacks for slaves so she has to stay there and try to be careful of her life.

It deals mainly with western pirates during the 'Golden Age' of piracy. Mr. Pringle compiled his information from court records of trials and other public records in England, the U.S. and the Caribbean islands,in addition to journals and other published accounts. This view is not so romantic, and does not contain the florid descriptions of many other books about pirates, but does seem more realistic. He sets the scene by describing life during the period, and in this context the pirates actions do not seem to be any more brutal than the norm, and sometimes perhaps they were more humane than their legal counterparts. He certainly makes it understandable why pirating became such a popular vocation. There are no maps but there are some illustrations. The writing style is a little dry, but for a factual account of pirates, and the pirating life, this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Armband unusable, case OK","review":"It is very hard to feed the end of the armband through the slot for it (too wide for the slot, really). There's no way I could get it positioned comfortably by myself, as I must feed it through the slot *before* putting it on my arm, and I want to put it over the sleeve of my t-shirt. Can't be done without help.Armband is also quite small for me, although I must admit I have large upper arms. Still, I imagine some muscle-bound guys' are larger, even though theirs would be muscle rather than my fat.On the upside, the actual Sansa case is quite a bit lighter than my current one, so I am putting the Sansa in that case and clipping it to the neck of my t-shirt for exercise. Not what I pictured, but it will work.Both the armband and the case seem well constructed, but that doesn't matter much if it won't work as intended.It would probably be fine if you had small arms or had help to put it on, but it's a 2-star for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saver for those who are \\"hard\\" on their MP3 player","review":"I am a big fan of cases that can clip onto my belt (or pants). This case not only has a great, sturdy clip, but is very functional. All the main buttons are easy to access. If you want to put the player on \\"hold\\" you have to undo the Velcro at the top, but it isn't too hard to do. The clip is really strong, which is a big plus since I was constantly dropping my old e260 (that I didn't have a case for). I am sure if I had this case my other SanDisk e260 wouldn't be resting in peace.I love how the screen is protected with plastic, but that that the wheel is still easily accessible (did I mention I am hard on my toys?)The sides are made of a stretchy material so it is easy to remove the player if need be, but the Velcro fastener is really strong that I don't think the player would fall out accidentally.I haven't used the armband yet, but it seems pretty sturdy.

The neoprene band is adjustable and does well with sweat and moisture. The player holster is OK, a bit awkward to get your fat finger into the dial for pressing the keys, but I did it. Even tougher while running. Once you are off and going, you don't need the \\"hold\\" button on the Sansa, since you can't really accidentally push any of the buttons. Leaving the hold in the off position allows you to adjust volume on the move, or easily turn it down if someone actually tries to talk to you with headphones on...Well made, very functional, adjustable for python guns or pencil arms. Does a good job. Good protection for the player in the holster.

That is, until they get hurt.I found Newman's novel bland, boring and basicly blah. There was no reason to set the novel in 1971. The character does not change for none of the desisions in the book are made by her.

Angels Crest essentially plays out within the confines of a 2 person play set to a single location - purposely dissecting each character and scene in a perverse, contorted tale of suspense. Mr. Couto brilliantly sets the characters against a backdrop which offers a pleasant, salient counterpoint, yet magnificently illustrative of the twisted and gnarled storyline.

I found the book essentially accurate in portraying the flavor of Portuguese life and the expatriate's experience of it. Richard's sense of humor is good, his prose tight, his persistence in the face of obstacles quite remarkable. Barbara's illustrations are refined, simple and warm without excessive sentiment. If that's not enough ... the two of them give those who read and \\"listen\\" a nice lesson in how to find the humor in challenging and essentially frustrating circumstances. For those who look for Mayle and find it not ... if lacking Peter Mayle's amazing thematic flow through circumstance ... still a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING!","review":"HELLO!

I've been doing genealogy for over 40yrs and I think if it's not in this then it's not worth worrying about.The only downside is that it doesn't have a lot on the internet, but that's ok, because at the end of the day, you need a good foundation on the basics in family history genealogy and this is the book for that!It covers all the things that you need to know about going into business as a Family Historian/Genealogist - covering contracts, business planning, research, evidence analysis, family histories, proofing, indexing & editing, book reviews and classroom teaching.In all a well rounded overview of everything you would want to consider to become a Genealogist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Genealogy","review":"The product was exactly as advertised, and in much better condition than I had expected.

Perhaps you should not judge a movie by its cover. You certainly can't here. The cover has army guys, Apache helicopters, explosions, and at least a hint of DaVinci Code coolness. The movie itself actually has none of this!! Literally no army guys, no Apache helicopters, no explosions, and not a wiff of DaVinci Code coolness.The plot is full of holes and the acting and writing are stiff.

A conspiracy indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULLSVILLE","review":"If you're ever up late one night and you can't fall asleep, slip this yawner into your DVD player and you'll probably fall asleep after the opening credits.This preponderously dull, hokey drama asserts that there is an ancient code that scientifically proves there's a God.

The graphics glitches (clipping) were constant. You can ride a rail but your board is a foot to the right of it. If you hit a fence enough you will 'pop' through it. It was also SLOW. I can ride faster than this in real life... and that's not saying much. The layout of the first level (I couldn't stomach it long enough to get to another level) was also poor. A very boring game. They should have spent less time making the backgrounds look good and made the game fun. There were some nice touches, like 'live' animals that run around in front of you, along with traffic when you're on a road, and snowmobiles and powder-cats.Oh, and even though there are 5 modes to this game, three of them don't have any mountains available until you achieve all of the goals on the first run in career mode.

Verlaine is not, and never has been, an outstanding lyricist, and with the vocals relatively up front here, this is an issue. The guitar is still striking, with numerous lovely pieces, but doesn't sound particularly new; the album sounds quite a bit like the last Television album. Verlaine's first solo album, Warm and Cool, has a superior atmosphere and overall sound. Nice, jazz-inflected songs like \\"A Stroll\\" would make perfectly acceptable background music for a lazy luncheon, and this is where this album belongs, unobtrusively, pleasently, in the background. Either the end of the album is weak, or I'd had enough of the record, because \\"Shingaling\\" and \\"All Weirded Out\\" sounded dreadful, faux-hip and faking it, and by the time I reached the penultimate \\"The Day on You\\" I was worn out.

A birthday present to myself.Bad choice. A clerk in a local stationer's explained to me that Cross - formerly a reliable manufacturer & purveyor of fine writing instruments - had hit upon the idea of a single body for both pen & pencil - which presumably saves money in manufacturing - with only the insides different. A first disadvantage is that looking down at the two objects in my shirt pocket, a pen and a pencil, they are indistinguishable: can't tell one from the other. A second disadvantage is that the lead-feed for the pencil regularly infuriates me: it takes forever for the lead to find its way into the channeling sleeve & for it to appear & be writeable-with. Pen & pencil have heft, that's undeniable, they weigh enough for the price. But do they work???Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD MOVIE","review":"I had been trying to find a copy of this movie for a long time, when finally I spotted a used copy at my favorite used video store.

After 25 years of the same old same old, Tim Brookes decides to revisit his past, and hitch-hike across the country and back, the same way that he did in 1973 when he was just 20 years old.

My little one loves these and I still get a kick of of em. Can't say my older kids like them too much but the little one begs to watch. The only thing missing is the Theme Song.

He lent me this CD, and then I lost contact with him, never to be able to give it back. If you're that guy, and you're reading this...hey, thanks, man, but you can't have it back.What you will hear on this record is a nice mix of ambient electronics and dream pop that fits nicely somewhere in between Slowdive and Seefeel (who, incidentally enough, collaborated for a while). The music is very obviously composed by someone who knows what they're doing and how to achieve what they want. It's not exactly life-changing, nor will it get the party started (unless it's a slumber party with lots of weed), but you will probably enjoy it.Incidentally, there is a recent band with the same name.

Little did I know, I was about to be exposed to one of the most delightfully entertaining and funny movies I have ever seen.Geena Davis, Jim Carey, Jeff Goldblum and Damon Wayans took a script destined for disaster and somehow created a masterpiece in its own right. The aliens, the musicals, the outlandish props and stupid plot all combined to create one amazingly entertaining movie. It is amazing to see the actors that I mentioned when they were much younger and barely known in the industry, and to see them take such a weird movie to such a high level really displays their raw talent and shows why they eventually make it so big in the industry.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see or show something different, bizarre and totally fun. It certainly is not an ordinary or normal movie, but then again, it was the 80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Movie","review":"This is one of my favorite 80's movies.

It is well written and provides a great deal of factual information. It presents well thought out conclusions. It is balanced; not overly slanted toward the National Park Service, but not overly critical. The book is extremely well researched. The stories of historical characters and events add much to the book. The universe of Yellowstone experts hold several differing views on the proper wildlife numbers that should be allowed in Yellowstone. Schullery fits into the group that favors using historical stocking as a baseline. Those inclined to an agronomy baseline will question some of the conclusions drawn.

And based on the success of this first film, they have just released this direct-to-video sequel (a la \\"Aladdin: Return of Jafar\\" and \\"The Lion King II: Simba's Pride\\"). However, this second installment, while not terrible, is significantly worse than the first one. Now, the Disney folks are geniuses because they banked on the success of the previous one and are hoping that it's success will carry over into this new one. And they are idiots because, had they actually made this second one GOOD, many more people would have paid even bigger bucks to perhaps see a third installment in a few years... unfortunately, Disney does not think that far ahead (Sorry, Mr. Eisner.

A very disappointing sequel that isn't even half as good as \\"A Goofy Movie\\" with none of the main characters doing any songs in the film and some previous characters are omitted from the film. The movie's story line surrounds Goofy more then it does both him and his son, Max, but still follows the same plot as the first film (Goofy and Max getting stuck in a position where they have to work things out between them and find the bond between father and son) not something that should have been repeated if you ask me. As far as I'm concerned I have seen it but have no intentions of owning it. If you wanna good \\"Goofy Movie\\" get the first one not this one. I can say I think they need to bring out a 3rd and final film so we can find out what happened to the missing characters (Stacey & Roxanne).That is my opinion on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great movie","review":"I really loved this movie because it had really funny parts, sad parts, and really good parts.

Too much is left out. Paul Bryant comes out looking like a bad guy here which I'm sure doesn't sit well with many college football fans. The extra features however are excellent. The ESPN presentations of Sports Century and The Real Junction Boys alone make this a worthy addition for any football fan. If you are interested in this story buy the book. It's much more informative and portrays Bryant in a much better and understandable light. Was he mean? Yes! Was he ornery? Always!

I used to like them, I liked \\"The Party Album\\" and all their singles until the horrid \\"Shala Lala\\" was released. After that, I should have just given up any hope for the Vengaboys, but stupidly I went and bought this terrible album and now sits permanently on my shelf never played. Ever! \\"Kiss\\" is a nice song, but the single for it's available and all the other songs are just ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. They're not catchy, they're slow, they're extremely irritating and impossible to dance to.

The movie is really good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aims to shatter convention, but fails to even crack it.","review":"Gaines has written a book that starts out promising but ends up being about as deep as Jane's slave name, \\"Ticey.\\" He does nothing to transcend the hackneyed images of former slaves. It's almost as if, for all his groundbreaking intentions, he's afraid to change public perception too much. He seems to feel that, if he challenges common doctrine to the point where people will have to reconsider their convictions, then he will be overstepping his bounds. But isn't that the point of nonconformist novels such as The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman? To contest that which is accepted, no matter the cost or means of getting there? Instead Gaines pretends to be an iconoclast with this novel, and, in doing so, leaves his characters as mere caricatures, their motives and accomplishments just meaningless accessories to their sketchiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very droll","review":"I realize this is classic American literature, or at least modern classic, but I didn't like it. The book isn't really an autobiography; Jane is merely a point of reference (a common element) in a story that depicts the changes in Southern American society from the Civil War to the 1960s. I think it is unlike other slave narratives in that the central character is not the one whose name is in the title. It is a story of characters, many black people, the people Pittman meets. And the antagonist is social construction. Pittman's life seems so very dull, even meaningless. Things happen around her. She is not a participant. Until the end, when she decides to march in Bayonne. In her old ago, she gives her life purpose by finally deciding to actively respond to the terrible things she has experienced. Style reminds me of Zore Neale Hurston --- it's just storytelling, complete with its vagueness, how and what one chooses to remember, digressions. It often becomes droll."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an excellent book!","review":"I read this book for my sophomore English class.

Endo Shusako San's portrayal is one which approaches Jesus in a manner worthy of several reads. In \\"Life\\" Endo discusses Jesus on a level which both biblical scholars and the lay person or even non-Christian can appreciate and on each level there is great integrity as well as success: a near impossible task!Additionally, this book helps us step out of the otherwise American/Westernized picture of Jesus which the community of biblical scholars - who are mainly white and upper-middle class men - has developed.If you are ready for a vividly real, honest, and (most likely) accurate examination of Jesus' life, pick up a copy today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus for the Japanese","review":"Endo's \\"take\\" on Jesus is unlike most western accounts.

The biggest flaw is the reluctance to acknowledge the \\"small\\" miracles - as much to his fear that his fellow Japanese might not embrace the faith because of that barrier to belief - saving it all for the Big Miracle (Easter). (Malcolm Muggeridge did much the same, though in his case the picture of the \\"small miracles\\" - this healing or that one - is meant to have been something annoying Jesus did while here for those who did not get the big picture).

There are not enough elements in the plot to garner it a tragedy. The central problem to the story of the movie is fixable, hello? Also the Kingsley character is most definitely inaccurately portrayed. If somebody was working two jobs end to end, that person would be sleep deprived. Great stories have come out of sleep deprived characters. Look at Fight Club. This is not a great story. It has more elements that would have made it a very good comedy with some tragic elements. The only tragic part of this movie is the unintentional message, I am sure, that there is no place in this country for immigrants, that the immigrant family end up what it does in the ending (I don't want to give away the ending).A poorly written movie that could have been so much better as a dark comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"So much critical hype, but overall conventional and contrived. None of the characters are very believable, especially Ben Kingsley's. Jennifer Connelly is, as usual, beautiful but sadly limited as an actress. The story as a whole is dull and predictable.

I thought that the characters were well drawn and Ben was in top form. But, I could not sympathize with the girl. Hasn't she ever heard of consequences? The only thing I could see in the film was a self-absorbed girl in an unfortunate, but avoidable, circumstance being aided by a cop who should never have passed his oral boards, let alone a psych exam. Together they dismantle a strong and faithful family while being blissfully unaware of their consequences.If a movie's purpose is to evoke strong emotion, this movie does it, but for all the wrong reasons. It seems to be another case of western 'civilization' clashing with 'other' beliefs. Hopefully such 'Amero-centric' thinking will finally meet its extinction when folks realize that there are no good guys vs. bad guys.

Everyone in the film fit the characters in the book, except maybe the cop. I had him pictured as more Hispanic or maybe Portuguese or Italian, for some reason.

The cop is a self-absorbed jerk who leaves his family (as his own father had) for Ms. Sad Sack, and ends up in a very tight jamb.Guess who skips out at the end of this epic, comfortably above the fray?

Your heart pours out for the woman when she looses the house her father spent 35 years paying for due to a tax error; it's amazing that she goes from being a homeowner to homeless in one week.

By the time the film reaches any sort of climax one is so thoroughly fed up with everyone on screen that it hardly seems worth finishing. As if sensing its own foulness, the film attempts to recapture the audience with a shocking and tragic ending; the impulse is wrong and, worse, transparent. Having not read the book, I don't know if it's fair to put all of the blame on the shoulders of the filmmakers, but this is one movie that should definitely be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!

The movie totally missed the mark--"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOUSE OF DREAD","review":"Dependent on the unlikely actions of several characters, \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" is a heavy-handed, utterly earnest excersize in contemporary tragedy. I understand that Jennifer Connely's character is supposed to be an average American whose life history remains obscure but her reason for being involved in a legal dispute over the ownership of a modest home is so unlikely it is rendered shallow. The cop who befriends Connely and slowly becomes psychotic due to a racist mentality is only a device to turn the lame story toward it's melodramatic resolution. It's certainly a watchable movie, even involving, Connely and Ben Kingsly as the compatriot in this legal dispute are excellent, but the platform plot too often sinks in the sand and gets lost in the fog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Amazing acting by Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly.

A movie any actor would love to be in, any actor who wants to be \\"taken seriously,\\" and that's the only reason why I think Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley would do a film like this - as advertisement of their skills to others who can make better movies. Because this is a mess of a film, badly written, horribly plotted, and depressing for the sake of being depressing. It's as if the writer didn't have a clue how to end his story, so he just threw in a bunch of dead-end tragic events as a cheap (but seemingly \\"deep\\") way to wrap these characters up. Depressing stories don't always equal depth. Not to say the film doesn't look good.

He is the only thing worth watching in this movie.The message is horrible....the story is horrible....Why are we as a nation obsessed with the horror stories of life. How about if they just went to the county and discussed the mistake and got it righted and everyone was happy and Connelly learned to open mail.All's well that ends well.this did not start well....it did not end well. i never see much point in perpetuating the horrors of stupid people.Wake up folks.....this is not Oscar worthy. its not even rental worthy unless you like depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"chilling and extremely sad","review":"I liked this movie.

As far as the story goes, it didn't get interesting until the last 20 minutes of the film. Gee lets see how many lives this chick can destroy over 500 bucks.

Not because it had a deep meaning, but because there was so much potential to tell this story and they chose to make stereotypical nonsense the order of the day. A cop that \\"saves the damsel\\", misuses his authority, gets in trouble for being so stupid and the poor lass that just can't pay the house payment.The cop's actions in this movie had me so frustrated that it made the whole rest of the movie just a collection of unbelievable gibberish. Sad waste of money and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was WRITTEN in a fog...","review":"I give this ramshackle, disjointed movie two stars only because some of the acting was fairly good. But the story line is full of stupid scenes that would never have happened in real life, and it uses violence at the end, in order to try to prove itself.In general I think this kind of over-hyped (and under-written) movie is now all too typical of American movie making, and it's actually very sad.

Unfortunately I think he failed here.Started out great as a character study of people's lives unraveling but after the characters start doing really dumb things just for the sake of moving the storyline along, well, it lost me and the people watching it as well.I had no sympathy for the consequences of the character's irresponsibility and stupidity.It wasnt touching and it wasnt moving, it was an eye roller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted house","review":"Beautiful and almost unbearable, \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" rises on the strengths of Ben Kingsley's and Shohreh Aghdashloo's performances as an exiled Iranian couple. The DVD, due March 30, ably conveys the visual evocation of claustrophobia and dread against which the actors perform their magic. The Dolby Digital audio is just good enough, based on a test disc. Best supporting feature: Aghdashloo's audition tape, which indicates her performance arrived fully formed. The tape covers her key scenes in a wrenching 6 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Great drama.

An endingsure to shock.Thanks and enjoy,Tom"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than just disturbing","review":"I just watched this movie today on DVD and it left me feeling quite stunned. I really didn't know what to expect when my Sister-In-Law told me a few days before that she was so depressed after watching this and couldn't get it out of her mind! Well, all I can say is that yes, it was pretty disturbing, however it was worth watching. I kept wondering just where this movie was taking me, until the \\"ending\\", where after the credits ran, I just sat there in total disbelief. This isn't the type of movie to entertain you, but however it has a lot to say about how people interact with each other, and how you watch everything fall apart for each one. Be forewarned to not watch this movie if you are in a good mood, or want to be entertained!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This movie is powerful, I have no other words for it, you must go and see it, It will surprise you, you will think that one person is bad, then you will continue seeing the movie and say that the other character is the bad one and yet you will still be perplexed at thinking that maybe its the other character! And what a powerful ending, it is a must see, you will be talking about it days after you have seen it, but this is just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"How small mistakes can ruin whole lives","review":"House of Sand and Fog is a wonderful movie, the cinematogrophy is beautiful especially with the fog rolling over the hills. Ben Kingsley gives a stunning portrayel of a disgraced Iranian Col. trying to acheive the American Dream. Jennifer Connely gives a great performance of a recovering alcoholic who loses her house due to a deadbeat husband. The only complaint I had about the movie was there was a small difference in the ending compared to the book. I think if they had added this it would have given the movie more depth than it already has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible","review":"I would not recommend this book to most dog owners. I was immediately turned off by it from the first page:\\"Most Stafford owners are quick to answer no [to the question 'Is that a Pit Bull?'], and then take the time to say the name of the breed over and over, slowly and carefully, to make sure there is no misunderstanding. They may go on to try to explain what a Pit Bull actually is: 'bigger,' 'longer legs,' 'cropped ears,' 'vicious,' 'trained to fight.'\\"In my opinion it's terribly irresponsible that she would defend the Stafford whilst demonizing the Pit Bull.Also, pictured on the back cover of the book is an American Staffordshire Bull Terrier, not a Staffordshire Bull Terrier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt Dillion's first movie","review":"This was a very cute movie.

It has at it's core a true story of urban planning gone wrong. Parents who long to make a better life for themselves and their kids in a planned surburban community end up turing their kids into the very influence they hoped to escape. Although some of the acting is spotty in places(most of the cast were REAL kids), the overall impact carries it through. Basically, it works! It worked for me when I first saw it on HBO in '81(I guess) and it still resonates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"Cheesy?\\"","review":"I grew up in the suburbs not to long ago and can somewhat relate to the general message of this film. I do remember well the utter boredom that my friends and I would have to endure day after day which eventually led us to create our own adolecent problems: using/dealing drugs, vandalism, fights, etc. But the main problems with this film lie primarily with the writing and the atrocious acting. Because of this, this film, with its preachy and stupid message, comes off more as a silly, dated film than anything that we can learn from. Oh well, if nothing else, it was entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Hoovers","review":"Worst movie I've ever seen. Performances were amateurish and boring. No plot. Dated. Dated.

I've seen it maybe 100 times but never once all the way through. The comparison to say Dazed and Confused is apt, though this movie takes itself serious and is of its time, not nostalgia.

Chew does detail the war very well and some of the writing is interesting. However, the writing is very, very dry and it took much time to plod through this book. I have no problem with the accuracy or detail of the book, but this is dry reading. Since this book was written in the late sixties/early seventies, much material from the Soviet side is also lacking in this book. If the reader is looking for what Finnish or Soviet units fought in what battle or part of the front, this is a great read. For those who just want the details of the war, perhaps Frozen Hell is a better(and more modern) book.This is one of the first books about this war in English so I give credit to the author. Presently, there are better books out there on this war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very detailed history of Winter War.","review":"Chew 's book is a very detailed histroy of the WInter War between Finland and Russia.

It was tall enough and spacious enough to allow for a three-man tent pitched inside of it, along with room to eat and dress.The only feature it lacks are walls- the mesh is very nice, and provided a little bit of shade and kept the dust down slightly. But it would have been handy to have removable, opaque walls to provide more shade, privacy, and wind protection. That's the only reasons this gets 4 stars instead of 5. We ended up sewing bed sheets into the walls of ours, and rolled them up when we didn't need themOverall a great purchase and a great shade tent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD STORIES -- BAD TRANSFERS","review":"I love Sherlock Holmes stories and movie adaptations. This collection includes a nice cross section of fine stories, but the transfers are not restored (and probably taken from public domain copies of copies in some cases). However, the low quality, grainy, vintage-looking transfers do give the videos an added element of old England's atmospheric ambience.

The lake monster is bland & forgettable at best. It's like a very long bad episode:too long for it's own good. It has a ton of stupid moments like dressing the lake monster as a girl. How can anyone not see that the girl is really the lake monster? It also has weird plot points. The only likeable cast member in the whole film is the Robot Nanny.

It tried to be too independant and unrealistic as far as plots go. Then, they decided to kill Doug off once and for all. How? They made a movie.

It came with a sticker on it reading \\"Made in Chine.\\" I thought this was a joke but after a little research, found that Chine is in fact not a typo. Now I sort of regret peeling the sticker off because I thought of a great joke for it while doing tricks. Back to the box. What can I say, the box is really great for the price. I got ten bucks back when I ordered two items thanks to a promotion with the company. So this box and a deck of Svengali cards was only a few bucks.(So look closely for special offers if you order on Amazon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"came broken","review":"this item came broken and because its so cheap to begin with i didnt even waste my time ordering a new one"},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good","review":"This did not come with instructions - just a wood box in a cardboard shipping box.

Please Jane, go back to the jazz!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Monheit excels again","review":"Admittingly, we are big Monheit fans and her latest album doesn't disappoint. We simply love most everything she does and she has become as consistently good as another of our favorites: Janis Siegel. The album was so good that I bought extra copies to give to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland and vacuous","review":"This is easy listening muzac, pure and simple - more at home in a dentists surgery or an elevator. The voice is wonderful, but where's the spark and the passion? It feels like the lights are on, but nobodys home. Jazz? No way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane's weakest record so far","review":"I've been a huge fan of Jane since her first release, and was unfortunately quite disappointed by this album.True, her voice is in wonderful form (when is it not?) but the weakness of this album lies mostly in the arrangements, which seem highly over-produced, sappy, and bland.I get what she was going for here, perhaps a more lush and luxurious sound than the jazz combos of most of her previous recordings. But where as Diana Krall did this sort of thing very successfully with the interesting, haunting arrangements on her \\"Look of Love\\" CD a few years back, Jane's effort comes across as elevator music to my ears. The paint-by-number orchestrations and syrupy production values don't help, either.I'd like to hear the results if she were paired with more adventuresome arrangers and orchestrators. But \\"Surrender\\" just doesn't serve Jane's artistry the way it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Everything","review":"Jane Monheit sings with angelic quality to the point the listener is moved and changed by the sound. Her voice control of each note is so pure, it emphasizes the extent of skill of her extraordinary talent. It is the voice and note control that amazes the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monheit rarely disappoints in her \\"Surrender\\"","review":"After just seeing Ms Monheit at the Catalina Jazz Bar & Grill just before New Years Eve, I was flabbergasted at how amazing her voice sounds in person versus record plus she has an automatic rapport with her audience. Thus I decided to check this album out and was rarely disappointed except I wish they would've had an english translation of the Brazilian lyrics that Jane sang so beautifully. Also though I prefer the original Brasil '66 version of Sergio Mendes \\"So Many Stars\\" with Lani Hall, Monheit's version again with Sergio on piano comes a close second. If you're undecided about Jane, do check this one out and I absolutely adore her version of Mancini & Mercer's \\"Moon River\\" (my favorite track)--from the way she sings this beautiful tune, she must have seen \\"Breakfast At Tiffany\\" a thousand times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane moonlight","review":"I first heard Jane's voice on a local light Jazz station and added her to my \\"wish list\\", then purchased her CD \\"Taking a Chance on Love\\". As a lover of Samba and Bossa Nova and long time fan of Elise Regina it was a no brainer to follow that one up with \\"Surrender\\" when I saw that she sang Brazilian style music. I was not dissappointed in the cd, for me there was not a bad track on it. As a long time Sergio Mendez fan \\"So Many Stars\\" quickly became one of my favorite tracks, I hadn't really appreciated the depth of that song's lyrics until I heard Jane sing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting Thriller","review":"I just received my copy of this movie today and I am very impressed. This movie came out years before my time but it was still very engrossing and chilling. The beginning is very mysterious and keeps u thinking... The middle of the film is the best IMO. It gets you into the characters, and unlike other horror/suspense films it lets you know the killer... It's very mysterious and the 70's city atmosphere and where anything can happen adds to the mystery. The ending is very cool, and while not as chilling as other horror films, it's shocking and at points scary... I don't consider this film a classic horror film like \\"Dawn Of The Dead, \\"Texas Chainsaw Masacre\\" or \\"The Exorcist\\" but unlike it's peers, it gives a level of suspense that the other films lack. The others lead right into the carnage and horror while this film takes u on a journey thru the life of the \\"killer\\" and is very satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better when I was younger","review":"This movie was better when I was younger.

This one scares in the good-old-fashioned way, but putting the heroine in peril and leaving our own imaginations to work even as we watch.....Have you checked the children today????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the babysitter see this","review":"The recent remake of this film should not discourage you from seeing the original.

The middle is extremely boring. The beginning has Carol Kane as a babysitter receiving strange phone calls. The middle focuses on the caller now loose and running around the city with a bit of memory loss. The ending has the confrontation which was pretty descent. It would have been better if there would have been a bit more cat-mouse chase in it. The PI looking for the caller didn't do much for me...he seemed more awkward than needed. I actually enjoyed the remake much better. Also, aside from some trailers there isn't anything extra on the dvd which is somewhat disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrilling!!!","review":"this movie scared the **** out of me when i was a kid.. its good to know that a movie with mustly talking can be this effective and still to this day.not that much action really if at all any if you want to say that its more of a mental thriller with a great ending. i just heard they are doing a remake and i feel like that shouldnt mess with a classic.i love this one and im pretty sure i'll hate the remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good!","review":"The only thing that is good about this movie is the first ten minutes and the last ten minutes.

This is then followed by an incredibly boring hour-long section where a detective searches for the escaped killer. And the killer could at least be scary looking-- he's more like a sissy. The ending was pretty good at least. I would not recommend anyone wasting their money on this movie. What a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hang Up!!!","review":"The most surprising thing about \\"When A Stranger Calls\\" is the \\"R\\" rating it was tagged with. I suppose there's a certain intensity here but I would have given it a \\"PG\\" since \\"PG-13\\" didn't exist in 1979. To it's credit it's not a slasher flick in the least. It seemed to me that the makers were paying homage to Hitchcock without the Master's sense of suspense. This flick is just predictable and boring and utterly forgettable. What's most criminal is the top shelf actors who somehow felt compelled to appear in this dreary exercise. Even more amazing is this flick spawned a sequel and a remake!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you fear for your child?","review":"When asked by a friend if they should watch this film, I immediately replied \\"No. It's really bad. The first 18 minutes are scary, and the last 18 minutes are scary. Everything in the middle is a trainwreck.\\" If you MUST see this film, take my word for it, after the first 18 minutes, fast forward to the last 18 minutes. What your left with is 40 minutes of great suspense. Carol Kane is about the only thing going for this turkey. The only other scary part is the three sizes too small mustard yellow polo shirt Charles Durning wears through the middle of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDIOTS...

The rest was really boring. Don't get me wrong, i don't mind a slow paced movie which were prominent in the 1970's and 1980's but this movie was so dreadful. This movie isn't origianl in terms of the horror subgenre of a slasher/killer calls by phone type of movie. Black Christmas 1974 was the original slasher flick/killer calls by phone type of movie. When a Stranger Calls flat out copied the scene from Black Christmas. In Black Christmas 1974, A sorority sister gets a really creepy and scary calls in the house.

The first 22 minutes of the movie was the most scariest when I was little and has stuck with me to this day. I am not going to go into detail about the movie, but it is great in the beginning, slow moving in the middle, and excellent in the end.I also purchased the sequel with this one and has an excellent ending as well with our two original star characters.Not at all gory, but the other elements like suspense and thrills make up for it. Check out the sequel. Both are a worthy purchases on Amazon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When a Stranger Calls","review":"I read all the reviews of this film, on this site, before actually buying it, so I knew what to expect, and most of the time, when to expect it! As every other reviewer says, the first 20 minutes are exceptional, and the last 20 minutes not too far behind. The problem is the bit in the middle, which provides neither direction, nor suspense. I'm not saying this film should have been full of murder from start to finish, but it lacks that little something that I don't think I've seen anywhere other than Black Christmas which, for me anyway, is the \\"daddy\\" of all \\"he's in the house\\" films. This is in my top ten scary movies, and is worth buying for the 40 minutes referred to alone.

Whatever...they are still awesome shoes for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm actually kind of surprised by all the positive reviews that Kill Theory has garnered. This was one of the main attractions for me when first checking out this year's After Dark Horrorfest lineup, and the end result is basically a cross between Saw and slasher conventions. A group of college grads (among them horror vet hottie Agnes Bruckner and Sons of Anarchy's Theo Rossi) become the targets of a killer (Kevin Gage) who proceeds to turn them all against each other in an effort to survive until just one is left standing. In between all that is some atrocious acting and average makeup effects, but what saves Kill Theory from being complete horror rubbish are the decent amount of twists towards the end of the film. Those alone make Kill Theory worth a look, but all in all, you're not really missing much here."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAW re-written with college kids trapped in a vacation house.","review":"This movie was clunky and an obvious rip off but it was pretty fun to watch and laugh at. The plot is a little ridiculous and far fetched and riddled with holes. The movie doesn't really elaborate too much on how the killer is aware of the movement of 8 people at all times. The only contact he has with them is through a walkie talkie and I don't believe for a second that every escape route was booby trapped and monitored. The characters could have loaded up supplies and escaped but instead they just stand around yelling at each other or just don't care. The whole thing was really illogical but I guess it's fun if you ever wondered what Saw would have been like if it was made to be just another horror trope flick with a sadistic killer. Just seems like it was made really quick with no real thought put into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO","review":"A talented cast, coherent if derivative script and some moral dilemmas elevate KILL THEORY to the best Horrorfest IV entry I've seen so far (have 2 more to catch). This slasher throws 8 people together and a killer who plans to kill them all unless they kill each other. There are some tense moments and good performances especially from Agnes Bruckner and Patrick Fleugel. A nice twist at the end too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Theory","review":"No reason this movie was made. It is not well written and Kevin Gage is in it for less than a minute?

I've only had them about a week, but here are my thoughts:- A bit on the flimsy side. My kids are young (<6 years), so they will be fine. I can see these being too flimsy for older kids though.- Stakes are useless. My backyard has some rocky soil. Almost all of the stakes bent when I tried securing the nets. And the ones that didn't bend didn't stay in the ground long.- Easy to put together. I had both of them together in under an hour.- Velcro net attachments. These made assembly pretty easy, but we'll see how they hold up.Overall, I would recommend these for young kids in the backyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coaching Football's 50 Defense","review":"This book is only usefull to coaches who want the bare fundamentals (stance, alignment, read keys).

Father Hill's voice is very soothing. The chant is musically different from traditional Orthodox chant from Greece or the Middle East, which is very , but very typical of the chant in English-speaking Orthodox churches in North America. Hill lacks the ornate performance style of Eastern canters, but his voice is full of reverence and compassion. I would recommend this for non-Orthodox people too, it's a beautiful ancient perspective on death and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, soothing, and moving...","review":"What else can I say? There are some passages reminiscent of Bach, but I think Novus Magnificat stands on its own, without the need for comparisons with earlier compositions, unless it is to give a new listener an idea of what it sounds like from examples. Arpeggios abound here, as well as soaring lines that take off like an eagle winging through the space lanes. I cannot, however, compare Ms. Demby's music to the grand moments in Mahler, except for the sheer beauty of it. Mahler's climaxes have a power not even approached here, but why worry about that? Novus Magnificat shimmers with iridescent gorgeousness. It's a feast for the ears. Put it on and let your soul sail through the vastnesses of space and time. I find it soothing without being syrupy and cloying... restful, with glimpses of Heaven. And powerful, without the bombast associated with so many composers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as pictured!","review":"Great product, just as pictured and described.

I can only assume that Cheung was not subject to the kind of befuddling, unprofessional and inefficient conditions of the sets for the movie-within-the-movie, while she was making IRMA VEP. So there is some hope for the French cinema, no? I suppose many American critics would want to watch French filmmakers obtusely navel-gazing on why they cannot make great films any more. (Assuming that they used to make great films, even during the nouvelle vague) Me, I'll take the 12th run of HEROIC TRIO anytime. A work of art? A charming comedy? Mon derriere!Ah and yes, Fox Lorber did the usual slum job with DVD transfer, mucho compression noise, especially in close-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quelque chose de different","review":"The French do self-reflexive cinema better than we do. This tale of a has-been director attempting a comeback with a re-make of a silent French serial (and using a non-French speaking real-life Maggie Cheung in the title role) is the ultimate exercise in cinematic intertextuality. But it's also a lot ofe fun and not--as one of the film's own characters grouses about the state of French cinema--just intellectual navel gazing. Not for everyone, of course, but for lovers of cinematic irony, it's hard to think of a more delightful feelm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie for the latex rubber enthusiast","review":"Irma Vep is a bizarre story about a young Chinese actress who plays the title character in a remake of the 1915 silent French film Les Vampires. It later becomes obvious that Irma (starring Maggie Cheung) accepted the role because of her innermost desires and fetishes. In fact, most of the female roles are portrayed as either bi-sexual or lesbian. Although there is only brief nudity and no sex in this film, it still has a very erotic theme The movie has absolutely no decent ending; typical of French films, but I still recommend this for those with a flair for this fetish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming French cinema...& lovely Maggie Cheung","review":"I will state that I have never been a fan of self-reflective French films. Some French films are so self-aggrandizing. However, I did find \\"Irma Vep\\" to be a charming piece of work. I'll try not to be biased since I am a huge fan of Maggie Cheung. Maggie gives what else?...another delightful performance. Fans of her HK films will probably enjoy seeing Maggie in the flesh acting like a normal person. She looks radiant with very little makeup and dressed down in jeans. It is a good look behind the scenes and the squabbling on a movie set. I was unsure if this was supposed to be a satire since French cinema is not my forte."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled by the cool cover picture...","review":"This has to be one of the most disappointing movies of the 90's. Sounds like a great concept, the fabulous Maggie Cheung in a French art movie, but no, this is just [wrong]. In general, I enjoy art movies and I do like Maggie Cheung. She is an excellent actress and this movie's saving grace but unfortunately she's not enough to make it worthwhile viewing. The plot drags on to no convincing purpose, with weak and unconvincing characters save for Cheung herself. The final result is totally uninvolving and just tedious. There seems to be an attempt to make some kind of deconstructivist, self-referential movie here, but intellectual goals seem to have overridden any intention to make an enjoyable movie. It certainly doesn't even stand up to comparison with the movies of someone like Wong Kar Wai which are both innovative and poetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-criticism of the moviemaking world","review":"It seems that director Assayas's lack of skills for storytelling made him try to disguise Irma Vep with some elements of interest (the remake of \\"Les Vampires\\"; casting Maggie Cheung playing herself; trying to show the making of a movie, etc..) just to hide he had nothing to say with this film. There is no progression or development of characters or ideas on this screenplay, contributing only to increase the lose of interest as the film goes by. Everything that is said by different characters criticizing American film industry and French intelectual movies just sounds superficial when the movie you are watching cannot stand on itself because of its own technical and artistical mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phooey!","review":"I don't understand all the reviews praising this film.

The only part of this movie that grabbed my attention is when a Gen X French movie critic, hip and au courant, interviews Maggie Cheug in-situ and tells her all about the \\"revolting\\" habit of the French government to allow and promote financially the productions of boring intellectual movies nobody is interested in paying to see, Arnold Schwartznegger flicks being the favorite diet of this hip pseudo-critic.....Forgive me: this must be the ultimate comical note in the whole movie Irma Vep: for is not French Governement Money that I see behind the production of this painfully unfunny movie about-nothing-and-even-less?

I think she should have had other people help out with Star until he found someone else he loved, (maybe Ashleigh, his dam's owner?). After all, in books 24-33, Christina thought Sterling was the world's best horse and loved her more than anything!! Think of how poor Sterling must have felt, one day a treasured pet, the next totally ignored by Christina,(who she thinks the world of) and sent off to live in a whole new stable where Christina hardly even visits! Get a life, Christina! Horses are such loving, trusting, faithful, forgiving, willing creatures, (I speak from experiance having a horse of my own, Lucky, who I will never part with) so how can you just drop them for another horse after all they've done for you?

Chris and Melanie were twelve for 12 books and now suddenly she'd shot to sixteen in just three books? That's not right.

There are so many typos and spelling mistakes, it's becoming a bit tiresome. I mean, really! I'm not spending money on a disjointed, incomplete book with little originality in its plot. Not even if it's about horses. All you authors, take advice from Bonnie Byrant!

I mean in all the other books Sterling was her dream horse that she had saved and loved and had big hopes for and an incredible bond with, how could she sell her? I guess racing overpowered her so much that she lost total interest in the things and horses she used to love and Sterling would be happerier this way but it still seems kind of heartless. My all time fav horses in this series were Wonder, Wonder's Champion and Glory.

The weeks and years are flying by too fast, especially for books these short. Characters have disappered into nowhere, and details no longer seem to matter. The worst thing an author can do is leave loose ends, and there are so many loose ends in this series you could wrap them three times around the earth. And, as I said, these books are bland and unbelievable. I give the author props for having Star loose his first race, but Melanie should have ridden Star, not Chris. Plus, because of lack of character development, there doesn't seem ot be any bond at all between Star and Christina. In my mind I see Star as a slacker, not a horse missing his favorite rider. No detail, no elaboration, too many loose ends. Why I still read these books, I don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't stand Christina!","review":"Christina risked being hurt by Sterling's abusive owner to save Sterling.

Now she throws Sterling away like a wadded-up tissue? Why? She's such a flimsy character in this book. Nobody ever makes a complete turnaround to something they dislike (in Chris's case, racing).

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"lavendar blanket","review":"I ordered this item for my daughter who was leaving to go to a new college away from home.

Heats in two minutes in the microwave and the heat lasts a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and Attractive","review":"This is terrific and works precisely as advertised. It is relatively thin as these things go so it doesn't stay warm as long as some of the smaller alternatives. Works best if you put a blanket over it. A microwave with carousel is required if you don't want to ruin it. The \\"stuffing\\" stays put. The key advantage and reason to go with this is its coverage area and the flexibility to fold it over to cover a smaller area and stay warm longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This is a wonderful product.

But if you are really interesting in actually learning something, by all means, read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"While I respect the author as a pagan, her grasp of ancient history is sorely lacking. Her historical and philological arguments are tenuous in the extreme, and completely fail any test of scholarship. Some books of speculative history I find thought-provoking: this was not one of them. Clearly the book was not even edited -- some of her later chapters contradict statements in earlier chapters (I understand that this is typical of Llewellyn Press).

Great performances by both the Fishbone members and their 'special guests'. Everything sounds SO FRESH and NEW! If they had released this CD during the big 'ska' craze of 1995/96, perhaps they would have gotten into the mainstream along with the bands they influenced (No Doubt, Sublime, etc.).

First providing the reader with an engaging introduction on the origins and essentials of prose poetry, Lehman proceeds to include a good basic range of authors. Gertrude Stein has a particularly impressive contribution, as do several others. This is a thought-provoking and highly recommended read for anyone interested in learning about the basics of prose poetry -- my only real annoyance was the absence of Leonard Cohen: while he is not American, he is Canadian, like several others featured in Lehman's collection, and (as an example) his work 'How to Speak Poetry' is utterly classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puttin on the Hits","review":"This is a great book, an American book, a prose book full of poems, a poetry book full of prose, an American book you can take to Paris, a book with a cover like none you've ever seen, a collage you can take to college.

Project 86 has a nice heavy sound with guitars that have a satisfying crunch. The singer has a unique voice and delivery and rides a middle ground between singing and rapping. To their credit, the band has the restraint and confidence to infuse their songs with a full dyanmic range (volume and tempo) which makes for interesting listening.

THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST TALENTED BANDS OUT THERE. THE VOCALS ARE ALSO REALLY DEEP AND THE PRODUCTION ON THIS WHOLE CD IS REALLY TIGHT. THE BEST SONGS ARE STEIN'S THEME, SET ME UP, AND ME AGAINST ME. AS FOR THE REST OF THE CD, IT IS ALSO PRETTY GOOD. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE SONG ONE ARMED MAN WAS EVEN BETTER ON THE NEW TOOTH AND NAIL COMPILATION-CHEAPSKATES HARDER EDGE. ON THAT CD ONE ARMED MAN HAD MORE POWER AND MORE OVERALL SOUND. THAT'S ONLY A MINOR PROBLEM THOUGH. THIS CD WOULD BE GOOD FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE PAX 217, AND P.O.D.

Project 86 has a very distinct type of music, a mix of Limp Bizkit and Korn, but they are all christians. Drawing Black Lines is an improvement over their self-titled debut, but both of them are excelent. Buy them both if you want some serious hardcore (not rapcore) without all the cussing and negitive refrences."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible band","review":"A great major-label debut by an incredible band. The music is heavy and has a kind of hardcore flavor to it dominated by great bass, memorable riffs and original sound structure. They incorporate their own style and one can easily recognize Project 86 from other bands. The vocals are great featuring a half-rap/half-singing style by the frontman whose dark and edgy voice are accentuated by the band's music. Overall, I would describe them as a mix between Staind and the Deftones with some rap-metal influence. Standout tracks include \\"Stein's Theme\\", \\"One-Armed Man (Play On)\\", \\"Me Against Me\\", \\"Chimes\\", and \\"Sad Machines\\", although the entire cd is great.

Its totally amazing how much better they sound. Take an awsome voice put it with some hard music that is very lightly similar to korn in some areas(i am not endorsing korn in any way) And you have project 86. One of there best songs is set me up and steins theme. Steins theme is about how people are annoyed by chistians but the religion keeps growing,and set me up is about cliques and how people are rejected.

(They are nowhere near as bright in color as the photo of the product would indicate.) I never did identify the purple ones... Also, these marbles are smaller than normal marbles, and the holes on the board are very closely spaced.

I'm returning this set and looking for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice box","review":"Thats all what is good about this product is the beautiful box. The marbles are sooooo light I could not tell which color is which, only the red and green can you tell, the others you have to hold up to the light and there is no purple marbles to go on the purple section. So I had to buy new darker marbles. But the box is pretty thats why it says premium wood box. Thats all that was premium.

From beginning to end, just totally creepy. It's like a beautiful nightmare. The main character in the movie, Jane Doe, is played by Cheryl Lawson, and I think she does an excellent job of overdramatic, but not bad, acting. Especially when she freaks out or is being hypnotized by the doctor. Not a whole lot of gore, but a lot of really cool looking zombies out for brains. Basically, a hopelessly zoned out woman is stalked by an undead doctor at a mental institution. Very creeped out music. I like this movie.

I watched this on cable just to see if Renee Zellweger really took part in a movie as bad as this looked, and she did and it was. No update, no twise, just a pastiche of bad movies.

I love old movies and prefer them greatly to newer ones. However, this one attracted my attention with the amazing wardrobe and the setting of a 1960's romance. Unfortunately, the story line was ridiculous. The film used every opportunity to be distasteful and provacative. The attempt at humor was lost on me, I am afraid. I will stick with the original romantic comedies. One positive notation: the fashion did not disappoint.

The sex jokes are un-funny and tasteless, and the whole thing is stylized to the point of lunacy and so camp I didn't believe in the \\"reality\\" of the characters for a moment.

From the moment this film was announced a couple of years ago I was thrilled that someone would attempt to recreate the feel of the glorious 50's CinemaScope productions. Even the opening credits feature the classic 'Scope logo! The opening music credits were spot on. This should be a great time, I thought. Well, THAT JUST WASN'T THE CASE. This is a DISASTER and a SLAP IN THE FACE to anyone who was conned into thinking this would have the charm of the past. I do NOT fault Renee or Ewan. I believe that with a competent director, this really could have been screen magic, but no. Instead, we're treated to a MOCKERY of the genre.

But Renee, this is not the phone book. And I think you know that. Why, Renee? WHY? WHY? WHY??!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down With Forced Campy Acting","review":"Great costumes and art direction. Horrible acting that seemed forced, fake, and trying much too hard to be campy. In one word: terrible. Zellweger and McGregor are both strong actors BUT someone steered them in the wrong direction for this film. Here lies the problem: campy performances cannot be calculated. They just happen. I don't remember Doris or Rock's acting ever being this down right bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk!!!","review":"I'm so glad the late 50's and early 60's I grew up in are a thing of the past. The light romantic comedy of that era is pretty pathetic compared to the modern genre, represented by such hits as Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail. This movie was just plain stupid. Renee Zellweger was terribly miscast in the lead role, unlike in Bridget Jones' Diary, which was just perfect for her. Some silly actress like Kate Hudson would have been more appropriate for this role."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best frickin movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is the absolute coolest movie ever.

However, there's more to like than him. McGregor and Zellweger are terrific as well and display perfect comic timing in their scenes together. There's definitely no shortage of laughs here.Reasons not to see this movie: Plot twists at the end of the movie are utterly ridiculous - but why get bogged down in something like that in a fluff movie like this.Overall: A fantastic light comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this Flick!","review":"If you've seen the Doris Day / Rock Hudson movies then you will probably really enjoy this movie.The movie was fast paced and funny. The sets and clothing were real eye candy.Make sure you see the widescreen version."},{"rating":"1","title":"entirely forgettable","review":"This piece of fluff was so forgettable that my wife and I were about half an hour into it before we realized we'd actually seen it before.I'm giving it two stars because there were a couple of moments of witty, well-written dialogue, because the retro-early sixties fashions were mildly amusing and because David Hyde Pierce gives a funny performance. I also liked the faux-Gershwin music.Apart from that, not much to object to or admire either. The leads don't have much chemistry and McGregor especially seems very out of his element like a callow, immature version of Sean Connery.This is apparently an \\"omage\\" to the Rock Hudson-Doris Day movies of the early sixties. Those weren't much good either so it's not surprising that this attempt to reproduce them also fails to make much of an impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"I love this movie! The visuals alone are amazing. It's all so bright colored & beautiful! The costumes & the sets are to die for. The cast was perfect for these roles. Rene is enchanting as Barbara Novak, the feminist author who insist that women don't need love, but she finds herself falling for Catcher Block, a playboy journalist who wants to expose her. It's such a cute movie, I made it part of my DVD collection along with my Marilyn Monroe flicks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with this MOVIE!!!","review":"Just a horrible, horrible film. The film is a spoof on 60's Doris Day/Rock Hudson formula romantic comedies, but rather than being a tribute to the genre, this film butchers it. Renee Zellweger does what she can with the script, as do a very talented supporting cast, but what the script writers didn't cripple, Ewan McGregor finishes off with a poor performance. Most of the comedy is either crude or simply hackneyed - the split-screen implied sexual acts is the culminating dagger in the heart. The Wife and I agreed - one of the worst films we've seen in awhile. No wonder you never heard about this thing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was there a need to make this movie?","review":"I did not know what this movie was about and just happened to watch it on HBO. As soon as I saw Renee in the opening scene, I thought she looked like a Doris Day wanna be. I watched and enjoyed all the Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies and thought they \\"worked\\" for their era. However, I cannot say that Down with Love was cute at all. It was really kind of stupid. The over exaggerated body language made this movie even more difficult to watch. Doris and Rock were cute and enjoyable. This knock off movie was a waste of money and an even bigger waste of my time....LOUSY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Original, But Not Trying to Be","review":"Set in 1962, it is about Barbara Novak, a woman who wrote a book called Down With Love, teaching women not to love, but to think of sex the way a man does. Playboy columnist Catcher Block decides to write an expose that would ruin Barbara, and incidently liven up his sex life again. So he poses as Zip Martin, an astronaut from a small town.This movie borrows a lot from Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies (Pillow talk, Come Back Lover), but it is meant to.This is a cute movie, enjoyable to those who like that corny, classic 60s style."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think we've found an alternative to the Death Penalty.","review":"We can wipe out crime altogether if we were to show Ewan McGregor movies in the joint. Especially oneswhere he takes his shirt off.....FOUR times!OK, I thought this movie was cute...for about 5 minutes. I love Renee Zellweger, especially when her eyesare OPEN, and I think she pretty much duplicated Doris Day's walk, but she could never duplicate her presence.Maybe this film wouldnt have been such an irritant if I hadnt just watched Pillow Talk a few weeks ago,but it's pretty irritating nonetheless. The nonstop sexual innuendo and the split screen action was abysmal,and the fauxlatio was disgraceful. An \\"homage to the 50's\\"... I don't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure, Unadulterated Fun!","review":"This is one of the cutest chick flicks I've ever seen. Romantic comedy? Well, sort of. Our heroine, feminist writer Barbara Novak (Renee Zellweger) is out to change the world. How? By getting women to say \\"down with love,\\" and adopt a more male life style--complete with sex a la carte!Novak's plans are jepordized, however, when playboy journalist Catcher Block (Ewan McGreggor) is abadoned by his usual ladies. He is determined to stop Novak once and for all--using some very sneaky methods...As other reviewers have pointed out, this movie is certainly lacking in substance. But who cares? You wanted a comedy, right? What this movie does have, in delightful abundance, is that old theatre charm. The acting, the comedy, and the special effects are all WAY over the top. But hey, not every movie is meant to be some deep, insightful masterpiece. If you do look beneath the surface, however, you will find one very important lesson: people are not always what they appear to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes You Miss Rock and Doris","review":"On the plus side: The costumes and decor are just the right side of kitsch; it will make fans of the singer on the soundtrack, Michael Buble'; and David Hyde-Pierce shows why he's this generation's Tony Randall (and you can easily compare, since Tony has a cameo).Not so good: The writers couldn't decide if they were doing a remake or a send-up; not surprisingly, what used to pass as sly sexual innuendo is now simply vulgar; worst of all, the stars aren't up to the originals. Rene'e doesn't have anything like Bridget Jones to chew on here, and Ewen reminds us that Rock Hudson -- if he was no Cary Grant -- at least had the humorous heft to make this sort of thing credible and fun. Too bad. It was a bright idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Renee, Ewan, and David... who needs more?","review":"I abolutely loved this film. I have never seen a Doris Day/ Rock Hudson movie and didn't have to. I got the joke and would be very surprised if someone didn't get it. Renee and Ewan are two of the most talented people in Hollywood and I was excited to see them together in a movie. Not only that, but they sang again too! What also impressed me was the extras on this DVD, they were just as funny and clever as the movie. David Hyde Pierce has too much spit? And is serious about it? Comic genious! Big blockbuster movies don't come with extras like these, and this was a box office dud. If you want some summer entertainment, check out this movie, and be sure to bring some Tang!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"\\"Down With Love\\" was a cool, breezy little film. I have to admit that I finally have a reason to love Renee Zellweger - this movie was tailor made for her. This is a real date movie for both sexes. Although the plot twist at the end was a little unbelievable, so what?? This is a comedy, not a documentary.Thoroughly enjoyable and romantic. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fastest, most fun 90 minutes I've had in a long time","review":"/Down With Love/ is, without doubt, a very silly movie. But it's fun, it moves at a good clip, and it is filled with cool characters. Renee is cute and stylish, Ewan's got his pseudo-suave demeanor, and David Hyde Pierce offers up an excellent supporting character (Niles as a beatnik? It's worth seeing the movie just for that). The genuinely surprising twist in the story combined with a number of 60s clichés makes for a really enjoyable experience overall. Oh and the music is very well done too, in my opinion.I think this movie was unfairly passed over in the theaters, which is a shame. It's a blast to watch, and it's really well done. /Down With Love/ is the most fun I've had in 90 minutes in a long time, and definitely one of the more well crafted movies of the last few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and witty comedy","review":"I recommend watching the original Doris Day and Rock Hudson \\"Pillow Talk\\" first, then watching \\"Down With Love.\\" They are both great fun. \\"Down With Love\\" has a more bawdy sense of humor that wasn't possible in an earlier era. The split-screen telephone conversation is a hoot. Too bad the film had poor marketing; many more people should have seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down With Love, A Real Pick Me Up","review":"This film is an adorable, funny, tongue in cheek recreation of the Doris Day/Rock Hudson/Tony Randall films of the early sixties, complete with pastels, marvelous costumes, great music, and an introduction (for those under 50), to the seemingly benign manner in which women't rights, and desires to be taken seriously, in and out of the workplace, were being introduced to the culture at large. Like Katherine Hepburn's comedies with Spencer Tracy, these films, dressed in the guise of humor, introduced us to women who wanted it all. This film captures the fun and playful sexuality of those films. In a day when films are so loaded with gratuitous sex and violence, this was a delightful and clever romp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No one should be forced to sit through this.","review":"I understand that this is supposed to be a satire, but even a successful satire should be entertaining. The only thing this movie succeeds in being is a World Class BORE!Renee Zellweger was cute enough in a part devoid of any character, but Ewan McGregor falls way short of the standards set by leading men like James Garner, Rock Hudson, and Rod Taylor. Instead of watching this movie, spend a night mastering your Epi-lady instead. I promise you you'll have more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"I thought this movie was rather cute. It was a cool take on the old 60's romcoms (especially the ones with Dorris Day and Rock Hudson). All in all, cute movie, a few innuendos here and there, but adorable anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"THUMBS UP for DOWN!!","review":"Had no idea this format could translate well for contemporary entertainment and was shocked at how much fun this plot provided. Ewan in tux just shined and loved the zany but unpredictable twists and film premise. NEVER enjoyed the Doris/Rock films, and expected plodding inuendos and 1-DIM characters. I Was hoping for more Ewan vocals but had to wait for the credits for this treat. Renee dresses beautifully for the period but several lighting situations were extremely unflattering, DP needed better feedback! For sheer entertainment plus I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"It's pretty much your typical romantic comedy, but depending on your movie taste, you might enjoy that. In the credits, Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor sing a song together. The video for the song is included in the DVD. It's one of my favorite parts of the movie. The movie has some dirty parts, and they're hilarious. Overall, it's a really cute movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!","review":"The film is just excellently done, all aspects of the film! The chemistry of the 4 main characters are great. The Casting was just perfect. How I wish there would be a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down with \\"Down with Love\\"","review":"The people who did Down with Love's music, sets, and costumes deserve an Oscar. The actors, directors, producers, and screenwriters deserve to be shot. This movie has absolutely no charm, and works 'way too hard to achieve silly, vulgar one-liners. If you want to see Renee Zellwegger in something worth watching, try Chicago, or Bridget Jones' Diary. I can't figure out why Tony Randall would be in this, except for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Maybe this movie is supposed to be campy, and fluffy, and cheesy. And it is, but it is also terrible. It was completelyand totally unwatchable. I turned it off after a half an hour.Don't waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I had high hopes for the movie, I looked at all the reviews on Amazon's website...so I when I found it on sale at a local store I bought it. I watched the whole movie...to be brutally honest this had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen (one my worst movies list, it is now #1). Don't bother buying it...if you really MUST see this movie rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"Doris Day and Rock Hudson movies were no good the first time, with their split screen phone conversations and crossed wires. They never rose above a bad TV sitcom. So why would Hollywood producers do another one--not a spoof but a straight copy? Are there really no good new stripts available?Renee Zellweger is a good actress and has done some good light comedy, as in \\"Nurse Betty.\\" She's also done drama and musicals. Why she'd allow her talents to be wasted in a film like this is beyond me.I watched as much of it as I could, hoping it would amount to something. It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'd hoped for something witty, clever -- especially after the McGregor's performance in \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and Zellweger's in \\"Chicago.\\" But United Airlines was screening this film in-flight on my way home from a recent trip West -- and I'm glad someone else was footing the bill for both my flight and the screening. The first half was tolerable, but it quickly spiraled downhill -- both in terms of plot and performance. And would someone please quit typecasting David Hyde Pierce? The man has acting talent, and yet he's been stuck in Johnny-One-Note roles that mimic his romantically inept portrayal of Niles on \\"Frasier.\\" The most enjoyable part of this film? The in-character duet McGregor and Zellweger perform over the closing credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but unmemorable","review":"DOWN WITH LOVE has its moments, and hopefully David Hyde Pierce will not remain one of Hollywood's most underrated actors for much longer, but it left me wondering exactly what its point was. Much like FAR FROM HEAVEN, I kept waiting for the moment where this film would make its clever connection with/commentary on the present, but all I got were expertly-constructed retro sets and costume design. Maybe I'm being unfair in looking for something that the creators possibly never intended, or maybe the whole point of the film flew over my head, but with most of the Doris Day-Rock Hudson catalogue currently available on DVD, this movie feels unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down with this movie","review":"I really love this movie.

I have them staked in the yard and they do not move. I have had other goals (even higher priced ones) that are crap and fall apart. These goals are low priced and should be good for years. It is not often something this simple exceeds expectations so remarkably!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice melodic rock album from Harem Scarem guitarist!","review":"This is an album by Harem Scarem's guitarist Pete Lesperance featuring him on guitars and vocals. I guess it's almost like a solo album although it was written and performed with another Canadian musician who I am not familiar with. There's also some help from other Harem Scarem members too so I guess fans of this legendary melodic rock band will really be interested in it. This is a well-produced melodic rock record with solid songwriting as would be expected by these high calibre musicians. It's a little more commercial and modern than their previous work but fans will dig it. Some very catchy tunes and vocal melodies make this a great album but probably not essential unless you're a die-hard Harem Scarem fan like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"This doll doesn't meet any standards.

Most of these stories are mediocre at best. Some are written so horridly, I can't believe they actually got into a book titled \\"The Best\\". You'll find better erotica on AFF. net or Mediaminer (dig around, good fic exists). For free.More than half of these little tales, are angsty and depressing. Which is fine, if you're doing a \\"Best of Womens Angst\\" book. Erotica? Where??? Just because theres a minimum of one sex scene in each story, does not make it erotic. There's no seduction to the reader, no introspection, and hell, not even the smut scenes are that hot.I was incredibly disappointed with this book, I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"For me, nothing's worse than ending a story feeling down and depressed, and at least 80% of the stories had that effect on me.

I actually tore the book up and threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"pains me to write this","review":"i love to read erotica. and i've enjoyed other collections edited by marcy sheiner. but this book is such a disappointment. the stories are mostly fine stories. but i don't buy collections of erotica for \\"a\\" story. usually women's erotica offers stories that are exciting from psychological, intellectual, and sexual angles. sadly, most of the stories in this book have none of these qualities to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare look into Renaissance Florence","review":"For anyone who enjoys history, and especially Italian Renaissance history, this is a gem! This book is an examination of marriage as a legal institution and the prescribed roles of both men and women in it. By examining two actual persons involved in a legal case about the validity of their marriage, Lusanna and Giovanni, Brucker allows the reader a rare glimpse into a more personal type of history- a microhistory, that tries to show the greater mores and norms of Renaissance Florence through the interpretation of a legal case. Although not an easy read, and why should it be, this is an excellent introduction to anyone interested in more detailed historical analysis of law and social institutions in the Renissance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible chore to read","review":"I had to read this book for one of my college history classes and it was just a really tedious process. Even though the book is really short, it took me about 3 days to read it. This book is not a novel. It is not a fictional story. It is a true story that discusses the validity of Giovanni and Lusanna's so called marriage. The entire book is about Lusanna's story, then Giovanni's story. Naturally, each other's statements contradict each other. This whole book is like reading a legal transcript from a court house. The author himself, writes as if he were a witness in the court house as this whole case is broiling. This book is not one bit interesting and as soon as I am finished with my term paper, I'm running back to the book store to return it and getting my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding information for today's consumer","review":"Easy to understand and to follow .. information that every consumer should be aware of ..

God wants to get married! While I find many readers tend to get stuck in the allegory, some may discover something that they may have never considered before... the Bible is actually a book detailing a divine romance between God and His creation. It is easy to see how the ministry of Witness Lee (titles also available on Amazon) has influenced Gene's understanding of the Bible and contributed to his realization of the divine romance. One warning though, don't get stuck in the allegory-- let this book open your eyes to what may be a fresh perspective to God's plan for His chosen people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why add to God's story?","review":"Gene Edwards takes far too much liberty and in my opinion fictionalizes about God and creation to a point that actually contradicts the Word. My advice is stay away from this book. Go to the real Bible for all you need to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Love of All!","review":"I have read a number of Mr. Edward's books, but this by far is my favorite. I try to read this book once a year. It makes real creation, Adam and Eve and how much he loves each and every one of us. I am particularly struck by how eloquently he describes God's craftmanship in fashioning woman. We all know how he caused Adam to fall into a deep sleep and extracted one of his ribs. He tells a beautiful story of how women are everything he could ever want if he could have the perfect companion. All of that went into creating who I AM as a woman. This is a must read for anyone interested in stories based solely on books of the bible explained in such a way that you feel like you're actually there. I really loved the part about Adam and Eve being in different parts of the garden and knowing the other one was there but not how or where to find the other. Absolutely awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First rate!","review":"This is quite an extraordinary book! The author succeeded quite well in his imaginative but Biblical attempt to tell the story of our God - from creation onward. Though there are inevitable questions left unanswered & perhaps minor disagreement with the author's viewpoint, he seems definitely guided at least in part by revelation from God's Holy Spirit & shows great skill in his writing about a difficult subject. The only argument that I have with the book that kept me from giving it 5 stars is the author's failure to incorporate a conception of the Trinity into his story. His viewpoint seems closer to \\"Jesus Only\\" theology - but that does not spoil what is truthfully a very inspiring book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly is a beautiful love story","review":"This book really helped me to SEE and now to experience just how much Father loves me.

It makes you realize how well planned and orchestrated the whole plan of God is and how He much loves us. I felt closer to God and more in love with Him than ever before. I am definitely looking more forward to the marriage supper of the Lamb where I meet my Bridegroom face to face. He ties the plan of God together from Genesis through Revelation and shows you how much God longs for fellowship with you, which is why He created you in the beginning. Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful story but negative view of women","review":"This story is beautiful in its depiction of God's love for humanity, as a \\"romance.\\" The problem is that it depicts woman as a lesser being than man, that woman is not in God's image, only man is. The idea that God is Male and Adam is therefore in God's image in a way Eve is not, I find unbiblical and personally abhorrent. I found that this depiction of the nature of woman, largely ruined the rest of the allegory for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Gene Edwards","review":"I love Gene Edwards, but I wasn't as crazy about this book as I have been about his books A Tale of Three Kings or Prisoner in the Third Cell.

A central theme of this period is the conflict between the West and Islam. There are many books that come from the Christian perspective but many fewer come from the Muslim point of view. Understanding both perspectives is essential to gaining a more complete understanding of the period.David Macauly's \\"Mosque\\" carefully follows the construction of a mosque complex in Seventeenth Century Instanbul. Most of Macaulay's focus is on the engineering and building crafts associated with the construction of the mosque. Yet at the same time, he provides us insights into Islamic culture by describing the religious prerequisites that dictate the site location and functions of the buildings.

This movie would not have worked with anyone else in the lead role.The idea of the film is that Stiller is the ultimate independent film producer, Morty Fineman. His movies may not be great art, but there sure are a lot of them. One of the best gags in this film is to just sit back and enjoy the titles for all the films. A lot of work went into conjuring up literally hundreds of titles--some of which will make you laugh out loud.

This is a scary, disturbing thriller and once the story takes off, it is difficult to put down.

This is a much harder sounding recording than anything Banco recorded in the seventies. The subtleties of their earlier work is lost here and has been given over to sheer volume and a much harder edge to their sound. The new keyboardist is adequate at best. His reliance on already dated sounding digital keyboards really detracts from the music. Uncharacteristicaly, the vocals sound rough and strained. There is little reward to be found in this recording. Stick to their seventies output, Come In Ultima Cena and Io Sono Nato Libero in particular...Simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"I could definitely own this one","review":"I really enjoyed this one.

They are a really good up-and-coming industrial band with a sort-of-famous frontman (Lead singer Elijah Blue is the son of Cher). Their un-luckiness with record labels has pushed back their debut CD from '98 and it still isn't out. Try some of their songs if you like pop and are adventurous... it's a more sophisticated pop/metal hybrid that should appeal to an older crowd. I suggest \\"She Likes Big Words\\", \\"The Mansion World\\", \\"This Goodnight\\" and the song on this sdtrk, \\"Fox on the Run\\". They have a sound similar to Orgy and even share a producer, I think.

This unit shuts off after 60 sec. of no radio signal. According to Belkin tech support, there is no way to override this timeout. Because the RAZR uses a mini USB headphone jack, the user has to use the headset adapter (supplied with the phone or bought separately), an adapter to convert from 2.5 to 3.5, and then you can plug in to the FM transmitter. Because of all of these adapters, it doesn't see a radio signal therefore will only remain powered on for 1 minute at a time. Pretty darn useless for RAZR owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"the devil may care","review":"denis wheatley...dear lovers of occult fiction,... is quite a good story teller in this genre, however, he also writes at a time when certain prejudices were deem acceptable.

I defy anyone who gets to the chapter 'Within the Pentacle' to be able to put it down until at least the chapter after that! Never have I been so scared while reading a book. I have read most of the more contemporay 'horror' writer's offerings, but they pale when compared to this man, who was the master of his craft.

Anything with an electric cord in my workplace has to be tested and stickered for safety. These do not. They are durable having dropped them several times without problems.

Even my acer laptop speakers (cheapest speakers on the planet, so I thought) were louder than these sony passive speakers.

Apparently, the makers of this film were trying to cash in on the recent explosion of gay culture in the media, but after watching this film I have a funny feeling that the writers have never even met an actual gay person.

Even in that teenage-boy-wants-to-see-some-boobs way.

This is not entirely true. It is offensive to any living, breathing human being. Not just that it presents gays as stereotypical sissies (how daring is that?), but the story is so over-bloated and rehashed with TV level unintelligence, that it's drolly unwatchable. Cuba Gooding, Jr. seems to have had a bad run of movies lately and Horatio Sanz is the non-humorous, overweight sidekick with no good lines. You know the plot. It's no more than what is in the previews. The only thing believable about this film was Roger Moore as an older 'queen' and that scared the \\"living daylights\\" out of me!Note that his film is unrated.

This movie seems like the type of movie teenage boys would love (topless girls, completely lame sex jokes) and that ordinarily you'd find unknown teenage actors starring in - not an Academy Award winner...oh yeah, and written by teenage boys too...in about an hour (my apologies to any teenage boys who are above this).

They were just a backdrop upon which the heterosexual love story could be pushed along. They did have one token gay person of color, a gay Latino firefighter. However, while Cuba Gooding Jr. is chasing two women of color, for the most part, in this film gayness is basically equated with whiteness. Gay people of color should be especially offended by this movie. The movie did have a pat \\"be nice to gay people; they can be your friends too\\" message. But that wasn't enough. Even outside of the homophobia and erasure of gays of color, the movie was just awful, awful, awful. It was choppy. There were jokes that did not make sense. It was repetitive. It was predictible.

Our kitchen isn't a commercial kitchen, and in the nine days we had this timer, we probably used it less than 15 times. And it's broken now. Why in the world can't I find a decent kitchen timer that will last for a few years? It's very sad. If this piece of trash was made here in the U.S., then I fear for our future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked twice then quit . . .","review":"During the two times it worked the alarm was too soft and could not be heard from the next room.

It is a little loose and cannot be put exactly on a number, if that makes any sense. If you want a rough gauge in minutes, though, it will work fine.UPDATE 05/30/08: Stopped working and I have no idea why. I only used it about six times. The batteries are still good, but the timer is dead as a doornail. I trashed it. Consider my rating down to one star. I suggest getting a digital timer instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on Arrival","review":"The timer didn't work when it arrived. I returned the item and purchased another timer.

Recently I tried to use it and now if I set it for more than 20 minutes it doesn't work properly. It gets stuck at the 20 minute mark. I had to go out and buy a new one - a Lux brand that cost as much and doesn't ring as long but I am hoping it lasts longer than this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work right out of the box.","review":"Like another reviewer had noted, my dial gets stuck at about the 17-20min mark.

I would recommend avoiding this one unless your willing to take a chance of getting a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it. it doesnt work","review":"I ordered this to set the timer for my girls to take turns on the computer.No matter what I do, it just doesnt work.

I would have given this item no stars, but that was not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old-fashioned timer that has a LONG ring","review":"Only reason I gave it 4 stars is that though it's a LONG ring, it's not an indefinite ring. I'd prefer the latter (had bought such from Amazon only 2-3 years ago & it's no longer available [Pyrex brand]). We bought two of the Cook-Rites as if you set *both* for the same time, you pretty much can't miss the rings from several rooms away. These are great for general timing where \\"to the second\\" accuracy isn't necessary (pot roasts, piano practice, etc). Plus they are easy to set and have big numbers (they're fairly large)."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"nice timer no ticking very sturdy fell already many times and still working stable plain white but that's what it advertises very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silent timer","review":"Great timer. It doesn't do the \\"ticking\\" sound like old fashioned timers that look like this. It is dead silent. It sounds a warning at 1 minute and then starts beeping when time is up. At first the beeping is soft but gets louder and louder in case you're in another room. It's nice that the timer doesn't blast as loud as it can in case your within a few feet. I would definitely recommend this timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy crap.","review":"I give this two stars only because it's historically important as a Wiccan/Neopagan foundation document. I don't know how anyone ever took Murray's \\"theory\\" seriously because it's so incoherent. Having read this book twice, I'm still not sure exactly what she meant to prove; her \\"thesis\\" only becomes clear when filtered through other authors. Murray seems to have assumed that if she kept lobbing enough \\"witch trial evidence\\" at readers (especially if such documents were in foreign languages), they'd believe her through sheer exhuastion. Judging by this tome, Murray would not pass a college level elementary logic course today. She would certainly never have been admitted to a basic cultural anthropology class."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE Work & Research Methods","review":"During years of anthropological research, I've seen this book referred to again and again. But Murray lacks any credibility. This book is a terrible source. Murray's premise is based on the records of Inquisition victims and the confessions of \\"witches\\" during torture and trial. One can't write seriously about this subject, and use this terrible information, extracted under duress by the Church. Murray actually postulates that the consistency of the practices described, from the confessions, is evidence of a widespread witch religion. Yes, it is evidence, but evidence pertaining to the consistant beliefs of the Papal Bull of Innocent VIII against witchcraft.

P. Lovecraft includes this book in the villain's library of 'forbidden books' in \\"The Dunwich Horror\\" and several of his other stories. As this was a well-known text at the time of his writing, Lovecraft included it along with his fictitious books, like 'The Necronomicon' and the 'Book of Eibon'. This blending of real and fictional texts imparted legitimacy to the fictional texts as his readers would go, \\"I've heard of that one and that one and that one. I don't recognize that one. I should look it up.\\"Also, Lovecraft used this book as research for his writing.

The wealth of research and numerous scriptural references entrenched throughout this volume make it a \\"Must Have\\" for any serious student wishing to learn more about true In-Christ fellowship.All of that said, it deserves 5 stars! However, I gave it 4 due to the publisher's carelessness. This is obviously a newer edition of an old book. That being the case, the publisher should have taken the opportunity to reset the type (updating and refreshing the layout, doing minor editing here and there, etc.) But they did not. From what I can see they simply Xeroxed and digitized the old edition, and then sent those files off to the printer with a new cover. Disappointing. It could have been so much more ... aesthetically speaking.Nonetheless, \\"Koinonia\\" is a great book of immense value to any serious Bible student."},{"rating":"1","title":"bring a high I.Q.!!!","review":"I am an avid toy collector.

Only one kindle may be selected to receive the blog and it does not even show up in the archive for our others to access. Upon exploring this problem with Amazon, I learned this is not a mistake, but at the design of NYTimes. The NYTimes should update their delivery design as often families now have multiple kindles.If I were a print subscriber to this newspaper, all members of the household would be able to freely view the material. To limit family access like this makes no sense and defeats the purpose of our family kindle experience and lessens the educational value of this subscription.

The top two or three national and international stories of the day are covered, and then there are a couple of feature articles about some interesting topic. These are \\"New York Times\\" quality articles--well written and well researched.For the modest cost, obviously there is a trade-off. There is no regular business or sports coverage. This will not replace your local newspaper. But, for the cost of less than $.10 a day, this is a steal.The only complaint is about getting updates.

For instance, it's commonly held that babies shouldn't have cow's milk before the age of one year, yet there are many recipes in here that call for 2 cups or more of cow's milk for 6-month-olds! Also, there are recipes that call for \\"brown rice\\", again for six-month-olds, with no explanation as to whether they mean cooked brown rice, like Uncle Ben's, or if there's an infant brown rice cereal (I've never seen it). There are even some recipes that recommend citrus for young babies, but I've read you should wait until at least a year to introduce citrus fruits.

Right off, I realized this isn't the book I wanted. They only have about 2 maybe 3 recipes for 6 months olds, so this book is better for older babies and toddlers. The authors talk about introducing egg yolk at 7 months. My pediatrician told us to wait until a year old for eggs. Also, they have recipes for citrus fruit for 8 months, which we were also told to wait until a year. The authors talk about a vegan lifestyle and how to get your baby started on that. My husband and I are not vegetarian, so if your like us, I would not recommend this book. If you are, maybe you would like it. They also talk about soy and tofu, which I don't plan on giving my baby.Bottom line, I really didn't like this book. I would highly recommend Blender Baby Food (see review)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've done better...","review":"I got this book for the same reasons everyone else did-to be able to provide my baby with good nutritious food in hopes of avoiding jarred baby food. I found this book to have one main problem, lots of contradictions. At first it told me what I wanted to hear, you can make baby food at home and it's easy and fulfilling. The emphasis seemed to be on providing foods that don't contain extras like sugar, butter, seasonings, etc. Then many of the recipes given contained these extras: sugar, salt, butter, and cinnamon for 10 month olds. I didn't find this very reassuring and not what I was looking for. These recipes came from chefs whom may or may not have kids so maybe that's the reason, but this was certainly not what I had in mind for my baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"I wish that I had heeded the warnings in some of the other reviews about the style in which this book is written.

This recording makes you wish you were in Chicago in 1964 at the RegaL so you could SEE what was a fantastic week of appearances by the King of Blues. In a word: WOW ! This a must own recording, as a matter of fact get 2 because you'll wear one out !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably Raw and Exciting","review":"This is live blues at its pinnacle. I could go on and on about this or that reason to buy this, but let Blues Boy tell you -I gave you a brand new Ford (\\"uh-huh\\")You said I want a Cadillac (\\"Yeah!\\")I bought you a ten dollar dinner (\\"tell it\\")You said thanks for the snack (\\"Whoooh\\")I let you live in my penthouse (\\"yeah, B.B.\\")You said it was just a shack (screams)I gave you seven children (screams begin to crescendo)And now you wanna give them back (pandemonium)Get this now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Got BLUES?","review":"B.B. King was, is, and always will be a helluva performer. Take it from me - I've seen him twice (in his later years, mind you!), and he hasn't failed me yet! This is probably his most popular album, and I'm not surprised why. There are killer cuts aplenty, the best being Sweet Little Angel, How Blue Can You Get, You Upset Me Baby, Worry Worry and Help the Poor. His guitar's at its usual high point. The band is great. Plus, the stories are HILARIOUS!!! If you don't have this album, I don't know where you've been. Rush out, and pick it up. Then get tickets for the next B.B. King concert. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.It's worth noting that B.B. recently retired from touring - damn shame, but come on, the guy was 80 when he stopped. So if you're a fan of the blues and haven't seen the guy live, do the next best thing: buy Live at the Regal."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best blues band of all time","review":"This is the standard for all blues bands to follow. The musical interplay and use of dynamics throughout this set is absolutely stunning. Your life is not complete without this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of The Blues","review":"I read a review about this album that said it was probably the best live blues recording of all time.
