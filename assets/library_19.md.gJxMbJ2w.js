He set it up, so I can't comment on the ease or difficulty of it. When I saw it, I was not impressed. It really did look cheesy. I figured he spent maybe $30 on it -- more than I felt it was worth, but he seemed pleased with the purchase. When I found out he spent nearly THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS on it, I thought I had married a complete lunatic!

The locals are not happy, particularly when someone else dies.The basic story, the descriptions of the Lake District and the overall writing were enjoyable. But this was offset by lack of character development, being irritated by the relationships of the two main couples, and the coincidences. The scene exposing the killer just wasn't realistic.

This is followed by three music videos (\\"We Die Young\\", \\"Man in the Box\\", and an early, alternate version of \\"Sea of Sorrow\\"). Layne Staley's voice booms and is simply beautiful to listen to here, and the band themselves are so tightly knit that this is an almost perfect early portrait of the band. On the downside however is the live performance is way too short, and the black and white presentation gives the video a grainy and dated look.

If you believe that transcription can bring new insight into the genius of a piece of music, your belief will be validated here. The transcription of \\"Die Seele ruht in Jesu Handen\\" from Cantata 127, which contains some truly stunning harmonies (all from the original Bach,) is of particularly moving beauty.

Saul Williams portrys Ray so effortlessly, as if there was no acting involved. The cinmematography is immense, as a fly on the wall perspective of a man who hustles weed to make a small living in the Ghetto of our destroyed and impoverished Capital.

Saul Williams, as well as Sohn and Malone, in Slam inspired me, rather this (I don't want to call it a movie) this interpretation of life forced me to release a pent-up energy that was kept down for far too long. The completeness of this fantastic journey through urban, USA is exhilarating and painfully forgiving. A must see for all, the performances in this work of art are as moving as almost any book that I've read; it does not take away from the viewers mental imagery, it only adds to it (not too often that a movie can claim this). 5-stars are not enough -- see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slam (1998)","review":"Great movie and extremely powerful and motivational.

Only to become discouraged in the fight and caught in the same traps; sex, drugs, anger, remorse, unforgiveness, hate, regret, shame, mental pain etc. I fought so hard for others of my race not to placate to; even to the point of using drugs. But GLORY has come! This movie has given me new strenght to continue to advocate, fight and defend (help) my enslaved (physical or mental)people.

Remove the slam aspect and look at it as a poetry movie and it becomes passable, with interesting work from Williams and Sohn. As a prison movie, it was simply laughable, particularly the scene where Williams' character escapes the cliche prison yard beatdown by reciting a poem!The acting and \\"script\\" were atrocious.

He shoots the bartender in the head and then spends the next several hour -- the movie is in real time -- playing mind games with the 6 hostages. What comes out of this is a chilling and emotionally gripping film that is alarming and difficult to endure. This challenging film will linger with you long after. I highly recommend it and can't stop wondering why this film disappeared after its theatrical release in 1995. This film was ahead of its time -- it belongs with \\"Happinness\\", \\"Neighbors and Friends\\"... It's only better as far as I am concerned, because this one you just cannot forget.

You probably know the threads of the story: several, unrelated plot lines where each character is challenged. If I cared to, I could discern the links between them all; however, I just did not care enough about the story or the characters to pull the threads together. All through the story, I felt that Miller was just on the edge of taking the plunge to explore these characters more fully, but it never happened.

If that doesn't give you pause about the compatibility of neoliberalism and democracy, read this book.In Hayek's model of an ideal constitution each citizen is given one vote per lifetime when they reach the age of 45 (page 113). Then, Hayek decides that's probably too generous, and calls for an \\"indirect method of election\\" where the legislature would appoint regional delegates who would appoint new legislators, without any popular vote at all (page 114).Neoliberals hate democracy, in both theory and practice, and are much more comfortable with an oligarchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good video","review":"The trainer is motivational, and fun.

That is a new strategy, sell the customer a faulty product, then make the customer pay to make it right. The product may work, I will never know. I'm out shipping both ways--the folks at TEAC America really don't care. So, if you think you might be luck enough to get one that was built correctly, go ahead.

You will be able to relate to many of the essays(chapters)in the book. If you finish the book on a Sunday, going to work on Monday is a whole lot brighter...GET THIS BOOK..it's also a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"turn dem pages","review":"If a book doesn't grab me I put it down and it doesn't get finished. This book grabbed me. I enjoyed the narrative and the shifts between rural and urban locales, the colorful personalities, how the author captures the mood of the time, the gentrification of the East Village. I read this book shortly before I moved to NYC, and it gave me some insight into the city I now call home. My favorite parts of Strange Jazz are when it becomes overblown and outrageous, when the characters start acting a little like cartoon characters, caught in absurd situations and responding in kind. I love that stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious and haunting","review":"The best, most insightful, most bitingly funny novel about New York in the 80s I have read. The tightly wound plot unravels with intellectual suspense, revealing the hidden workings and interconnections of powerful and powerless, money and art, country and city. This is a stealth epic disguised as a comico-satiric memoir. An ambitious book about big subjects which at the same time brings into sharp focus a particular time and place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange Jazz , a wonderful novel !","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is beautifully written, a literary novel that is entertaining to read - a real page turner. The author paints a series of consecutive pictures with words, with amazing attention to detail about location, characters and situations. Everything in the novel is delineated by contrasts: city and and country, farm and business, and three brothers. Some of the situations are extremely funny (i.e. the hamburger episode, and the100 year birthday) yet this is a serious book, filled with kindness and cruelty and it is about the development of a tyrant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Penn - too dark for my taste","review":"Here's the story - I like Penn and Teller. I like Penn Jillette in general, even his old columns in PC Computing magazine. I think he's a bright and funny guy.And I'll grant that this book is pretty well written. It has a quirky style, but that's not a real drawback.But I can't say I enjoyed the book. It's dark. And I mean much darker than a typical Sam Spade type mystery. Depiction of what bodies feel like when they're fetched from the river, for example... yeah, it fit the story, but it's just darker than I want to read.It's not like anything else I can think of, but I suppose the best common ground I can come up with is Dean Koontz. I don't like reading him either, for the same reason. So if you like Dean, this might be right down your alley.With Jillette's background, you might be looking at this as a potential comedy buy. But if you're looking for comedy, look somewhere else, unless you like your comedy dark indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have friends in other timezones","review":"From start to finish, this book had me stopping every few pages to call up various friends, insisting they let me read them two paragraphs here, or a few pages there. Since I didn't finish it until well past midnight, I was glad to have friends living a few hours behind me, or several hours ahead.(Oh, and you might want their help with the hundreds of pop culture references, from jazz standards to Lou Reed.)Penn's insights are often humorous, poignant, and too close to home.Buy a few extra copies. You'll want to loan this one out, and it's a safe bet you won't be getting it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but just too mean for me","review":"I love Penn Jillette, and thought that the premise of a sock monkey narrating a murder mystery would be my cup of tea. Well, no. It's a great idea, but halfway through, I still didn't care about Dickie, or the Little Fool, or anyone. And, the descriptions of how to fish out a body or facts about acronyms vs initials were interesting, but almost didn't fit; as if they were thrown in because they were just hella neat. It's interesting, but too dark and mean. That being said, I'll still read whatever Penn Jillette writes because he's a very smart, very talented guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAY JAY THE JET PLANE - SUPERSONIC PALS","review":"My 4 yr loves this dvd, its fun and educational.

The characters are all fun, but it's the dialogue that really makes this book shine. I mean, overall I like it, and I would recommend it. And I'd probably read another book if the same author wrote it (probably). But it's not flawless. There are some great moments, but also a few chapters that don't really seem necessary. Plus, he misquotes Martin Klein, who is a great poet, in the introduction,which kind of bothered me. I would give it 3 1/2 stars actually because of that, but I can't.

This was almost the worst zombie movie I have ever seen. Bad acting, Terrible sound, and camera work. Whats up with the extreme closeups, and hand held camera? The only redeeming quality to this film is the soundtrack, if you like country blues. And the nostalgic drive in movie clips. Besides that, Sorry this movie is a no go. Don't get me wrong I like all types of zombie movies, and try to give them all a chance, but this one... just didn't deserve the one star that I gave it, and definitely not the 5 stars the other folks gave it.

I thought the Drive In thing really worked. The story was really good,and all the actors even though there were no big names, really did a good job. I was very impressed with the little girl, Audrey Evans, I look forward to seeing her in more films. The scenes with her and Bubba, played by S. Mike Davis were my favorites, you really felt the connection. S. Mike was awsome as Bubba, in the big climax I found myself cheering out loud for him. Brad Maroney and Ramie Mercado were alot of fun to watch, you really felt like they were long time buddies. Without giving anything away, this movie has alot of firsts as far as things you have never in a film like this. Bottom line I love it, it was just a fun movie to watch, I would love to see another installment, I think there is alot more story to tell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read before you buy","review":"The title is misleading. This is actually a 1962 Judy Garland Special. While a fantastic show if you are fans of Judy, Dean or Frank, it has some serious flaws. The opening and closing credits have been altered and the program has been colorized. The sound quality is great and hasn't been hurt by the stereo effect.

It arrived 3/1/12 but did not work right out of the box. Double-checked the lithium ion battery since we had a fresh spare, no luck. The return label from Amazon was printed after the 'send me another one' box was checked.Amazon delivered another new Salter 3003 the very next day 3/2/12. Unfortunately, that one was DOA as well, 0 for 2 in two days!Of course my original, but now dead, Salter 3003 we used happily for a couple of years is still sitting on my counter. Needless to say, DOA Salter #2 is going back today. I have no idea how to take Salter up on their 10-year warranty for the dead one on my counter. Nor am I going to bother. Who wants an attractive paper weight?"},{"rating":"1","title":"short-lived","review":"I bought the scale on May 9, and it died on June 21 -- not, to my knowledge, because of anything I did to it -- certainly, I hadn't spilled anything on it or immersed it. Nor have I subjected it to use beyond its stated capacities -- nothing approaching its 11lb weight limit. I thought perhaps its battery had died, and bought a new one: no luck. The thing just doesn't work.Before it died, I found that I liked its broad glass platform and its multiple taring capacity, but didn't like the fact that its buttons seem flimsy, and that the digital numbers seem to dance about quite a lot before the weight settles down.This scale is made in China -- it seems impossible to find one made elsewhere these days -- and although the design is beautiful, it certainly seems flimsily constructed, and its premature death makes it a very poor value for the money. Its price is higher than many others, and I hoped that paying more would buy more quality. Not so, alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile!","review":"I cannot comment on the features of this scale as I have been unable to receive one that works! The first one came well boxed and I placed it on the counter and turned it on. The scale gave a series of 8888s and then gave an error message. I called Salter and they stated the scale was broke so I sent it back. Two weeks later I got a new scale by UPS. I opened the box and one of the feet fell out. I called them up and Salter said they could not give me a new one until I sent the old one back. Since each time I have sent the scale back has cost me shipping, I calculate that this scale has cost me almost 50% over market price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every cook needs one","review":"This is a \\"must have\\" for any cook.

It's sharp-looking, reasonably accurate and has a good, usable range. We used it in the kitchen and also to weigh small packages for shipping. The top is made of glass, so it's fragile and needs to be treated accordingly. On the downside, for the price the scale is more of a toy rather than a tool you'll rely on for many years. For example, the LCD panel on our scale lost the top row of elements so getting a reading gets tricky especially when the weight includes the digit \\"7\\" which is ambiguous with \\"1\\" (see pic uploaded above). This is something I'd expect in freebie calculator, not a $50 item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help","review":"Has anyone had the problem of the scale weighing in even numbers only when using it to weigh grams?

Now there's nothing that can hold the batteries in place, barring duct tape.Note: this was not an Amazon.com purchase in the first place, but I ran across this while looking for a new oz./kg. scale.

It seems that moisture easily creeps inside and causes the \\"brains\\" to go crazy. I have also noticed that it generally fixes itself after a day or two. Just to be clear, I am talking about a simple wipe down with a slightly damp but certainly not wet paper towel. No matter how careful I am to avoid buttons, seams, openings, etc., the scale goes crazy for at least a day or two.

I own all the U2 albums and this was a great addition to my U2 collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love U2, you love this video. Its as simple as that.","review":"This video excursion (a \\"musical journey,\\" according to Larry Mullen Jr.) takes the viewer behind the scenes on U2's Joshua Tree tour. Some of the highlights are a pilgrimmage to Graceland, the recording of \\"Angel of Harlem\\" in the famous Sun Studios in Memphis, and -- my personal favorite -- the best rendition of \\"Bad\\" you will ever set ears to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rattle, Hum & Chill Out","review":"I've read reviews about Rattle 'n' Hum for years now. Everybody gets caught up in the mania of the movie. Honestly, who cares whether or not Bono makes a fool of himself (which he so eloquently does), who cares that this is their pilgrimage to the \\"holy lands\\" of rock. If you can strip away all the symbolic sludge and get to the heart of this movie, it's at that point that you can truly enjoy it. Rattle 'n' Hum is nothing more than an entertaining documentary of the journey of a simple rock band from Dublin Ireland. Their music and concerts are uplifting and their songs are incredibly simple, yet well-written. By the end of the movie, hopefully you will appreciate the fact that U2 always has proven themselves as a solid rock band worthy of the musical acclaim that has followed them throughout their long distinguished career. Forget the politics, forget the philanthropy, forget the garbage. Just listen to the music and enjoy the visual ride. It's only rock'n'roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"u2 on dvd is pure heaven","review":"finally! u2 on dvd! when will the rest be available! this dvd was fantastic. i want to watch it again and again and engulf myself with u2.the sound and clarity are amazing. give me more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rattle and Hum","review":"This is a great film for any U2 fan. It is like having a front row seat to the Joushua Tree tour, and getting to hang out with the band as they travel. The passion and excitement that Bono puts into his singing is infectious. I especially love getting a closer look at The Edge, Larry Mullens Jr and Adam Clayton. If you love U2, you should buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit at a time","review":"U2 / Rattle and Hum (DVD): While there are some very good moments in this movie, it's hardly a classic film for such a classic band. I've seen this film a few times but have never been able to sit through the whole thing in one viewing, I get bored and then pick it up at a latter date. Still, there is just enough good stuff here to give it Four Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I recently purchased this for my Toshiba A2 HD DVD player. Although I have not seen the entire disc-what I have seen so far is disappointing-too grainy. I realize it was filmed in a dark concert hall. My 2 biggest complaints are:1-angels of harlem-is in a small studio-not the concert footage (which I thought it would be.)2-all I want is you-the last song on the DVD-is played while the credits are running!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Video Quality is LOUSY!!","review":"The video is awful! Grainy, and dark. Blu Ray ought to be about pristine HiDef video, but this disc looks worse than most standard def DVDs. Although the audio quality is reasonably good, it should be PCM lossless instead of DTS 6.1. After all, the whole point of buying this disc in Blu Ray format is about superior sound quality and video quality. Neither were particularly impressive to me. I guess die hard U2 fans will happily shell out for the BD version, but I wish I had passed on this one. Oh well, hopefully Bon will use his cut for a worthwhile cause!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound quality","review":"I'll recommend everyone to buy the VHS version, as the dvd sound lacks sound quality.Even the CD version can't match the sound quality on the VHSJust my .02$By the way, the contents are excellent - great video."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"This song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles, now we're stealing it back\\" LOL","review":"Bono's attempt to cover the Beatles Helter-Skelter is incredibly amateur. He can't get the timing or the lyrics right. Why would he film himself doing a song when he doesn't know the words? Compare Bono's take on Helter-Skelter to the original if you get a chance. If you know the song it is worth a good laugh.Bono is the last person who should be remaking Beatles songs for profit. Bono has pompously compared his inept, politically motivated band to the Beatles. The Beatles had 27 Number 1 hits in 7 Years. U2 have 6 Number 1 hits in 30 years (4 UK and 2 US Billboard Hot 100) The Beatles did it in 7 years if U2 were going to be the next Beatles they missed the window back in the eighties. I am sure all the hardcore U2 fans hate to hear it but the facts are in the hits."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 Rattle and Hum","review":"I am on my second order for this disc and niether of the discs will load in any of my DVD players.

A sucker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How long have I waited.","review":"First I purchased the audio cd. It was pretty good. Then I purchased the vhs tape. It was really good! Unfortunately, some of the best tracks of the movie never made it onto the cd.

A must have for any U2 fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE THAN A ROCK BAND - one of the best shows of all time","review":"Well lets just say this, buy it.

Some versions of the songs are extraordinary. But as I said, everybody knows that.I'm here to talk about exclusively of the HD DVD version which in my opinion is quite bad. I own the regular DVD and they both have the same video quality, which is not great. One should expect great video from an HD DVD, but this is not the case, so if you own the DVD don't bother. If you own the VHS, just buy the regular DVD. Oh, by the way I just have a 720p HDTV, so I haven't watch it on a 1080p HDTV, but I don't think it would make any difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trashed by critics, it's not THAT bad","review":"Apart from a few time-wasting \\"interviews\\" where the bandmembers sit around acting like twelve-year-olds who are disgusted with the whole idea, this film is packed with some exciting musical moments. The prime example of this is the lads sneering their way through an incoherent chat in a warehouse then immediately giving a reeling, explosive rendition of \\"Desire\\" in the same setting.Serious U2 fans need to have this for some definitive moments. Others shoud at least give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside it's america","review":"I already had the album Rattle and Hum when I first saw the movie.

Excellent sound. (You can tell the difference with the movie in VHS) Wish they release POPMART Mexico in DVD soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 Rattle and Hum DVD","review":"I love this movie. I can watch it over and over again and still get the chills. I wish I had been able to see U2 then, when their shows were so full of energy than now when they've really toned it down. The film is fun because you get to see not only performances, but also things behind the scenes: Larry's obsession with Elvis, and interviews where they poke fun at each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 RATTLE AND HUM","review":"Awesome video.

It's the best band of the whole world."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 To Be Remembered","review":"One of the best DVD's U2 has released. Everyone is fresh, jazzed and the movie holds your interest. The songs are some of the best performed by The Edge. Bono is always the showman, and Larry and Adam are solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get the DVD","review":"This is old video that looks like old video. There are some good quality tracks worthy of Blu-ray but all in all, I was quite dissapointed. Hey, it's not the music that is poor it's the quality of the videos, if you got it on DVD, don't waste your money to upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Concert Footage and Music","review":"Haven't seen this since it was in the theaters almost 20 years ago. This is an excellent concert DVD. The documentary footage is the usual rockumentary stuff, going to Graceland and seeing Elvis's grave and talking deeply about the meaning of the music (which the band actually mocks and laughs about doing). But the music and seeing U2 in their prime as this monolithic juggernaut of musical talent, charisma and stage performance is just magical. The music is great and Bono is the air apparent to the thrown of Savior of Rock and Roll. He is THE MAN. One highlight that was not actual concert footage is them working with B.B. King. Also love the beginning, \\"Charles Manson stole this song from the Beatles... we're stealin' it back,\\" as an intro for Helter Skelter. The first half is in black and white for all the new songs that they were introducing. Then when they get to most of their big hits in the second half it is in color."},{"rating":"2","title":"misleading cover1","review":"purchased this one in Australia...

This is a must-have DVD for all U2 fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the critics","review":"This movie was really good...I didn't buy it to learn about U2's past (get U2 at the End of the World or something for that), but to hear them sing. And that's exactly what I got. While Rattle and Hum has some of U2's best songs (Bullet the Blue Sky, Sunday Bloody Sunday, Angel of Harlem, and Bad), I was dissapointed to find out that All I Want is You plays during the credits. That's one of the songs that got my into U2 in the first place, and I was hoping I would see them perform it.

They can then come to Amazon and buy a Region Code Free DVD player for $30 or more depending on how fancy you want to get.

But its worth the effort. The actors are talented, with exceptional chemistry. The writing is excellant, the ideas innovative and fresh. The effects are unique, but take an episode or two to get used to for people used to TV and Hollywood sci-fi. This show is the best on television, and deserves a fifth season. It will suck you in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, rotten DVD Mastering","review":"I love the show and think it was a crime to cancel it in the fourth season without a proper final episode.ADV has produced one of the worst DVD's I have unfortunately ever owned.You are forced to watch ADV's previews every time you put a disk in your player. This may be player specific but, my player will not let me advance throught the previews to get to the show. I think it is a DVD mastering trick to force you to watch the previews. I don't know about you but I don't want to watch ADV's comercials on somthing I just payed for.The extra material is repetitive using the same material over and over again. Scene brakes don't seem to be in logical locations.All in all I'm sorry I bought this DVD. If you can get it from another studio source please do."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've seen a few episodes and you are hungry for more","review":"I was deeply disappointed to find out that my newly found favorite show had been canceled before I even started watching it. After seeing a few episodes from the last season, I decided to start from the beginning. This is by far my favorite series ever, at first I would always skip through the channel when I saw all the bizarre characters, but after I spent the time to watch one whole episode I was hooked. So if you are interested this DVD set is 22 hours of one of the best televison programs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"SciFi's loopy programming!","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed this series quirky humor, poignant drama, and unique plot. Had the SciFi channel remained faithful to programming times, the show could have eventually garnered a wider audience.

I haven't missed an episode since I started watching last season. If I won't be home, I tape it. We recently rented The Best of Season One and the first release of Season Two. I will be buying every season that comes out. The only reason I didn't buy the \\"Best Of\\" is because I was hoping someone would put out the entire season of shows. I can't wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sci-fi show","review":"An astronaut got sucked into anther part of universe,met aliens and starts looking for home. It doesn'tsound original, but such classic idea is very appealingwhen it's done well. Farscape certainly exceeded my expectations.The acting is generally above average. The special effectsare done well and enhances the show's atmosphere, but neverat the expense of the plot.This DVD is an good intro for the series, but I gave it4 stars because it doesn't seem to have subtitles for allepiodes. My other complain is that one character just startedto appear (in the 2nd disk?) without introduction, so if youhaven't watched this series before it's kinda weird.Still, I highly recommand this DVD, like others said- you willget hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"farscape..... love it","review":"I love this show , I remembered watching a few episodes when it first came out and did not get to see all so now I can.

The chief reason I paid for a prime membership was so I could have access to this show and a few others Netflix took off Instant. Now Amazon does the same thing. Why with no warning? For me my Prime membership won't be worth it if the shows I want to watch all switch to pay per episode. I don't get it, unless of course you get us hooked so we'll pay to see the rest. I guess I'm glad I kept Netflix, at least I can get Farscape in the mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD with some very minor kinks","review":"Overall, a great set of DVDs. There are 6 boxes, 2 DVDs per box, 2 episodes per disk. There are overall only 2 minor complaints that I have about this set:1. The paper insert between the DVDs is supposed to be something...but I can't figure out exactly what it is. Looks cheap, feels cheap, doesn't do anything.2. I do feel that track list for each episode could be better. There are only 4 tracks per each 1 hour episode, and you can not skip the opening credits (which I found very convinient on other DVD sets like Simpsons) with \\"Next Track\\" button...but you can always fastforward through them.Otherwise, a great purchase.P.S. One of the reviewers said that they were forced to watch ADV previews every time a disk was put in......never seen it happen. I have to sit through the obligatory FBI warning, but then I can skip right to DVD menu."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually GOOD sci-fi","review":"This is simply one of the few great science fiction series currently airing.

Darkly funny, serious, passionate, exciting, intriguing, and intelligent are just a few of the adjectives that could describe this series. Unfortunately, the Sci Fi channel has decided recently to cancel the show's 5th season. So after a hiatus, the remaining episodes of season 4 and these DVDs will be all that remains of Farscape, so buy 'em all. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this one","review":"Just like the single DVDs, this is a money waster. Buy the full season 1 - Farscape rocks, but why buy it twice just to see the other episodes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I do not watch that much TV. But I would gladly buy premium cable if need be, just to watch this series. It is much more than an addiction, well ok its an addiction. Don't miss out, I have all their DVD's and have not regreted the buy or more over the hours spent watching and watching again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible encoding","review":"This IS Farscape, so the content itself is superb. However, the video encoding here is absolutely terrible. I have downloaded a number of other shows from Amazon that play just fine, but in this case there is a frequent and regular annoying regular stutter that makes picture and sound halt for a second. This happens in every episode. Also, the picture quality is blurry, the sound is full of static. This is by far the worst quality of all Amazon Unbox videos I have seen.Unfortunately, this is the only simple way of seeing Farscape Season 1 currently. The DVDs are not available, Netflix doesn't have this season, and iTunes is significantly more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Sci-fi show ever","review":"Cool aliens, mind-blowing stories, romance, great special-effects...

Too bad the show got cancelled prematurely, and we will never see the real end of the story. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Check out the Starburst Edition before buying this","review":"Now that the Starburst Edition of Farscape Season One is available - for approximately x1.5 of the price of this set of 6 episodes you can get the whole 22 episodes of season one.In addition watching the whole season lets you see how the characters and the relations between them develop - which is one of the things that makes Farscape such a good series (The 1 star is for the packaging, I'd give Farscape 5 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm eagerly awaiting Season 2","review":"This is simply the best series on TV. The mixture of interesting characters and humor (they never take themselves too seriously) makes it a delightful show. Plus it doesn't hurt that there are some lovely ladies on the show (Officer Aereyn Sun to name one).A Friday time slot, however, was always difficult. I missed alot of them and am looking forward to seeing Farscape in its entirety. Got Season 1 and now eagerly anticipating Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Show...

It's tragic. I love Farscape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show. SHAME ON AMAZON FOR ENCOURAGING PIRACY.","review":"Every person with access to the Internet has the option to pirate media. There is no limitation to what we can get from bit torrents. My family made a decision a couple of years ago to dispense with cable and using a Roku, a netflix supscription and then prime instant video to live cable-free without resorting to piracy. The kind of disgusting behavior exhibited by Amazon this week in yanking Farscape from free to practically fifty dollars a season is begging us to resort to piracy. We really love this show, but the only way we can watch it now is to steal it. What is wrong with this industry?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bait and Switch - Amazon Prime beware","review":"I just recently purchased Amazon prime and started getting into the shows that were offered for FREE.

Overall a fun series to watch for mindlessness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good sci-fi","review":"Of all the Science Fiction shows I love, and there are many, Farscape tops the list. (with Firefly of course) Farscape's use of Muppets allowed them to get away from typical \\"bumpy forehead aliens\\". The characters are all believable, and have motivations that make sense in their context. The villains are not just \\"crazy or Hitler\\" types, but actually have reasons for their actions. The goodguys meanwhile, are not that good either. Farscape, watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only season of Farscape worth watching","review":"At first I wasn't attracted to Farscape, then one day when I was watching the Science Fiction channel, I saw part of a show, liked what I saw, and found the title in the end credits. The reason the first season as well as the first four episodes of the second season are the only \\"season\\" worth watching is because it is the only time the plot was good. Only the John/Aeryn relationship was covered in detail, although clues were dropped about other relationships and their repercussions.

So I watched it and was hooked. This is such a great series, anyone who enjoyed star trek will surely like some part of this show. It is about space travel and aliens and it is awesome! It has a little cheesiness at some points, but didn't star trek? This show brought me through a tough time in my life, I used to get lost in it for hours, watching episode after episode. I love the characters (Areryn, Chiana, and Zhaan are all easy on the eyes), they are all unique, and each one brings in a cool back story. I am bummed that I missed all the conventions and autograph stuff they did when it was on tv.

Was it to have more airtime for \\"Sci-Fi Originals,\\" like Mansquito? As I write this, Farscape is syndicated everywhere--even in Israel--except in the States, probably because they're too cheap to pay residuals to the show's writers et. al. Sci-Fi is itself to blame for the \\"drop\\" in ratings when they monkeyed around with its scheduling. Everything about this show was top-notch, from the writing to the lighting, from the directing to the high-octave wheeze of Rygel's helium farts. And they killed the goose, for what? 'Cause it wasn't layin enough golden eggs. How myopic of them to mistake a drop (which was their fault) for a lull due to poor programing.

What a waste!! This book was way worse than any of the Gossip Girls.. it was obvious that the author was attempting to imitate certain aspects of GG series. There are so many stupid little sub-plots going on, metaphors that just don't make sense, and references to seemingly important events that are never brought up again. Zoey Dean is obviously trying way too hard. There is no comparison here; the author of Gossip Girl knows how to make you love or loathe her characters, and her writing leaves you wanting more. The A-List just made me want my 10 bucks back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!!!","review":"Perhaps its unfair of me to write a review on a book I'm only 9 pages into, but 9 pages seems like enough.First off - its a Gossip Girl 'wannabe' novel. Second, there's already a major typo only 9 pages into the book. The boy that Anna secretly lusted for (and Cyn wound up snagging) was referred to on or around page 3 or 4 was 'Scott Rowley'. However, on page 9, his name suddenly changed to 'Scott Spencer'.It seems Ms. Dean invested a lot of time studying Gossip Girl and Ms. von Ziegeser's creative way of writing and 'designer name dropping' down to a science.

She came off as a total fake, someone who we're supposed to think is different than the rest of the \\"rich kids\\" because she feels sorry for poor people. It was a total waste of time and I'm sorry I ever picked up this plotless book. If you must read books like these, turn to Gossip Girls instead. The writing is at least a little bit better, and it still has that \\"rich-mean-girl-sex-and-lies\\" element.

Every girl has had a boyfriend, had a crush, and has had their heart broken.

She has problems with her parents and with boys, and the guy that she likes the most just fell in love with her best friend. Then she moves from New York City to Beverly Hills, where the coolest girls in her new high school decide that they totally hate her. How they try to ruin her life is amazing to read. One bad thing after another happens to Anna, but she never gives in. What's also great about this book is that it is funny. I know that some other people here said how funny it is, but it really is.

Zoey likes to put real problems in her books and how you should solve them properly.The book I think is mostly for girls 13+ because it deals with adult situations. The theme of the book is that it is always important to make the right decision, and if you don't, you will pay for it.

She also likes writing funny books that people can relate to. \\"I love writing books that people can relate to.\\" Zoey like writing books for teenage girls, and have problems in her books that teenage girls face everyday.

When she gets there, she meets the boy of her dreams, and three mean girls who are determined to stop her. The girl learns a lot about herself and her family as they all go through traumatic incidences.

But, she does a very good job with the rest of story, giving it an ending that makes the story worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess","review":"This story starts off with some almost intriguing character development and then spins out of control in 4 different directions as the author struggles to find her plot (she never does) at moments reading like the lead ins to a murder mystery and at other times brushing close to erotic or romance genres. This book has nothing to recommend it except the authors general aquaintance with designer labels, if you happen to enjoy name-dropping in your reading material. Honestly, the story was chugging along pretty well throught the first half and then the author lost all coherency. Someone should really tell the author and editor that High School Students who have enough credits to graduate don't summarily get dumped back into school, they do post-secondary work.This book is a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"good seriest","review":"I've just finished with my first A-list book.

It takes a while for the character's personality to develop but once it does, you choose the ones you like and don't like.. I deffinately recommend reading this book.

The A-List by Zoey Dean is pretty much a slightly less (but not by much) version of the Gossip girl series. The only reason I gave the A-List 2 stars is because it's better than the poorly written Gossip Girl books. Of course all the characters turn out to be trashy and unlikeable in this book too. Also, the story plot of this book was hardly original because everyone always writes about some girl who moves to Los Angeles. Basically, this book bored me. In the future, I'll read books with more substance and less trash.

In clean, straightforward prose Hemingway might have admired, readers are introduced to the Archimedes, a steam ship beginning a cruise from North America to China. Weather intervenes and the ship and its crew are caught up in a deadly storm that severely tests their hearts and their will for four days. Much of the novel is an excellent narration of ship and crew in dire circumstances, but as the novel progresses different storms are adumbrated: storms of historical circumstance, storms of memory and experience, that add psychological and political depth to the work.Readers who have enjoyed Melville and Conrad should find much to like here."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most gripping storms in literature!","review":"In Hazard is about the capacity of mankind to cope with overwhelming challenges and believe in its future against dreadful odds.

Yes, sometimes it did seem somewhat preaching, or like it was writen for the \\"upscale\\" Pagan, but those moments were few and far between. They really did stress that it's important to be responsible for your choices, which is a huge thing in the Wiccan religion. For instance, if organic tomatoes are too expenseive, what are my alternatives? If I can't grow my own and can't afford the more earth friendly ones, at least i know that I'm responsible for making this decision. It doesn't make me a bad Pagan to know that rent comes before organic veggies, it makes me a realistic and intelligent one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this fragrence!!!!!","review":"This is an excellent fragrence for people who don't like strong scents. I'm very picky when it comes to perfumes. Most smell cheap or too sweet or so strong it triggers my asthma. Duende is light, clean, and has sort of floral and citrus tones. I've had many compliments on it. I recommend trying it at your local department store. Fragrences smell a bit different on different people so wear it for a couple hours and if you like it, compare the store's price to Amazon's."},{"rating":"1","title":"so disappointed","review":"This sounded like just what I wanted. I don't know if the one I got was counterfeit or spoilt, but it smelled of nothing but stale alcohol. I couldn't believe it.

The response? \\"I don't smell anything but alcohol\\".I tried it several times hoping something would emerge, but no such luck.

It is set up well. There is one video that is ab work, pure and simple. 8 exercises of 6-8 minutes, with 1/2 easier, 1/2 harder, when you just want to work on your abs. I use this on days when I am need something quick and effective or when I am doing other exercises. The second one has more ab work, including regular ab work and also more ab work which pulls in variations of pilates moves to help the abs in different ways and also work on other parts of your body as you work on the abs at the same time. A nice way to add ab work you may not have seen before. The last one is more of a general workout. It has some ab routines put into the mix, but gives you regular workouts also. There ton of work for your abs and a good amount of work to get you into general shape.

If you have a small 4 cyl or a light weight motor it may work OK for you but I had a straight six and because of its long block it made the stand very top heavy and awkward to move around in time I have found ways to keep it upright but was very disapointed in general with this purchase except for price.

It isn't often that something this irreverent comes along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caveat: this album will take time to appreciate","review":"I feel the negative reviews I read here could be because certain people have not listened to this album enough times to have the unique sound and lyrical direction crystallize into a coherent whole. It is safe to say this is a concept album and it helps to read along with the lyrics to hear the message. I listened to this album a few times and did not like it at all, then came back to it years later and loved it.In addition, perhaps some are mistaking that this album became lionized because of the controversy that swirled around it. To dismiss it on that level would be a sad mistake. And, the criticisms about certain songs not being \\"punk-sounding\\" enough for them smacks of the criticism targeted at Miles Davis when he strayed outside the boundaries of strict Jazz improvisation. If every artist obeyed these silly and arbitrary definitions for a particular genre, then innovation in popular music would soon cease.Like a fine wine, give it time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Cartoons","review":"This is a good album, but before picking it up check to see that it has the alternative tenticles label on it and not MANIFESTO; In 2001, the money-hungry, washed-up members of the group hijacked their catalogue from Jello's label, Alternative Tenticles, and is selling them on Manifesto records - in newly \\"remastered\\" format! Wow, the Kennedys have come a long way haven't they? They also put out a really poor best-of live album and are doing a reunion tour - WITHOUT Jello Biafra, they're original lead singer & songwriter. So anyway, you might want to avoid these rereleases of the DK albums, and refrain from contributing to the group's reign of terror. Jello still has the rights to their debut though."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 star music, 1 star CD","review":"Despite being possibly the most challenging and amazing punk album ever released, I would strongly recommend that no-one buy this CD. The mastermind behind (and very reason for) the Dead Kennedys' success, Jello Biafra, recieves no royalties on this album, and has not approved this remastered edition. If you can find a copy of the CD on Alternative Tentacles or an LP pressing, buy it instantly! This album is a piece of American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expect For...","review":"Vintage 80's punk rock from the politically and socially conscience legendary group - Dead Kennedys.It is probably something that you will either love or hate.With their surf guitar sound and the unusual sounding voice of Jello Biafra, this group covers the gambit of 80's pop culture in their music.Even though the lyrics may be dated, it is strangely addictive like almost all of the Dead Kennedys releases.The only thing I didn't like from this re-release is that the original artwork (which was a giant great collaged masterpiece with page after page of artwork that made numerous statements about the government and the pop culture of that time) was replaced with crap -- it's a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best work...","review":"there is a clear change of sound for the kennedys on this record,though it could be a natural progression it is unfortuantly a slight deterioration, the records features some classic dk songs(soup is good food,MTV get off the air)and the epic closing track...how ever there is somthing about this...it just doesnt hit as hard as their first 3 releases(2lps,1ep)...in this version the conraversial giger poster(which caused the contraversy which lead to the demise of the band)is ommited...i wouldnt recommed this as your first dk album, plastic surgery disasters and fresh fruit... are a better introduction to a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same band, different sound, killer album.","review":"I first heard of DK back when I was 5. This was in 1983 and I was blown away. Given the fact that 5 year olds are a handful, Dead Kennedys were a band that suited me just fine. I had no idea about politics or warfare, the music sounded great. Well, this came out when I was 7. I remember going to my friends house, and my jaw was on the floor during the listening of this album. Fast forward to 97, and I finally got to listen to it again. I burned a copy, but bought it a few years later. Very twisted surf guitar elements with the same intensity and lyrics. Unfortunately, the album that heralded the end. Get this album, no matter what. If it's Manifesto or Alternative Tentacles, it doesn't matter. Jello was found guilty of fraud and misled his bandmates. Jello still has a say in the band, but hey in democracies majority rule. As to the commerical rumour, they've never done a commerical. Ever. The band gets offers, they're turned down."},{"rating":"2","title":"disenchanted? fed up? \\"Frankenchrist\\" can help...","review":"This is the album that got me started on Dead Kennedys, and it still remains one of their strongest works. Going against the fast-minute-and-a-half songs that became the template for 'punk music,' \\"Frankenchrist\\" is 10 songs of considerable length, each with its own epic feel. Even today, the songs (and most of DK's backcatalog, for that matter) remain relevant and eerily prophetic ('Hellnation,' 'MTV--Get off the Air,' 'At My Job'). The last track, 'Stars and Stripes of Corruption,' is a six-minute work of genius, with many statements that ring all too true, especially in the wake of the now-famous \\"9-11\\" attacks (sample lyric: 'Tell me who's the real patriots? The Archie Bunker slobs waving flags? Or the people with the guts to work for some real change?')."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but why must jello get screwed","review":"This album rocks the world...But why do i rate it 4 stars then...because this is the reprint of this album, but another label, not alternative tenticles...If you know the whole reason this happened, after you listen to this album, you realize that Jello Biafra is the only DK member who kept his ideals...although it is awsome, try and get the origional alternitive tenticles version...or get it used"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid ...","review":"A totally useless re-mastering of a classic album. The music gets FIVE STARS, but this horrible re-issue should get NONE. The sound is not better at ALL, but really considerably worse - now the record sounds like friggin' OFFSPRING or some such nonsense.Used copies are still out there bearing the ALTERNATIVE TENTACLES label logo - find those and buy one.

And I just love the cover art - too funny!","review":"If you're into the Dead Kennedy's like me, than you just have to have this album/cd in your collection. I bought this album back in the 80's and just had to purchase the cd so I could load it onto my iPod. I wish I still had the Giger poster and thought maybe they would have put a smaller version of it in the cd but unfortunately not. The photo on the cover cracks me up every time. My favorite tunes are: Soup is Good Food, Jock-O-Rama and MTV Get off the Air. The DKs rock, and they were one of the best live bands ever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life.","review":"This album proved to me that it's OK to be off-center and unclassifiable. Even the punk scene wasn't totally sure what to make of Nomeansno. These Canadians seemed too brainy, too frenetic, too able to play their instruments and spin off-kilter narratives while pogo-ing around the scene with endless energy to fit exactly into any scene. Their take on human nature was dark, to be sure, but there were big, fat tongues in cheek while they let their edgy, heavy, and dare I say funktastic satire cascade over the music scene.This album - well, fusion of two EP's - still carries the intensity of their live shows while staying musically complex. It set me on a path of challenging music for the rest of my life. Utterly essential, incredibly influential, hopelessly classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"A book that portrays characters like the real ones I know and love from the South, not the stereotype that is perpetuated so often through TV & film. The dialogue rings true and the stories could have come as easily from Coffee County, AL or Pulaski County, AR. This book reeled me in like a long, summer evening on the back porch listening to my family and friends tell the stories of our lives.....embellished, of course, with each telling. I read it from cover to cover in one long sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"never finished it ..","review":"Well, I loved the concept and was dying to read this book. I got around page 88 and was bored to tears. Yes, there were parts that were funny and interesting, but the narratives are way too long. I'm all for good descriptors. Readers need that to be brought to the right place, but this was overdone. I hate giving up on a book, but I am on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprised...delighted","review":"I picked this book up because I love Paris (France), and I bought it because I grew up in the South, called off a wedding and was interested in the plot. I expected to like Duff, and didn't. I knew I would not like Milan...I adored her quickly. Other than tiring of explicit descriptions of intercourse, which I find unnecessary, the characters and the story charmed immensely. I was very regularly surprised by plot twists. I don't often read fiction, but I am disappointed that Jeter, Mavis, Slim, etc are not on my street."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, Ms. Thomason!! Outstanding!","review":"I'm a voracious reader, and normally post my books for sale on Amazon as soon as I finish them. This book, however, has earned the title \\"A Keeper\\" in my personal collection...one of those books that I hold on to, and read over and over again.The story is not original, but the author's voice certainly is. I laughed (hooted, actually) out loud, I sobbed, and in the end, I was enlightened. In the words of a beloved high school lit teacher, \\"Liberating Paris\\" manages to be \\"teachy without being preachy\\". High praise, indeed.This is southern fiction at its very best, with a cast of characters that anyone who's ever lived in a small town will immediately recognize. Even though I stayed up until 1 a.m. to finish it, that didn't keep me from wanting it to go on forever. I eagerly await Ms. Thomason's next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful resource during the decision making process and after","review":"Still to Be Born is a unique and invaluable resource to those parents who are facing difficult decisions about a subsequent pregnancy after a loss.

I have one everywhere--even in the bathroom to open medicine and vitamin containers. I have one in the bedroom, my purse, my office desk...I can't think of any place where I haven't used one or haven't wished I had one there.

As a Minnesota native I really enjoy traveling around the state with Davenport and seeing where I grow up. This novel took me away from that. Just in the first 30 pages you can tell that Sandford's New York trips are few and far in-between. His normal detail takes backseat to a poorly constructed dual plot. I really liked the Bekker character, but would have liked a little more focus on him instead of the Robin Hood killers. All in all I am sad to have wasted so much time on this book, but am looking forward to the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Sanford's best efforts","review":"Silent Prey had all of the hallmarks of a space-filler book designed to meet a contractual obligation. It's poorly paced, set away from the places that make the Prey series unique, and just tries too hard to be clever.The New York crew and the \\"Robin Hood\\" plot are just plain poorly executed. Lucas is on his worst behavior and comes off as a completely unlikable and irredeemable jerk. Even the evil serial killer is nothing more than a shadow of himself.If I'd started the series with this book, I wouldn't have tried any of the others, most of which are miles better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE'S BACK!!","review":"Do I mean Lucas Davenport? No but this is the fourth Prey book and I am glad there are many more to go. He's back means Dr. Mike Bekker, the drugged up psycho, killing his way through New York City, eyeballs everywhere. The pace is a little slower than some of the other Prey books, but Lucas Davenport is a great detective and always worth a read. I would be happier with him back in Minneapolis, but hey, John Sandford calls the shots. In this one we have double female detectives to deal with, Lily Rothenberg an ex of Davenport and Barbara Fell. The Prey series rocks. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tired easily from struggling through this verbose story .","review":"On and on and on it goes, where it stops.....who cares? very verbose story filled with so many characters it's hard to keep track. the longer I struggled with it, the more worn out I felt.

Having had his fill of Minnesotans, Bekker is now killing New Yorkers, and Davenport has been enlisted by his friend Lily Rothenburg to help find the monster.Of course that is not the only story unfolding within this book. Plot twists and subplots abound, as is Sandford's way.How can Bekker remain at large for so long with everyone looking for him? The answer to that question sends the reader spiraling toward an ending that resolves everything beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Davenport's Revenge","review":"Way to go Davenport AND your love interest survived this time! Maybe the Davenport curse regarding relationships with women has been lifted? Like \\"Eyes of Prey\\" finished this one in two evenings also. Overheard a woman in our local bookstore tell the clerk that her mother had read all of Sandford's book and I can see why she read the whole series. Sandford is like popcorn, once you start his books are hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gruesome but good","review":"I was looking for another crime series and I think I found it. I like Davenport. Seems like a believable character. Bekker makes my skin crawl. Luckily, the author does not go into excruciating detail every time Bekker takes a victim. The book takes a little time to rev up, but once it does, it is hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Another great book by this author.

However, unlike Lucas, Bekker has a plan - and he uses it to escape.At first everyone thinks that Bekker is after Lucas, but as time goes by and nothing happens, everyone relaxes. However, one day Lily Rothenburg (last seen in \\"Shadow Prey (Lucas Davenport Mysteries)\\") comes to Minneapolis to ask Lucas to come back to New York City. They believe Bekker has holed up there and is killing people and sending out bizarre quasi-scientific documents about his experiences and experiments. As a side project, Lily tells Lucas that there appears to be a vigilante group within the police department and she would like his help in shutting it down.Full of twists and turns, this is a satisfying read for anyone who is a fan of the police procedural/thriller genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each one becomes a favorite","review":"This book, my fifth of the series, impressed me. The adaptable Lucas taking on New York. The old nemesis, Bekker, up to no good again. As he attempts to fool the authories in a new way. His over drugging, if you would, continues his fury. A group of vigilante cops in NY add to the thriller, As Lucas has to dig deep to uncover all that is wrong. His womanizing contiues with an old flame and a new interest. The higher up corruption in the book add an interesting line. Overall a good read.

While the lyrics aren't as sophisticated as his work with Sabbath, Tony's voice continues to shine, earning his spot in metal history. I was expecting Headless Cross, but I got I Won't Cry for You instead. Not exactly what I hoped for, but nothing to complain about either. Definitely a must for any serious Tony Martin fan, and I look forward to their next release, which Tony himself says is coming out soon. Also look for Tony on the new Rondinelli CD also scheduled for release.

Ms. Greenwood-Robinson presents these products as the answers to everyone's problems: just pop a pill and you're on your way to a healthy body. But she only briefly addresses the fact that in most of the research she cites, the subjects took doses that are probably just not feasible. For example, in her chapter on pyruvate, she mentions that the subjects in the research studies took doses in the range of 8-36 grams. Most pyruvate supplements come in doses of 500-750 MILLIGRAMS per tablet! So to supplement your diet with this stuff would cost you a LOT of money. Some of the supplements in this book would indeed be good additions to a healthy lifestyle, but if you're looking for an easy way out, this isn't it.

I'd consider it so dispensable as to be tempted to toss it in the garbage.First, it is NOT a paperback book. It is a laminated, folded card (very large, but still a card) with side view illustrations of many species of birds along with their genus and species name. There is no other text whatsoever. First, I dislike illustrations of wildlife very much. Photos are much more reliable. From this card you cannot possibly tell the difference between a House Finch and a Purple Finch, for instance. It would be useless for identifying many other birds as well.Unless you already know birds fairly well and simply want to carry this card along in your pocket (because it's probably waterproof and you could write on it with grease pencil or dry erase marker), then I recommend you find other reference material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Reference Only","review":"This is NOT a \\"book\\" and in my opinion it should've been listed as a *pamphlet* not a \\"paperback\\".

But if you're looking for any detail (at all) about the species of birds in CT, their habits, diets, etc., then this is NOT for you.

I found myself wanting to race ahead to see how it was all going to end, but I kept reading. The end surprised me, though. It is both exciting and tragic.

She is truly the best crime writer in the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that interesting","review":"i'm a true ann rule fan, but this story did not have the spark that her other books have. i was a little disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting to read the story behind the headlines","review":"Having lived in Seattle while \\"Hollywood\\" was plying his craft, it was very interesting to read who he and his friends really were.Scurlock wasn't a low life criminal-- he traveled the world, lived in an eclectic tree house, and basically thumbed his nose at the conventional work ethic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe Ann Rule wrote this!","review":"I am a fervent fan of Ms. Rule, and eagerly buy her books as soon as they come out. I find her writing clean, engaging and difficult to put down. All the things I admire about her writing is missing in this book. The story is very slow moving, she does not make the characters seem like real people, the descriptions are repetitive, and there are even grammatical errors. If you want to read an Ann Rule book, read one of her older ones. This one is a pale shadow of Ms. Rule's gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could Not Put It Down","review":"I'm a big fan of True Crime books, and Ann Rule's in particular. This is one of her best. It was so interesting that I read it in two days, which is really unusual for me. The main story is well paced and never boring. It doesn't cover the trial, which is a nice change from many true crime stories that devote half the book to excruciating trial detail. My only criticism is the author's depiction of Scot Scurlock as just a spirited boy, so talented and handsome. He was an arrogant, extremely self-centered jerk who had no intention of ever making an honest living. I am sure his family described him as brilliant and maybe a little eccentric, but he was a world-class loser. He abused his friendships and was loyal to no one. In the end, he got exactly what he deserved, although the end came far too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe what you read.","review":"Well, chalk Anne Rule up as another one of Kevin's conquests. This book had his huge ego dripping all over it. Rule should have taken her time and investigated deeper. I will continue reading her books but with a more wary eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is Full of Misinformation","review":"Ms. Rule's book is full of misinformation. I knew Scott for many years and thought of him as a brother. I am friend of the men who are in prision. As a former journalist, I am surprised that Rule can call her book a \\"true\\" crime story. She put quotation marks around people's statements whom she never spoke with and I know this for a fact! This book is causing further injury to friends and family who have already been hurt by this tragedy. Kevin Meyers, one of Rule's main sources of information, is not the most reliable character. A couple of her other sources misrepresented themselves as \\"friends\\" of Scott, Kevin and Mark. I sense that they are either trying to cleanse their own guilt,trying to make a fast buck, or reach for their 30 seconds of fame. In the meantime Rule and others line their pockets with cash from the death of my friend. To me their acts are a type of \\"robbery.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I read the same book?","review":"I'm quite surprised by the number of rave reviews this book has. I've read at least eight of Anne Rule's books and I loved most, but this was incredibly boring. A lot of time is spent describing the earlier carefree lives of several characters and apparently little happened then that was worth reading about. And I was totally put off by the assignment of blame onto one character and even his family. Even if he was the brains behind the crimes his friends joined him of their own free will. They had plenty of other options and were grown men who chose for themselves their eventual fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BOTHER","review":"Pathetic.....nothing more than National Enquirer garb.How much did these maggots make giving information onpeople they \\"thought\\" they knew? tsk tsk...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ann Rule forgot to do her research on the book!","review":"I was shocked when I read Rule's book. She apparently believed Kevin Meyers' story - hook, line and sinker! Anyone who knows Kevin (and I do) can tell you that he has misrepresented himself and Scurlock and the Scurlock family. I am appalled that Ann Rule did not take the time to substantiate any of his stories. I am dismayed at the way she has portrayed the Scurlock family. They are some of the most wonderful and caring people in this world. I think she owes them an apology! Also, the fact that she would present and claim that Kevin Meyer's story is fact, makes me wonder about her integrity. She has also gotten some of her crime facts wrong. I have personally read all of the official police reports and there is definitely differing evidence. This would be okay except she is presenting this book as fact. Anyone who reads this book should be aware of all of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was poorly researched and contains lies","review":"From a personal view point, as one of the characters mentioned in the book, I find the lack of research in Ms Rule's book to be frightening and most certainly careless. There are at least two points in the story that are bold face lies. I am shocked that a professional author of this genre would publish without making the effort to complete her research. Many people's lives were destroyed by this tragic episode, one of which was mine and it saddens me to think that there are people reading this that only casually know me and will now begin to see me as the evil woman who \\"drove\\" a good man to rob banks. There is more to this story than Ms. Rule has allowed her readers to see and some of her informants have decieved her."},{"rating":"2","title":"more interesting stories by ann rule","review":"The story of Scott Scurlock has a different flavor than Ann Rule's other subjects. Scott, like the other criminals Ann Rule writes about, committed violent crimes. But you sense that the author was really attracted to Scurlock and his never-neverland way of life. Scott Scurlock led a hedonistic lifestyle, always in beautiful surroundings, dining at wonderful restaurants, honing and tanning his youthful, perfect body... Too bad he had to manufacture meth and rob banks to make it all possible. And too bad he had to involve his friends in what was destined to turn into a huge mess. One aspect of Scurlock's story I wonder about is his father, a minister. Was this a case of like father, like son? Did Scott learn to manipulate others from his father? Another interesting collection of true crime stories by my favorite author, Ann Rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End Of The Dream by Ann Rule Was excellent per usual","review":"There was a short story tward the end that took place in my town, in Nov. 7, 1973. \\"The Girl Who Fell In Love With Her Killer\\".

Does anybody out there know his real name?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and you never want it to stop.","review":"I loved this book, while it did sounded as though Rule may have inserted some of her own thoughts and ideas while describing the robberies, events and characters in this book. Scurlock was the most interesting thing about the whole book. What was he going to do next. When would it end. It seemed as if it never would. After the introductions of the characters the book was rivetting and I could not put it down until I read every last word."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Book!","review":"A reader-friendly, well-written account of a unique brand of bank robber(s) in the Seattle area. This book covers a recent, notorious crime spree, that took place in the Seattle area within the last five years: mid to late 1990's. \\"Hollywood,\\" and his dedicated friends' lives were just as intriguing as the main focus of the book. From start to finish, a great book, that describes some interesting facets of the green Pacific Northwest. Scott, the brains and guts behind these capers, could have become successful in many different area of life. He did appear to have a selfish side. He certainly led an interesting life, and he was successful at the things he set out to do. He liked to live the high life, and that required a lot of money. Luck cannot last forever. Saying anything else will ruin the outcome for someone wanting to read this book, which is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading","review":"always like true crime, so Ann Rule is a favorite author.

I would still like to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No No NO!","review":"I love Ann Rule and her suspenseful TC thrillers, but this book i could not finish. It just kept repeating it's self. Ann Rule you can write better than this! I see that there is a subheading that says\\" The Golden Boy who never grew-up,\\" this is the true focus of the story....a man his friend a tree house and being un-clothed. That is the highlight of the story. I think Ann Rule lacked info about the situation therefore the book was very bland. I liked her other novels: You Belonged to Me, Heartful of Lies, Every Breath You Take, In the Name of Love, Small Sacrifices. Do not read the Green river Murder TC by her it was very bland like this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age","review":"Leni Riefenstahl will soon turn 100 years and is not forgotten by those who love filmmaking. She carries the stigma of being the most celebrated filmmaker of the Nazi regime but this doesnt obscure her merits. She never belonged to the party and was always candid about politics. \\"My films are aesthetic not ideological\\", she once said. She was a wholesome artist.In this movie she stood against Goebbels, who wanted Jesse Owens performance deleted from the film, and won. She went to Hitler himself with her refusal and got away with it.In this historical document of the Berlin Olympic games she employed 150 collaborators and even invented a catapult-camera. She made many films but this is her finest and although it can be purchased in VHS it should be released in DVD, specially now that the lady turns 100."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected...","review":"This item was labeled as \\"One size fits all\\" and I am on the curvy side and it was huge with no way to tighten it without making it look extra funky. The red crushed velvet cape was probably the nicest part of the whole costume but it really did not look very pirate-ish. The laces in the cheaply made corset were pretty much pointless and I felt like if I tried to tighten them anymore they would have torn right through the material. I repackaged it up and returned it right away. (I put together a much more realistic pirate costume by going to the local thrift stores and finding a striped shirt and cheap pants to cut up as well as lots of fun accessories for less than half the price of this costume.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, for what it is","review":"If you like very straight folk and country, and you don't need \\"newness\\" or an \\"edge\\" to enjoy an album, you will probably enjoy this. Welch's voice is teriffic, as is Rawlings's guitar work, and the production is excellent.However, from such a talent and so much hype, I expected something a bit gutsier and more original. Only \\"Elvis Presley Blues\\" really struck me. A few other songs are, at least, very good. Some, like \\"Red Clay\\" just come off as downright fake (Welch isn't very convincing singing about cows and dirt, in spite of her studied-to-perfection country girl look). And perhaps, as a friend of mine complained, therein lies the problem--too much show and not enough self on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype","review":"This is a good album but it's not the best thing ever, the way people are talking about it. Modern country western fans don't get much good songwriting on the radio, but if you listen to superb songwriting from the gut of indie songwriters all the time, Time (The Revelator) doesn't seem that special.I recommend this to fans of Mazzy Star, Lucinda Williams, NPR background music and anyone on Valium."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest recordings I have ever heard.","review":"In a lifetime of listening to music, in the wake of thousands and thousands of albums sat with, there are perhaps 50 that are so self-assured, so complete, and so beautifully executed that there is nothing to say other than... \\"don't let another day pass without listening to this.\\" Finding records like this is the whole reason I listen to music in the first place.Sunset on a decrepit back porch with a glass of whiskey..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillbilly music - Not that I do not like some music in this gender","review":"Kind of depressing as a whole and no real good or catchy songs, personally I have a hard time finding much of anything really good to say about anything about the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"breathtaking","review":"I bought this the day it came out almost on a whim, not being particularly familiar with Welch/Rawlings' previous work, absent the cuts on the Oh, Brother soundtrack. Since then, it literally has not left my stereo. People who find the music slow are right. But I wouldn't call it depressing. It's lyrical and moving and somehow, especially on the first and last couple tracks, just takes your breath away.If you're looking for something sugarsweet and bumpy, stay away. But if you're into the soulful, the meaningful, the strictly -beautiful-, this album's a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"achingly beautiful music....","review":"Fantastic CD.

Relying upon my enjoyment of the \\"O Brother\\" soundtrack and after reading several of the positive reviews here, I bought this disk and was immediately disappointed. To paraphrase Lloyd Bentsen, Gillian Welch is no Emmylou Harris. Worse, each of the songs sounds like all of the others. As she mumbled her way through each one, I kept thinking that the next would be better, but no luck. Unless you are one of her established fans, skip this one. In fact, skip Gillian altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Depression","review":"This album is my biggest disappointment of 2001. I have nothing to say in commendation.

The best known author from that school is Wilkie Collins but it also includes Margaret Oliphant, Ellen Woods, & Mary Bradden. I've read other of Braddon's books and enjoyed them but this former actress turned writer left me a bit lost with her first book.....and this was supposedly a re-working from her original book. She threw in every plot device she could think of which made for confusion. There were some fun parts but also dull, rambling passages that seemed to go on and on.

It lived within my CD player for over a month playing non-stop. (Yes, I leave my CD player on all the time). This is the second album from Huston that I have, and I will be an avid follower of all his future releases.Whatever mood you are in, Wanderlust is sure to please your senses. It is a journey well worth listening to. Huston has a unique style that is all his own.

It's this kind of presentation where you can pick up tidbits that you'll remember forever. It covers the parental marriage as indicated by the sun and the moon (and other factors that perhaps you didn't know to look at in those terms). It talks about early childhood and the unfolding personality expressed through progressions. There is a very interesting chapter about the archetypal images of the mythical creatures, Puer and Senex, which was entirely new to me. If you are interested in depth psychology as shown in the birth chart you must read and re-read this book. You will come away from it knowing yourself in a deeper way than before.

It probably holds the most appeal to those of us who have participated in Erasmus or other international exchange programs and can identify. The coming-of-age angst and assorted melodrama are keenly observed and good-humored; it's impossible not to smile, cringe and reminisce when watching it. One caveat - the use of tired national stereotypes (the organized German, the flirty Italian etc.) was a bit unsubtle and unnecessary; but overall I very much enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"unknown characters in a known world","review":"Xavier (Romain Duris) comes to Barcelona as an exchange student and his life changes. He is in this apartment with 6 other students who have varied interest and view points. Even though the cover shows Audrey Tautou but she only plays a small role in this movie.

What a joke. I would only recommend this film to Americans who believe the unity propoganda perpetrated by Europe.

But out of all those pages and photos there were only 2 cabins that impressed me at all, the rest are downright ugly, impractical, and useless. And most of them also look very expensive to build.It seems to me that this book is more about \\"2nd homes\\" than cabins.I think the bottom line is that this book is oriented more towards architects trying to get inspired by new ideas for 2nd home designs.If you're looking for a book that will give you usable designs and info on building a cabin, this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely and inspiring","review":"This is such a lovely book to look at.

I had the choice of these pads, which are identical to what was installed new at the factory, or pads with a ceramic friction material. I have used ceramic pads at more expense in the past and was not happy with them. While ceramic pads can be quieter and longer lasting than the original material, they can cause more wear on the rotors and my experience has been that they fade badly when hot. These pads were installed on a 2007 Rendezvous (rear) and are just as effective and quiet as when the car was new. I can expect they will last 60-80,000 miles, maybe more.

On the other, it is stiff, like some of my favorite melamine cooking stirrers/mixing things.This goofy thing combines the disadvantages of both tools: it is flexible, but only for about a 1/4 inch at the tip, since the core is solid metal.

Not bad - just don't expect her usual approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and unmemorable","review":"I'm not a hard-core DMB fan, but I buy and enjoy most of his stuff. This album, however, is simply boring and unmemorable. There's nothing that comes close to showing the true musical talents that I know DMB has. I got through the first 8 songs and couldn't remember anything about what I had just listened to. I'll shelve it for a couple months and then listen to it again and may change my mind later, but I'm not very optomistic that it will make a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"A minor dissappointment","review":"I've been listening to DMB for about 10 years and this CD is not nearly as good as the live \\"rehash\\" of hits he has put out in recent years.It took 12 tracks before I found one that I could listen to all the way through.My feeling is Dave is too wrapped up in politics and needs to spread his musical talents around to deal with other social issues and personal experiences. Most of his songs are like mini-sermons with each one speaking to the listener in a different way. Only with this album he has no musical river to carry his message. He has had a long career and maybe he has exhausted his creative talents.I still have tickets to his show in West Palm Beach and look forward to hearing what I think is the tightest live band perform once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average.","review":"Very dissapointing.

I downloaded the songs off iTunes and into my iPod. I sat down and briefly listened to every song. My first reaction was that I thought I was listening to garbage. Dissapointed, I came back to my iPod an hour later and listened to the cd again. WOW, what a difference the second listen made. This cd is indisputably better than Everyday, and arguably Busted Stuff. ALL THE BAD REVIEWS ARE BASED ON BRIEF, FIRST-TIME LISTENS. There ARE some decent jams, and there ARE some great choruses. I can see DMB playing some of these songs sensationally live in concert. It is true that his new sound is different from Crash, Before These Crowded Streets, and Under The Table and Dreaming. They are not a dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews Does It Again!","review":"This Album is awsome for anyone that likes Dave Matthews, don't listen to the people that say it is no good.

So if your a Dave Matthews Band fan, go out and buy this album today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give DMB a Break!!","review":"Ok first off, I like most of the other reviewers, am a hugh Dave Matthews fan. I have every single live cd and studio cd. People have been complaining that this cd is terrible, and I would have to disagree. This is a new CD for the band and they have decided to try a number of new things, which is a good thing seeing how they haven't released an album for a few years. I was excited to hear the new sound, especially after Some Devil. I personally would have been disappointed if this CD sounded just like the other CD's. I applaud Dave and the gang for trying something new. Plus if you don't like this CD, wait until they play the music live. This is a band that lives on the road and that is because they play best in front of an audience. So to those of you that have been reading these reviews that dog the band, and have decided not to buy the cd, reconsider and have an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK","review":"I keep picking up Dave Matthews hoping somehow I would hear something like the albums \\"Crash\\" or \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\" because those are some of the best all time albums in my opinion. DMB used to jam like no other and I could listen to them all day. \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\" came out with a couple of good songs, but really just marked the beginning of a downhill slide. \\"Stand Up\\" \\"Recently\\" and \\"Some Devil\\" are junk too. I have thrown away enough money, so I am done with DMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of the Road for Dave Matthews","review":"If you haven't noticed by now Dave Matthews LOVES GIRLS, more of an obsession lyrically (wanted to follow the sweat running down her spine....geez dave). A kinda mellow down jam band style added to STAND UP, it shows potential in some areas, but as a whole this CD really doesn't deliever.PROS: Dream Girl, American Baby, Smooth Rider, Steady as We Go.Cons: Mainly Louisiana Bayou, the rest are better but mediocre DMB material. Oh yeah, (YOU CANT FKING BURN IT)DMB has had a great run with an uncountable list of good songs, although, this CD doesn't add many songs to that list, but I didn't really expect it too. Really just recommend for big DMB fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Caffeine Please","review":"Sadly, I must agree with the other negative reviews. My beloved band has hit bottom with this collection of sluggish, uninspired tunes. It sounds like the DMB boys have switched to decaf - the songs are all a slow, meandering tempo combined with lackluster vocals. The title song is frighteningly bad, the vocals could be better done by a bunch of drunks. American Baby, the single, would be fine if not surrounded by the other plodding tunes. I love DMB, and could never give them less than two stars, but if you're not a die-hard fan, buy any and all of their other discs, but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing on me!!!!","review":"As I listened to this disc on my headphones last night, the 4th time hearing the cd, I finally started to appreciate the music, BIG TIME. The band has grown. The music is much more complex. Complex music takes much longer to figure out. There are a few songs that stike me as very African in thier unique rythms & changes. Like African, world, Zappa or any other mature, complex music, it takes time to sink in & bloom in the brain.So that said, it's now obvious that the \\"frat boy\\", easy hook, easy rythm days of this band are over. THANK GOD! It's also clear that the \\"frat boy\\" reviewers are perplexed. AS they well should be, \\"No hook, no dice?\\" All these young cats wanting the next Crash are hilarious.I'm not a huge DMB head, but I do respect thier HUGE talents. This band is maturing in very postive ways & it's probably a good thing that thier music it starting to float right over the heads of thier legendary \\"frat boy\\" audience.Bring on the world beats. Keep driving forward DMB!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Music and Artists","review":"I agree with others who have said do not call yourself a 'fan' if your going to lash out at DMB because they have grown as a band and dared to do something new and fresh. This album explores a whole new side of the band and I cannot wait to hear this music live, it will be great.To often you hear bands sound exactly the same cd after cd and it is enough to make you sick. Not enough bands explore new sides and grow. Some of theese people who have criticized DMB are proberly the same ones who criticize other bands for sounding the same on all their cds. Do not be afraid of change lets all 'stand up' and take notice, lets open our ears and eyes.The DMB are truly the greatest band in the world and are not afraid to take risks and try something new and different. For those of you stuck in 1994 and waiting for 'Lillywhite' to return I have one thing to say to you, Grow up. This is one of my new favorite cds by DMB and look forward to hearing this music in concert this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems with my iPod.","review":"First of all, I had no problems loading this on my Itunes. I don't know what everybody's talking about. I just loaded it like any other CD. I was a little afraid when I bought this CD. Everyday was OK in parts I didn't like Busted Stuff. I went to buy this not really knowing what to think. I have to admit, I've been happily suprised. Sure it's not really anything like their old stuff, but I think that the band really had fun experimenting on this one. The only downside is the repetitive drumming. I can't wait to see what Carter does with the songs live! I think it's a great album. I wasn't sure at first, but after listening to it 10 times through I decided I liked it. It will most likely be the album that will lose them some fans, but it will also bring in a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey look a NEW dmb album","review":"Sounds like the same great DMB I've heard on all their other albums. Great musicianship, insightful and thought-provoking lyrics, killer drum licks, and fat bass lines. Sure it's not a \\"jam band\\" album but it's been awhile since they've done that and I for one am glad. DMB has shown the courage to release the music that comes to be when they gather in the studio; good for them, and good for us. If you really want one of their other albums then buy it. If you want to hear something new and different, you know like a NEW album then pick this one up, you won't be sorry.peace.G"},{"rating":"1","title":"Life is music","review":"I brought the Some Devil CD after watching a DVD with DMB's music.I ran into Stand Up and I was interested as I liked what I heard on Some Devil and the picture on this Cd promised like music, so I thought.

Cult music is usually for specific groups and I'm not a groupee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without...","review":"American Baby got me hooked enough to seek out this CD and buy it. Listening to the CD once, I realized that I had heard another song on the CD before (Old Dirty Hill) but didn't recognize it as DMB. However, I loved the song.Although the whole CD isn't a traditional DMB CD, I think it's a great branch out on their sound. I have played this album over and over again and every time I love it more and more. DMB should really be proud of this album, and it has made me appreciate this band as a group of comprehensive artists.I haven't had an issue with their content protection and its compatibility with my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Did It Again","review":"Up until I heard this CD I was not a Dave Matthew's fan...don't know what it is about his use of simple words, but with the combination of his voice and his band this cd is...awsome! If you like Dave Matthew's than you know what this cd is about, if you don't like Dave Matthew's....don't buy this because if you do you will be heading out to buy all the other Dave Matthew's cd's...so save some time and money and don't get hooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerts Suffering Too","review":"I saw DMB last night in Charlotte and had a mixed reaction. It was great to hear some of the old songs (Two Step, Crush, Say Goodbye) but they overdid it on the new stuff. I was extremely disappointed in their choice for an encore...Old Dirt Hill and What You Are. Whatever happened to Ants or Watchtower as a closer?? Most in the crowd were disappointed too. DMB is like a fish out of water. They need to get back to what made them famous or call it a day. The crowds are starting to slowly dwindle (Heck, I bought 2 great seats on e-bay for $21 each that had a face value of $57).I haven't bought the new CD and based on last night's show, probably won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it.","review":"Yes this CD is different from other DMB CD's but one of the best. It showcases everyone in the band and will have some classic songs that will played at DMB concerts for years to come. Don't miss out on some of the best music due to other reviews listen with an open mind and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM FOR DMB FANS","review":"This album represents really what the Dave Matthews band it's about, a lot of improvisation turned in to fine tunes, with fun details and great vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring that beat back to me again...","review":"And by that, I mean the lyrical and compositional brilliance of the band's older works. No, this album is not terrible. In fact, if my expectations of the band weren't as high, I probably would have had a more accepting initial reaction to the simple, poppier beats. However, \\"Stand Up\\" is over-produced and tracks that translate to solid jams when performed live are cut to three minutes of synthesized repetition, such as the title track. Nevertheless, certain songs bring out the band's rockin' fresh sound, particularly \\"Everybody Wake Up\\", \\"Smooth Rider\\", and \\"Hunger for the Great Light\\", which brings out the song-writing talent of Stefan. So no, the album is not a total failure, though it's quite the adjustment to have to skip through songs on a DMB album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old and New","review":"I hear all of this complaining about how this CD isnt like the \\"old DMB\\" and I understand. But the fact is, if you want the \\"Old DMB\\" listen to the old albums over and over again (and its quite easy). Any band can just churn out the same album every two years and make their money and be happy. But what musicians do is evolve, they experiment, and they get older and have different thigs going through their head when they are writing. I was worried about this CD prior to its release, but after listening to it I realize how great it really is. Its not like the old days, but its something new and different. I like the experimenting with the different instruments and production, it shows a new side and shows some creativity. And the album does have songs that remind you of the 90's. This is a great album, better than the last two. You cant really be a fan of a band if you dont realize that not every album can sound the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Fans??","review":"It's amazing to me how many reviewers claiming to be \\"true DMB fans\\" can give this album a positive review. If you ask me they're blinded by their \\"true\\" fan status. The truth is that this album is not that good. Where's the creativity? Where's the talent gone?? I have been a longtime fan of this band, attending concerts on an annual basis, buying albums, apparel, etc. However, in the past few years I have increasingly grown irritated with the direction of this band. All of the same, tired, live albums that have been released should have been a warning sign. DMB is out of material, creativity, whatever you want to call it. That's why this \\"change\\" has been brought about. Be a \\"true\\" fan, and be honest with yourself, this album is not the DMB we all grew to love. That DMB is officially gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok music, BUT WHAT THE HELL IS THIS ENCODING?!","review":"I like Dave Matthews music, and most of the songs on this CD are good.

VERY DISAPOINTING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Die Hard Dave Fan Dissatisfied","review":"Dave, what are you doing to me? Let's go back to the classic form that we all know and love (Crash, Ants Marching, Too Much) and do away with your lastest CD, Stand Up. THere are a few decent songs on this album (American Baby, Smooth Rider), but even those either lack true definition, or are too short to truly get in to. For some reason, the band has deemed it necessary to do away with a nice rythmic driving backbeat and lean toward a softer core of chants and other mediocre vocals.Finally, Dave and Co., KEEP YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS OUT OF MY MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album....ok dmb album","review":"The album certainly has some great songs on it. Song like Everybody Wake Up and Hunger for the Great Light are remeniscent of earlier fan favorites like Rhyme/Reason. What sets this back from some of DMB's classic albums is this: Leroi and Boyd are not featured nearly enough. What sets DMB apart is the way all the musicians come together and the powering solos of the Violin and the Sax. This CD is a bit too raw for most hardcore DMB fans. I do think that when they play these songs live the band might have something up theyre sleve, as they always do, and throw the sax and violin into the songs a little more. So thats it. It's good music, but its not what you have come to know and love from DMB. Experimenting with a well known Pop/HipHop produce...probably not DMB's greatest move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand Down","review":"The first blow to any appreciation I had for Dave Matthews happened when I saw him on ABC's \\"Politically Incorrect,\\" a TV show that revealed little about current issues but plenty about the preening arrogance and stupidity of celebrities.Dave was one of them.He was overbearing, obnoxious, rude--and not very well thought out. For a few seconds, Dave even made Bill Maher look thoughtful and considerate (which has NEVER happened).Then his solo CD and the \\"Gravedigger\\" video. How they could fill a 4-minute video with so much white guilt and self-loathing for America still amazes me. But Dave \\"cares.\\" Al-Jazeera is probably running that video with every commercial break...but Dave \\"cares.\\"When you guys--Dave, Springsteen, Dixie Chicks--stop singing and start telling us what we should be thinking....Aw, nevermind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never liked then and never will!","review":"Dave Matthews Band is most likely one if not the most over rated bands of all time.

Gone are the long jams you grew used to with DMB. Instead we get slick, polished tunes that last 4 minutes. I'm also tired of Dave making political statements on his CD's.I won't buy another DMB disc until Steve Lilywhite returns as producer.Save your money and don't bother with \\"Stand Up\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Rights Management","review":"So very uphappy.

In the future I will not buy any CD's with DRM on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I have nothing to look forward to now. . .","review":"When Everyday came out I was sort of disappointed. It still had some good songs. I have been awaiting the next album to see if they were going to continue down this pop road or go back to the old ways (Busted Stuff doesn't count because it was recorded before Everyday). Well, it looks like they are going the pop way. . . or some way, but it's not my way! I didn't like this CD at all. There might be a couple goods songs but that's pushing it. I guess I'll just listen to the old stuff some more."},{"rating":"1","title":"New direction, but still boring","review":"Some people say that DMB's new direction should be welcomed and enjoyed. Being a fan of so many musical genres (half the reason I liked DM in the first place - their jazz/blues/rock etc combinations), I welcome anything as long as it's good - or at least interesting. DMB's latest offering has absolutely NONE of the elements that made it one of the most successful (and wealthiest) bands on the planet. Stand Up features one song that are worthy of the band: American Baby. Even this song isn't that good - like someone else said, it sounds like some B-side track that never made it to an original album. The rest of the album almost unbelievably boring and half way into the track you feel the urge to skip to the next. For a band that have captivated audiences into humming their tunes all day, this album is a devestating loss of direction, and judging by other comments on Amazon, it seems I'm not alone in my opinion. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Effort, I hate writing this paragraph below...","review":"In this Album it seems as though Dave did not really give too much thought or effort into the album and it clearly shows. He may have been attempting to do something he has never done before, but either way, it is uncomfortable, poorly done, and overly produced, in my opinion. I refuse to listen to Everyday, so keep that in mind, as I consider it better than Everyday, but not far from. Every other Album from DMB showcases the musical talents of the band and takes music in new directions, while this album is not even close to the expectations or talents DMB has established for itself over the years. Also, I guess you could ask if my musical tastes are changing as well...who knows..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened Here?","review":"I am devout fan of Dave Matthews Band, I have every album except of a few of their live albums. After reading the Rolling Stones review and buying the album I totally agree that the conventional sound of DMB is gone on this album, the sax especially. I was expecting a lot more from this new album, I waited and waited for it and it fell right on its face. I hope for the better for this band that they listen to what the fans want and go back to what they are known for. Oh yea watch for the copy protection on the disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a funeral","review":"I used to drive to work and put in a DMB album and it was like there was a party in my car. With the last two or three studio albums, it sounds more like a funeral. I have loved this band for 10 years but I'm afraid this is the last album of theirs I'll buy. Sounded like they laid down one track with the sax and split it up among the 14 songs. And where's the violin?? I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave - Stand Up to RCA","review":"I popped the CD into my car on the way home from the music store. I was very pleasantly surprised with the sound and content of the music.Once I got home and put the CD in my computer to add it to my database and IPOD, I became concerned. Apparently RCA was installing something on my PC (as had happened with a recently purchased Sony Shel Silverstein CD).Now I've discovered that I am facing hours worth of tweaking my computer in order to remove an insidious program that's opened a security hole on my PC. Now, I'm ANGRY.Shel, unfortunatley is not with us anymore; but, Dave (and other artists that proport to care about rights) need to take a stand for fair use.Music: 5 StarsIntegrity: 0 Stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"No So Great","review":"This album is not DMB, it sucks! Sorry Folks, but lets be real, no jazz undertones, no strings intersecting with the incredible sax interludes, no power vocals by Mr. Matthews, where are those great lyrics? What happened to the great stuff like Bartender, Everyday, Two Step, Crash, Dont Drink the Water, When the world Ends, Grey Street and Rapunzel? Not too sure how this album will be performed live, DMB's best recordings are his live recodings, Central Park Concert, Live at Folsom Field, The Meadows Concert etc, and they are based off of his great works as mentioned above. The CD is okay as its DMB but it does not supersede his previous studio albums such as Crash and Under the Table & Dreaming, and Before these crowded streets. His best works are anything live, my personal favorite is Live at Folsom Field follwed by Central Park and than the Meadows."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the hell happened?","review":"Needless to say I tried to listen with an open mind, but ended up removing the CD from my PC after one round and placed it back in its cover where it will be exchanged for some music that has soul and depth.Sorry DMB. I still love your music and good hearts, but you missed the boat with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what DMB is capable of creating","review":"After spending some more time with it, I must change my opinion on the album. It simply isn't what DMB is capable of creating. It doesn't even come close to UTTAD or Crash. What happened to the display of musical talent? Now we get loops and electronic production??? It may have been a fun album to produce as seen by the DVD, but its hardly as listenable as early tracks. The acoustic riff that Dave played on the DVD was better than anything on the album. Ive seen them multiple times now, and support them because they are true talent. However this album is way overproduced, and barely displays their true talent. Its sad when Boyds biggest display is a plucked riff. Why not more of Leroi either???"},{"rating":"1","title":"They are not growing. They are regressing.","review":"Here's what happened:Once upon a time, the Dave Matthews band made great music. Songs that went above and beyond pop music, songs that were based on musical quality, poetic lyrics, and individual creativity. They did that for a while. Then they got older and realized it was hard work. And then they realized that they could get paid just as well by making the same lame music you hear on the radio. So they gave that a try. The lyrics were still decent, but the music was shockingly bland and lame. But they got paid, so they decided to keep going down that road. And no matter how much you or I may went them to, they aren't coming back.And if you like the album, I'm glad. I really am. Listen to it 10 times a day if you want. But please don't tell me that they're \\"growing\\" or \\"evolving.\\" They are doing the complete opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much to say... but it is not very good.","review":"Wow, popped in this cd on the way home from work and was quickly suffering from buyers remorse. This could be the worst Dave Matthews Band studio album ever. The lyrics right off the bat without reading them sound more political than ever... the music is flat and uninspiring, and vocals sound like they were taped in a garage with faulty equipment. I love going to DMB concerts, but if I have to sit through most of these songs being played... I'm thinking of reconsidering going. I don't know, maybe they will grow on me, but I usually have 3-4 songs right off the bat that I really like and then the others grow on me... I find myself hating most songs more and more each time I listen to them... and find myself grabbing old albums and live shows to listen to instead. Perhaps they should have labeled this album \\"Busted Stuff\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I bought this cd last night and listened to it twice all the way through. I have seen DMB 26 times live and have been a big fan for many years. This album is terrible. More than it being terrible I am dissapointed that I spent the money on the cd. I would borrow someones copy and listen to it before buying it because this one really seals the deal for me that DMB is just not what they used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make up your mind, Dave!","review":"As a longtime DMB fan, I kindly ask the boys to please stop searching for a \\"new sound\\" and get back to the basics of what made me fall in love with their music...intense jams, complex rhythm patterns, and introspective lyrics (and a few other Jimi Things). Although I like several songs from \\"Stand Up\\" it gravitates too much toward the urban/pop sound that dominates mainstream radio today. Also, no matter what they think, DMB is not going to change the world with political statements in their lyrics (& SFX)...so why even bother? Besides, we get enough of that from TV and the news...we don't need it in our music as well. C'mon, Dave, make up your mind whether you want to be a pop star or a rock legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best, but still great!","review":"I've been a fan of DMB ever since the first song I heard 10 years ago (hey, I lived in small-town Montana, give me a break LOL), and I'll admit that overall, this album isn't going to be my favorite, but it shows that DMB is a versitile group. This is more of a chill album, not too overwhelming in any aspect, but smooth and easy all the way around. It's a great listen, and once you listen to it a couple times to get used to the style, you'll love it.(unfortunatly, my husband doesn't agree...he hates this album. Poo on him, anyway!)A note to everyone complaining about the fact that you can't save the files to your computer...let me give you a lesson. Once you go through the agreement and the black screen comes up on the screen, look at the menu bar that runs along the top. There's an option there called \\"Copy Songs\\". From there you can choose to save the album to your desktop."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is a sad, sad day...","review":"when dave matthews hires eminem and beyonce's producer. the end result is this cd full of absolutely nothing special. i've heard that the band is planning on keeping this producer? while it's great that the whole band had more of an input on the music, the fact remains that true dave fans are sorely disappointed in the band's new \\"mass-produced\\"esque sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it all","review":"Stand up had me asking myself some questions about where the dave matthews band was going, and at first I did not like this album, because it scared me, it did not sound like the old dmb of uttad, and crash, With the exception of dreamgirl, stolen away 55th & 3rd, But as I kept listening I really began to love this album, the groove that pulses through this cd is amazing, Hello again and Lousiana bayou, have a nice country vibe, but are great songs, Alot of these songs dont sound like normal dmb but are amazing, and shows me the talent of the band, out of my hands, and steady as we go are beautiful songs that really make you feel that th direction the band is going in is the right one, I could keep talking forever but just get this, and get teh duel disc version, so you can see the boys on the dvd showing how much fun they had when making stand up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really back to the roots","review":"Much has been written about Dave Matthews \\"roots\\". His actual roots are heard in many of the tracks of this album as the rhythms and pentatonic harmonic licks of maskande, guitar abound in many tracks. Muted shades of Johnny Clegg's Jaluka and Paul Simon's Graceland weave the sonic fabric of Africa taking Matthews back to his roots in his hometown of Johannesburg, South Africa.This will not be everyone's favorite album but I for one enjoy the musical integrity of the pieces and the structured approach Matthews takes with the work. A great buy for those who truly know music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it grow on you...","review":"At first, I will admit I really didn't enjoy this album. It seemed too \\"electronic\\" and \\"over-produced\\" at first but after a week or so of not listening to it, it began to grow on me. This is not Dave's best by any means, but deffinitly better than Everyday. I popped this CD into my radio today and I actually found myself really enjoying a good majority of the songs on it. Honestly, the only song that I have to skip on this disc is \\"Stand Up\\". This is not the old Dave that we all know and love but this new Dave is not bad, just different. Give it a few good listens before deciding you will never listen to it again, it's the kind of album that has to grown on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take It Back","review":"I'm one of those people who listen to music on my laptop. Guess what, Stand Up has a DRM scheme that loads a program which you must accept or it will not play. Well I don't allow spyware on my computer. If I was using iTunes or MS to download a song I would expect this but I don't on a CD that I buy. I'm taking this worthless plastic disc back. The DMB can crash into me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best album","review":"I have been a fan of dmb for forever and I would have to say this is their worst album. If you're looking to start out listening to them buy a live album which are always better than the studio albums and have all their better songs. You could also buy Crash or Under the Table and Dreaming. Don't judge them on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have you gone?","review":"What happened to the DMB that I used to love? Since \\"Before These Crowded Streets\\" the DMB I used to know has all but disappeared. I suppose the writing was on the wall when \\"The Lillywhite Sessions\\" became \\"Everyday\\" and \\"Busted Stuff\\". This album is no different from the last two. Over produced to the point of boredom. Dave seems to sing each song with melencholy. The band doesn't sound like they are having any fun, like this is work. If you are looking for some jams with the whole band get ready for a few teases but nothing to satisfy you appetites. Again the talents of Leroi are dismissed. I continue to hope that someday in the future DMB returns to its roots but it seems that this is fading. In the past I was so excited to get the new DMB album. It is a shame I won't feel that way again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is B side album","review":"This is the worst album of 2005. DMB is gone bad now. What happened to Jam sessions? Even debut album of other bands are good. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album sucked, Thumbs way down, worst DMB to date.","review":"Horrible writings, songs, and lyrics..i'm so sad i wasted time and money on this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"A band trying to make even more pop popularity when they don't need it. If this music came from the heart, then it just doesn't grab me. In my opinion, it sound like they want to create more fans, not more great music. As far as songs go, Some Devil is 100% better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to it before you buy!!!","review":"I love DMB, and I'm sure as most, I love them more than anybody else, so you must listen to my opinion because I'm an expert... this CD is horrible. I was in the middle of ordering it on Amazon when my girlfreind whipped it out of her purse. We just listened to it and I am sick to my stomach. I hate this CD sooo much. I just spent all day listening to Live at Luther and Busted Stuff and was pumped up for summer, then I sit down tonight and loose all of this respect for Dave. Did he even listen to it or are they so big now they can shat on a disk and make it gold? Now, bare in mind, even though I hate it, you of cousre may love it, just listen to it before you buy. If you DO like it that's great but it's not going to be because you liked them in the past. Uhhg so sick. I feel like a little boy that just saw his Mom kissing the Milkman."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING, WILL NOT PLAY ON YOUR COMPUTER!","review":"THIS ALBUM IS COPYPROTECTED!If you wish to play this cd on your computer or mp3 player... forget it.

The album lacks the energy and inspiration that usually defines the Dave Matthews Band. It is not the band America fell in love with."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not Dave, and it's not good","review":"Like most reviewing this CD, I've been a fan of DMB for a long time, seen them live a bunch, etc... This CD is really not DMB, it's their new sound, and to me, it's lazy and I couldn't find one melody worth even spending .99 cents online to download. For those who are giving this CD 4 or 5 stars, I really think you're being too generous or letting your love for DMB's old stuff influence your judgment here. Bottom line for me is if you're new to Dave, you'll never want to ever listen to this album, and if you've listened to Dave for a while, odds are you won't like this new sound, it's pretty boring and not very musical.Here's something weird as a side note, all of Dave's \\"pop, new sounding stuff\\" has had black, white and gray covers, and all of his older, good music has been colorful. Think about it, Everyday, Some Devil and now this piece of garbage, although I have to say Everyday and Some Devil were both pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"a long time fan, disappointed","review":"This CD is boring, repetitive,and a big disappointment. The lyrics and music are both not up to Dave Matthews standards. The talents of these band members are hidden and Dave's voice sounds hoarse at times. Where is Carter's truly original and outstanding drumming? Most of all what happened to the wonderful lyrics we have come to expect? Batson did a diservice to this band and I hope he goes back to M&M and does not have any further influence on DMB. What were Dave and the guys thinking letting him in on the writing of this entire effort? I am sorry I spent money on this CD. I am sorry that a portion of that money will go to Batson. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copyright Protected","review":"Don't bother purchasing if you wish to play this on your PC or an mp3 player. It's protected against duplication.

The record companies and artists need to start putting out better albums instead of focusing on stopping mp3s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I want my money back - this new CD is not DMB. I listened through twice and took it back and got my money back. Now, I want to be compensated for the wasted time in listening to it.The riffs are weak guys. The melodies are lost. Too much crap in the background. Seems like they lost something after Lillywhite. Where did it go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor beyond belief","review":"I've owned this album since its debut. I listened to it twice, then shook my head and put it in my truck console under the map of Iowa.I wasn't going to dis DMB in public, but I just can't help myself after listening to 'Crush' from BTCS on the way to work this morning. It's hard to believe that the band that wrote and performed that song had anything to to with the piece of tripe that is 'Stand Up'. This clunker makes 'Everyday' sound like Sgt Peppers, it's that bad. Take a pass on it, and remember DMB's glory days. Because if this is their future, they're finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"The problem with being a 12 year old band...","review":"Is that all of the old guard (of which I am a proud member) expect you to release the same two albums over and over again. This album takes the band in some really exciting new directions. Sure I'd like to hear Dave get just a little more raw with the vocals at times (Everybody Wake Up) but this album really captures the energy of the Vote for Change tour last year and combines it with the savy these guys have accumulated over the past decade. It is mature but still a ton of fun, self aware and sensual. Great job guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid album despite people's \\"taste\\" in music","review":"Let's face it, no one is going to agree on an album being great or terrible - people have different tastes. If you enjoy Dave Matthews Band and are willing to accept a change in their sound (thicker sound with a hip-hop essence at times), give this cd a whirl. I wouldn't compare it to anything else out there, including Dave's old stuff - so it can be a new journey, whether you enjoy it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"What happened to the old Dave Matthews Band is what I am asking myself after listening to the album. When I heard American Baby on the radio I thought to myself ok this cd will probably be like Everyday, I was half right! These songs just dont flow, I don't listen to them and want to replay them because i cannot relate to any of the songs. I was really looking forward to this cd and now i am truly dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The last comment is the same problem I'm having, I want to play this cd but I can't because of the copywrite protection. I hear it's a good cd, but I will be able to get no use out of it because it won't properly run in my computer. I have no idea how i'm going to be able to play this on my palm either, and that's basically the only way I listen to music. So I guess this cd was a waste of my money. I wouldn't buy this cd if you plan on listening to it. Maybe you can hang the prety cover up on your ceiling or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did DMB go???","review":"I have always been a DMB fan. I love their music. This CD however, is horrible. It does not even sound like DMB. The vocals, lyrics, sound, style and even use of instruments are all different. Dave has lost his passion for meaningful music in this allbum. It makes me mad. This CD sucks! Something I thought I would never say about DMB. Please, do not buy this CD if you really like old DMB. If you really want it, mine is up for grabs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection ruins the experience","review":"IT WILL NOT PLAY OUTSIDE OF THEIR AUTOPLAY FULL SCREEN INTERFACE. Only buy this album if you never intend on using it on your computer. Its an incredible nuisance, and though I was formerly an avid Dave Matthews Band fan, I don't think I'll be buying any more of their albums if this is the way they intend to treat their customers.I for one, don't appreciate being treated like a criminal to use a product I've legitimately purchased.Thankfully however, a researcher at princeton wrote an article evaluating the system and describing how it can be gotten around. You can find that article here. http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jhalderm/cd3/ However, It still wasted 2 hours of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Enhanced\\" features made it useless","review":"I picked up a copy of this album this morning and never made it out of the parking lot. I don't know if it's the \\"enhanced features\\" or the anti-piracy technology, but my car CD player just spun the disc and then displayed \\"CD Error.\\" I exchanged it and repeated got the same results. I returned it.I seem to be one of the only people who hasn't jumped into mp3s whole hog. I don't pirate music, I don't swap or share online, and I pay the ridiculous prices for CDs. Now, I'm out of luck in listening to an album I'd been looking forward to for several months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD","review":"The music is fine, but the CD disallows fair-use. If I legally purchase a CD, I should be able to transfer the music to my iPod. BMG's anti-priacy software does not allow me to do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evolution?!","review":"The interesting thing about all these reviews on Amazon is that they're either people who 1)are fans of Dave Matthews Band's early stuff, or 2)people who justify the current album as part of the evolution process. First of all, why do groups have to evolve? The Rolling Stones have been doing the same thing for 40+ years, and no one seems to be complaining. The real weakness behind this album is not the production, or evolution of the band, but the strength of the songs. This was becoming obvious on \\"Everyday,\\" and continues here. There are just no songs that instantly capture your attention here. An acquired taste? Perhaps. But this band was always known for its catchy tunes, and innovative instrumentation. The earlier albums had this. So did \\"Busted Stuff.\\" Thank goodness Dave puts on one of the best live shows in the business, or else there'd be a lot of angry Daveheads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Further Down the Spiral","review":"Anyone else want to help start a collection to get Steve Lillywhite back in the Dave Matthews Band camp. DMB reached it's pinnacle with Before These Crowded Streets and has been on a steady decline ever since. The latest release has so much influence of the producer's hip hop and pop experiences, it detracts from anything positive on this album. Dreamgirl is a very good song, but beyond that, everything is averate at best.With releases like Everyday and Stand Up, it will not be long until VH1 airs the Dave Matthews Band, Where Are They Now. Unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent new music bad record company","review":"The new CD by Dave Matthews has some pretty decent stuff however sonds like leftovers from older sessions.. A must but for hard core fans..Whats up with software being put on your computer to put this in mp3 format?? can not play on ipod..If this is the future of buying cd's and not being able to play on your computer then the artists and record labels shouldnt ask themselves why people are downloading entire cds"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"This CD is really disappointing. The only song that was played a lot during his summer tour was Hello Again. Where are the rest of those new songs? My favorite song is the Intro to American Baby... pitiful. There is electronic music shuffled into the mix that is horrible. Not enough jamming. I would not buy this CD and I hope they don't play many of these songs on tour this year. Save 15 bucks and put it towards going to a Dave concert rather than getting this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was eagerly awaiting May for many reason of which both the new NIN and DMB were a part. While NIN is amazing, this release by DMB is very poor and disappointing. I listened to it once and filed it away with Around the Sun by R.E.M. I strongly urge listeners to stay away and don't waste your hard earned cash on this poor effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What","review":"The album has about 2-3 solid songs. There is alot electronic hip-hop beats that don't work. Craptacular"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from classic DMB","review":"This really is an awful album for reasons that many have laid out already. But for everyone complaining about the copy protection on this CD... just hold down the Shift key as you pop it in your computer. I ripped it with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but Good","review":"The grittier sound on this album is really really cool. I liked a lot of the individual songs on Busted Stuff better, but I think this album is better as a snapshot of where the band's at right now. As for the editorial review that says \\"Stolen Away on 55th and 3rd\\" is partially crunk... umm I think not. It sounds like it's going to be pretty crunk when it's just the beat at the beginning, but then everything else joins in and it settles into a really chill flow and is anything but \\"crunk.\\" Also I love the dual disc... the enhanced audio sounds great on the all-channel stereo setting on my surround sound system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing with a Capital \\"D\\"","review":"I was eagerly awaiting this new release and am extremely disappointed. If you thought Dave's solo effort \\"Some Devil\\" was good you'd probably be able to live with \\"Stand Up\\".It amazes me how the single on most CD's is the only good song. The same applies with American Baby. No other song is close to it. Save your cash!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is a 3.5 the disk is a 1","review":"Do yourself a favor and pirate this album. If you don't you will have to go through countless unecessary steps to get this on your iPod.I never thought I would pirate a Dave Matthews album until this one. Who would have that that DRM would CAUSE piracy?The music is sub-par for Dave Matthews as well. Unless you like the pop crap that is everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking a stand ...","review":"I do like the Dave Matthews Band a lot but I am taking a stand on this album.I love my iPod and I love my CDs. I do buy music.I actually purchased this Dual Disc album but took it back when I learned that I could not upload it into my iTunes library.Obviously, this new anti-copying format on STAND UP has enough iPod entusiasts upset that DMB addresses it on their website.Well ... sorry Dave ... I am not going to upload this disc as a WMA file and then burn it so I can upload it again into iTunes.PS ... I think that DMB should cooperate with Apple (and not vice versa) in making an easy solution to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunncomm?","review":"Apparently one can bypass this excellent media protection software by holding down shift prior to installing the cd. Of course, sunncomm threatened to sue when the subterfuge of this software end-around was made public. I suppose they must protect the millions that go into the development of such sophisticated software. By the way thanks Dave--first the Chicago dump and this (a dump of another kind)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I have loved Dave Matthews since 1996 when I went to my first DMB concert in the Omni in Atlanta. Since then I have gone back every year for the past 9 years. I even have tickets for this year's concert in July, which I hope he doesn't crowd his playlist with songs from this album. Although it does sound like Dave singing it seems as if his band has disappeared. This album was so disappointing. Every album in the past has been so wonderful. I even loved Everyday, which most criticized greatly, but this one was TERRIBLE. I hope he puts out a new one soon because this is going to leave a bad taste in my mouth for a while. Maybe he'll make up for it at his show. Don't bother purchasing this CD, the only good song on it is American Baby and you can hear it on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection is a big minus","review":"Sorry Dave (Mathews) ... I really wanted this CD, but I returned it because of the copy protection ... without even opening it. I can only vote with my money ... so this is all I can do. I would be happy for Sony to give me the CD for my time and trouble, otherwise, let's join a class action suit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a new band instead","review":"Dave has lost his passion and his writing shows it time and time again. I suggest you try a new band's CD, perhaps one without SpyWare. I buy ALL of my music legit, but I do make copies for MY use. Between autos and home I have five CD players. (Eight if you count computers) Does Sony (or the DMB) really expect me to buy 5 copies of the same CD? I hereby swear my allegiance whatever group that opposes this type of copy protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"They just forgot the power of all instruments","review":"Dave is trying a new sound, but it is not working. I have been a fan for about 12 years now and been to over 100 concerts. The thing that makes this band unique or at least what they were is they made one sound, all instruments the same or in a harmonous sound. It is gone now, they should break out their old albums and build upon the harmonous groove they had and leave it that way. Hell they did that for a long time, why the change? Dave was on the path to instrumental greatness, what happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blatant Sting Ripoff","review":"I have to be honest, don't know everything in this band's repertoire, but when the single \\"American Baby\\" starting getting played on the radio my first thought was \\"Wow, Sting has nothing left to say, he just reformulated \\"King of Pain\\" with new lyrics.To later learn it was Dave Matthews was quite a shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Qué es esto?'???","review":"Demasiado comercial, y con el productor terminaron de desenfocarse, el album es una pena, nada comparado con ningún otro albúm de la banda, incluso que everyday. Definitvamente trabajar con Mark Batson no funciona, los cambios son buenos pero cuando son para bien y en éste albúm creo que a varios y en mi opinión a mi, me ha dejado decepcionado. Y creo que la gente que hace una crítica buena debería de reaccionar y comparar....No habrá opción mas que esperar otros 2-3 años para ver que sucede con esta banda (otra producción)...espero se nivelen otra vez y definitivamente que ya no trabajen con Mark Batson.Muy Fan de DMB pero esto ....Definitivamente Malo!=("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not DMB and Not Worth It","review":"I have listened to DMB since 1995. My first album was Under the Table and Dreaming, the second Crash, and so on. I was extremely excited in 2005 when they were releasing a new album. Then, I listened to the album. There are basically three or four songs that I can stand listening to. Other than that, this album is utterly terrible. The use of drum machines masks the actual musical talent of these musicians. The lyrics of many of the songs are quite weak (see Everybody Wake Up, Dreamgirl, Stand Up...I could go on. I write this after the release of the group's latest studio album, Big Whiskey and the Groogrux King, which I enjoyed very much. So the band isn't totally inept in the 21st century. But for those of you looking to enjoy DMB's standard alternative folk rock with musical brilliance, avoid Stand Up altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"i tell you what....","review":"even if i bought the cd just for \\"dreamgirl\\" - i'm ok with that. it's nice to be excited about some dave matthews again.. it's been a while.."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't listen to these schmucks","review":"ok, maybe this isn't their best album. nothing will surpass Crash. but all these reviews are WAY too harsh. this is a really good album. it has a little bit of everything that their fans love about them. i'd recommend listening to Stolen Away on 55th and 3rd and Hunger For The Great Light. Other good tracks are Dreamgirl and American Baby. all the other reviews on here must have been done by some suckers who listened to the album once while getting stoned in the backseat of their buddy's car. in order to appreciate this album, you gotta listen to it more than once and you'll actually get into it. trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listened to it at least 10 times since Friday (FS rules)","review":"Sounds more like a Dave solo album to me. Where are the jams? Where is the band soloing ? Why bury the sax?

We like DMB and owe them so much for the pleasant memories. Hey DMB, ONLY your true friends are going to tell you the truth. This is GARBAGE but it has POTENTIAL. Yes we throw this thing around the office like a frisbee. We don't want to hurt you guys so we have a solution to this mess. Just get Reynolds on the line and have him mess with each song for about an hour. I PROMISE - you will have something interesting, creative, non-commercial and certainly not boringly pathetic. And get rid of that Bela Flek sax player and give some studio musician a chance. LeRoi Moore, a master, deserves better than to be replaced by some bela flek novice. Get Sonny Rollins or somebody with a clear understanding of Jazz and not Jazzercise. No offense to bela and his little band, your good enough to exist but you guys are not that great. Sad, at this point it would seem as though DMB disolved after crowded streets."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, Dave, no please....","review":"This CD really brings out the 'country' in DMB and turns away from the rock/funk/jazz. Its more like \\"The Dave Matthews-Stefan Lessard-Carter Beuford Band featuring Boyd Tinsley and Leroi Moore.\\" I just don't get any sax and violin on this recording, which makes DMB lose their originality.So it's something like this:Before These Crowded Streets - awesomeCrash - greatUnder the Table and Dreaming - pretty goodEveryday - Eh...not badStand Up- well...let's hope they drop that producer."},{"rating":"1","title":"two old school fans, no longer fans at all","review":"My wife and I saw Dave every tuesday night in the early 90s in Charlottesville and will never forget the energy of those early times. While I respect a bands need to experiment and grow, I honestly believe DMB is heading in the wrong direction. Too repetitive, pathetic lyrics, and no inspiration.This CD is nothing short of humiliating. In my opinion, there is only one track that is the Dave I know and love (Out of My Hands), the rest I couldn't even give a second listen. Honestly, since the early stuff, the only bright spots have been the Lillywhite sessions and Some Devil. Hope that Dave finds his singer/songwriting self that he once was, but honestly, I have grown tired. BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I smell fear. Mostly.","review":"It's called evolution.This is a solid album, fantastic production and yes, I agree, some of the elements that have defined DMB in the past have fallen back in the mix.The trademark violin solo, the jam band feel, but we know those elements will all come out live, why worry?DMB fans worldwide are going through an identity crisis because of this album. What did you think was going to happen after 14 years? I doubted very much that they would rehash the same old formulas, even if the Dead got away with it for years.FYI: saw them live about a week after getting the album. Old Dirt Hill, Dreamgirl and Stand Up come out fantastic live. They all still have the skills onstage, and there are plenty of opportunities for the live DMB we know and love to shine through on the rest of the album. Having had a few more listens, it is definately not the DMB of old, but I'm not complaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave proves himself once again","review":"Dave Matthews proves once again on this record that he can still manage to conjure up some of the most boring, whiney, bland music to hit the shelves. He is a talentless songwriter, his lyrics are horrible and his music lacks any form of a hook. His constant falsetto actually made me want to hurl at times. The drums, bass, violin whatever other instruments are in his band overpower his weak acoustic riffing and delicate voice. This record drones on and on, most of it blending together into a painfully uneventful soundscape of bad poetry and poor musicianship. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet since Before These Crowded Streets","review":"First, any one who gives this a poor review is not a true DMB fan. This album is awesome and the use of Eminem's producer was a good idea. \\"Everyday\\" sucked (even Dave agreed with that) and Busted Stuff had nothing new (just concert songs on CD). This album brings fans closer to the Dave we once knew. Its honestly one of the best and is probably better than \\"Crash\\". Do yourself a favor, buy the album and actually listen to it. That is if you are a true fan?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent CD but a little whiney","review":"The recording quality is great. Songs are well though out and performed.

American baby.. blahblashlblah, DAVE stick to jamming on some cool fun beats, and rhythems with solos and feeling. I bet their live show sucks when they start playing these new songs. I'm pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gathering Dust","review":"I love DMB. I have loved DMB since I was 15 years old (and that was longer ago that I'd like to admit). I buy all of the albums as soon as they come out and almost all of them get regular rotations through the CD player. The only two that do not are Everyday and this one. I often wait until after I have heard the songs in concert to judge the album; but after back-to-back shows this past weekend, I'm sad to say that, in spite of my best intentions of trying very hard to like this album, its just going to stay on the shelf gathering dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god, DMB got three strike on this one","review":"Humm...I've been a DMB fans since the first album but I think Dave is lacking creativity these days. His solo album was so-so and this Stand Up album is very close to 'Up in the Garbage'. What a disappointment!!!! Nothing close to 'Crash' or 'Under the table dreaming'. I've been listening to this album more than 10 times and beside 'Dream Girl' and 'American Baby', they won't attract too much attention with this crappy album. Also, to make it play on my laptop was pain, as I had to install protective software to prevent illegal copies. Maybe Dave should worry more about his music than people stealing it, as few will do it with Stand up....You can do better Dave!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand Up....","review":"...and walk out on Dave Matthews Band!

I have heard this hyped up and smacked down. So I took it upon myself to get it and listen. But there is one small problem. I have to authorize software for my computer, I have to download licenses, and tracking cookies. They say that you dont, but the scans I have been running are finding them. One other bad thing, this CD has issues playing in vehicles. I was believing that I was the only one, but others I work with are complaining about the same issue. I am getting tired of the people who will charge me $15 for a CD, then not allow me to listen to it when, where, and how I want to.

Just because a band puts out an album that is different doesn't mean it is good. DMB could put out a samba album and while i would respect the fact that they were trying something new, it doesn't change the fact that it sucks. This album is very different from their classic first 4 albums (UTAD, Crash, Before these crowded streets, lillywhite sessions/busted stuff), but that new direction isn't as good as the old one. The live oriented old DMB is the DMB that everyone loves and embraces, and there new, over-produced, strictly studio sound frankly isn't a good fit for the band. I do respect them for trying something new, but it just isn't as good. Don't but this album, just pray that DMB will get back together with Steve Lillywhite on the next ambum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Good","review":"This CD required about 10 steps to play in my computer - Then when it did I whished it hadn't. DMB is composed of outstanding musicians, but none of them played in this CD, the pop-blues style sounded synthetic and unoriginal. Sorta sounded like the Counting Crows, but much,much, worse. By far the worst DMB cd ever made - I hope they can come back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy protection makes this CD useless to me","review":"After purchasing and struggling with \\"Stand Up\\" by Dave Matthews Band I was frustrated to discover that I could not copy the tracks onto my portable music player like I could with all my oher CDs.

I feel this album is, at best, uninspired. I listened to it twice, and on the third listen I had to shut it off in frustration. It is terribly repetitive. Can this be our beloved Dave? I don't know how to describe exactly what went wrong here, but if you're expecting a creative work you're in for a huge let down. I am sorry I spent money on this disc, and will be a lot more cautious when considering any future works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful album","review":"I wish I could give this zero stars.When the first verse of the first song goes something like \\"digging my way to china, and if I was there, I would dig my way back just to be with you ...\\" you know your in deep do-do. Come one Dave, you can write way better lyrics than that. May of the other songs are just as pitiful.The guitar and arranging. Sure they are a tight band, but there was nothing interesting on this album what so ever. Basic licks, some horn and the drums. Where's the talent, guys? Where's teh jazzy, funk riffs? Where is Bory'd violin?A few of the songs sound muddy.Oh, and the DRM. Yeah, the very LAST DMB album I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed DaveFan","review":"I am a longtime fan of the DMB and own nearly every album I have listened to this album several times through and it does nothing for me.

If this indeed is the direction the band is going, it is time for me to find a new cool band."},{"rating":"1","title":"DMB: Shark Jumpers Supreme","review":"I have PURCHASED every album since 1993, so I feel I speak with some authority when I say that this album is by far the worst yet. I felt that the record they did with Glenn Ballard was a reasonably listenable waste, but thought they made a strong recovery on the next one, \\"Busted Stuff\\" (which was the record they SHOULD have released instead of the Ballard one). \\"Stand up\\" stinks up the joint from the cover art (what is that goofy concept lady?), to the tiny tiny song labels on the back. Oh yeah, and the music is lame, with 3-4 exceptions. I won't even address the copy protection issue...that's been done to death, and I agree with them all.

Have you guys not found a warehouse flyer on every single dmb cd??? I have and I always thought he was a greedy 84$%*rd but hey who cares, as long as the music is good... But what really agravates me is the fack that they are putting all this copyright crap on their cds... It happened to me already once with \\"Some Devil\\" which I ended up returning as I live with my mp3 player attached to my ears... I can't believe he did it again...

If you have a MAC with iTunes you shouldn't have a problem but for everyone else that has a PC it is a nightmare.

It's a slightly darker sounding mix, with heavier drums and bass than previous releases. As for the songs - there's the usual good mix of up-tempo pop songs, slow quiet stuff, and a few grungy dirty ones too. I like the direction because it shows the band is moving and growing, rather than just becoming overly formulaic.The DVD content of the dual disk format is great!Favorite part: The wild ending of \\"American Baby\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great but not amazing","review":"i was estatic when \\"stand up\\" came out, being an extreme dave fan. the lyrics are good, and there is a nice variety of sound and rythmns, but the album defintely doesnt match up to some of dave's older albums. the intro to american baby is really good, as well as \\"stolen away on 55th and 3rd\\", \\"out of my hands\\" and \\"dream girl\\". i wasnt crazy about \\"stand up (for it)\\" and the whole album had a bit of a somber tint to it..kind of depressing. however, dave's voice is still amazing, and his lyrics are inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Yet","review":"I have almost every cd they have made(except Everyday). I can't imagine how anyone who likes this band would not like this cd. There is something here for eveyone. Not a song on this cd I don't like. I have alot of cds by some very good bands, but this one I have had in my ipod shuffle and played nonstop at the gym since I got it. American Baby and Everybody WakeUp are the best post 9-11 songs written about our great country.Why do some people want every cd of DMB to sound like the first one they ever made. How boring would that be. Musicians are suppose to grow, not play repiticious music. Buying this cd is a really good purchase and well worth your hard earned money. Buy and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews on cruise control","review":"DMB is basically on cruise control the entire album. I still remain disappointed after many listens. As far as I'm concerned DMB's best album is and will be the shelved and then leaked - Lillywhite Sessions; which became what we now know as 'Busted Stuff'. However, when the tracks were officially released it became apparent that they were ruined by 'tampering and over production'. On 'Stand Up the band has turned on cruise control, and have produced a creative dud. I really wanted to love this album. Dave, I suggest you look through your roledex and give Steve Lillywhite a call next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"WTF?Dark,dreary and artificial sounding.The drum mix bites,and the unnecessary use of drum machines/sequencers add an aspartame/corn sweetener taste to this album.Sounds muddled and confusing in terms of production.Dave,get another producer and engineer,cause the ones you have are deaf,dumb and blind.Not a big fan of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just give it a listen","review":"At first listen I was like what is this? This is not the DMB I've heard, but as several more listens I started to appreciate the new sound. I love Louisiana Bayou & Hello Again. Hunger for the Great Light has a great riff even though the 'oh great light of love...' doesn't seem to fit so well. The American Baby Intro is awesome live so you can't give it it's full appreciation on the studio version. Old Dirt Hill is a fun little song. I have grown to like this album so much that it's in my top 3 from DMB. Give it a chance, just because it doesn't sound like every other Dave Matthews Band song you know doesn't mean it's crap. It just different, but a good different"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely confusing","review":"When I heard this album it made me feel...well, nothing. In the past I have counted on The Dave Matthews Band to get me through some tough times. Listening to their music made me feel something that cannot be described in words...a connection to both the lyrics and music, if you are a fan you know what I am talking about. When I listened to this album I felt like the band betrayed me. This was not at all what I expected. I never really cared for American Baby but I was willing to give the album a try and now I am mad at myself for making that decision. This album is not worthy of the Dave Matthews Band name. I can only hope that they don't release such undeserving material in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame music for a lame band","review":"The DRM copyright managment says it all.

Sorry, no sale.","review":"Once again record industry executives have demonstrated they are clueless. Music has moved on, and they are still trying to control how we listen by limiting the usefulness of the the physical media. Memo to Sony and the rest: If your product is incompatible with my iPod, I simply won't buy your product. Period. If you imagine that your lame music offerings are more important than the way I enjoy music in my life, think again.

But, now that I've given the cd a listen, I love it. It's what \\"Everyday\\" could have been had they taken a bit more time and put some feeling into it. Personally, I think \\"Stand Up\\" is more comparable to \\"Some Devil\\" than to any of the actual DMB albums. I'd also say that it's the most musically upbeat album since \\"Under the Table...\\" and \\"Crash.\\" I know it's hard for us as DMB fans to allow our band to explore other options with their music, but this is a very refreshing album for a career that seemed to be waning a bit. \\"Out of My Hands\\" is unbelievable, nice work on stripping everything down to piano, drums and bass. Anyway, if you have hard time listening to it at first because they don't sound exactly the same, relax, take a deep breath, put it in again and open up to it like they're a new band, because with this album, they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPRISINGLY- new is not better","review":"Graciously awaiting a new album with high expectations is something I live for. I never thought that I would be so dissapointed with a DMB album as I am with this one. It rates nowhere near any other past release. With the release of \\"American Baby\\" I thought that the album would be unbelievably awesome but they went the wrong way. Boyd is nowhere to be found but for a few tracks, Leroi is also on select tracks and Carter is still his awesome self but there is that electric drum beat feel which doesn't feel good. There is more piano than ever before which sounds ok. I hate writing this bad review but the songs were just boring and lacking FUN. They sound like a country gospel band. I have given this album a chance but it doesn't work. I'M ANGRY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commits the worst crime of all: forgettability","review":"I seem to have lost my copy of this record, and I'm not really mourning it--not nearly as much as \\"Busted Stuff.\\" Yeah, DMB tried to write songs with the same types of melody and freeform as their early work, but this feels forced.

Don't bother with this one, it's a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of the music","review":"When I first heard this album I didn't think it was that good. Then, two years later I listened again and I loved it. It's funny how you can dislike something if you're in the wrong mood for it. It's different for sure, and I'm sure that turned off many a DMB fan, but most of the songs are very good.However, where DMB scores one in the music category, they continue to let themselves be whores to their record label. The whole \\"enhanced\\" cd thing is lame, and I completely understand someone giving this album one star because of that. When is their record contract up? Whenever it is, I certainly hope DMB goes the route of Nine Inch Nails and ditches their label. There was also the whole fiasco with Lillywhite Sessions/Busted Stuff/Everyday. Such a shame the forces of evil have so much power in the recording industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"Really all of the past reviews have been dead on about the album being the DMB's worst. Coming from a big fan this album was a really big let down. In past albums the band has come together beautifully, but there was too much Dave and not much of the band in \\"Stand Up.\\" The new album sounds nothing like the old albums and like someone said earlier, it was over produced, Dave's voice sounded different for one. The album was just all the same, very bland. The band really needs to think about going back to their old ways and spend a lot more time working on some better writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened??","review":"Wow! Man i've been so pumped up for a new studio album and this has let me down really bad. I was expecting something along the lines of Everyday or Crash and this is not it.

Ever since then i have bought every cd I can get my hands on. Since Everyday I have had my doubts about where they were going with their music. One of the biggest reasons this band is so big is because of their awesome musical talent with instruments. This cd has none of that. Its been over produced or something ( I dont know much about producing music). All you hear is Dave. WHich is not all that bad. But were they hell is the band? I did not know this was going to be Dave singing with a little touch of back ground music. I am going to see them this summer.

Hoping to find a cool blend of Dave Matthews and His Band, something in between Everyday and Busted Stuff. What I came across was a travesty to his music. There are exactly 4 good songs on this album. Three spins through and thats all I can really stand. Some people are praising the studio trickery that the producer of 50cents last album added to this effort. I question..why the hell use the producer of 50cent and Eminem on a thouroughly original and talented group like DMB??? I find this album to be absolutely inorganic, the lyrics to be uninspired (and how hard is that to achieve on a politically driven album???), the bands play seems commercial and chord ridden...almost simple, all in all this album is a huge disappointment and I will go listen to The Gorge and wait for something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make albums like the good old days!!!","review":"what is this new crap?

I can tell you that this album has maybe 4 good songs on it, the rest I skip. Getting 50 Cent's producer to show them how to loop was a HUGE mistake.

You can really tell that a hip-hop producer produced this record as the drums have an in your face rap and R&B; sound to it, which just makes it worse in my opinion.. They really bombed on this one. It seems like thier musical creative minds have left and this is the result. As for the lyrics..please, I don't care about your political views, nor should you be singing about them. The only band that could get away with that and did it well was Rage Against The Machine. DMB should have stuck with what works.. Anyone who has given this album a 5 star rating is undoubtebly to me a \\"DMB can do no wrong\\" type of fan who'll give 5 stars to anything they put out to make themselves a few extra bucks.And please, Dave, don't put out another Live album.

I kept waiting for one glimmer of hope, or one inkling of justification for spending my hard earned money on this trash, but I couldn't find one.

Well, for starters, this disc won't even play in my $3900 Cary CD player!!!!! It won't even read the disc!!! I had to use my portable player just to even listen to it!!

It simply does not have that instant classic in the bunch. Here is what may be the problem - Maybe you fans have grown up. I found out about 5 years ago that the farther away from college, the worst this band sounds. They are the \\"frat band\\". There is no real substance to them.That said, I hate the live jams. I prefer the quick 4-5 minutes the way the song is recorded. Even with that in mind, I still did not care too much for this album.

That is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone who likes this album is NOT A DMB FAN!","review":"Everyone lists their credentials as a fan of the DMB first in their reviews. I will spare you that, but I will let you know my Warehouse number is one of the lowest out there. I have been extremely dissapointed in every release since the departure of Steve Lillywhite as their producer. Their sound, once rich with the voice of each band members instruments, has become void of any type of appeal that attracted me and most other DMB fans in the early years. Of course bands change, but DMB has become a slicked down, over produced band. I would recommend that no one buy this album. If you haven't listened to DMB before, go buy and older album that is produced by Steve Lillywhite. You will thanks me, unless you are a Britney/NSYNC fan, then you might like this new release."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck is this?","review":"Did someone just lock Dave & co. in a dark basement, pump in airborne depressents, and tell them they had 24 hours to record a new album?Busted Stuff was disappointing enough, especially in light of the far superior unreleased version.... but this is almost entirely unlistenable.Maybe this was a \\"contractual obligation\\" album that they had to make, like Mike Oldfield's \\"Heaven's Open,\\" and Dave will happily move on to a new publisher now and create something worth listening to again.This thing is abominable.

Electronic beats and way too much repetitive drumming on the album, not the same dave. Change isn't always bad but for this, by far their worst album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music: So-So. Copy Protection: Bad idea.","review":"Thankfully the band has tried something different...unfortunately it doesn't work. Perhaps the worst moments occur as The Millionaire Dave tries to churn out some anti-war protest material. Terrible stuff.Then there's the copy protection...I don't blame the band, but I instead blame the record label. No, it doesn't \\"crash your systems\\" or \\"fry your PC\\" as others have said. You can grab the ISO image and pick out the .WAVs then encode them for MP3 and you can iTunes your little hearts out. Is it a pain? Yes. Is this breaking the law? No - it's fair-use of your property, as long as you don't share it. Was this a good business decision? Absolutely not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Career Suicide","review":"Do I really need to say anything aside from the title? *shrugs* I think they'd have made more money not screwing with everybody's computer and just letting people do what they do and getting over the fact that they are missing out on a bit of money from people downloading vs. buying the CD. Sucks to be you. I listened to a friend's copy of this CD... But with all of the computer destroying business... I'm not touching it with a 10 foot pole seeing how I listen to most of my music on my computer... Nice job Dave..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad blues?","review":"This is definitely a departure from what most people view as the DMB (i.e.: Under the table & dreaming, Crash, etc), so don't buy it if that's what you're looking for.It sounds more like a bad blues album with a lot of musical/lyrical repitition and lack of the normal insightful/creative lyrics that I've come to expect from these guys. I bought it because I like the African influenced rhythms in the first few tracks, but I'm dissapointed in the quality of Matthew's singing on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRABLE ROCORD","review":"Money does funny things to people. In my opinion, it has made the band soft and caused them to stop working. I have been a die hard fan since the early 90's before \\"under the table and dreaming\\" came out. Things faultered when they left the care of producer Steve Lillywhite causing \\"everyday\\" and \\"busted stuff\\" reclessly composed. \\"stand up\\" however, is complete garbage. The first track on the CD is alright, but it sounds like that is the only one that dave showed up to the studio with. The whole album sounds like a bunch of teenagers playing around with that program \\"garage band\\" on their mac's up in their bedrooms. It makes me very sad to see the musical integrity and inspiration die away from this band. I hope they will wake up and take some time to do some serious practicing, playing and writing. I am still waiting for a worthy follow up to \\"before these crowded streets\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD!! BLUE SCREENS YOUR PC","review":"This is unbelievealbe.

Well Boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Pathetic! What's your deal, Dave?","review":"I hear the single for \\"American Baby\\", and the first thing that came to mind was, \\"Not a very good song at all, but it's different.... I still have good hopes for the album.\\" Well, upon listening to the album, I found that American Baby, is by far the best song on the album. Not saying very much for the album, when a mediocre song is tops.I listened to the album three times though, hoping the disc would grow on me. To no avail. This album is absolute garbage, and Dave Matthews should be ashamed of himself for putting out such trash. This album is right up there with Eminem's Encore album as the greatest disappointments of the 21st century in music thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new Dave Matthews Band","review":"I think we can all agree that this album is very much not like the DAve Matthews Band of the old days. I would argue that if some random badn put this album out and all you DMB fans heard it, you wouldn't like it. It's because it's DMB you are blinded, and you can't see past the fact that it's DMB and it actually is a bad album. This album is not Dave Matthews Band you find on Under the Table and Dreaming, Crash, Before These Crowded Streets and Busted Stuff. If you like those albums quite a bit and dismiss Everyday as a non-DMB album as well, you won't like this. It's junk, overly produced and I hate it. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"DMB has been a favorite band of mine and I was really looking forwad to this album. Big Disappointment. If you take Dave's voice out of the music, you would never guess it was the other DMB musicians playing. The DVD is kinda cool. But it's 20 minutes or so. On the DVD, Dave mentions that on this album Carter is really allowed to open up and do what he does best that drives other drummers crazy. ??? He does? Cause if so, it's on a different version of this album. Carter is the man, but the drumming on this cd is nothing special. In my opinion, they should never, ever, ever make another cd with the producer they picked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technology at It's Worst","review":"I can appreciate that bands need to explore different forms and strive to be different with each album. However, this album just doesn't cut it for me outside of a few tunes like Dreamgirl. What's even worse is this is the first anti-piracy disc I've purchased that is a rolay PIA to play on my desktop. The need to constantly ask for me to accept the digital key policy and the inability to listen to it through my other cd player software such as MusicMatch Jukebox is a joke. If this is the way DMB wants to distribute their new stuff then I'll be more than happy to \\"stand up\\" and tell them to stick it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"I was a little nervous about the new album since I didn't really care for \\"Busted Stuff\\" or Dave's solo album. However, \\"Stand Up\\" is a really solid collection of new music. The band gives us a dose of its earlier sound, and \\"Stand Up\\" is more reminiscent of \\"Crash\\" and \\"Under the Table and Dreaming\\" than anything DMB has done recently. \\"Dreamgirl\\" is probably my favorite song on the CD, but I enjoyed every track. The album is very mellow and fun to listen to...some of the songs are a bit \\"poppy,\\" but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I hope I get to see the band play all their new songs on tour this summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual Disc--Be Careful","review":"I bought the dual disc this morning, but when I got it home, it wouldn't play on my computer or in the cd player. There's a small print warning on the back of the CD they pointed out to me in the store when I returned it that says the audio side of the CD will not play on all CD players.So, be careful buying the dual-disc--I had to exchange it for the one-sided CD.Otherwise, it's a great album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Dave I Grew To Love","review":"This is not the Dave that the true fans know and love. The band has lost its way. Having 24 CDs means nothing...I started listening to this band from the creation and was in owe with its creativity and step away from the norm. They have sense been taken in by the commercial world of crappy pop/new age rock. And this pains me to make a comment like this about DMB. But, given the last three albums (not including Some Devil) I would say it is over with this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cheapest piece of crap...","review":"Do yourself a favor, and take advise from an avid listener of the Dave Matthews Band, DO NOT BUY THIS DISK! While the music is good, the CD is just terrible. There are so many copy protections on this disk, that playing it on a cd player is just impossible. I recently bought a new model of the Sony A-Trac CD/MP3 player, and the original disk won't even work on it...It's best to wait for an mp3 release of these songs, then purchase them online..."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Coming from DMB this is shocking. This is just plain bad. These songs just don't flow at all they're all over the map unlike his previous works which makes this more of a let down.

Ill be downloading every CD from now on if I cant load it onto my ipod.And outside of that the music isnt DMB.I dont know what it is.I do know that iam selling my tickets to his concert this summer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting sound, but not for this listener","review":"A startling departure into a different direction, this new CD takes getting used to. Unfortunately for this listener it doesn't work. It sounds heavier and darker than earlier DMB; even Dave's vocals sound subdued. There was nothing here that made me think 'wow, impressive'. I've always appreciated DMB's music with their introspective and enlightening lyrics without any 'hard sell' of their viewpoint, but there's not much of that earlier Dave here. It's pretty heavy-handed in sound and production.Dave made a comment during a performance on MTV of music from his solo effort that there were things he wanted to try for a while but they didn't work with his band, hence the solo album. Maybe he's trying something new, because we all know that you either grow together or you grow apart. I respect that they take these chances, as long as tomorrow they don't say goodbye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well *I* liked it.","review":"What's with all the reviews complaining that the cd copyright protected? How about actually reviewing the *music* that's on the cd instead?Anyways, I'm glad that Dave Matthews is back and as good as ever. \\"American Baby\\" and \\"Louisiana Bayou\\" are the two best songs on the album. They're so catchy I'm listening to them over and over. I'm also glad that Dave and Co. have shortened their songs a bit. I mean, how many 9+ minute songs can you have? Thankfully Dave has the guts to try something a wee bit different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what really has happened?","review":"Add this one to the other last two albums, which were also bad, and sounded like they were just checking a box on the \\"to-do\\" list. This one especially sounds (again) over produced and just lacked that special folk rhythm and smooth vocals that made DMB so great. I'm not sure you can even really hear Boyd on this album.I'm scared that the end is near for this band that definitely gave spice to the life of normal people in the 90's. They will always hold a place in my memories but they will not commandeer my wallet anymore.Sorry Dave..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse DMB Album Ever Made","review":"I am about as hard-core Dave Matthews as you can get. I own every single album, dvd, and have a pretty big collection of bootlegs. My expectations for this release were not that high, given that Dave has been in a slump since Before These Crowded Streets (Everyday has its moments, but wasn't even in the same category as his previous albums), but what the heck was he thinking on this one? The only song that's even listenable is American Baby and it's not that good. Sorry to say, but the mish-mesh of leftovers from Busted Stuff is way better than anything this album even comes close to! Don't waste your money on this album. If you must listen to it out of curiosity, borrow it from someone you know that made the mistake of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DualDisc is a waste of money","review":"I'm giving the DualDisc 1 star. I'm not reviewing the album because I've only listened to it once. The problem is with the DualDisc. The DVD side sounds nice in Surround Sound Stereo, but this disc will not play in my car CD player or in my computer so I can't recomend this disc to anyone. I bought it for the bonus DVD features and it was only $2 more. What a waste of money. Just buy the regular disc instead. Avoid DualDisc!Edit:Well I can't change the number of stars and I wish I could. I listened to the album more on the DVD through my computer. The album's different, but I was expecting a lot worse and I like what I hear. Somewhere between 3.5-4 is what I'd give the album. It's a fun, groovy listen. I still stand by my statement that DualDisc sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once upon a time....","review":"there was a great band that had a new fresh sound, that inspired, that was inspired, sounded optimistic, up-beat and was flat-out fun. With this CD, that is all in the past. Now, it seems, the political (?) cause over-shadows the music (the music presumably being the reason the band was formed). A group that has risen to the top because of what this awesome country has to offer now ironically and hypocritcally thinks they have a better way. Destitute, drab and pessimistic this music does little to inspire and is definately not fun. And for God's sake where have Carter's drums gone!?Too bad this CD wasn't dumped out the tour bus septic tank into the Chicago River with the rest of DMB's excrement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in my cd player","review":"First point to consider...I am a major DMB fan, so giving this cd a 2-star rating was tough for me.A lot of frustration was delivered along with this dual cd. The audio side refused to play in any traditional equipment. I had to use my computer to play the audio. I work at my computer and have neither gigantor speakers nor the luxury of the mood to enjoy DMB. The music, to me, was not typical DMB so it went unnoticed. Amazon quickly and easily replaced my defective cd, however, the problems on the new cd were identical...no music on a traditional player.The video side played in my computer and the large portion I have seen is interesting; however, it is not something I would play over and over again like the MUSIC side. A little lacking in Dave himself, though.The only reason this cd got 2-stars is because it is DMB...otherwise it would have received a Zero!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saccharine Trust did it better","review":"There we go, Dave! Stickin' it to the man! I bet you didn't even care when you found out your new CD was going to be copy-protected. After all, you're probably one of those Bush-hating economic conservative hypocrites, you being so rich and all.My theory professor found some way to BURN (yes, illegally, cause I didn't wanna spend my cash on this crap) this CD for me (he's all about DMB for some reason) and told me I'd probably like it (I generally like fusion, jazz-rock, jazzcore, so on.)However, DMB is a pop band first and foremost; they're a hit-making machine led on a tight leash by some off-key drunkard named Dave St. Matthews or something like that.I can't wait for his band to kick him out and change their name to \\"The Supremely Awesome Hercules-Riding-A-Motorcycle Jam Band\\" and they'll do all sorts of cool stuff that makes us throw away our Phish records in shame of spending our time with lesser jam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Like everyone has said, this CD is basically useless. I can't put it into ITunes to play it on my IPod. It's a sad day when a band lets their record label put what's essentially spyware onto their CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT","review":"You can't put this music on an MP3 player, thanks to the brilliant copy protection scheme that causes so many problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stand Up","review":"Nothing like the DMB of old.DMB should go back to their old manager/arranger. I'll listen to my old DMB CD's and enjoy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthew Stand Up","review":"CD tray was broken (due to shipment?), but CD and booklet were in very good conditions, actually it was a new and unused item. I do not like the music, but that is not something the seller is responsible for ...;-)))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful, don't buy it","review":"I loved the Lillywhite studio albums (and Busted Stuff which we all know was Lillywhite) but Everyday was a joke and this album is a complete disaster. So disappointed.Where to begin? Bad song-writing and lyrics, none of those great cohesive jams they used to do, DM's voice is craggy, all kind of electronic experimental crap going on -- is that machine gun fire in the background?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrically lacking","review":"Maybe it's a coincidence that printed lyrics don't come with the artwork on \\"Stand Up\\", but maybe it's because there's not much depth to plumb here. Lyrically, this is Dave Matthews' weakest offering to date. The songs \\"Stand Up\\", \\"Wake Up\\", \\"Hello Again\\" and \\"Louisiana Bayou\\" all have a very fast, repetitive chorus which is sung over and over, ad nauseum. What makes it worse is that the repetition doesn't allow for any of the musicians to veer from the track and experiment with the melody. There are a few really enjoyable, melodic laidback tunes on the album, but again, they don't have the lyrical heft of \\"Don't Drink the Water\\" or \\"Proudest Monkey\\" or \\"Ants Marching\\". Fortunately, the band's website offered this album as a package deal with three previously unreleased live albums, so I am at least enjoying those. Check out the website for their latest live albums, and don't be surprised if \\"Stand Up\\" leaves you underwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Matthews BAND?!","review":"Was the band replaced with a drum machine? This album is painfully bad, and should not be listener supported. And it can't even get being bad right, it's unevenly bad all the way through and sounds like it was produced by 14 different people, all of whom had never listened to DMB. I would have been very happy with something comparable to Everyday or Dave's solo album, they weren't classic, but still solid. Where is the instrumentation? Will the band just go on break when these are performed live? This album could almost be a nightmare worst case scenario of what the Dave solo album could have been. Is \\"Old Dirt Hill\\" a Sugar Ray song? Did Dr. Dre produce \\"Smooth Rider\\"? Only \\"American Baby\\" and the last song \\"Hunger\\" have any passing resemblance to a DMB song, and even that is oddly guitar-heavy. This on top of the abysmal Weezer album pretty much cements the fact that everything I grew up with has run its course. How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! This CD will ruin your Windows computer!","review":"Sony has designed this CD so that if you want to play it on your PC you have to install some very poorly written software that will leave your computer vulnerable to viruses and hackers--and if you remove the software, you won't be able to use your CD drive at all! Check around the internet, there's a lot of talk about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for the last time.","review":"I give up on DM. He sounds like he has Emphysema on this album along with the lack of melody and instumental talent that had made his '90s albums great. His bands talent went with the sewage that he dumped on those poor people on the tour boat in Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"where'd ya go, Dave?","review":"...When I first listened to this album, I thought I bought the wrong CD. \\"Where'd ya go, Dave?\\" ...The sweet sounds of all the members of DMB have seemed to be replaced with bubblegum pop beats and lyrics that would make you say to yourself: \\"Man, Fred Durst's lyrics aren't SO whack afterall.\\" or \\"I wonder what song the Backstreet Boys will release next?!\\" The past couple of albums (*excluding the live albums which always jam) have been a little disappointing. What happened to the sound that made them the Dave Matthews Band, leaving all the other bands behind? It seems like they have been trying to make music for people to like them, rather than just go out and have fun. If you disagree with this review, and would like a free copy of this album, please let me know because i'd be more than happy to send it to you. This purchase was a very BIG disappointment. I've only listened to it once, and have been thinking of using the CD as a coaster. Come back, Dave. We miss you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mm...what happened?","review":"I respect DMB from where they came from and what they have created for us all over the years. The days of Under the Table and Dreaming, Crash, and the energy the songs had was incredible and moving. Now it seems as if they have steared in different directions and have got lost in the grievances in the world and lost the energy. Just kind of disappointing. I was hoping the energy would have come back on this one. Yes I'm a die hard fan and understand Dave's got some messages to get across but what about the good? Must be something positive to sing about. Well here's to dreaming. Like they say \\"I'll go in this way and find my own way out.\\" Hope they find the energy and bring it back to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's LeRoi and Boyd","review":"As a DMB fan for years, I was greatly disappointed with the new release. I didn't realize LeRoi (sax) and Boyd (sax) had left the band...... For the most part, these 2 fine musicians are left out of the \\"mix\\". In addition, for Carter (drums), new producer Mark Batson, could have replaced him the a programmed drum. It's interesting that all of the songs and most of the keyboards are played by Mark Batson? Is he now a member? What made DMB different was the sax, violin and drumming. They sound more like everything else that's out there now."},{"rating":"1","title":"So VERY disappointing","review":"I have been a DMB fan from just about the beginning. I was eager for the new album, but had my reservations when I read that it was being produced by a guy working with Beyonce and 50 cent. Unfortunately it's even worse than I feared. There is so much horrible R&B glossy crap on these songs that, even if they were good, would render them unlistenable. I think the single worst thing has to be the way the percussion has suffered. I've alway been a big fan of Carter's drumming AND drum sound overall. Every kick on the bass drum here has been overdone with that trendy low thud instead of actually hearing the sound of the drum itself. And his playing has been completely restricted to the pocket. None of that tasty work on the hi-hats this time around. I won't bother going into the rest of it because there's no point. It greatly pains me to write this, but this disc is crap. I can only pray that they come to their senses after this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!","review":"HUGE dissapointment. I'm not usually one to give extremely bad reviews, but this one deserves it. You cannot rip this CD without installing some mysterious software on your computer which seriously limits what you can do, and quite possibly has spyware.

Beauty Habit shipped it securely and it arrived genuine and in good condition as stated in the Amazon description. Beauty Habit also included a few well known, upper end samples.

I thought it was too stark, too melancholy, too dark. When you are young the world is more of a technicolor place and perhaps we are all unwilling to let the dark clouds into it. I resaw this film when I was in my 50s and my reaction was much different. There is a melancholy yet bittersweet quality to this film, almost a dreamlike glide through the corridors of memory and time. For it is an old person who will die sooner, rather than later, who is looking back on his whole life and his memories as well as winding up his life as it exists in the present. Everyone who has made it to an older age will recognize the territory of the film at once as very, very familiar. It is a Swedish professor who we watch on this journey. His relationships in life have been turbulent but not out of the ordinary. It is a beautiful film, one of Bergman's very best and he didn't make any duds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reflection on a life's choices","review":"Ingmar Bergman's \\"Wild Strawberries\\" (1957) follows the memories of an elderly man reminiscing about his life.

Awesome roller coaster ride of a movie that gives you fears you never thought you could have. The best scene has to be when the spider drapes across the television set during FAMILY TIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved PQ & AQ. Spiders in HD","review":"As you may or may not know, Arachnophobia was pushed back to a later release date because the original HD transfer was too dark. Now with the remastered Arachnophobia Blu-ray release some reviewers are saying that the picture is too light in some scenes. Honestly, I think it is perfect. I have always loved this movie and this is by far the very best it has ever looked and sounded.The extras may leave something to be desired for some, however this is not the type of movie that I want to know how they did it. I don't want to know that they had little strings guiding spiders around to make them do what they want them to do. I think knowing some things about some movies really takes the magic of the movie away.Highly recommened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong region","review":"Unfortunately this DVD does not play in Ireland, the display says \\"wrong region\\" , the DVD is perfect but not for Ireland , I could not return it as I opened the DVD packaging in order to play it .

The directing by Frank Marshall could have been a bit more thoughtful.Let's not forget the man made Congo. If that doesn't give away the film's quality I don't know what does. Only redeeming Quality is John Goodman."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPIDERS!!","review":"I thought this movie was way far fetchedam I am terribly terrified of spiders..but this movie was because of a spider comingfrom South America and having deadly babes andthe people needing to kill them.. I didn't likeit very well. No offense to the people who do likeit..that is just my oppinion.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, creepy entertainment","review":"This was a good movie. Creepy in the right way. Doesn't quite do to spiders what Jaws did with sharks, but worth the viewing.On a side note, I can't believe the moron who complained about the killing of spiders in this movie. Pal, life must be pretty boring for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary and funny.","review":"I am not a fan of horror or thriller movies, but I have seen this one several times. The first time I saw it I screamed through almost the whole thing. It scared me to death! I am absolutely terrified of spiders and yet I watched it. *lol* For those who like a good scare (minus anything overly-gory) with some laughs, this is a good movie to watch. John Goodman is very funny as the exterminator. I do not recommend this one for children. The language is a bit much. And smaller children could have nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close...","review":"McMurtry didn't even try very hard to show us the young Rangers. The characters are flat, and some of the dialogue is witless. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"McMurtry's Heart Wasn't in This One","review":"While this is a story that has its moments, somehow it isn't up to the standard one expects of Larry McMurtry. I get the impression that this was one he thought he ought to write, rather than being one he wanted to write. The story has too many loose ends, and too many characters that are just there so that they can die before the end of the story - hence the title. Skip this one and go straight to Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read but a little disjointed","review":"Having Read Lonesome Dove and Streets of Laredo, I found this book to be also quite good. I enjoyed the story line and the characters. The style is vintage McMurtry except for the one weekness I saw. The plot seems to be a bit disjointed, with the characters going from one difficulty to the next without ever really wrapping up anything. It leaves you with an unfullfilled feeling at the end. I guess I just wasn't satisfied. It seems a little too obvious that McMurtry is simply setting us up for another prequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst and most implausible ending ever written.","review":"I give it two stars for the humorous exchanges of Gus and Call, but I was sorely disappointed in the plot, and the ending was enough to make me swear off McMurtry for good. Where he got such a group of stupid and hackneyed characters as the Lady and her entourage I'll never know."},{"rating":"2","title":"-","review":"This is my first McMurtry, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. After readding the slight disappointments of the other reviewers though, I'm eager to begin Dove..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Smooth reading, enticing characters.","review":"Sure, nothing can rival Lonesome Dove or Terms Of Endearment, yet, anyway. But this book is so smooth. An easy read that gives you a good feel for what got Call & McCrea started. I loved it, and would love to see some more tales of our two heroes in their younger years! Thanks Larry, a good escape! I'll pass it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageously Bad","review":"Wow... this is one of the most ridiculous story I've ever read. The first 7/8 of the book were plain silly and totally unbelievable. How many times does the author repeat the \\"Gus is afraid of bears\\" contrivance? The last 1/8 of the book was...bizarre. Rescuing an English aristocrat in a leper colony...and then the sick details of Indian torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"No lonesome dove","review":"First of all let me say I loved 'Lonesome Dove'. Loved it. Loved the story, loved the characters, and consider it a classic. Regrettably this isn't in the same league. Most of the dialogue is so stupid it insults the intelligence and the characters seemed cartoonish at best. In fact the whole book felt like a comic book. I found myself skimming over pages until I just couldn't take it any more. At page 310 I skipped to the end, an ending which ranks as one of the dumbest endings I've ever encountered in fiction. I gave it two stars because I did get 300 pages in before calling it quits."},{"rating":"1","title":"dud","review":"i bought this book as i was turning the last few pages of lonesome dove hungry for more stories of gus and mcrae. i was sorely disappointed, this was just plain awful. mcmurtry's writing style changed, so much that i'm convinced he didn't write it. maybe he came up with the story but this wasn't the pulitzer prize winning prose we enjoyed in _ld_. gus and mcrae were wimpy characters, rarely shaping their own world, trudging through a storyline of doom only to end in a scene that made me literally throw the book across the room. i wouldn't read this unless you are totally desperate for another ld novel, or want to say that you \`read every ld book' published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"This was a good story. After reading Lonesome Dove, it was interesting to read about some of the background that led up to it.I really enjoyed this story. The only thing that might have made it any better would be if I didn't know that Gus and Call had to survive the Walk because they were in Lonesome Dove.While this is still not in the same class as Lonesome Dove, it was definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I thought this book was great. McMurtry is an obviously talented storyteller due to his ability to transport the reader into the world of Woodrow Call and Augustus McCrae. Great characters, sharp witty dialog in the Clara Forsythe scenes (ya gotta love her!) and pretty much stunning, shocking scenes of very descriptive, graphic violence in the torturing scenes. I think I will get through these four books with no problem. I'm reading the second installment in this series(which would be \\"Comanche Moon\\"- not in the order they were written, but according to the ages of Gus and Woodrow) and I am finding it very hard to put down, too. It's a pity these books are rather bulky. Once I finish them I will wish I hadn't done so...that's the only bad part I can see so far. Other than that, congratulations Mr McMurtry. I speak on behalf of my father and I when I say that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supurb unsentimental adventure","review":"I read this before reading Lonesome Dove so I could not compare it at the time. Nevertheless this novel kept me reading breathlessly to the end. Full of raw spirit, realistic descriptions, and free of moral pretensions. Like many of McMurty's work the open endings need to be there. Like life itself, a by the end of the book you know the story just continues - there can be no simple, convenient conclusions. A perfect prequel to Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"2","title":"dead man's walk","review":"My first mcmurtry read and I was not disappointed. It was great. I would recommend it to anyone who loves adventure and action novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch McMurtry","review":"Written after LONESOME DOVE but actually a prequel to it, this is about Gus and Call when they were young men and members of the Texas Rangers. They are quickly disillusioned by the incompetent leadership of Col. Caleb Cobb; they also come up against some pretty rough Comanches and tough Mexican soldiers. Worst of all, they have to walk across the Jornado del Muerto, an immense desert region, which they just barely survive. It contains all the things that made LONESOME DOVE great, except for the variety of outlandish characters that peopled that novel. If you like McMurtry's writing style, his fascination with the grotesque, his depiction of people as just blundering along at times, his lack of shyness in describing violent events - and all of it swathed in a Twainian understated humor - you should enjoy this book very much. Not as good as LONESOME DOVE (nothing is), but a major achievement for McMurtry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rushed, contrived money-spinner.","review":"After the amazing Lonesome Dove and the rather good sequel, Streets of Laredo, McMurtry hits us with a book that simply doesn't make the grade. It reeks of his editor saying, \\"You have got to write another book this year, why don't you use those two rangers again?\\". The book starts quite well, with some gritty scenes but quickly goes downhill from there, ending with one of the most ridiculously contrived endings I have ever had the misfortune to read. Not even, McMurtry's often brilliant style can save this book. Symptoms of the book being rushed are everywhere (e.g. Saying that McCrae is Scottish when in Lonesome Dove they comment on Call's Scottish roots).All in all, a total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Man's Walk - a review","review":"Woodrow Call and Agustus McCrae are very young men, just embarking on their adventures as Texas Rangers when this book takes place. I have to admit it was rather a disappointment. \\"Lonesome Dove\\" is a masterpiece and, in a way, I think McMurty should have left it at that. He uses the central characters from \\"Lonesome Dove\\" in \\"Dead Man's Walk\\", and, especially in regard to Woodrow Call, it just doen't ring true. I just can't see Captain Call of LD as the same Woodrow Call in DMW, particularly when it comes to his relationship with Maggie. Captain Call was a solitary individual,emotionally remote. I don't see this struggle in DMW, or any reason for him to turn inward later in life and to deny his son. The ending of the book seems rather abrubt and far-fetched. If you can separate the idea that these are the same characters from LD, you may enjoy the book on that level. As westerns go, it is an okay read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Prequel","review":"For me, Lonesome Dove is not my favorite of McMurtry's work. It is an excellent book, and I would rate it 5 stars, but I've always enjoyed The Last Picture Show series the most. That being said, Dead Man's Walk is an enjoyable read. It's not Lonesome Dove, but then, who would want to read the exact same story? For me, I like the variety. This story introduces us to some great characters. Gus and Call are fun, as always. People who wanted the story to be another Lonesome Dove -- for the author to be true to the characters -- another Lonesome Dove is not what has been written. They are young men in this story, and it give us an inkling of what helped shape them into the characters we read about later. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially fans of the Lonesome Dove series. It's definitely worth the money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the same person that wrote \\"Lonesome Dove!\\"","review":"I finished this book only because I had started it and somehow expected it to improve down the line. After reading \\"Lonesome Dove\\" I had expected a read at least approaching that of the original of the series. What a disappointment. The writing is almost amateurish. I do not believe L.M. wrote this book, but he obviously put his name on it. Buy at your own risk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, depressing, and disappointing","review":"Lonesome Dove was a fantastic novel, but this prequel is not even close to the same league. McMurtry must have been depressed when he wrote it, because the entire book is very gloomy, and nothing good ever seems to happen to the main characters. This book and Comanche Moon should really be one book, since there is really no conclusion to this book. Neither one of them is a worthy prequel to Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not call it the story of two Jobs?","review":"I thought that this book (which I unfortunately read to the end) was incredibly contrived, and basically just plain stupid. Two young Texas Rangers manage, with no recognizable skills, to survive Indians, floods, fires, wild animals, and the Mexican army. But, of course, they had to survive, since the books that chronicle their later years were already written.So you know what's going to happen, even though much wilier and skilled men, actually, about two or three hundred others, manage to fall victim to various calamities. Just plain stoopid! Everything that happens to our two \\"heroes\\" is bad - everything. It's one sad, miserable, gruesome event after another. It never lets up, yet, in the last few pages, they're saved in a totally unbelievable, Deus ex Machina ending. I'm so mad at myself for reading to the end that I could spit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear of a punk planet","review":"i bought this dvd because it had NOFX on the cover. the movie is a cheasy story line with hardly any nofx influence. i never got into the movie because i was just looking for nofx entertainment. it seems to be a really low budget mtv teenage movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Tremendous","review":"\\"Muso Ko,\\" Habib Koité and Bamada's first album, offers a truly unique and exceptional listening experience. Users of some versions of Windows Vista may have heard a number of the songs on this album with the \\"Sample Music\\" packages distributed with Vista.For listeners unfamiliar with Koité, he sings (primarily) in the Bambara language of his native Mali. The use of this language adds a depth and feeling to the overall listening experience that is both difficult to describe and to understand without actually listening to Koité.Right from the start, with \\"Fatima,\\" through songs of different tempo, such as the fast-moving \\"Nanale\\" and the more harmonically-driven \\"I Ka Barra,\\" this music offers a tremendous listening experience.Highly recommended to all music affectionados."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vibe","review":"Absolutely love this CD from start to finish. I discovered Habib Koite and Bamada when I was traveling in South Africa (a selection from one of their CD's, Ma Ya, was playing in a music store and I liked the song so much I had to buy it on the spot). Searching out more of their music, I bought Muso Ko upon my return and I have to say I like it as much, if not more, than my original purchase. The music is both beautiful and expressive and while not speaking the language, I find myself singing along.

NOT SO ! This music is fantastic !! Why, it even manages to *gasp* cross language barriers ! Imagine that !Seriously, folks, this is is great stuff -- a real find. I listen to music from all over the world all the time, and when this artist rolled around on my random 400-shuffle CD carousel I said \\"Wow ! What is THAT ?\\" and proceeded to take it OUT of the carousel player so that I could enjoy it repeatedly in my car.Est-ce que cela suffit pour l'evidence de l'appreciation de cette musique d'Afrique selon les \\"anglophones\\", mon ami ? ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this!","review":"When I first heard Habib on the radio, I had to pull over and call the station immediately to find out who this new genius was. If you are a fan of King Sunny Ade, Ali Farka Toure, Femi or Fela Kuti, you will consume this CD like a pig in nectar. Bursting with rhythm and energy, great talking drums and balafon, wonderful guitar, poignant lyrics, intense call and response harmonies, the whole package absolutely guaranteed to tweak your head off your shoulders if you are a devotee of African music. Track 3, Den Ko is a stunning achievement. Spare in the beginning, building gradually to a magnificent fullness, while maintaining the integrity of each component of the sonic landscape. Also unusual for an African album, there are no turkeys on this album, only good and great songs. Ma Ya is great, too, but for those who want the driving beat tinged with sweet minor key sadness, this is the disc to get. Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Band in a Box","review":"This book and more importantly the CD is a great practice aid. It comes with a number of tracks in many styles, keys and progression. The tracks start out with simple one chord jams and work up to very complicated chord progressions. The accompanying book contains the transcribed chord chart with suggestions for scales, key center etc. This information is key to using the CD.The backing band is very professional and the chord progression can be very demanding. All in all an excellent tool to further developing your shops - intermediate to advanced players will get the most out of this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unejectable!","review":"Ms. Black's first release is one of those rare albums that combines honest, heartfelt lyrics and music that somehow genuinely translates and communicates them.

DK is no doubt the greatest punk band that has and ever will grace the now defunct 'scene'. This album is more of a compilation of various songs that they either scratched in the past or songs of various significance to the people who compiled it. I think this is my 3rd favorite because Fresh Fruit and Plastic Surgery Disasters are such incredible works, worthy in my mind of being the top two albums that I've ever heard. It's too bad that the members of DK are now engaged in a court battle, mainly Ray and co. against Biafra for alleged non payment from Biafra's label alternative tentacles.. or so I think that's case. I wish Biafra could find a new way to surface these days; He's such a dynamic guy. His spoken word stuff is somewhat disheartening I must admit, but hey, you've gotta make a living.

More D.K. crap","review":"So i have tried to give them a shot on more than one occasion but anytime i hear the vocals all i can picture is Katherine Hepburn with a microphone. But singing (un)talent aside, lyrically it isnt much better. Political songs are the easiest to write as long as you have an opinion, and the lyrics to any Dead Kennedy song can be written by a 16 year old boy who watches CNN and has an ego.

I am a huge fan of Chuck Connors, and have been since childhood, back in the early 60's. This book is almost totally about his career, as opposed to his personal life, which the title implies. Mr. Fury obviously spent a lot of time on research, but took the wrong direction. Chuck Connors childhood was skimmed over, especially his obscure relationship with his father. No picture of Chuck's dad or sister were included. It seemed more like a list of productions he had been in, rather than his life. I hope someone close to Chuck Connors tries to write a more intimate story about him in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair filmography, terrible biography","review":"The amazing thing about this book is that aside from Chuck Connor's having a good sense of humor, you learn almost nothing about his personal life. His childhood is ignored, there is one paragraph about Chuck meeting and marrying his first wife, one sentence about their divorce, and even less about his subsequent marriages. Reading this book gives you far, far more information about the characters Chuck played onscreen than about Chuck himself. A major dissapointment to a true fan of The Rifleman and the man who played him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Details career, lacking info on personal life.","review":"You can find out a lot about Chuck Connors career in this book, but little about his personal life.

Montenegro knows a lot in this earth. He breathes it. It doesn't matter what the confused critics say. Even if you get initiated and pretend to be something, it doesn't necessarily happen for you. I've seen a lot of ugly nonsense tossed back and forth by initiated lunatics in these houses. Sounds like the critics of Montenegro are just such idiots. Montenegro's books are very interesting. One has to be a real roots man to appreciate them.

I'm a huge fan but I got this primarly as an in between read. However, I was not disappointed! Hard Contact was well written, you really get to know the characters, and it's fairly short so most anyone can get through it quickly. For those considering this book it works well as a stand-alone, so well in fact that I would recommend ONLY reading this book in the series because immediately after Hard Contact the stories lose focus, are WAY too long, and become Jedi-hating soap-opras. This is by far the best written book of the Republic Commando series, so if you're on the fence about it I would say get this one and stop there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"I was concerned that without any \\"known\\" characters, this book would not be very interesting but it definately was. The author does an excellent job laying out the characters and helping the reader get to know them. So before long, in the mind of the reader, they are \\"known\\" characters. Excellent job detailing out the clones. The auther paid close attention to \\"how they speak\\" in the movies and has carried that forward.

Although it gets quite philosophical about breeding men to fight and die, it's still a kick-butt action story that features some clever characterization and \\"Star Wars\\"-style banter. It fits in perfectly with the tone of the last two prequel films (good thing as it's set between them) - as the Jedi search their souls while continuing to fight ruthless villains on alien worlds. You'll get to know (and love) clones in this one.I guess I only have two minor knocks against the story - one was that other than the poisonous rat-like gdans, the setting was fairly mundane (actually seemed a lot like Indiana). Another was that the fight at the end, the climax, seemed a little too straightforward. These are minor quibbles, though.The other reviewers are right: this is a good \\"Star Wars\\" story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - awsome development of characters","review":"What a awsome book. I was surprised by the depth of character development by the author and how the story progressed to a great conclusion. I hope that the Omega Squad will come back again for another book under such as good author as this. I recommend this book not only to SW fans, but to fans of military fiction as well.

If you still believe in the whole haunted house story, you are about to change your mind.

To the makers credit they scored personal interviews with Defeo family neighbors and close friends who give insight into the family and the events leading up to the murders along with rare family photographs not seen in almost 40 years.The Defeo murders were best summed up by attorney William Weber. \\" This was the murder of a family, that could have been your neighbor or mine \\" Granted there were problems in it but all families do. The best book written on the Defeo Murders was done in 1981 called \\" High Hopes The Amityville Murders \\". I cannot give this documentary more than 2 stars despite it's qualities because too much of the so called facts in it have been debunked by reliable sources and the Brigante and Defeo families long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"This story as told is hard to believe.

I didn't get a chance to use it much, as it was stolen a few weeks after I bought it, but I just placed an order for another. Sure, it doesn't have the fancy features that the Skil offered, but it cuts a perfectly straight and plumb line every time, which the Skil NEVER did, in fancy mode or not. At twice the price it was worth every penny. Can't wait for my new one to arrive. A real tool for real work - reliable and accurate. Refreshing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great saw","review":"I bought a new Bosch 1590ESV jig saw a few weeks ago(got mine on E-bay). I'm extreamly satisfied. Lots of power.

Bosch should be ashamed of themselves for this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"multi-purpose tool for DIYers","review":"This was the first time I had used a jig saw. And it was for purposes of nailing down solid hardwood flooring at home. The 3 blades that accompany the jigsaw are also good. Cutting angles was not as clean as say a miter saw. But all in all, its a great multi-purpose tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Really no need to review this Jig Saw, as it is simply the best. My cost more than the others, but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Jigsaw I Have Ever Used","review":"This jigsaw is by far the best jigsaw I have ever used. I am an amateur and I have used it for various jobs around the house and to install a laminate floor. Laminate flooring is very tough on a saw. This jigsaw had plenty of power. The integrated blower worked quite well. I had no problem following the line. Changing blades is one of the best features of this saw. You literally eject the old blade with a button! Two more features I was not expecting was a boot cover and anti-splintering insert. If you are cutting delicate materials it comes with a plastic boot cover to prevent scratching. The anti-splintering insert clips in around the blade to support the material. These two small yet very useful features were very handy while cutting the flooring. This is not the cheapest saw you can buy, but go ahead and spend a few extra dollars. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best jigsaw I ever tried","review":"The first project I did with the saw was to cut an opening in a steel door. I didn't even feel any resistance and the cut was right on the line. What more could you want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This saw has all the options and when it works it is better then everything on the market. One major problem. The keyless blade change mechanism is made of plastic and metal mixed. I had my saw for two weeks. The blade got stuck and I immediately released the trigger. I was not worried Bosch has things in place to avoid damage. I then saw the balde fall out and found the plastic and metal keyless blade mechanism was broken. I did some research and found this is a common problem. Until Bosch changes to a better keyless blade mechanism I would NOT buy this saw. Sooner or later yours will fail also don't risk it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to use","review":"My old Skil jigsaw was 10+ years old. I had no idea how much better a jig saw could be. The Bosch is powerful and has several nice features like the precision guide, no tool required blade change, blower to blow chips away, and positive lock for angled cuts.The instruction manual is excellent due to its clear and concise information. The storage/carrying case is well designed and has enough space for the cord to fit without undue hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome saw........Cuts straight..........","review":"This saw was worth every penny paid. It cuts straight because of the blade holding mechanisim. My old saw would let the blade bend slightly and therefore cut unsquare. It is a very powerful saw and has no trouble with any wood type. This is a dream come true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best jig saw out there","review":"I'm a profesional woodworker and use my jig saw almost everyday. There is no other saw I want in my toolbox then the Bosch. It's smooth and has great control. Everything about this screams quality and durability. If you are looking for a jig saw this is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best got better","review":"This is a nifty improvement upon Bosch's excellent jig saws. The base plate is the most noticeable upgrade over the old ones that would bend any time the tool fell, or was dropped. The blade change mechanism is a vast improvement over the previous flimsy, tool-less system, and obviously more convenient than the even older screwdriver models. The machine is solid. Vibration is well controlled, and the tool is reasonably quiet. And of course, it cuts like a Bosch.I do have one quibble, and it's admittedly an odd thing to complain about - The cord is too long! 99.9% of the time I'm using an extension cord anyway, so the extra 6' (or so) of cord serves no purpose other than to be a hassle to pack up.As I said, it's a quibble. Other than that, I can't find anything I'd change with this saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Easy order and very timely delivery for my son-in-law's birthday. With the blades he has an operational tool that he seems to like and use a lot. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"After having a Dewalt DW331k break on me three times I gave up and got the Bosch 1590EVSK. What a difference. This jig saw does what it's asked to do with no complaints. The blade changing system is pretty much fool proof and the bevel adjustment is smooth, quick, and easy. The weight of the machine removes vibration and the variable speed motor is infinitely adjustable and sensitive to finger pressure. It's everything that a carpenter could ask for and it has a wonderfully long cord to boot. The true test will be its longevity but from the workout I have given it so far I am confident that this is one rugged and reliable tool. Goodbye Dewalt; no more junk for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performer","review":"I bought this saw when I was installing about 2400 square feet of laminate flooring. I thought for sure that the by the time that the floor was finished the saw would be as well. Surprisingly, the flooring is long done and the saw is still going strong. In fact, I have installed another laminate floor since then and used this saw to cut stainless steel for a range hood. Many blades later I continue to be impressed by this tool.It is somewhat heavier than most jigsaws, but this works for you as much as against you. The saw does not tend to jump around or shake you to numbness, even if you use it for an extended period of time. On the other hand I would not want to hold this saw upside down making coped joints for very long.All in all this is a great saw that I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"None Better","review":"This is the last jigsaw you will ever buy, unless you buy loaners for your neighbors and kids. CPO sells a minty refurb for @ $20 less but then adds shipping, and doesn't offer Amazon's standard $25 off of any major tool purchase. Your choice. A buck is a buck, and CPO is good.This saw cuts straight and does curves and tight spots extremely well. I am a beginner woodworker but I have tried and owned a couple of other jigsaws that just can't compare. Yes, it's heavier than my old jigsaw, but I don't cut so much that the weight is an issue, and the stability and power more than make up for a little added weight. Forget the price. Tomorrow you won't miss the money and you'll have a jigsaw that will last a lifetime.Buy Bosch Progressor blades and don't look back. They are equal to the saw's ability and then some. More than worth the slight extra money. Don't forget to buy a few special-purpose blades, too. And buy more clamps!Bosch has really figured out the jigsaw and its blades."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I am a heavy tool user. I have been woodworking for many years. I give this Jig saw my highest rating. As soon as I got the saw I put a blade in it with no tools, and I rammed it through some extremely tight turns in 5/4 PT decking as fast and hard as I could. I could not beleive the cut.The saw is a little more money that other in the class, but I beleive it is money well spent.You will not be sorry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a real tool","review":"I have used other jigsaws but this is the first Bosh jigsaw I have had.

Also tossed in are special effects monsters taken from JACOB'S LADDER. None of this new stuff adds anything to the film.This film is also poorly edited. The character keeps waking up, discovering that what happened was a dream. Then waking up again. Now she's in the water, then she isn't, then she's crawling out of the water, then it didn't happen.If you've seen the original, you might be able to guess what's going on in this remake.

The material has been covered before, but what sets the book apart is Flowers is a writer first, a science writer second. The writing is a pleasure to read -- warm, lucid, enthusiastic ... interesting while not talking down to the reader. The only criticism is the photos, which are uninteresting head shots of scientists. There are certainly many more interesting visuals the publisher could have selected to illustrate Flowers's fascinating essays."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DISTANT DEATH","review":"This amazing novel by one of the most interesting Mexican authors attempts to remind us never to forget one of the most horrible moments in human history: The holocaust. While the theme of the novel has been through time analysed, discussed and remembered in a lot of different ways, Jose Emilio Pacheco adds his book to the list with a new innovative technique that forces the reader to participate in the course the story takes. It is a great novel for those who seek readings that stimulate the mind and intellect. I must confess I wasn't thrilled with the theme of the book (as I said, this subject has been over done in a lot of different ways). What is really worth admiring and enjoying is the way Pacheco takes us from one story to another, to discover what lies behind the game of the persecutor and the persecuted."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would recomend","review":"My son loves it and it is a durable pool.Has fun bright toys attached.

I originally inflated in my living room and threw plastic balls into it and used it as a ball pit until it stopped raining outside and was warm enough for her to go swimming. She enjoyed crawling in and out of it. She also loves squeezing the \\"posts\\" the rings go on top of - they make a squeaking noise. It was well worth the $7.99 plus free shipping, and I'm sure she will enjoy it all summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUMMER FUN!","review":"My son had a great time playing in this pool. I bought this item when he was 7 months old, and now he's almost 11 months old and still enjoys playing with all of the inflatable extras that the pool comes with. Every time he pelts one of the stars on the rainbow bar, the bells inside jingle--which he thinks is fabulous! The side poles that hold the colorful rings squeak when you squeeze them, so he has a good time gripping them just to hear them deflate. It's an overall safe toy that your child can enjoy as long as they are supervised, of course. The only difficulty I had was inflating the pool itself. Blowing it up would have taken forever, and using a bike pump would be a workout. Just find one of your buddies with the industrial pump in their garage or take it to the local gas station and it will take less than a minute--it's way easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little pool -- but too little for my active 9 month old ...","review":"I love this pool ...

It barely holds any water (and 1.5 inches) and theres barely any room for other children. I'd be lucky to get 2 1 year olds in it.

I totally agree with the reviewer who stated that these stories would be embarassing to tell in front of others, in fear that they also might fall asleep.Other than the well written article about a bear mauling, the other stories fall flat. Where is the famous \\"Monkey's Paw\\"? The only people who would find these stories remotely scary are tea tottlers or the ocassional camper who gets scared watching an episode of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\".

The author simply repeats many fundamental misconceptions (e.g., that jet engines work by because exhaust gases push on the outside air or that helicopters steer by tilting the rotor axis).

I bought it and gave it to her at the office. The rest of the day her fellow employees kept thumbing through it periodically interupting her, with \\"I bet you didn't know . . .\\", or \\"Listen to this. . .\\" to the point that not much got done the rest of the day.This work, may not be the latest thing, but it provides quotable responses to many frequent twin questions - and I would recommend it to anyone who has, or is closely related to a set of twins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story of the Reagan Presidency as a Failure","review":"I purchased this book to get a sense of why Reagan was so successful as President and so fondly remembered by so many. Lou Cannon's book presents Reagan as a bumbling fool. After reading this book you will get a sense that Reagan failed at everything he did and Americans should look to the Carter administration as the definition of success for presidential administrations. Cannon may have seen Reagan close up as a reporter over decades, but after reading this book, the author never seemed to grasp or understand why Americans liked Reagan. If anything, this book unintentional highlights the disconnect between journalists and Americans through Reagan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable tool","review":"This book provides an insightful and even-handed appraisal of Ronald Reagan and his presidency. The author, a journalist and former White House correspondent for The Washington Post, covered Reagan extensively during his tenure as governor of California, his campaigns for president, and his tenure in the Oval Office. The book describes how Reagan treated the presidency as an opportunity to perform and gave a magnificient performance as president of the United States. The book highlights Reagan's intelligence as an actor, his commitment to his craft, and his success at being presidential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Regardless of my personal admiration for Reagan, as a historian, I was very disappointed with this book. It simply doesn't read like a researched, even book but more like something written by a journalist, which, of course, it was.

This CD of the music of German violinist Louis Spohr has been previously available as a full-price Marco Polo title, and now is offered at budget-line through Naxos. In some ways Spohr can be compared to Paganini, as he wrote these concertos to showcase his own virtuosity on the violin.

She makes a few splendid baskets small as well as large, presented cost break downs, suggested retail prices and potential profits. The video also makes it clear how to save money and where to get bargains. I learned many things from this video, even for my own gift gifting, it was well worth it.

While Michener's story gives you a sense of the migrations of peoples to Hawaii, his work is fiction. For example, Michener's missionaries Abner & Jerusha Hale are fictional people. He had them arrive at Maui, whereas the true missionaries arrived in Kailua-Kona on the Big Island at a different time from Michener's novel. This book gives the facts that show us the real story is more compelling than the fiction.

A noble young man named Boris leaves his family and girlfriend, Veronica (the main character), while he goes to fight for his country.What do I love about this movie? It is realistic. Life doesn't always go the way we think it should. It is also full of warmth and humanity. The characters are ones we sympathize with. And the movie is thought provoking. The imagery, scenery, and music in this film top it off to make it a true work of art.This movie is safe for the family. Boris and Veronica's relationship is entirely pure. And there are no war scenes depicting violence or gore. Our five year old daughter watched it.

This book is an excellent example.It deals with some of the first submersible ships. The submarines described are mainly british or those built by other countries considered potential challengers of the British Empire. The rest are dismissed with little more than a few words or simply ignored. Even then, the best descriptions are mostly anecdotical, so you can find in this book descriptions of the bedroom behavior of members of the british royal family or George Washington's dental prostheses. If you are really interested in serious books about submarines you will find several of them in this excellent website.

It shows how ignored the Damned are compared to other punk bands - Pistols, Clash, Ramones, Buzzcocks, et al. Whatever - this album combines ferocity with psychedelia and a bit of goth as well. Classic tracks include \\"Melody Lee\\" (I love that piano intro), \\"Anti-Pope\\", \\"I Just Can't Be Happy Today\\", and the excellent pair of songs \\"Plan 9 Channel 7\\" and \\"Smash It Up I & II\\". This would be an excellent introduction to the Damned's music. The debut \\"Damned Damned Damned\\" was great too, but only showcased the guitarist's (Brian?) songwriting. He left before this album was made and the other band members took over the songwriting, especially Captain Sensible. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best damned album","review":"In my opinion this is the damned at their punk rock peak.

Minor quibble: the tracks on the Smash It Up single would have been a lovely bonus disc, or just as additional tracks, there is room. And another unreleased track or two would have been welcome.

It has 100 or so tunes, a lot of which are rare these days. This is not a book that will help you to play in celtic music sessions, as the tunes are mostly obscure, and if they are common, Robin always has to throw in some wild variation, or change the tune slightly. His choice of chords is better than anything I've seen in more conventional celtic fiddle books. He teaches the basic ornamentation, and each tune has a paragraph written about it. The record, now a cd, is helpful to learn his stylings and the tunes but only covers a small amount of the tunes printed, 20 maybe. This book has great personality and is much more interesting than the sterile massed produced tune books of today.My only complaint is that I wish it had more tunes in the book and more tunes on the record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain crazy fun!","review":"Excellent movie.

The original one we had bought and I can no longer find was 4 times the size of this one. You could also use the velcro on the bottom to bunch up the stuffed rabbit so the puppy could actually cuddle with it, or you could lay it flat so the puppy could actually curl up and sleep on it.

Laced with stories that easily stimulate my minds eye, I found myself wanting to try the exercises to SEE if they MIGHT just work. And, they had the overall effect of reseting my body's tendency to always go in the same direction, in the same mannerwhile finding myself enjoying the ride. A real gem of mind-body connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This book didn't do a thing for me.

I ordered this watch because of the features on the face. It has military time listed on it, which is not common on most modern pocket watches. When the watch came, it did not function. I took the backing off, and found that the internal workings were very cheap and plastic. The battery that came with the item was dead. I replaced the battery, and the watch still did not work. I will need to take it to a watch shop. The seller is Target, the store does not normally stock this item. As for the watch, it is thin, light and does not have much substance to it. The top mount and time setting post is of an almost plastic material, the chain and belt clip are nice. With some work done, the watch could be nice, but as is, leaves something to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible watch - you get less than you paid for","review":"I have owned two of these watches. The first one ceased keeping accurate time after I had the battery replaced. And I mean wildly inaccurate.The second one did not hold up well. The ring at the top of the watch came off (with normal in-and-out of the pocket use) and could not be replaced. I tried tightening it with pliers and it instantly came off. I used it anyway, and now it has ceased keeping accurate time (even though it is on its original battery).Setting the time is an adventure -- be sure that the button is fully back in or it will never start back up. And I have had the time set button pull out when I pulled the watch out of my pocket.It is a cheap watch -- but you get less than you paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and stylish","review":"This was such a great buy for me.

I was wrong.When you pop out to set the time, the minute hand flops around a teenie bit so when you set the time you have to be careful how you click the set knob back in or it can move the minute hand a little. Not very accurate and really annoying to me.However, yes, it's fine for the price I guess but I'm now looking for another pocket watch. It's not worth it for me to send it back so I'm donating it to a thrift store and spending more money this time for something with a bit more quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended. Avoid.","review":"I got this watch a year or two ago, and it was fine for awhile, but recently it has started losing big chunks of time. Not sure how it happens, but I'll look at when I know it's around 7:30 and it will say 3:15, or something on that order.It will keep time fine for a few days, then will go bad, I'll reset it, it will keep good time again for a few days, then it will go bad again. Can't find any rhyme or reason.Replaced the battery, but that didn't solve the problem.EDIT: finally got frustrated, bought another one. It soon started doing the same thing.A watch should do one thing: keep accurate time. This one doesn't. If you need a shiny $20 paperweight that will sometimes tell the correct time, buy it.

In a unique style that I can only describe as \\"bandito\\" Park merges the gritty honesty and rawness of Maxine Hong Kingston with the surreal unearthliness of Haruki Murakami, throws in the mix his own disciplined intelligence and imagination to create an experience while wholly unique, is transendentally universal.

The former will want to skip this one, but it is a must have for the latter. It's a great way to have Queen's rockinest songs, both from the 70's, and beyond, where Queen prove that they could, and still can kick it. From the early, thoroughly masculine, head-bangin' TIE YOUR MOTHER DOWN and I'M IN LOVE WITH MY CAR to the 80's masterpieces HAMMER TO FALL and ONE VISION, featuring one of Freddie Mercury's best-ever rock vocals, Queen makes you want to turn it up, and up and up!

Buy a test kit to check the water twice a week. Takes 5 minutes. My wife and I enjoy the pool too. Dry the pool completely and store in a large bin for the winter for years of fun.

FIrst off the pump did not work when we set up the pool. After several 1 hour or longer phone calls to Cust. Service we finally got a new pump 3 weeks after the pool was filled. Finally get to use the pool. But only for 6 weeks because now it is time to take it down. Taking it down, we find the entire bottom of the pool to be full of pin holes. Water is seeping out. Called Cust. Service. They will not stand by their product because we did not buy the extended warranty. We didn't even know one wa available.

We couldn't find the leak no matter how hard we tried. We even used the soapy water method but to no avail. It became a hassle to fill it and try to keep it clean. It provided enjoyment for the time we had it. We are thinking of getting the 18 x 48 round frame pool next. As everyone else says, make sure you do the work of getting the yard area level before trying to set it up. We were getting it a little better each year. We used sand for the ground cover, put the tarp over the sand. I hope this information helps others. It was worth it to us.

The replacement pool liner leaked twice as bad as the original pool liner. Further contact with INTEX about the second leaking pool liner, and their position is that \\"it is beyond the 90 days from the original purchase date, therefore there is no longer a warranty!\\"JUST GREAT!! I have received two defective pool liners, and in my opinion INTEX has NOT followed the \\"MAGNUSON-MOSS Federal Warranty Act\\" retail warranty provisions.The pool concept is great, and I encountered no problems during setup (other then the leaky pool liners).

Once we had the tree removed and the debris removed from the pool it is up and running; good as new. Never even deflated it to clean it up. And we are not level, our home back ups to a retention pond so the back of our property sloops. It dropped once and we lost maybe 1,000 of the 5,000 gallons but it had rained for days straight over filling the pool.

I measured from the floor to the very top of the water and it measured 23\\". It was filled all the way and level. Who can swim in 23 inches of water? Also the filter is junk, it's made cheap and can't clean well. Look at the picture on the box and you can tell the adults are sitting and the children are on their knees in the pool. It's a total advertising gimmick. Obviously, the company can't keep their numbers straight. When they said 42\\" they must have meant 24\\". The kids got to play in it a total of 1 hour.

It was a LOT of work, but it was so completely worth the hours and hours of yard work. We are in this thing all the time.This pool is sturdy, the setup is SO easy once you have a level location, and if you follow the instructions and run the pump, it's pristine and clean fun all summer.If you are wondering if this is a good alternative to a permanent pool then STOP wondering!

The CD tracks are clear and straightforward and the tablature is helpful. Many of the turnaround licks themselves, however, are either so elementary that no one of even mediocre skill will use them, or are of limited use because they're heavily jazz-influenced and unnecessarily complicated for guitarists not especially interested in jazz. I'm not a great guitar player, but I've been listening to blues music for decades, and of the 76 tracks on the CD, there's one -- ONE -- that I may try to learn and incorporate into my repertoire.

Then the rainbow shade would keep falling over and it wasn't rounded like in the picture but more like a point. Then the dolphins wouldn't even stand up. I had to stand there and hold it. The slide would just flatten out whenever anyone used it. So needless to say I returned it. It had alot of great stuff and the colors were bright and pretty.

The song with Madonna was SO BORING, what with all the hype, I really expected it to be a smashing number. Please go back to Spanish, although I am from India, I love the Spanish songs.

So, imagine my enthusiam when I heard he would be releasing his (inevitable) English album. But, much to my dismay, the album disappoints. Maybe it's that whole \\"it loses it's meaning through translation\\" thing, because in English, he does nothing for me. Even his catchiest tunes like \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\", are made with predicatble manufactured pop lyrics and hooks.

With \\"Be Careful\\" and \\"She's All I Ever Had\\", this cd is almost as amazing as Ricky's stunning grin."},{"rating":"1","title":"??","review":"This is a pretty average album. I can't understand what all the hype is about. Ricky's god-awful duet with Madonna proves that the Queen of Pop shouldn't sing with people of a lesser talent than herself, which would be, of course, no one. He only brings the potentially beautiful duet down with his album. Otherwise, this mediocre collection has a few high spots, but I really feel as though I wasted my money. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound is great, and it just makes you want to dance!","review":"I really love Ricky Martin's sound. His voice sounds great and his music makes you want to dance. His style is new and unquie and it's great. He has got a great look to go with his sound and I think I see a rising star and a risig career. In closing I'd like to say this album is worth any amount of money because it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky Martin is so fine...and he's mine!","review":"Oh my! Ricky's new CD lives up to all of our expectations. He is so hot! He is very talented and quite amazing. He is so gorgeous! I love his lyrics and beats...they get you dancing. He is definitly eye candy! This CD is very good and I reccomend it to everyone. I LOVE RICK MARTIN!!!!! He is so mine, thank you...by the way, you spell his name with a Y, not an I. Let's see who ends up on Fanatic?! I love both Ricky and his music!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is amazing!","review":"Ricky Martin is a wonderful performer.

I CAN SEE THE PASSION AND STYLE THIS MAN PRESENTS TO MUSIC. THE GQ, SUAVE STYLE IS WHAT MAKES HIS MUSIC HOT TO HEAR AND FEEL TO DANCE. IT'S ABOUT TIME WE SEE A LATINO RIPPIN IT UP AND BEING RECOGNIZED FOR BEING FLY OVERALL. IT'S A ONE AND A MILLION STYLE, CALLED-LATIN CHARM!JULZ"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MARKETING ATOM BOMB!","review":"The fuse has been lit and now watch out for the explosion! The hysteria surrounding the release of this CD is the wildest I've seen in a long time. Is it deserved? Well, yes and no. The choice of material, production and special guests is flawless. The pacing is right on and the entertainment value soars through the stratosphere. Will this CD change the world? No. But then again it is not meant to. History will probably remember this album not for artistic content but for the shear sales volume. This album will be remembered as The Phantom Menace of the music industry. We'll be hearing hit singles from this CD well into the next century and dancing to remixes of those hit singles for just as long. So don't try to fight it...put your dancing shoes on and give into the rhythm. You will have more fun than you thought you would."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Song And Lots Of Filler!.","review":"Like other reviewers of this CD I bought it because I liked the song Livin La Vida Loca which is played a lot on radio stations and to be honest it's the only song I like on this CD!

It's an okay song, but unfortunately the radio played it to death. I bought the cd on the strength of that one song and tried hard to like the rest of the cd. Tried very hard! Other than Cup Of Life, which i found to have more energy and passion than La Vida Loca and is actually a better song, there isn't much left on the disc worth noting ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake your Bon-Bon people, Ricky Martin is here to stay!","review":"This cross-over album is a great success! He has not only conqured Latin America, but it seems he is taking North America by storm. The only thing is he has been around for quite some time, and this is long over due! I have followed his career since his Menudo days, and he gets better and better with every CD. Ricky, you don't know how proud I am to be a Latina! We can do something positive, can't we? The Billboard Award perfomance was GREAT. When he won the award for Best Latin Performer and dedicated his award to Raul Julia it brought tears to my eyes. This CD is a compulation of styles and sounds that you have to hear it many times to get the feel of it. I urge anyone to get out and get the CD. It is well worth the money. Continued Sucess Ricky! Keep Livin' La Vida Loca!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why you should get, Ricky Martin's new cd","review":"I'm a big Ricky Martin fan, epecially since I live in his home land, Puerto Rico, everyone here loves him, so I went and bought his new english-language album and he sounds great and his voice is amazing, so if you thought he was just a ''jump and jive'', kinda guy, think again, some of his songs can touch your heart, with songs like,''she's all I ever had'', ''I am made of you'', are very sentimental but on the other hand, you will get up and dance to, ''livin' la vida loca'' and ''The cup of life'', so go and get this album, and I hope you will enjoy it! PS. Have a nice day"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"This is a great effort from Ricky Martin. I bought the album simply on the strength of the hit single \\"Livin La Vida Loca\\", however there's much more to enjoy throughout the CD. Stands out tracks are, of course, \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\", \\"She's All I Ever Had\\", \\"Shake Your Bon-Bon\\", \\"I Am Made of You\\", and \\"I Count The Minutes\\". I also love the duet with Madonna \\"Be Careful\\", I'm sure that it will be all over the radio pretty soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"We should expect far better from Ricky Martin!","review":"I know Ricky can do better because he already has. I could listen to \\"Vuelve\\" all day, every day. But this CD, I want to turn off as soon as \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\" finishes. ... It's boring. ....nd like cheesy 80's love songs most of us want to forget. Even the duet with Madonna verges on boring. Unless you're a die hard Ricky fan I suggest buying a single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky can shake those hips!!","review":"I love this album & VUELVE. I love the song SHE'S ALL I'VE EVER HAD, BE CAREFUL & especially THE CUP OF LIFE. His presentation at the GRAMMY'S was incredible. I literally got goosebumps after he performed. LIVIN' LA VIDA LOCA has great rhythm & all, but the words are horrible. I didn't pay much attention to the words at first (probably b/c I was so amazed of his good looks & dance moves) but now I listen to them & they make no sense. Ricky, Ricky, Ricky...I hope your next hit song has some better lyrics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheapens latin music","review":"this album does to latin music what pat boone did to rock'n roll -sucks out all the soul in order to make it more palatable to a wider audience -a disgrace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected......Ricky esta no es tu onda..........","review":"A Medio Vivir and Vuelve are great productions; this english album does not even compare to them; believe me you would never get borred with Vuelve or A medio vivir; but this new \\"crossover\\" album its horrible; its borring ; a bad production; exept for \\"Livin La Vida Loca\\" which is not better than any other song on the other albums. And the Maddona and the other girl Duos; are not that great; I expected more of Maddona's song; its the same romantic song with just different words. I have been a fan of Ricky since he moved to Mexico in 1991 and I really like his music and his songs; but this album is not him; believe me; it should have been better; it could have been better... Ni modo amigos...... Hey Ricky stick to spanish it suits you better; and your voice will always sound better in spanish have no doubt about it.R.H.pd spanish ballads will always be better...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beter Imposible","review":"This is one of the best albums i've ever heard,well for that people who don't like latins, we dont,t care because we are getting better every time,thank You Ricky"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the spanish Ricky","review":"I admit the world cup song is very hip but the rest is very flat. I have heard so much about him & was looking forward to this album, but was very disapointed.

The great beat and amazing dancing, makes this album the best one yet! His music has really caught on fast. The man is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky Martin","review":"Surprisingly a CD with a wide variety of songs. From the well-known fast and wild \\"Livin La Vida Loca\\", to the romantic and slower-paced \\"She's All I Ever Had\\", and to an even sad and wistful \\"You Stay With Me\\", this is a CD that can appeal to several different kinds of music-lovers. With great music and a wonderful voice (not to mention good looks and moves), Ricky Martin definitely has talent; and it has all been put together in one album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky, Lots of Flare, Lacks Honesty","review":"The debut of his U.S., self titled album is unquestionably a blockbuster to put it mildly. But Ricky Martin's songs (with the exception of \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\", \\"Be Careful\\" (w/Madonna), and \\"Cup of Life\\"), seem to lack a passion or honesty of sorts. In short, he doesn't seem like he means what he's singing about. Most of the other tracks seem to run together in a gushy, blah ballad of sorts. He's sexy, he's cool, oh yes! But who is the REAL Ricky Matin? Let's hope album # 2 gives us a little more insight! I know we'll all be waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"Ricky Martin has been around for a while, but his first English album leaves much to be desired. Except for the already know hits, \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\", \\"She's All I Ever Had\\", \\"The Cup Of Life\\" and \\"Shake Your Bon-Bon\\" the CD doesn't offer much else. Besides these songs get old fast, after a few times they become annoying. The duet with Madonna is horrific in my opinion, and the rest of the album lacks conviction. Looks aren't everything when it comes to good music. He has the looks but lacks in music intensity. Money would be better spent on Enrique Iglesias' new CD Enrique, looks and good music in one. Ricky Martin's CD isn't a total wash, but there are definetely better works out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caviar at McDonald's!","review":"The problem is not with Martin;the man can sing with inspiration and conviction,he is truly talented,but rather with the ludicrous and dubious market-oriented vibe of this album where the beautiful,passionate and sensual Latino music is butchered and packaged in unsuitable forms.Check out 1998's'Vuelve',a much more honest and emotion-filled Ricky Martin album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Livin' La Vida JOKA","review":"Whatever happend to this guy? He used to be bigger than Elvis, now I think he's waiting tables down in the Mexican cafe I often frequent. Sure, the beats, horns and congas on this album are memorable, but WHERE IS THE SUBSTANCE!! I purchased this record a few years back, thinking it would be full of in-depth lyrics and various sonic moods that would be overwhelming. Instead, what I heard was Michael Jackson plays Mexico City - for his thirteen year old \\"friends!\\"Hey, I dig Mexican music just like the next guy, but this dude is LIVIN' LA VIDA JOKA nowadays!!!!!! Give me the DJ Jazzy Jeff + the Fresh Prince any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excuse me while I throw up..","review":"The cheesy hit \\"Livin' la Vida Loca\\" was kinda of cool, but the rest of this cd is such a nightmare. \\"She's All I've Ever Had\\" is incredibly sappy and \\"Shake Your Bon-Bon\\" is rather embarrassing. Diane Warren's contributed \\"I Count The Minutes\\" isn't much better. Even worse, my mom has a crush on this guy! Argh, stop the insanity!!!! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD","review":"I think this album is really cool! From fast, hot dancing song to slow pace love songs, the duet with Madonna...It's a must buy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"Does this guy ever stop? He is unfiltered pure energy. I have an extensive CD collection of over 2,000 and this is NUMBER ONE in my book. We havn't seen this kind of action since Elton John. He's only 27 and he's already a master of his craft. He's a great artist like Rembrant. I can't wait for his next album, book or fashion design idea to hit the market. If you could bottle charisma and talent, this guy would be a factory like Ford. He's got it all and then some. GO RICKY! GO RICKY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm missing something...","review":"but this was yet another Tommy Mottola-inspired move to capitalize on a large Latino population by overhyping a product that can't even stand on its own merits but instead has to rely on its singers looks SOLELY. I'm sorry Ricky, but no, this is the worst album I've bought in a long time. Talk about dispensible, disposable pointless pop music. I'm completely disgusted, and if I could get my money back, I would. The ONLY decent song is the one with Madonna, and really, that's not saying much either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good CD, but Ricky should stick with spanish.","review":"This is a really good cd, but somehow the lyrics just sound too cheesy in english! It's also less dance oriented than his others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I love Ricky Martin and \\"Vuelve\\" is THE album. Why couldn't he stick with what he's best in, Spanish, latin music? The good beats and the feeling he puts into the Spanish songs are completely missing on this CD. The only good song is \\"Livin' la vida loca\\". I really hope he's gonna go back to his roots again on the next CD, it would be a shame if he didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is muy fantastico!!! Ricky es muy caliente!!!","review":"Hola, to all you Ricky Martin fans!!! The cd \\"Ricky Martin\\" is the best cd I have heard in a long time!!! I especially love the blend of latin pop and english!!! I love the cd because many of the songs on the album, he blends the spanish language into english songs to create diversity that many people are use too!!! My favorite parts of the cd are the fast songs(The Cup of Life and Livin La Vida loca) especially when he breaks into spanish!!! Ricky's music is very inspiring, uplifting, and just loco!!! I give the cd 10 stars!!! I can't wait to hear more of his great music!!! Keep the great work coming!!! And I am your biggest or one of your biggest fans and even though I did not write much about your cd it shows for itself!!! So any one who has not yet purchased it get it now, it's the best cd you'll ever own if you love Ricky!!! Ricky you should think about coming to DELAWARE for a concert or something cause eveyone loves you!!! Adios!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vuelve was better","review":"This one lacks the energy that Vuelve had - He would have been better off sticking to his old style that made him famous in the first place - Only Livin' La Vida Loca comes close. I don't think he will have another hit from here - maybe the Madonna duet as well, but more because of the hype than the song itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ricky is great","review":"He is the hottest singer i have ever seen. i love his songs the are upbeat and it keeps your body moving. Hope he keeps up the great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of '99","review":"A fresh sound (finally)!!!! Not to mention one of the hottest faces on the face of the earth! Music you can dance to and music you can romance to. You won't put anything else in your cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"Having been a huge fan of Ricky Martin for at least four years - yes, four years - I am greatly disappointed in his current album. It lacks the drive, the energy, and the beauty of his two prior CD's - namely, his spanish music. While I remain and will continue to remain a big fan of his, I am dissatisfied with Vida Loca and most of the other tracks on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"i like it, but he can do better","review":"i thought that all his songs would be as fast and cool as \\"here We Go', and \\"Livin LaVida Loca\\" and \\"maria\\" but those were the only ones (and i already knew them upside inside out..hahahhahahahah lol)"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for 2 good songs.","review":"Ricky Martin's c-d only has 2 good songs- Living La Vida Loca and The Cup of Life. That's it. Even the one with Madonna is way awful that I can't even listen to it. ... we like it, we love it, and we expect more of it.ut I've been listening to him since he was singin Spanish only. Even if you are not interested in most of the English tracks, the CD is worth it with the \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\" (English & español), and \\"La Copa De La Vida\\". great sounds of the Latin culture. Way to go, Ricky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but a one trick pony","review":"Given the hype this CD has received I was really looking forward to listening to it. My reaction? Yea the guy is totally amazing looking but an album cover does not make a CD. I found this CD to be one song sung 14 similar ways. This will be a CD I end up using as a drink coaster in a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new album is DISAPPOINTING! EL STINKO!","review":"Ricky is really selling out. I'm a Ricky Martin enthusiast from way back, and I think his music style is being sacrificed for popularity's sake. Maria and La Copa de la Vida were already on previous albums. Who wants to hear a regurgitation of already released songs with lyrics that don't translate well? And as for Livin' La Vida Loca... what can I say? Nice ska beat, indeed, but the lyrics talk about a sleazy woman who's into voodoo. No thanks. Besides, the other songs are not really worth buying the whole album for. I am REALLY disappointed and irritated about the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful music","review":"this cd is excellent. i bought it about a week after it was out and can't stop listening to it. usually the people who are not enjoying it are either to jeleous of him or they just don't like the latin flavor of music. people should just stop worrying that it's only his looks and just listen to the cd and just relax!"},{"rating":"2","title":"he's the bomb!","review":"Rickey Martin is not only, good-looking but has a great voice! The Cup of Life and Livin La Vida Loca are his best songs, since they have such a good beat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy Album....!!!","review":"I have great expectations for this album coz I have seen him perform live long time ago. I knew he will be big. But when I listened to this CD, I was very disappointed coz the music and songs are a in mess....everything is tangled up. I can't even tell who's who singing in the songs...And I'm sad coz it appears that the record company is promoting his image and looks even more than his music talent. Try again next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looks Don't Make a Great Artist","review":"I'm happy to say that I don't own this CD. A friend of mine does, and even he only bought it for \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\". He plays the English version and then skips to the Spanish version before ejecting the CD from his player. And that, ladies and gentlemen is the best way to sum up this CD. At best, there are 3 good songs on here: the aforementioned, plus \\"The Cup of Life\\" and arguably the Madonna duet \\"Cuidado con Mi Corazon\\". The rest of the CD are run of the mill ballads with about as much lyrical depth as a kiddie pool. And ladies (and gents) if you could stop being fixated on his good looks for more than 2 secs, you'd see there really isn't much to his voice either. I'm not saying he has not talent, but his voice is in no way distinctive and he manages to show little range on the album. This flavor of the month doesn't taste that good in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!","review":"As far as hype and new albums goes don't believe the hype. He is supposed to be the \\"Latin lover from Puerto Rico\\". Well, I know I'm male, but I can't see what all the fuss is about. It has to be stated that Ricky Martin has the vocal style of Beck and the rhythm of the Gipsy Kings for that one track. The best song on the album has to be \\"Living la vide loca\\". The rest, unless you are really into soft romantic ballads, is tripe. Unfortunately, \\"Living la vide loca\\" is the highlight of the whole album. Never mind, better luck next time, that is if there is a next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing compared to Vuelve","review":"Ricky rocked on \\"Vuelve\\", but he kinda sinks on \\"Ricky Martin\\". I was expecting so much more and even rushed out to buy it the first day of its release; only to come home, flip it into my CD player and go \\"Huh? That's it?\\" \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\" is possibly the best track on the album while \\"Spanish Eyes\\" and \\"She's All I Ever Had\\" are also respectable tunes. The 11th-hour Madonna duet should have been tossed out because they both sound absolutely lifeless on the track. The other duet with Meja is much better than \\"Be Careful\\". If you like \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\", go out and get the single. If you wanna listen to more of Ricky, go get \\"Vuelve\\" cuz this cross-over doesn't cut the mustard."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute mess, overrated and what a disappointment!","review":"This album is just boring except for \\"Livin La Vida Loca\\", and I was not happy to hear old songs from previous years like \\"Maria\\". In his duet with Madonna \\"Be Careful\\" his voice sounds awful- off key what an embarrasment. Forget this one, or buy it just for the cover.....Ricky you are hot in the looks department but your music has freezed over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ricky Martin isnt really a latin","review":"This album isnt a real latin album. I am embarrased, when people classifised this as latin! Its sounds more like American to me. I am from Norway, and I am fortunate enough, to have discovered REAL latin music on my own. The songs here are redicilus in my opinion, like \\"Livin la vida loca\\" \\"She bangs\\" \\"shake your bon bon\\". The only 2 good songs here(good compares to the rest ...) is Maria and cup of the life.The lyrics doesnt have any depth, and only \\"love songs\\" or more \\"Sex songs\\". None political,Poetic songs. NONE! And the music is the same over and over and over again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a nice surprise...........","review":"Ricky Martin's self-titled album was more than I expected. It is pretty darn catchy with the usual mix of ballads and dance numbers. My absolute favorite song on the album is Private Emotion which I never get sick of listening to. The 2nd best song is I Count the Minutes with a very catchy chorus that you will be singing along with. She's All I Ever Had, Living La Vida Loca, and his duet with Madonna called Be Careful are also featured. The duet is a bit on the slow side but still quite good. I think I like his duet with Christina Aguillera much better (Nobody Wants To Be Lonely) but overall this cd is worth checking out. You have a variety of textures, exotic sounds, and different tempos to keep you from being bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more songs like Livin' La Vida Loca!","review":"I bought this CD for Livin' La Vida Loca and I like that song but that and the Spanish version are the only songs on the CD that I like, the other songs really just don't do anything for me, they are very insipid compared to the energetic and electrifying Livin' La Vida Loca! Now I like Ricky Martin, he's handsome, sexy and he's got a great voice and what girl wouldn't like that and if he put out an album with more lively songs like Livin' La Vida Loca I would buy it in a second and I also have to say that I really don't mind that he also sings some songs in English his voice sounds great with whatever language he sings it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disappointed","review":"In all honesty, I was looking forward to this CD. I remembered him from Menudo (even though I was barely out of diapers), I watched him on General Hospital and thanks to a close Puerto Rican friend, I was familiar with his Spanish works, including his much buzzed about \\"Vuelve\\". So written from the perspective of someone who was never out to get \\"the flavor of the month\\", I have to honestly say this was disappointing. The slow songs are boring and the lyrics are so cliche. In \\"She's All I Ever Had\\", he states, \\"She's my lover; she's my friend.\\" How typical is that? But lyrics and bad melodies aside, the only reason I give it two stars is because there are only 2 half-way decent songs. \\"The Cup..\\" and \\"Livin'...\\". The rest of the album is honestly (poorly) manufactured cross-over latin pop. ... But please, look past the pretty face ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, this is no good, now is it?","review":"Geez, this \\"music\\" sure is ghastly! I - oh, what am I doing?

And Chris Rock wasn't lying. He knew what more and more people are beginning to realize is Ricky Martin is a joke. Songs like the patheic \\"Private Emotion\\", the lame \\"She's All I Ever Had\\", and the silly \\"Shake Your Bon Bon\\" are enough to make him my generation's Tom Jones. These songs do NOT stand the test of time and it makes you wonder what was happening in the world during 1999 to make this guy a success. The only good song is \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\" and after a while, its gets tiring. Trust me when I say, this album is NOT worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ricky Martin go home!","review":"UUGGGHH! Why do people buy this cd? Ricky Martin has no depth, and his lyrics are shallow and meaningless. Words cannot describe how much I hate his songs. Whenever \\"Livin la' Vida Loca\\" comes on the radio, I just want to reach out and punch somebody. \\"The Cup of Life\\" is the same few lines repeated over and over again, and \\"Shake Your Bon Bon\\" has the worst lyrics ever written. For Gods sake, what kind of a title is \\"Shake Your Bon Bon\\"! The only good thing about Ricky Martin is that someday he'll be gone, and that America can turn its attention to some deserving musicians. If your'e a teenybopper loving masochist, then this cd is for you.

I bought this CD and \\"Vuelve\\" at the same time, and there's no comparison. Ricky went way too commercial with his English-language CD. There are too many mediocre songs on it. The ones that really have some genuine spark are the songs sung in Spanish. \\"Bella\\" sounds so much better than the English version. \\"Vuelve\\" is far superior, not only in the choices of tunes, but in Ricky's vocal range.This self-titled CD is not the best introduction to the U.S. English-speaking audience. But I'm hopeful that Ricky will not let us down with his next CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda disappointing.","review":"I have listened to Ricky Martin's CD Vuelve, and i find that one much better. in some of the songs on this CD, his voice isn't as good as i thought it would be. all in all, this CD is very disappointing. i could only find 3-4 songs that i liked on this CD. i couldn't wait for this CD to come out, and when i got it, i was disappointed. i think ricky should stick to spanish music. ...thoroughly enjoying this CD. At least 4 more songs should \\"make-it\\" off this album, \\"Spanish Eyes,\\" \\"She's All I Ever Had,\\" \\"Shake Your Bon-Bon,\\" & \\"Be Careful.\\" What a great voice for Latin & American cultures. The best for both worlds. Ricky's going nowhere but up! I can't wait for the next one.

He is so good looking. In fact the best looking guy I've ever seen. The music in his CD is unique and great for having a good time. Livin La vida Loca is my favorite but I also like the Spanish songs as well. I'm an english speaking American girl and I enjoy listening to different types of music. I also think Ricky Martin and his music was such a good idea, America definitley needed a culture pick up!

The only saving factors for this CD are \\"You Stay With Me\\", \\"I Count The Minutes\\" & \\"Be Careful\\"...although I do have reserves using that as a saving factor.

It is full of fast paced songs and slow ballads. After reading other interviews that dissed him, I had second thoughts about whether or not to buy it, but I am happy I did!

All in all, the whole c.d. rocked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"Living la vida loca is an excellent song, but the rest of the CD is pathetic, if not downright irritating. I am a DJ and buy music to complement my collection of music. The only song that I can see myself using is the above-mentioned song. If that is the best that Ricky Martin can do, then perhaps it would be better if he stayed overseas."},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THIS THE BEST YOU CAN DO?","review":"This CD is not what I expected from Ricky. The quality of it is very low. Only trying to impress the Anglo, and dissapointing your true fans. Repeating Spanigh songs that made you famous in your \\"NEW\\" english CD makes me so mad. It was a waste of my money buying your new CD. Last comment: Ricky Martin nunca seras tan grande como Luis Miguel, que si es verdadero cantante. Tiene mejor voz que tu y es mucho mas guapo. Y sera simpre el Rey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the maxi-single instead!","review":"If you're expecting this album to be as good as his first US single \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\" you're in for a disapointment. It definately lacks the energy of that single or any of his older stuff like \\"Cup of Life\\" . It's full of a bunch of cheesy ballads any one of those boy bands have probably already done and lacks the latin flavor of his previous stuff. However, the ballad with Madonna and the booklet alone (for the yummy pictures) make it a must have for any gay boys out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"RICKY MARTIN ES EL HOMBRE MAS ENCANTADOR DEL MUNDO","review":"Ricky Martin has successfully crossed over. His Salsa music is 100 times better than his English music and tiene un sentido mas profundo, pero su musica americana es tan buena o mejor que los demas.

Total, el si es el hombre mas maravilloso y sabroso que he visto en mi vida y Dios le dio una voz para matar las mujeres de passion y los hombres de envidio.

The music is uplifting and energetic.....GREAT music to DANCE to (which I just did hee heee :) I agree he IS cute, but hey some guys picture isn't gonna have me going NUTS over him...well okay maybe for a minute or two.

Boy, was I wrong! When I first got it, I turned it off after 'Livin La Vida Loca'. Finally, i decided to listen to it all. It was awesome! I loved 'She's All I Ever Had' so much, I played it at my wedding as the first slow dance. And the rest of the music is awesome, a little bubble-gummy, but awesome! it covers ever genre of music anyone could want. BUY THIS CD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok..... But....","review":"Well, this CD is okay... BUT the music is too noisy....! When I first listened to it, it nearly drive me nuts....! Too much background music I supposed.

Buy it,,or you'll miss the greatest music experience of the millemium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Ricky's best","review":"My favorite until this CD was Au Medio Vevir, but Ricky proves he's got more than just a sweet romantic voice on this collection of fast dance tracks and of course the Get Up and Shake Your Booty \\"Livin La Vida Loca.\\" Ricky takes Latin music into the mainstream like Gloria Estefan and Selena did, and the results are stunning. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next best thing to Ricky in person","review":"Granted, all of the songs aren't great, but very few performers can do that. After watching his TV special and then listening to the CD, watching him definitely adds to the listening pleasure. Ricky has a nice voice, but it's not great or distinctive, but he is beautiful to look at. I liked the Spanish versions of the songs best. The ballads were okay, but that is not his forte. I'm glad I bought the CD and plan to buy more of his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed!!!","review":"I was expecting a better album by Ricky although I alredy knew that his voice is limited;nevertheless with proper songs He can sound great. Unfortunately the songs in this album aren't the appropiate for him,all the ballads sound boredspecially the duet with Madonna(a totally waste of time)something like Ray of light would have been better.I hope his next album emends all the mistakes made in this one because He is a good performer full of energy and Livin' la vida loca isjust SUPERB!!!."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a huge disappointment","review":"The excitement and beauty of his music falls so short when translated into English. His upbeat salsa music sounds flat (compare the two versions of Livin' La Vida Loca and you'll see); his ballads sound like bubblegum music--more from his Menudo days than from his last CD Vuelve. His duet with Madonna is remarkably boring. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is definitely an in-your-face CD!","review":"What an amazing album. This is definitely Ricky Martin's best American album. I liked SOUND LOADED, too. But nothing beats his self-titled American debut! With hit singles like \\"Livin' La Vida Loca\\", \\"She's All I Ever Had\\", \\"Shake Your Bon-Bon\\", \\"The Cup Of Life\\", and \\"Maria\\"...how could you go wrong? Another one of my personal favorites which I think was released as a single but didn't make it very high on the Pop charts was \\"Private Emotion\\", a duet with Meja. Ricky Martin definitely knows how to groove and shake his bon-bon. One of his most awesome performances was singing the Spanish version of \\"The Cup Of Life\\" at the 1999 Grammy Awards - that performance really did rock the house! I think he has awesome vocals and a unique style in music. ... RICKY MARTIN is one awesome album and I think everybody who likes Latin music should get this! A must-buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a video by it's...","review":"If you're expecting a video on primitive hunting, look elsewhere! The video shows no actual hunting at all.

The box I received did not have the NDS name stamped anywhere on it. Instead it was marked as being a DrainTech box. Perhaps DrainTech is a subsidiary of NDS? Anyway, the box still seems to be very sturdy. I weigh about 260 and I can bounce up and down on it without the box or lid flexing too badly. I have a smaller NDS box for another set of valves and the lid snaps on much more securely than the DrainTech. The only thing I don't like is that there are two large holes on each side of the box that are put in by the factory. In my application I couldn't use either hole and all they would do is let dirt and water in. I blocked each one off with some 1/8\\" pieces of PVC plastic and then backfilled with crushed stone.

We do know, however, that we are magnetically drawn to the sultry beats of nearly all Brazilian music. Celso Fonseca, a superb singer/musician, is our latest Brazilian discovery. Fonseca's self-produced cd, \`Rive Gauche Rio', is an enthralling piece of work. Grounded by the gentle strum of his guitar, Fonseca's alluring ballads are buoyed by the tasteful presence of horns, multi-tracked vocals, gentle percussion and modern studio devices and techniques. Fonseca's melodies and performances exude warmth and sensuality. Unfortunately, we may have to learn Portuguese in order to properly assess his way with words (although two songs are sung in English, including an intriguing rendition of Irish folk-singer, Damien Rice's \`Delicate'). But really, with music this sumptuous, words hardly matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celso Fonseca - Rive Gauche Rio","review":"Brazil has never sounded better. Even though Celso Fonseca's second album RIVE GAUCHE RIO starts on the minor key and quietly icy electronics of \\"O Rio Para Trás,\\" summer quickly sets in by \\"Por Acaso, Pela Tarde.\\" As always, Fonseca's vocals are solid and never forced. The instrumentation, especially the steady guitarwork, sound impeccable. The deep strings of the bass on \\"Un Mundo Estranho\\" give that track a dark beauty, while the vocal duet on \\"Don de Fluir\\" makes it as light as chiffon. Even the heartbreak of \\"My Broken Heart\\" is put into a bright and airy room by Fonseca's clear vocals and gentle guitar plucking. Simple without ever being simplistic, this album shows that Brazil is still the place to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puro Dolor","review":"We downloaded this album and have been very pleased with the results.

I'm a big fan of Medieval music, but this has got to be some of the worst singing I've heard on such a CD. I'm guessing the lady was thinking of how, with modern rock music, often the singers will wander from the original melody and rythm a bit. But I stress here A BIT -- that doesn't mean these should be turned into pseudo-rap, or bad poetry. She totally just starts SCREAMING certain songs -- trying maybe to communicate the emotion?Also (and I noticed in the liner notes that the group often does Middle Easter music) there was a sort of unpleasant Turkish/Indian style to the improv that I didn't like.My final complaint is that it is a woman singing all these songs -- these songs were meant for men to sing.

The techniques are not detailed very well and often are difficult to understand fully. They give techniques for many off-topic subjects, such as waking up without an alarm clock. They don't tell where they get the sources for their information. The actual names of the authors of this book aren't even listed. Despite these flaws, I put my faith into these techniques.

The production values are on a par with that kind of show - a bit interesting.What I found so very disappointing was the fact that ALL of the \\"Special Features\\" were nothing more than the original show cut differently with an extra 30+ seconds of new material thrown in here and there (perhaps a whole 10 minutes more in total?) The extra material looked like deleted scenes from the original.I would not have purchased this DVD had I known that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not the best","review":"I got this DVD for myself and my 4 obsessed children, hoping to see more of the real places mentioned in the books - like a little travelogue perhaps, as well as more about the author, and some discussion of the myriad references to mythology in the books. There was some of that, but there was also a great deal of a fellow in robes calling himself \\"The White Witch\\" talking about wicca and how his wand works, etc., which was not at all what I was looking for.

As a narrator, Laurie is wonderful. He has an expressive voice,and is clearly having fun, despite the boring script.There are tours of Oxford, Cambridge, English boarding schools, even an interview with a so-called \\"white witch\\" who claims broom-riding powers(???) It sounds more exciting than it is.Seeing this on PBS,I found it terribly boring.

Basically, I wanted a fan tour without having to pay the 2-3K it costs to actually do that. Instead, I was given sort of \\"this is the junk we have in our pocket\\" presentation. It's not worth your money, unless you're REALLY interested in listening to some guy who calls himself the \\"white witch\\" babel on about proper broom flying technique.

We wrote on a family pollyanna we wanted a \\"whistling tea kettle\\". A relative gave us this. I just used it to make my favorite tea- Barrys Irish. The person who wrote the last review was right- it DOESN'T whistle! Also the lid doesn't go down after you press the lever. I had to manual squash it down. I followed the directions- I mean this isn't rocket science. The whole point is to get a sound so I know the water is boiling. I am going to be donating this to the thrift store and buying another brand that DOES work. We previously had a Revereware kettle that worked until the whistle part fell out and down a black hole in the stove. I am sad because this clearly is a defective product and should not be sold as a whistling kettle. I wish they had a no star option on this review. I let it pass for one star because I liked the chartreuse green color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Material sloughed off--buy with caution","review":"This tea kettle (which I purchased in white) served us well for about a year; it was fairly durable and did not rust on the inside. The handle and pour spout were also well designed. We often used it several times a week to make coffee and tea with no apparent problems. However, I recently discovered, to my dismay, that whatever material this kettle is made of/coated in was sloughing off on the inside. In other words, when I touched the inside of the pot, it felt grainy, as though coated in fine sand, and my finger came away looking like I had dipped it in white paint. Needless to say, I promptly threw it away. To me, this does not suggest a reasonable standard of craftsmanship. I don't want to use a kettle that might endanger my family's health."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Functional Teapot","review":"This little (but not too small) teapot feels sturdy and looks nicer than any of those I had owned before. The bright red color adds liveliness to my kitchen. The handle, designed to keep the hand away from the steam, serves that purpose well. It is comfortable to lift and pour with a single hand. The whistle works fine, too. I've used it every day for about a month and haven't seen any rust on the inside bottom. Well, I've been careful to leave no water in the teapot after each use, or wipe the inside with a paper towel if it is wet. The lid is tight enough to stay in place but easily removable so adding water/cleaning is a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red HotWhen I needed a new kettle, I looked in the better Malls","review":"When I needed a new kettle, I checked out the better Mall stores. Anything that impressed was also overpriced. The collection on Amazon was truly impressive.I choose by looks and function. It sits there in all its red, round glory. It sits on my glass top stove like a piece of art. The fit of spout cover does not allow it to whistle.The steam comes out and runs down the kettle, to the stove. Be very cautious when refilling. Wait till it cools down or the steam rises up to the handle - with you hand on it.I still love it but you have to be really careful or you will get burned.

I say that having seen many versions and the authenticity of this version stands head and shoulders above all competition especially the modern versions. The singers are sublime, especially the irrepressible Renate Holm, who shines throughout, and Janowitz and Waechter are equally stunning. I cannot fault any performer in this perfomance - it is magic from beginning to end. I recently watched a production from Covent Garden with Hermann Prey and Kiri te Kanewa and it grated on my nerves - it semed so unnatural. So if you are an operetta fan, and love excellent music,acting, and aboe all an authentic feel get this version, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Die Fledermaus by Johann Strauss","review":"This is an excellent version of the operetta by Strauss with superb singers who look right for their parts, speak Viennese and can act as well.A wonderfully uplifting entertainment that is perfectly suited for New Years Eve viewing.

Wald puts Johnson in context in the history of the blues, and there's a great companion CD, Back to the Crossroads: The Roots of Robert Johnson, with 23 rare 78 tracks, so you can hear many of the hundreds of blues pioneers mentioned in the book.My favorite suggestion in this book: What effect did Alan Lomax's 1941 Mississippi interviews with Delta blues players regarding Robert Johnson have on their assessment of \\"their one-time peer\\"? This thought made me put the book down and think about history and history writing, for about 2 days.Very heady.

This morning I placed the stem in a cup of ice water and the indicator slowly dropped to 190 degrees. It seems to be a permanent position.

I've shown the Anchor Bay version to friends in the last few years all of whom have been impressed by this clever caper from 1981. But when a company comes out with a new version (seven years after the last time Diva was released on DVD) it deserves a whole lot better than this.

I hope the word gets back to whoever reproduced this movie and they'll re-issue a quality DVD and/or video soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie -- Bad, Bad DVD","review":"One of the main characters in this wonderful, quirky film is music. Full, amazing glorious sound weaves in and out of both plot and subplot. Well, it does in the movie, anyway. The truely awful mono sound on this DVD is like blacking out the image of one of the stars.It's still a good story but if you've seen/heard this movie in a decent theater the terrible sound on this DVD will have you screaming in frustraition. Where's a Criterion Edition when we need it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do it over!","review":"I've seen 'Diva' on public TV and on VHS. The story is wonderful, lyrical and exciting. The DVD version is terrible simply because the sound was so poorly transferred. Please do it over, with the speakers turned on. Then, it will deserve at least 4 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic film, but What a bad DVD transfer","review":"Such a shame, the film is really good but impossible to listen to a diva with such a bad sound quality, I'm very surprised and disappointed that J.J Beineix accepted to difuse his film with such defaults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrific movie, ruined by horrible sound","review":"I was trying to replace my copy of Diva taped off the television with the DVD. That copy was infinitely better than the DVD. The sound was like an AM radio stuck under a pillow. Pretty ironic for a movie about some quality sound recording equipment. It is definitely not worth the money. Do not buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy it...","review":"Someone just today told me I should see this film.What a disappointment to see these warnings of poor quality DVDs being produced by Fox Lorber.Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm one of the few who didn't like the film.","review":"Sorry, but I agree with the fellow who says that this filmis overrated. To those who love it, \\"I'm happy for you.\\" I saw it on TV - beautiful music, lush photography, but by the end of the film, I felt that I was wasting my time -- at the end, it reminded me of an ordinary TV thriller climax. Sorry - once was enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good work of its' day","review":"This was quite a hit in its' day. A good friend, a black female opera singer, was a good friend of the black female opera singer in the movie, and shared comments privately with me regarding the musical choice and more. The appeal, I believe, at the time was this movie's inclusion of 'punk' into a classical venue. Punk, as a lifestyle and art form, was fairly new at the time, as was MTV, VH1, computers, cell phones, fax machines, etc etc. There are moments when the dialogue is a bit paced as artistry, and does not seem too real. But the movie is good, and worth seeing, as a time piece and a good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Award for worst sound, ever!","review":"I have to agree with Mr. Hodges; the film is very cool and a lot of fun. I have shown it over the years in my French classes. But, the sound is extremely inadequate. I had to turn my tv monitor all the way up, and we could still barely make out the conversation and sound effects. Until they clean up or restore the sound, don't waste that valuable money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diva audio disappointing","review":"Diva is one of my favorite international movies with spectacular surrealistic cinematography and French-style action mixed with beautiful bel canto singing. Unfortunately, the producers of the DVD version of the movie really didn't know what they were doing on the audio track which is mono and seems to suffer from severe compression and distortion effects. The effect is that the sound track sounds muffled and occasionally even drops out altogether. Unfortunately, the audio quality is so bad that it really ruins the movie, and ultimately makes one want to fast-forward through Wilhelmenia Fernández's beautiful singing. What a shame.Therefore, although I highly recommend the movie, I would definitely NOT recommend this DVD. Perhaps the video version or French-only release is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror","review":"This DVD is an insult to DVD technology. I have never heard such a bad sound, not even on video tapes. The movies worth is at least 50% sound (who ever saw it). Besides the fact that laguage is french (what I oversaw) this es my worst DVD experience ever. 1 star is too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good durable shoe","review":"For a lace-less, velcro-less shoe, I haven;t seen better than this particular shoe. Purchased for my 5yo boy who loves wearing them and finds them quite comfortable.

It was a mistake. Taxcut was not able to update to the latest version, even tho it kept trying. I finally had to manually update the version, but Taxcut still did not recognize it. None of my forms would print without the update. I then bought Turbotax and was finished with my taxes in 1.5 hours.

When I sent the error report Microsoft, they said there was no fix. So I called Tax Cut. Sure enough, there is no fix and if you have to enter an amount on this line of the Federal return, you can't use this software!!!!! How can they put out a product that they know doesn't work????

The program added over $6000 of extra 1099-misc income into my return. It was just there out of the blue. No entry, no name from whom it came from just an extra $6,000 of income out of thin air. Not a good thing. Luckily, I caught it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steve Oekekerk Is NUTS! And It's GREAT!","review":"Steve Oedekerk definitely has windmills in the splinters of his mind. But insanity isn't always a bad thing. Take Thumbtanic, for example. A hilarious send-up of blockbuster Hollywood movies is Steve's forte, and it is done here in style.

You should like one of those two, or even both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part III of the Thumb series","review":"This is a very funny short and one of the better in the series. A lot of the jokes are laugh out loud funny, but a few still don't work. Not as good as Thumb Wars, but good enough.The DVD includes: A very funny commentary, storyboards, and trailers for this, Blair Thumb, Bat Thumb and the unreleased Frankenthumb.This is the worst of the DVDs so far in the series because of barely any extras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received my items although I was charged for them","review":"I haven't received my items nor have I gotten any response from the emails that I have sent inquiring about my order."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legend Comes to Life in two Masterpieces","review":"40 years after his debut in Amazing Fantasy # 15 Spider-Man became the blockbuster movie followed a sequel starring Tobey Maguire as the teenage Daily Bugle photographer Peter Parker & the wall crawling, web slingling superhero Spider-Man as he battles Green Goblin & protects his love Mary Jane Watson, In Spider-Man 2 he battles personal problems with M.J. & with Harry who continues his veageance on Spider-Man for his father's death & battles the maniac Dr. Octopus.

A must have for Austen fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aggravating Annotation","review":"This book reminds me of a sullen student's half-hearted approach to an assignment. EVERY single simple word on EACH page is explained--that is, given a dictionary definition. This book is so disappointing; its promises so much and delivers nothing. I really don't know what to say to someone who finds Jane Austen's vocabulary too hard to read; she beats Hemingway hands down in the prose department. If you want to learn more of the 'backstory' to the times and customs in Jane Austen, if you yearn for a few well placed lit-crits, this is not the book. For the rest of you, just use a dictionary and save the $30. I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annotations very good, but it's still Austen","review":"The annotations in this volume make it worth buying if you must read Austen; they give P & P more depth and interest. On the other hand, it is still Austen (though probably her best). Given that the Bronte sisters wrote only a few decades later, and managed to have characters with depth and stories with plot turns, Austen appears really overrated to me. So I give the book 2 stars for the annotations, but keep it low so Amazon will quit recommending Austen books for me, and save them for those who do appreciate her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformative!","review":"Mr. Shapard does a fair amount of gushing, but he gets it out of his system after about a hundred pages. What's left is historical context, balanced literary interpretation and elucidation of the subject matter. Overall, he's done a wonderful job.Years ago, I read P&P; and thought it was alright but nothing worth getting excited about. When I read this version, suddenly it wasn't just two people talking; it was Darcy digging himself a hole in front of the oblivious Elizabeth. Talk about something worth getting excited about; I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and pedantic.","review":"I had hoped that this book would be \\"annotated\\" to explain aspects of social history that are lost on us modern readers. And there's a tiny, tiny bit of that. For example, the editor explains what an entail was, and what rank Lady Catherine would have been. This is interesting.But the vast majority of the annotations, as other reviewers have noted, are explanations of words whose meanings are quite clear from context. Jane Austen was a very clean, concise writer-- so much so that 200 years on, she's still enjoyable for all ages. A recent Publisher's Weekly survey found that American teenagers identified her as their favorite dead author. *They* don't have any trouble understanding her. Her writing needs no glossing... and certainly not the tiresome, repetitive, intrusive explanations it gets in this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a first time reader.","review":"This book is the first Jane Austen novel that I have read. I found the annotations to be very helpful in understanding the cultural context of the novel, explaining antiquated customs and character motivations. Austen makes reference to other books of the era, and the editor elaborates on the background and significance of them.Having the annotations opposite the text on the facing page is very convenient and it's easy to read every one. I did not find the annotations to be overly redundant.I wish that the editor had more annotated Austen works, but having read this one, I'll have an easier time understanding the other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Kindle rendition of a wonderful book","review":"I have read Pride and Prejudice at least six times in print, including the print edition of this book. For my most recent re-read, I started with the free Kindle edition, but was put off by the many typos, so I thought that I would just buy the Kindle edition of The Annotated Pride and Prejudice. Unfortunately, this book ALSO had many off-putting typos. I guess that for books that were originally published in the pre-ebook era the process of conversion to Kindle involves scanning with an OCR reader, which would be fine if someone actually went back and proofed the result. That obviously did not happen here. Since I'm re-reading the entire opus this summer (done with Emma and P&P, on to Northanger Abbey), I'd be very interested if anyone could point me at a high-quality set of Jane Austen books that I could read on Kindle. I haven't found any, yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning album by one of the greats","review":"This album was my introduction to the vast world of Hypocrisy. After listening to it, I didn't quite know what to make of it. At the time, my favorite bands were At the Gates, In Flames, and Amorphis. I was told that I would like these guys since I like death metal, and boy were they right. Hypocrisy is brutal, yet melodic, angry yet soothing, fast yet strangely slow. This album kept me guessing the whole way. A total unpredictable album, which makes it fun, yet scary to listen, because you never know where Hypocrisy will take you next. One song might be like thrash, yet the next might be atmospheric, and the next comes with the screeching vocals whereas the next song brings the growling vocals.I kid you not: Hypocrisy is one of the best death metal bands around. My only regret is that I didn't discover them sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est magnifique","review":"I don't intend to say anything new here. I agree with everyone else who gave this 4 or 5 stars. This is an absolutely masterful album, with not a step wrong.I have occasionally found Hypocrisy a little short of subtlety, but never with this album. For me there are two of the best tracks of all time on this collation; Elastic Inverted Visions and Paled Empty Sphere, (Elastic Inverted Visions is my ringtone) but the sheer mind-boggling brilliance of those two never casts the rest of the album into the shade, as there isn't a weak track on it.As others have said before me, if you only ever own one Hypocrisy album, make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"the best hypocrisy ever. a perfect balance of the faster-paced death and the slower melodic. peter and crew were flawless! if you only own one hypocrisy album, this should be it"},{"rating":"2","title":"1st of May","review":"This is a delightful family movie even though the actors may be older, but the story is lovely.I liked Micky and Julie's role; but Joe Di's could have been much larger to become a real meaningful part of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic family Movie","review":"I have watched this movie a few times.

Is this what happens when the ladies from \\"Girls Gone Wild\\" grow up and become moms? The characters certainly are braindead and characterless enough to have had that as a sub-plot. (If there had been a primary plot to start with.) It's true that some former type-A women who leave corporate life for homemaking sublimate their need to achieve into this group and others like them, but be not afraid: none of the members of the actual group could make a PowerPoint presentation. It's not worth wasting even summer beach reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of paper","review":"This was selected for our reading group...we saw no merrit in itat all. vacuous shallow characters, no plot, no development, gramatical errors throughout.

The cover looked fun and as I flipped through the pages at the bookstore decided to plop it into my basket.I was completely disappointed in the writing. Between improper use of punctuation, poor grammar (did anyone bother to edit this book?), shallow characters, useless name-dropping of San Francisco landmarks and no plot there was little left to enjoy. I forced myself to finish the book hoping there would be some redeeming qualities but none ever presented.I'm sorry I spent the money on the book.

That is, I find that the bible presents a picture of a god who I can't believe in. As I was unable to suspend my disbelief, the story fell apart under the weight of the ages.As another reviewer commented, there's no point in reviewing the bible. I would recommend that everybody read it, depsite the fact that it was possibly the most boring and pointless works of literature ever. But I have reviewed the bible because reviewer #1 did. No amount of commentary, indices, etc can make it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Catholic Study Bible","review":"Originally I purchased this for my son who is going to Iraq. I was going to give it to him for Christmas. However, I noted the print was so small and he had asked for something bigger than what the Army issued prints are, so I ended up ordering him something different - not a study Bible. With all of the good study material included on each page, it is necessary for the print to be the smaller size - so it's a good Bible if you want a study Bible with all of the extra information in it - the references and maps, etc. However, for a praying, casual reading, type of Bible this may not be the one that you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presents a liberal perspective","review":"This study Bible gives the \\"standard\\" liberal perspective on the books of the Bible. It casts doubt upon the authorship of the books and their accuracy, which in my opinion undermines the Christian Faith. I doubt that the early Church Fathers would approve of much of the commentary in this Bible. The meat of the notes is in the Readers Guide at the front of the Bible, instead of with the books it is commenting on. This may require the reader to go back and forth from the book to the notes at the front, which I found annoying. If you want a liberal slant on the Bible you may enjoy this Study Bible. If you are a traditionalist you should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Study Bible Overall","review":"The Catholic Study Bible is one of the best study bibles for students and scholars of biblical criticism. The biggest asset is the extensive Reading Guides which are very helpful for gaining a historical perspective and general background on all books of the bible. The New American Bible translation and footnotes are understandable enough, but this study bible lacks an important feature: an index or concordance. This study bible is recommended mainly for those in serious critical bible study, not normally for the mainstream Christian."},{"rating":"1","title":"orthodoxy questionable","review":"This Study Bible does not present Catholic teaching well and views the Bible from more of a modernist perspective. The NAB is a rather loose translation and has some strong defects. There are different authors for the reading guides to each book of the Bible. Some of the guides are sound. Others, however, seem to deny the historicity of the Bible. Modern liberal interpretations and datings are presented as facts, even on points where there is much debate. I would not recommend this book to any Catholic. The best translation out there is the RSV-CE, otherwise known as the Ignatian Bible, and I would suggest the Navarre Bible commentary series to any Catholic interested in getting to know GOD's word better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Exodus and part of Genesis","review":"Ordered it while in Iraq, and had it shipped to my home.

The Bible was written in languages (Hebrew and Greek) foreign to most of us, in a location thousands of miles from us folks in the U.S., and thousands of years ago. The Catholic Study Bible provides readers with reliable assistance in unpacking the meaning of God's Word and provides Catholics with outstanding Bible scholarship by Catholic scholars who, like Fr. Donald Senior, are among the best in the world.

Although the attempt is genuine, the content is lacking both linguistically and in historical scholarship. The translation itself is lacking and shows only a basic understanding of the Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic sources. Also, an an odd isogetic bent is found throughout the NT in translating. The commentary is cold, overly literary, and lacks the true warmth and personal nature of the Holy Scriptures as they are found in the original sources, (Hebrew/Aramaic, Greek, and possibly Syriac). My hope is that a revision of this text will reveal a true desire to communicate the Sciptures accurately to Romanists.

Setup was easy as could be, I didn't level the ground but I should have. Still I could fill it up to the top ring and it wasn't off more that a couple of inches. Bought all required chemicals, test strips, etc., balanced the water and shocked it every week, ran the pump at least 4 hours a day, cleaned the filter once per week.Pool water still turned green from algae, so contrary to directions I bought a vaccum attachment and hose and used the pump to vaccum. Found out filter would not catch the algae, so I would vaccum water out in the yard wasting 25 to 40% of the pool water each time.

I was upset to find that it did not include an air pump to inflate the pool ring, so count on spending more money for that if you do not have one (and a bicycle pump will take you forever...so plan on purchasing a more commercial air compressor). Also, a screw driver is absolutely necessary to tighten the brackets for the hoses. Another thing wrong is that it advertises that this pool can be setup in 30 minutes....wrong! Plan on a full day....and that's if you are lucky and have lots of help...I am personally still having problems setting mine up due to the pool ring leaking and the hose gaskets leaking water. I am disappointed in this pool...would not have purchased it if I known the difficulty,etc. For a little more, get a professional above ground installed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about holes???","review":"I'm surprised that no one else has had a problem with holes! It's a little hard to locate a hole in the top of a swimming pool. If you try to put it under water, all of the water comes out. You could walk around with a spray bottle, but that's like finding a needle in a haystack! I spent $100.00 on one of these pools and had to throw it away at the end of the summer. Also, no one has mentioned anything about rain. Several times our pool would fill up so high that ALL of the water would overflow onto the ground. This wouldn't happen with a metal pool. It seems like these \\"Easy Pool Sets\\" are taking over all of the stores, and it's almost impossible to find a metal pool, unless you want to spend $1,000.00 or more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these pools!","review":"I had read the \\"bad\\" reviews of these pools before purchasing one. I decided to see for myself. That was a $300 mistake. Anyone saying that the support from the company is anything but a joke can't be telling the truth. The pumps are so under powered for the size it isn't even funny. I have had experience with regular above ground pools, so I understand the work that can go into keeping a pool up. I could go on and on about this, but please take this advice, DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE POOLS!! They are a bigger pain than they are worth. I live in the upper midwest, so those in areas that have more all season warmth may have some different results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get taken by the great hype and reviews...","review":"This company has a list of complaints on the BBB. This pool has cost me hundreds of dollars in water bills, and headaches due to leaks and cheap motors that consume tons of electricity.

Like I said we sat around on our days off from work waiting on it, it did not show so we started calling everyday no one would call us back. We will never ever order again because of this.... You should be better with delivery for such expensive purchases.

You have to watch the little ones because they can climb on anything and fall in very easily!!!! Setting up this pool is horrible. You need to set it up perfectly or it will slant causing water to gush out over the side!! We've used the pool with no problems for about 3 weeks and then the water turned green. The filter is awful. We have used a ton of chemicals, ran the filter all day, vacuume constantly and eventually we had to drain about 3,000 gallons of water and fill it up again. One time my 4 yr old leaned on the side and the whole side collapsed and he fell out along with 2,000 gallons of water. The parts wear easily & need to be replaced too! It's a hassle & a money sucker!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky product","review":"This is our second run through with this product. After buying and filling the pool twice, both times it had leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not an \\"easy pool\\" set","review":"I bought this pool due to it's size and advertised ease of setup. In contrast, it is anything but easy to setup. The instructions are vague and minimal. Also, it is implied that everything you need is in this set.....but be warned that I was shocked to find that an air pump was not included. Thus original installation of the pool was delayed (we could inflate the ring), until I ran to a nearby store and spent 40 additional dollars on one). It is suggested on the box that this pool can be setup in 30 minutes....it has taken us days to install it and the pool is still leaking around the filter pump. It does not suggest long-term outdoor exposure, so winterizing it for storage will not be easy. I fear that the filter pump is fragile and does not do well when exposed to outdoor climates. If I had known this pool was so difficult, I would have avoided it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"As far as setting up the pool, we put it on the tarp right on top of a level grass surface. We didn't use any sand (as suggested on the box). We already had an air compressor so no extra cost was necessary. The vinyl is VERY heavy. I didn't expect it to be so heavy, but am glad it is since that makes it very durable. It was difficult to spread the bottom surface out so that it didn't have wrinkles in the bottom, so we do have some wrinkles -- but i don't mind. The pump runs quietly and was easy to hook up. I have had no problems with leaking. My only concern is one of our cats getting up on the rim of the pool and popping a whole in it with it's claws. I hope they stay down!! Another advantage is the ladder, which is just \\"set\\" over the edge so it can be removed easily so that the little tykes don't go climbing in the pool unattended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Set Pool - A Pain To Clean","review":"I thought this pool was a great alternative to putting in a big pool. However, we can't find filters anywhere for this bigger size pool. (...) I had to order them from another online company and still don't have them. The vacuum system is a joke. It does pick up little solid debris from the floor, but it does nothing for pollens, algaes, and those sorts of things. The filter bag just pushes those things right back through. I went to the pool store to buy a real vacuum only to find that you can't hook one up with this kind of filter. I like the idea of the pool and it was exceedingly easy to set up, however I'm not sure if we'll be able to continue using it if we can't buy filters or get it clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"the fusion of gotenks","review":"mr.boo[fatboo] split into parts and it in too two types one is completely evil and one completly good then the bad boo beats up the good one the good one looks just like mr boo and then the evilbuu abzorbs the good one and becomes superboo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding yourself !","review":"This is the first of all \\"hindu classics\\" I've read but I think it already gave me a good vision about this \\"way-of-life-religion\\".

It shows you the importance of a good will instead of a sellfish being in which you just think about your fellings, forgeting all the holliness of the world around you. Make your best, but for the life in general, for God, not for you and your sellfish desires and you'll reach the path of heaven, the world of infinit.

It's fired at a higher temperature (hence the strength) and the crock shrinks in size accordingly.I asked Maxi-Matic to extend the warranty on the new crock since it was a poor substitution. They would not.

Being a Chinese who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years, I am ever so saddened by the fact that people really think this guy is cooking the \\"real\\" stuff. My friends and I just think that he puts on a good show. If you enjoy his food, please do not get the wrong impression that it is Chinese. He has substantially modified many of the dishes to fit American taste, just as many western restaurants in the Orient would make western food which have been changed to fit the Asian taste buds.

I wonder if anything in his recipes are kitchen tested. I was looking specifically for sauces and there isn't one recipe in this book that I could make to taste like what I wanted, either at a Chinese-American restaurant I have gone to in the 'burbs or a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown.

Having no basis for comparison plot- or character-wise with other Siddons' titles, I can say that Islands--its stories and characters--provided me a completely delightful weekend of reading.

The happy parts were overly gushy, reminding my of when I was young and naive and still believed in the abilty to really live happily ever after. I don't mean to sound like a pessamist, but really, this book carries an unrealistic idea of what life is like. There were no middle areas where things were just okay, it was extreme happiness or extreme sadness, which isn't realistic. The happy parts reminded me of the end of a romance novel gushing orgasmic joy over things being \\"perfect\\".On the other side of things, I definately give Anne Rivers Siddons credit for the ending - with the way the book was going I was never even remotely expecting the ending. It was a real shock to me and it left me feeling puzzled and thinking \\"what just happened!?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Past her Prime?","review":"I've read and enjoyed several of Siddon's other books, and her descriptions of places, customs, climate, food often make you feel you've been there, but to this book I often said, \\"Blah, blah, blah-who cares?\\" As I was trapped in airports and airplanes I read the whole thing in a day. Actually I skipped over some of the descriptions because her writing was unimaginative, methodical, repetitive....boring. I think I'll go back and actually count the number of times she used the word \\"obscurely\\"as an (obscure to be sure) adverb. Doesn't she have an editor? Do writers get paid by the page?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light read","review":"The newest novel by this talented author takes place in the Low Country of South Carolina - Charleston and the islands of her shores. While the plot is somewhat predictable, the descriptions are quite good. I could \\"see\\" the scenes. The dialogue moved the story along. I was pulled in from the beginning and read the entire book in record time.This is a wonderful for an in front of the fire or by the pool type read. It doesn't take much thinking power, but is enjoyable none the less. What I really like in a story is well defined characters who stay true throughout the book. I found this with Islands. I also enjoy strong relationships, which I also found with this read.Ms. Siddons' fans will surely enjoy this latest effort. I would also recommend it to those who enjoy reading about the Low Country and beautiful, wealthy people with strong relationships. This was my first read by Ms Rivers Siddons and I enjoyed it as a good light read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading!","review":"Following the lives of a close-knit group of friends as they move from middle to old age is highly appealing, and makes me wish I had a wonderfully supportive clique like this to grow old together with.

So, I looked forward to starting this one with some anticipation. However, what I found was a bunch of snobbish tripe!It wasn't worth wading through to get to the utterly impossible ending. If you are addicted to Anne Rivers Siddons you just might need to read it for a fix, but it wouldn't be a quick one. It takes a quite a while to finish because of the slow moving and boring descriptions of the beach, the homes, the clothing everyone wears, and the shallow characters.

So I sent her a copy for us to read together. It was not a treat. I was disappointed there were not enough descriptions about Charleston and the Low Country. I've been to lovely Charleston and Beaufort and this book didn't make it recognizable. I agree that character development was shallow. What was that mess in Mexico that made no sense? And, nothing is more aggravating than reading a 'professionally' written book with TYPOS! And repetitious descriptions. The ending was implausible and a rush to have some closure. PLEASE do not compare this author to the talented Pat Conroy. So we waded through the 'pluff mud' of Islands, and are giving Siddons another chance with Peachtree Road, but my mother has finished it, calling it 'bizarre'. Gee - can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite author seems to be losing it.","review":"I have read every one of Anne Rivers Siddons's books. Some I have read twice because I like them so much. I have even finished the last page of one of her books and turned back to page one and started over again because I didn't want to leave the characters. When I started to read Islands, I had just finished reading Low Country and was very disappointed with it so I was hoping that this would be the work of the author that I loved. It started out badly. The quick way she met, married the doctor and was accepted into his old childhood group was not believable. After that I wondered at times if I was reading a novel or a travel brochure. Since she had no plot, she filled the pages with descriptions of the beach, the ocean, Charleston, the food they ate, ad nauseum. And I won't even mention the ending which was totally unbelievable. That's two in a row that I didn't like. I wonder if I will buy another one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of Her Best","review":"I have been an avid reader of Anne Rivers Siddons books since \\"Homeplace\\", written in the late '80's. Her last three books, have been very disappointing to me including \\"Islands\\".While Siddons still has a \\"feel\\" for the Carolina Lowcountry, where I live, she has lost her ability to make her characters seem plausible and alive. Her plot in this last book is disjointed and boring. I almost put it down without finishing it but then read about the strange ending so I perservered and sure enough, the ending was terrible. Upon closing the cover I had to pronounce it a waste of time and the ending disjointed from the plot. It made no sense to follow these close friends through years of ups and downs only to find out one is a murderer! I sincerely hope Ms. Siddons can and will return to her writing style that was present in \\"King's Oak\\", \\"Colony\\", and the \\"Outer Banks\\". These, to me, are her best efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost patience with this book very quickly","review":"I have never read another book by this author, but picked this one up at the library after I thought the book jacket blurb sounded promising. What I found was a tedious novel with very little plot, only a few spurts of good writing, and an ending that seemed to be a desperate twist to make it into a murder mystery. The characters were very poorly developed and had the most tedious lives you can imagine. Maybe this is how the rich live in Charleston, but it certainly didn't make for good reading. I simply skimmed through the last two-thirds of the book, and don't think I missed a thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you enjoy it, you don't have to like it","review":"I love Siddons's books. I'll read anything that has her byline on it and I'll enjoy it whether I like it or not!How can that be, you ask? Well, she's a pictoral writer. By that I mean her words conjure mental pictures of characters and scenes in the reader's mind. The setting she writes about in ISLANDS (the coastal South) is beloved and familiar to me. She has the ability to create a charming world for the reader that is a delight to experience.All that said, although I enjoyed reading ISLANDS, I felt the story was weak. The ending seemed dux ex machina and the characters were too familiar to avoid the feeling that they were cliches.She's still my favorite author and I'll read every book she writes, but ISLANDS strikes me as a book written by someone who no longer has anything to say. Ms. Siddons has lived in her world so long and written it so well that it's time to stretch her talent with something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Torture","review":"I have read this author before, but this book was pure torture to read. It was excruciatingly boring, with little plot. The main character, Anny, was sickeningly sweet and naive.

YUCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gentle read, but you'll end up depressed","review":"Anny joins the Scrubs, a group of self-indulgent, self-absorbed folks, who just can't grow up. Without realizing it, she morphs from confident, caring, community worker to a skittish, selfish, Scrub. When tragedy strikes, she elects to lie in bed, rather than attend the funeral service of one of the group's members. Thankfully, the member's daughter blasts her and tells her how selfish she is, especially since her mother liked Anny best of the group. (That zinger was my favorite part of the whole read.)Great details, but I did end up flipping ahead to get things moving along. The ending was abrupt and felt like the author knew she had run out of gas and needed a big finish.I didn't like any of the characters and was wishing for their comeuppance until the end of the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"How much to sacrifice for the sake of the story?","review":"One more plea for better writing or editing.... I live in Charleston and found several of her facts to be a bit \\"confused\\" now and then, but when that sailboat was found lying on its side in the water, I just had to consult my own sailboat expert. He assures me that this kind of sailboat (with what's called a weighted keel) could *never* end up like that! -- unless the keel is removed, and if that was the case, the story should have included that information. A sailboat like this is like a kid's tippy cup: it will right itself.Running into such flawed writing is just like running aground in our beloved pluff mud. A sad situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work!","review":"I usually love Siddons books. I was excited to find one that I had not read yet at the airport a few weeks ago.This book had me either crying or stumped the whole read. The character development was good to a point. But, i agree with a previous poster that says how unrealistic it was for the doctor to own so many houses. Yet, they never set up a home.The 'evil' character by the end of the book had me wondering where that idea came from. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not read it. I found the plot turn with the fire to be too much.Not one of her best books. I had liked it up until the point where a dog goes missing and a fire is started."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Rivers Siddons is Queen","review":"I rarely write reviews because I am loathe to criticize anyone. And, this review is not to criticize ISLANDS but to remark on the reviews left by others. Anne Rivers Siddons is the undisputed Queen of Southern Letters and I just have to say that I think some of these reviews are gratutiously unkind. That's all. I think that if Anne left her grocery list on my kitchen counter it would fascinate me for days and weeks. I read ISLANDS and thought it was wonderful for a whole host of reasons. Maybe she was trying to say something beyond the story line. Maybe some of the readers expected something else. But there is no reason to be so judgmental - for writers, more than the average person, words mean a lot. All that said, ARS is still the Queen in my book. People who read are generally great folks. What's up here? I have no idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much!","review":"Although I have enjoyed ARS earlier works like Colony and Outer Banks, I find myself getting more and more impatient with each successive offering. I found Islands to be nothing more than one overlong description after another of the too, too wonderful southern climate (even though it is laden with unbearable humidity and mosquitoes), landscape (can pluff mud be mentioned one more time?) cozy houses (all main characters own several, of course), furnishings (lots of rump sprung sofas, whatever that is), wonderful dogs and over privileged people who manage to look like teenagers well into their golden years. All of this puncuated with an occasional death, disappearance or discovery of infidelity thrown in to keep the reader's interest. I, like another reviewer, found myself skimming over some of the more unbearable blather in a desperate search for a plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Siddons Disappoints","review":"I have read every one of Siddons' books and eagerly awaited the arrival of this book. This book is probably her worst. It starts off okay - Charleston, the beach house on Sullivan's Island - the places she's so good at writing about. But the book was boring. The writing was uninspired and insipid. The ending was so bad that I began to wonder if Siddons wrote it or if someone else finished it for her. This book was supposed to come out in the fall of 2003 and finally came out in the spring of 2004. Now I know why - she struggled with it. Die hard fans (such as myself) will read it, but get it from the library - it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Siddons","review":"I am not going to summarize the book, amazon does that quite well! So just my review...I am a huge fan of Ms. Siddons', I have been reading her books from the first. She is the type of author that you take her book and not just read it, but wrap it around you, and you become a part of her story. This book was no exception. I really liked the characters. Of course the setting, as in so many of her books, was another character.I gave it four, (really wanted to give it four and a half), instead of five only because of the ending. Something happens at the end,that I think needed a little more story. I felt like maybe her editor told her to hurry up. Overall though, a really good read, and well worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Before I left for the holidays, I picked up a few books to read. I remembered one of my relatives highly suggested Siddons' \\"Colony\\". The store I was in did not have Colony so I picked up \\"Islands\\". While I love to read all kinds of books and relish the different writing styles, this book was an absolute torture. It's about a group of spoiled, completely self absorbed adults with no aim in life except to 'be'. The story is incredibly shallow, yet with an enormous amount of silly details that don't tie into anything within the story. All along while reading, I kept saying to mayself this has to get better, NOTHING can be this bad...folks, it NEVER does. Actually, I found it got progressively worse with each page turned. If, indeed, Siddon's other works were decent perhaps this one was simply written to ride on the coat tails of the previous successes for nothing else but quick release and quick $. Not worth folks. One of the worse reads I ever spent time on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise ending...","review":"...if you can make it that far. It took me - ready? - over a month to read Islands. I'd read a chapter, get bored and put it down, pick it back up and read a little more, get bored again...and I skipped ahead a lot to see if the story was ever going to pick up. It didn't.Basically this is the story of how a pack of over-indulged snobs from Charleston grow into crotchety over-indulged snobs at a beach house. That's it - that's all that happens. People die, houses burn down. The story picks up a bit once Gaynelle comes on the scene but that happened long after I lost interest.I should just post the spoiler and save you all the cost of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares about any of the characters?","review":"I have read most of Anne Rivers Siddons previous books and was looking forward to this one. I was extremely disappointed in the lack of character depth. I never felt any compassion for or real interest in any of the characters. Often I found myself saying, \\"this is ridiculous\\".Actually I didn't think the ending was any worse then the rest of the book, which isn't saying much.I bought the book to read and share with my daughter, another Siddons fan, but I told her not to waste her time. I recommend the other Siddons books, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I tried making biscuits twice and ended up throwing out both batches.

It speaks from and to the heart. It has many personal stories from individuals with ASD and that alone is incredibly revealing. Many good strategies written in easy to apply segments."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will challenge how you think!","review":"This book is a great guide to understanding students with autism, but will also help you understand how to address concerns with students with other disabilities. My favorite chapter is on behavior and really gets to the core issues. She provides information that will create a shift in thinking, e.g., that forcing compliance is not the way to go. I highly recommend this book, it is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ballad of a good soldier, friend, and son","review":"Ballad of a Soldier is sometimes dismissed as overtly patriotic Soviet propaganda, and it's not too difficult to understand why. However, to dismiss the film as a whole and all that's good with it would be like throwing your beloved babooshka out onto the Siberian permafrost with her mineral oil bathwater.Aloysha, the main character and soldier in question, chooses family and friendship over self-recognition, commitment despite personal setbacks, and ultimately country over all else. The film itself is a lesson in the virtues of altruism.This really is a warm-hearted and gentle film with a heart as big as Lake Baikal is deep. Ballad is definitely G-rated and would make for good classroom and family discussion. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise it's in Russian!","review":"It is in Russian with subtitles. An interesting storyline about hardship during war in the early twentieth century, but a very primitive production by today's standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really that good...","review":"Like those stirring Nazi propaganda films, this movie has it all: chiseled cheekbones, black&white film, chaste love, sacrifice for country. And likewise, it uses all of those to cover for shallow plot and shameless please-don't-shoot-me-Stalin sentimental storylines.I'll admit it's hopelessly romantic and a good waste of 90 minutes; the scenery is beautiful, the camera-work is great, and the story is calculated to tug at the ol' heartstrings. But at the same time, realize that the emotions you're feeling aren't genuine - they're delivered, from Russia, without love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lyrical, and touching movie","review":"This is a story about a soldier's experience as he travelled home on a leave during WWII. Romances seemingly blossomed and were put on hold as the soldier crossed a countryside greatly affected by the carnage of war. Every encounter was too brief, as the battles rage on within gun range. A nice movie to watch and savor. In a way a good companion to the excellent American's The Best Years of Our Lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent depiction of a young soldier's experience","review":"This is an excellent movie which I had seen about 5 years ago and have not been able to forget. The story is about a young soldier who gets a short leave to go home and meet his mother. His experiences as he travels are beautifully shown. Emotions and characters show the far-reaching effects of war well beyond the front. It is an anti-war movie that does not rely on graphic scenes of violence but rather on war's adverse effects on the lives of ordinary people."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOWEL IS OK, BUT TAG SHOWS THE PRICE IS ONLY 4.99","review":"I BOUGHT A COUPLE OF THESE TOWELS AS AMAZON CLAIMED THEY WERE ORIGINALLY 13.00 WHEN I RECEIVED THE BATH TOWELS, THERE WAS A PRICE TAG ON THE INSIDE STATING CANNON'S PRICE OF 4.99!

Those towels were the worst towels I have ever had; they frayed like make and became horrible looking. They are long since gone from my house. Anyway, I have other Cannon towels that are still very good and usuable, after almost 16 years(they were wedding gifts).Cannon products are ones that alot of us grew up with, and many have last thirty years or more. These Santa Cruz, though, are mistakes that Cannon has made and should get rid of the line altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Movie","review":"I will admit this is my favorite movie. It is a long movie (over 4 Hrs.) but one I watch over and over again. The battle scenes are fantastic,the equipment of the day accurate and the music stirring. The best part is the actors portrayls of these famous men of the Civil War on both sides.

The singing is fine, but the handling is so heavy-handed that it hardly seems worth the bother. The 1950s German film of \\"the Gypsy Baron\\" was infinitely better.

Talented cast, fabulous voices, Stuttgart Symphony Orchestra and chorus, all together make a great production. This operetta feels more Viennese than Hungarian. Lovely costumes and scenery. The story is based on a Hungarian folk tale. Fun trailer included of the Salzburg Festival of Mozart operas, extremely modern costumes, including bikini clad actors, very modern stage settings, but lovely classical Mozart music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipes for the parking lot socials","review":"Let's face it.

I never used punches before, but this will be my first and last one from this company. If I can, I'll return it to Michael's for a refund. I should have taken a hint from the many previously opened and taped up Punches they had hanging on the wall.If I had a 250-pound tackle from the NFL to press this thing for me, then I'd have it made!

This one is difficult to use. It cuts through, but you really have to push quite hard on it. I also discovered that the flower never fully punches out because there are two notches on opposite sides of each other.After some research I discovered that the notches allow the flower to be folded over for a 3D effect. If the flower is to be used on its own, then it has to be punched out the rest of the way by hand. Not a problem, as long as you know that's what you're supposed to do.That info. should be stated on the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"disfunctional","review":"I was disappointed with performance of this item as it didn't fully make the shape punch sharply.

It was nice to read about Denise but it felt like she just hooked up with her dad to quickly. What 14 year old girl just takes to an absentee father and his lover so quickly? Maybe Denise and Lucy just clicked. Perhaps I missed that.

I read it from cover to cover - there are very few books I can say I have done that. It is the autobiography of the most controversial author and white civil rights leader in the country. It talks about his life, his evolution and his awakening. It discusses very intimate details about the National Alliance, the cosmotheist church and many other very fascinating topics.

His technique and speed are mind bogglingly good. However...To me, his style is very linear, like he's playing 400 notes per second constantly, just over different backing tracks. He does not play \\"country\\". He plays shred metal over a blugrass backing track, with a couple of double stop bends thrown in just to make it sound country \\"enough\\". He is very entertaining to listen to, and I am blown away by some of his licks and noise \\"tricks\\", but he lacks feeling. That type of feeling that will keep this CD in my player for more than 30 minutes...after that, I just get bored.

Mono-dimensional solo work, same riffs, same drums and rhythm section, useless and ridiculous effects, no general idea. Inadequate inclusion of country melodies and old-fashion elements.

My main gripe about this album was the backing. It seemed to me very guitar magazine CD backing track, theres no connection with the other instruments. Dont get me wrong John5 is technically an amazing guitarist but his guitar playing is so much more advance then the bass, rhythm and drums it sounds isolated. Whilst on Satriani/Vai albums you also get to hear Jeff Campiteli, Stu Hamm, The Bisonette brothers, Mike Mangini, and so on. His song/riff writing is no where near Satriani/Vai standards either. If you wanna hear an amazing guitar album get Franks Zappa's 'Shut up and play yer guitar', its in a different class."},{"rating":"2","title":"BASKET CASE blu-ray info","review":"I'm giving the movie itself 5-stars (how could someone grow up in the 80s/90s and not rent it is beyond me!) but it's a great one. Henenlotter started strong and kept it going.But the info I want to make known is that the transfer for BC is a brand new one coming from the previously-thought lost negative. Henenlotter himself has stated online at places like Facebook that he thought he'd lost it but came across it a couple years back buried in his storage. He is excited about this as BC has never truly been seen the way he intended it to look -- transfer always came from beat up prints instead of the negative and never got the true attention he'd hoped for.

Such a great little horror movie with some good gore, decent acting, great direction, but be prepared to feel sympathy for the main characters. Their existence is a depressing one and this movie is able to do everything one would expect from a good horror movie and manages to do it very originally. Themes of revenge, sexual repression, loneliness, traumatic childhood . . . it's all here. A low budget, indie film doesn't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always question whats in the basket...","review":"Basket case is a fun low budget horror from the 80s. It is without question the directors master peice. The use of stop motion annimation was very well done for the time. This movie had a little bit of everything: Gore,comedy and romance and was paced out pretty good. Its a unique movie with an even more unique story that will leave anyone who watches wanting to see the greatly overlooked sequals.

Unfortunately, the book does not include a legend or other explanatory notes on how to translate time. Each chapter is titled \\"Century I,\\" \\"Century II,\\" etc. The best I could guess is that Century I is perhaps the 16th Century, based on the date of Nostradamus' Forward to his son (1555).

Put plainly, Teen Ink is the only book out there that gives teens a place to share what's most meaningful to them - from touching stories about the loss of family members or friends to those light, heady tales of a first kiss. With poems, art and photography from teens to boot, it has, for lack of a better expression, everything!So many books for teenagers are written by adults with good intentions who, unfortunately, are trapped in a one-sided view of teen life -- Teen Ink is definitely NOT one of them. Teen Ink is so amazing because it releases both its authors and readers alike from preconcieved expections of how teens should think and what they should say. The results are magnificent--the teen authors write with a surprising insightfulness about their world.Parents and teens alike will find the book a moving reminder about what life is all about. I know I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Great..","review":"I thought this book would be a good book, but after I ordered it from amazon.com, then I started to read it.

Its an okay book, but if would have know it was going to be like this I wouldnt have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although some of the stories in this book are well written,heartfelt and moving, many are in need of major editing. Teens are at an impressionable time of life, and are charged with havign to learn the English language for all its stylistic nuances. By reading stories such as those in this book, it brings to question whether or not they will pick up some bad habits. While it is great to give teens a place to express themselves, it is surprising that such works are published without cleaning them up.

Every sample resume involves being at the top of your class. Obviously, I didn't graduate in the stratosphere but I am far from being alone, 80+%. Also, I've been able to eke out a decent practice despite this. I've used this book for the past few years and it is helpful because there is a large selection of sample resumes and cover letters to choose from, but I've often chuckled to myself when doing so, because for having such a large selection of examples for so many areas of the law, it just deals with the \\"elite.\\" It never addresses anyone who might be below this standard.

True, the gatekeepers for the elite jobs are not authorized to think outside of the box, and therefore resumes based on these tips will appeal to them; on the other hand, there is no reason that these attorneys should have to put more than a cursory search together as these employers will be chasing them.

It's interesting that I find now what I also found true then-- namely, that the first Piers Anthony book in any given series is always the best, with the following books becoming increasingly sillier and sillier. The first book in the incarnations of immortality series had some clever and original ideas, but past that it lapsed into the besetting Anthony sins of pre-adolescent boy fantasy and deeply goofy plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tremendous comedown. . .","review":". . .from the first \\"Incarnations of Immortality\\" novel.\\"Bearing an Hourglass\\" deals with the character of Time. While the introductory couple of chapters set the stage rather well, the remainder of the novel fails in its promise. Norton, in his role as Chronos, traveling backward and forward through time, encounters numerous attempts to dissuade him in his purpose -- to fight against Satan and the forces of evil.However, the \\"encounters\\" don't seem realistic (even for a fantasy novel). The freshness of the first novel is almost totally absent, as is the depth of character development.When I first read this volume some 8-10 years ago, I found it one of the weaker efforts of the series. A recent re-reading has not disabused me of this notion.Worth a read as part of the series -- but standing alone, it is a grave disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Story, Interesting Idea","review":"Seriously. I wanted to like this book. The concept was so fun. The incarnation on time living backwards? sweet.But somehow Piers Anthony managed to make the whole thing boring. Perhaps it was the quasi sci-fi \\"magic come out of the closet and the Earth it made whole again\\" setting. Perhaps it was the plodding pace. Perhaps it was the over-long interludes in supposed anti-mater galaxies that (SPOILER) were just illusions. Do I feel bad publishing a spoiler? NO! Because I they didn't feel so much list satanic illusions (per the plot) as weak filler for an underdeveloped plot. Sure, some campy fun that makes laughs of pulp sci-fi and epic fantasy... but for every page of intentionally overwrought \\"illusion\\" I would have prefered a single paragraph of well-written storyline.I finished the book because I like to finish books and I kept hoping it would get better.

The confusion a mere mortal has to face when he takes up the 'office' of Time (sort of like taking up the office of a President) and become the mighty Chronos who wields the hourglass, is hilarious"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every Dog has his...excrement.","review":"I decided to become a writer after reading the entire Dark Tower series by Stephen King...now, granted, there are not a lot of series that can compare to the universe he created( short of Tolkien's) but when i first picked up On A Pale Horse by Piers Anthony, I was fully prepared for another series filled with excellent morals and interesting characters. I ordered this as soon as I finished reading On A Pale Horse; highly anticipating the day when i could delve back into the mind of the author. About thirty pages into the book, i started hating the main character--not only because of the fact that he was almost exactly like the Zane--but because he fell in love almost three times throughout the book. It didn't stick to a single story line--there was a thirty pages of a simulation Satan sent Norton on that had absolutely nothing to do with the story. But I'm glad I read this book; it showed me what horrible writing was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Follow Up","review":"In the firstbook of this seires there is only one chapter is about the maine charicter's life wich gives you the a good understanding of the charicter before he becomes an incarnation. But in this book nearly half the book is about norton's life and relationships and stuff that you don't care about. When he finally does get offered the position of the incarnation of Time it hardly explains the porpse of his office, his day to day duty as an incarnation it is just him playing with his powers. On anouther note the author wastes three chapters on side storys that have nothing to do with the the maine story, for instance satan will send him away on an adventure far away were he will inconter a damsle in distress an have an adventure with her then at the end of the chapter he will come home and the regulare story will resume, This happens 3 TIMES!! but it is usefull to read this book to fully understand the other great novles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read it to get on with the series","review":"Ok - this one is SOOO not as good as the first... or the other books in the series...Just get through this one so that you have a basic understanding of Chronos and proceed to Fate... Trust me - Fate is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"\\"Bearing An Hourglass\\" is, frankly, one of the best books I have ever read. Piers Anthony is a wonderful writer, continuing the series that began with \\"On A Pale Horse\\" (my personal favourite). \\"Hourglass\\" caused me to actually pause and think, which is something to be treasured when provoked by any means (I began to read Stephen King while blundering my way through the fourth grade). I took to slowly absorbing all the book has to offer, and still have not made my way entirely through everything. My favourite thought to turn over in my mind is this: Who initiated the relationship between Clotho (otherwise known as Niobe) and Chronos (Norton)? I shall leave you to mull it over for yourself...this question stole quite a few hours of sleep from me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets take a walk with (not through) Time","review":"Imagine having your life going one direction a minute ago then having it going the other in an instant. I'm not meaning the emotional roller coaster we live through I mean literally changing directions, through time. Sounds wild, right? Well Piers Anthony makes it possible in this addition to the Incarnations series. It might sound confusing at first but if you like paradox (and Chronos loves paradox) then you will like this novel. With its switchbacks, backward language, and interesting plot lines, its a go getter. If you find it confusing try to finish it out, this book links alot of the other novels in the series together. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a great one!","review":"This book HAS to be one of his best!I really like how he writes this and all of this books because he puts so much feeling in them. Norton is kind and very in uh...time with the world. Even at the beginning! He seems like the kind of man I would love! The way every thing is described how the hourglass works and just every thing! He is such a creative writer I can't imagine any of his books being BAD!! Any way, I LOVED IT!!! Every one should read at least one of the Incarnations of Immortality books they reallly are wonderful writing!:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, Immature Book For Young Boys","review":"This book is a classic example of bad writing that has been well targeted to earn good money. The characters are completely one-dimensional, boring, and unrealistic. The women in the book (and the series) are not-too-subtle male fantasies.

I cannot wait to get a new one, because this one is so bad. First of all. There is no screen on the front which is just annoying because you can't see who is calling you or what time it is until you flip the thing open. I get horrible reception everywhere I go, and zero reception in a lot of places. The phone I had before was fine in those same areas. There is no predictive text for text messaging which makes sending a short message a tedious chore. The back cover falls off everyday.

Reasonably interesting plot, nice depiction of a libertarian society that is, however, a little *too* perfect. Realistically flawed in some areas - there are still jerks here and there, and corporations can be dishonest - but still, the streetgangs in Freehold don't write graffiti and mug people, they take care of the local park and help lost children find their parents.That that's the worst flaw I've found in Freehold, says something. The book's well done; realistic, some excellent ground combat, and Williamson clearly knows what the hell he's talking about in everything from economics through war and diplomacy. Writing style is crisp, using less words rather than more - something I like - and intelligent.A very, very impressive first novel. I'm looking forwards to more from this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Libertarian Sci-Fi at it's best","review":"The novel is a fast pace, exciting, vivid account of the last enclave of freedom in the human universe and their struggle against the communo-socialist power brokers who seek to enslave them. The main character around which the story swirls, Kendra, is a female from earth who flees to Grainne (the Freehold) to escape a plot to scapegoat her in a typical military/corporate scandal. She is shocked at the unbridled freedom she enounters in her new home but slowly adjusts to her new found liberty. In the end does our hero go back to Earth and slavery or stay on Grainne and remain free? Does the Freehold remain free or do the forces of tyranny prevail? You'll have to find out for yourself in this page turner! I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could use an edit","review":"This novel reads like a mashup of Heinlein's worst works, with a bit too much anti-government propaganda thrown in.Don't get me wrong, I love Heinlein -- but the Earth Kendra comes from is too much like a futuristic China than anything I recognize about the United States.Seriously, I know people complain about lowered educational standards, but do you honestly think any self-described 'political scientist' would not know what the term \\"empirical data\\" means?Overall, the book could use a good editor. And really, just eliminate the scenes about gardening."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're happy reading about utopias, read on.","review":"I couldn't finish it. The society the protagonist emigrates to was too good to be true, too reliant on 'humans behaving themselves' and pre-behavioural economics (the type where it is assumed that everyone behaves rationally and has access to all information required to make decisions) to be plausible. Whether he means to do so or not, the author comes off as 'just another rightwing nutjob UNaphobe' who shows no appreciation for the natural tendency of a percentage of humans in any society to try to game the system - an astonishing assumption for anyone who has served in the military like he does.While delusional economic systems in novels is hardly new (David Weber's Manticore - which I love - allegedly runs on a flat tax), that's usually made up for by the rest of the story. And perhaps that's also true for this novel, but not for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw the book away","review":"Yes, interesting views on a free people versus corruption and oppression. It seemed as though the characters where mainly one-sided, either all good or completely evil. No complexity of character or redeeming features.Also, too much swinger sex, bi-sex, etc... for me. Not just one instance, it's throughout the book.I doubt I'll buy anything else from this author. Definitely not Heinline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bollocks.","review":"This is lolbertarian masturbatory bilge at its very finest.

The author pokes fun at himself and the utopia when one character says it is not a utopia, there are man-eating animals way out in the woods. OK, so it is not a utopia. And the utopia is more of a sexual fantasy than a political ideal. Some of the politics of the tiny \\"government\\" are not clear; there seems to be some sort of democratic influence on the placement of roads. There seem to be some good libertarian ideas and some good commentary on priorities, but most of that is lost in the noise. Eventually I realized this book was more libertine than libertarian, more about license than liberty; I stopped at a little past a third in and put the book down.You should note that this review is written by somebody who did not read to the end and so did not see any redeeming features near the end. Completely unfair, I know. The tiny gems I did see did not tip the scale enough to get out of one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proper Sc-Fi","review":"Up there with Heinlein, Niven et al.

I recognized a similarity in style by chapter 2, and there are several references to the man throughout the story. So if you've ever enjoyed Heinlein give freehold a chance.The only drawback of the story is that he has obviously given this society such much thought that he can't stop talking about it.Michael, if your reading this, sometimes its alright not to explain why things are. :)I would, and am, recommending this to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opener","review":"This is a film that everyone should watch if they think they have a hard life.The mind set of the young boy is far above most of us much older.Very good story line the acting is raw,But that's what makes it so good.A must see film don't miss it you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The only complaint I have is that Wood drastically underestimates the impact of social distinctions predicated upon wealth, especially inherited wealth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mind expanding view of the American revolution","review":"I've read Gordon Wood's work with the Oxford History of the US and so I decided to read his other works. This book is one of the most unconventional ways of looking at our country's political orgins. This is a complex book but it really makes you think and that is it's most valuable aspect. Traditional views of the politics are thrown out the window as Mr. Wood describes our transition from Monarchy to Republicanism to a Democracy and his conclusions based on the founding fathers are not good. That was my biggest shock, by 1825 Jefferson thought we were in trouble. In summary, fantastic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not argue his points well","review":"I cannot pretend that this book isn't popular or prize winning.

To choose The World of John Cleaveland (a great book but about a little town in Massachusetts) as your community study that proves all sorts of economic theses, etc. and ignore Women of the Republic is not only peculiar; it is irresponsible. There was no fresh research and although it was well written, it was no Creation of the American Republic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I had to get this book for a class, and honestly I like it. I have always hated and been bad at history, so when I looked at it, I would get sick. However, after opening and reading through the majority of it, I must say that I would recommend this book to everyone. It is very educational and understandable. Ironically, I have never been able to keep up with a timeline of events and memorization of history, and I understood everything that was being explained. Definitely get this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You could miss this book and still have a good life...","review":"Anyone sitting down to read this book should know that Gordon Wood is a socialist historian who views events through the lense of class conflict. With that orientation, he has written a revisionist history of the American Revolution that argues (against 200 years of American scholarship) that the revolution was not a political, but in fact, was a social revolution. Wood writes well but he is just mistaken on this point. The same elites that were in power before the revolution were in power afterward. Ours was not a social revolution on the order of the French or Russian Revolutions. Most historians view the American Revolution as a struggle for independence and a clash of political ideas - Wood brings a neo-Marxist interpretation to the events, interpreting them as class struggle and social conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of the Revolution from a Solid Position","review":"Gordon Wood's litterary talents have grown since the CREATION OF THE AMERICAN RERUBLIC. This book is much more readable and is fascinating in its scope and clarity. The influence of his mentor Bernard Baylin is evident and one almost believes he is reading the teacher rather than the student. An excellent work by an accomplished historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true revolution","review":"For the first time I truly understand the importance of the American revolution. In school you learn about no taxation without representation, and heroic figures like George Washington but I always had the sense that this was a petty reason for rebelling against England. It seemed that Americans just wanted to be independent from England. This book shows that the revolution was about changing a society governed by an aristocracy where everyone knows there pace into a society where everyone is equal and can be anything they desire. It was a true revolution that transformed society as thoroughly as the Russian Revolution did in 1917. The difference of course is that our revolution was a liberation and a success. The Russian revolution only brought slavery and death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick Wolf Should Be Ashamed","review":"It's amazing that such a large cast had no likable or interesting characters.

Period. The author(s) took the time to clearly explain topics and answer all those little \\"Wait, why did you do this?\\" questions that other texts leave to you to figure out. I still go back to this book instead of Hibbeler's engineering series as the concepts are explained much more clearly and the excersizes are tough to make sure you really learn the concepts. Another great feature of this book is it's easy to understand writting style.

Very good choice overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lot of hard questions, not enough explanation","review":"The book does not go indepth into a lot of physics problems. It will solve one question on one topic and then give the student a bunch of other questions at the end of the chapter that are different and harder than the solved example problems.

Yes, while carbon IS the fourth most plentiful element in the universe, the statistical distribution of elements on earth is relatively unique compared to the rest of the universe.

I'm no math major, but I'm pretty sure 1% of 49,000 is 490, which is quite a bit less than 750. How do blatant, elementary math errors make it into a published book?

I would have loved it if it were a clone of Dave Mirras BMX, but its not. This came out after Dave Mirras BMX and it should have been better. This game suffers a great deal with clipping (textures and walls become see through), the gameplay is slow, and the control is hard to manuver. When you turn, it turn more and further than you want it to go. The camera is very choppy and does not help you see what is in front of you. The animation is very stiff and unrealistic, even for a game. save your money and dont buy it.

Brumwell has one point to make, more or less, that the English soldier in North America adapted to the style of fighting needed during the French-Indian War and was effective.

Every page contains several footnotes which usually don't explain anything further and could better be placed at the end. I had to work to finish the book.

What I don't love is the suggestion that we use fresh yeast to the point where all of the recipes calibrated for the use of fresh yeast, without providing conversions to dry yeast in each recipe. The conversion appears at the beginning, and is cumbersome. It puts me off trying the bread recipes when I don't happen to have fresh yeast at hand (n.b. this is most of the time) and when I don't have a pencil and paper to do some arithmetic. The one time we did buy fresh yeast, it had gone bad before we could use it.

In one scene they dare each other to stand naked outside their adopted father's window. They believe they were once ancient Aztec/Inca goddesses. The dialouge is culturally odd in the translation as the girls are described as \\"so sweet, so pure, just like the sisters of baby Jesus.\\" Another bit was \\"all gods are real because they are imaginary.\\"The movie was artsy and not a real horror style vampire film.

To whom exactly? Typical disfunctional redneck family drama with an alien subplot thrown in. The middle of the film seems to drag forever. The music is cheesily dated and the acting is sub-porn level. GI is included on the Mill Creek Sci-Fi Classics package, and it's defintely one of the clunkers in the lot. Could be entertaining after eating mushrooms and drinking a bottle of sangria, but you'll get more out of watching the designs on the wallpaper move or trying to write the next great American road novel and taking off for LA, forgetting you have to work at McDonalds in the morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singing Praises","review":"How can you not love MST3K, This time the boys are forced to watch a musical!

I hope they release more movies from the more recent seasons soon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hye, I won the essay contest!","review":"I like to think of I Accuse My Parents as the perfect gateway MST3K episode. Not only is the movie laughably moronic in several different ways--without being as mind numbingly boring as Manos, the Hands of Fate--it's proceeded by an awesome short about truck farming and the host segments are all pretty funny as well. My sister and I got my mother to drink the cool-aid with this one, and it was made better because she was pretty sure she'd actually seen the truck farming short in school. I also indoctrinated my girlfriend with it and now it's become one of her favorites.Yes, this is a Joel episode, but it's Joel at his best. If you don't come out of watching this with at least three or four new catch phrases added to your vocabulary, there is no hope for you at all. You should probably blame your parents for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"I accuse this film of being really bad","review":"I Accuse My Parents, while not one of the worst films on MST3k, is still ludicrously incompetant enough to make Joel, Crow, and Servo's roasting of it a special experience. It's basically about Jimmy, who is neglected by his drunk parents and ends up killing someone. It could have been a thought-provoking story of how his parents' ignorance led him to join the mob, except he's so stupid he doesn't even realize he joined the mob! Also, depite his whines to the contrary, his parents ultimately had nothing to do with him destroying his life! Maybe if his father was in the mob, that would have at least been something. The episode has some great host segments, like the art therapy projects and trying to explain where Jimmy's madness actually comes from. A great episode from the Joel years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truck farming short","review":"I can't believe no one has mentioned the truck farming short! While the boys have seen much funnier shorts, I think that this one is the best part of this movie. As usual, the Encyclopedia Brittanica company puts a positive spin on things like migrant labor and DDT. As usual, Joel & co. shoot them down.

Ruth Marlow, a rather timorous and unheroic protagonist, has so much in common with the less confident everywoman of this world, but somehow she is able to cope with the challenging conditions thrust on her. I also rather enjoyed Nick - a most unconventional \\"knight on a white horse\\" and agree with the previous review - just who or what was the cat/house?

Other than that - a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Had a lot of fun with this one. A very light, fast read, especially fun for SCAdians or people who like the references to other stories. I also like the fact that many of the characters are adults - why should teenagers get to have *ALL* the fun?! ;) The characters can be a bit one-sided, but it would be hard to elaborate too much on them, given the pace of the book, without boggling the story-line down. I like the humorous elements, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I won't sum up the book since the first reviewer did so quite nicely.

Lovely background music to tea and cakes on a rainy day or having a nice little picnic with a shy friend. It's Winnie the Pooh music.

But I'm listening to it right now and it's grown on me. It is simply a sweet CD.Those negative reviews are, judging from their tone, written by people who get angry fairly easily. This album was clearly not made for that audience.By the way, \\"Weathershow\\" really rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Props to Isobel + Friends","review":"The arrangements on The Green Fields of Foreverland are wonderfully sparse and lovingly played. They are clear and simple, a virtue that most bands could learn from. The playing is certainly amateur, but makes no effort to hide this and that is (mostly) charming.

James Caan is quite charming as the producer and fan of Fanny Bryce looking to get rich. They're sparring relationship, and the resulting romance, is charming, in a kind of \\"Two For The Road\\" or Sam and Diane kinda way.Compared to Funny Girl, this movie, of course, doesn't stand up.

At the time, it was highly anticipated and did make good money for Columbia Pictures. Even the stars in attendance that night like Henry (Fonzi) Winkler, Roddy McDowall and Rosalind Russell, seemed bored by it.And no wonder. The character of Fanny Brice in this film is completely different that she was in Funny Girl. The story is dull and goes nowhere. Fanny has become a hardened woman and not a very nice one. James Caan is poorly cast. as Billy Rose, who tries to turn a professional relationship into a personal one. The whole thing is for her fans only.

The personalities, the on screen chemistry, the arrangements, set designs 'cept for the proposal stage model, were disjointed and misrepresented for time period. Not sure what hair and makeup did with Babs but she looked washed out and the DP did not help with her good side. Ben Vereen was an exceptional talent and provided the most polished sequence despite the hideous color scheme for costumes on the two women, 1930's???

The features that are presented are luke warm, at best. The film itself and the quality of the DVD is terrific. It's great to get this stuff on DVD format and not worry about preservation with video tape. If you enjoy cinematography, then watch the \\"How Lucky Can You Get\\" number a few times.

Instead you get more of a \\"Two For The Road\\" antagonistic romance, or perhaps if you're a TV fan, Sam and Diane.

Barbara Stanwyck had class, was intensely private, and so what? If people want to discuss their sex lives and have the information published for the world to see, fine. Personally, I have a lot more respect for people, gay or otherwise, who mind their own business and expect the rest of the world to do the same.

At some point, readers are going to have to ask how much unflinching they can take.Some of the early stories in the book are not as realized as they might be, but the payoff is the tour de force that is the title story at the end. \\"Poachers\\" is a memorable little novella that will leave readers looking forward to Franklin's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy at its best! Vibrant and mesmerizing, a real treat!!","review":"If it's 3 a.m. and you are trying to figure out how to be a midwife to a centaur,then you've fallen under the spell of Nick O'Donohoe and his many and varied friends at the Crossroads.This series of books(3 so far)is both factual and fanciful as B.J.Vaughn,the veternarian, must come to terms with bringing both the best and the worst that our world has to offer to the \\"other Folk of Crossroads\\". A very good read,indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music & Performances","review":"Both CDs in this set contain pieces by R. Strauss or his father that aren't heard very often, at least in my experience. I found the music and all the performances on these 2 CDs to be very good and enjoyable to listen to, not only because they are well-played, but because before listening to them I'd heard these pieces very rarely if at all, and they are refreshingly new to my ears. I also like the variety of solo instruments featured."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR GOD'S SAKE, GET THIS!","review":"I have seen this book available online elsewhere, in a 2004 edition (!), so really, there is no excuse for you not having this.Honestly, by the time I got to page 10, I'd already had many of my assumptions about health and strength challenged.Dr. Siff seems to have a much greater appreciation for the contributions to health made by real strength training as opposed to cardiovascular fitness, which is basically heresay here in the USA. The man says:\\"...the proliferation of weight training facilities and personal trainers still has much more to do with commercialsim than the impact of strength science, as is emphasized by the fact that the CARDIOVASCULAR DOCTRINE [emphasis added] still dominates the fitness conscious psyche...\\"This book is a goldmine, loaded with a constant stream of science-based information that is essential.Before you read this, make sure you are ready to expand your knowledge base and dive in-depth into specifics as opposed to generalizations."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Solvent extraction and Supercritical Solvent Extract","review":"What is solvent extraction and supercritical solvent extractionWhat is critical condition , subcritical condition and supercritical condition and how the properties of water being changed in supercritical condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EARLY WESTERN WRITER","review":"There are wonderful, well-written (although in an older style) stories about the early days of the Old West along the lines of Jack London, Mark Twain and John Steinbeck. Early California comes alive on the pages, as do some of the characters doing the gambling, settling down, and even stealing horses, with some of the culprits barely escaping the vigilantes (but not always). I particularly enjoyed \\"Salomy Jane's Kiss,\\" \\"The Poet of Sierra Flat,\\" and \\"The Luck of Roaring Camp.\\" Some sadness and struggle in the stories, but also a lot of humor.These stories will never die and the writer will become immortal with the readers that enjoy this genre.

There are also textual notes at the bottoms of the margins as well as notes about how other Greek texts are different in some verses. I give the book 5 stars as a product.Now let me tell you not to use interlinears. It completely defeats the purpose of working with the Greek text. Hodges and Farstad have made a number of judgment calls in their ultra-literal translation, so you are really just buying their opinions. You might as well just have a translation that you trust in front of you. Interlinears fake you into thinking you are working with the Greek text when you are actually just working with the observations of those who made the interlinear. Do yourself a favor and learn Greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greek/English, features not found elsewhere","review":"Amazon is the greatest place to find out of print books. The New King James Version Greek English Interlinear New Testament is formatted in a different way. It has the word order numbered so you can make sense of the translated words. It is a line by line interlinear and they have the bible text off to the side in a column to help you read and understand the context. They have also underlined some words and below that offered a more concise meaning of the word. Word study offers alphabetized list, Greek, it's English spelling and Bible reference. Was fearing the worse when I ordered the cheapest copy available, but was almost pristine in condition. Dust Jacket was in great shape. The only marks found were a name/address stamp on the outside pages opposite the binding and inside the front cover.

She also wrote the fantastic How to Steal a Dog. This book is just as good. Strong voice, fast read, I couldn't put it down. Main character, Bird, is looking for a best friend. She finds a boy she wants as a friend and doesn't give up. Full of fun, quirky characters you'll just love. O'Connor's use of quick, specific details does well to establish the settings.

I honestly think that people who like this book don't really understand the lifestyle that they are buying into. They want rustic village living, but with all the benefits of industrial society on demand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best watch I have ever owned","review":"I bought this watch on a cruise and loved the perpetual date function.

When I took a closer look and found all the features available I was instantly sold! The perpetual year is a great feature, and I've seen several other reviewers complain that it doesn't have a daylight savings feature... well, there are actually places in the world that DON'T do daylight savings; and after living in Hawaii for the last 4 years, it would have been really annoying for my watch to suddenly adjust itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high quality watch!","review":"This is a finely-crafted watch that will impress.

After about 2 weeks I noticed it would be late by 15 to 30 minutes. I'd reset. A few days or a week later same thing. I left it in the sun for 8 hours to charge. Same thing happened a few days later. This is a complicated watch. I have read and reread the manual. There is nothing I am not understanding about operating the watch. You should be able to charge it once and leave it run. It get plenty of sun.Exchanged it for another of the same model. Same exact thing is now happening after about 3 months. Thought I got a good one but guess not. If two of these do the same thing for one guy, I would seriously suspect the quality of this watch. I've never had any problem with a decent quality watch before this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 6 years and 2 days of service","review":"The watch is very nice looking, solid and accurate (while it works).Then, a day comes and it doesn't respond to anything - cannot change date, time, nothing. None of hands move, exposure to extra light helps none.Warranty is limited to 5 years, and my watch died after 6 years and 2 days being on my wrist. There was no abuse at all, I loved and 'babied' it. I was hoping to get 15+ years of service from the watch made in Japan and costing that much...The reason I gave it a star - it was a good watch when it worked, I liked it. I think I gave Citizen too much credit when I parted with about $400 exchanging it for this watch.My watch was not purchased thru Amazon, thus there are no complaints going that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this watch","review":"My wife gifted me this for our anniversary a year and half back and its working great.

Eco-drive is GREAT!","review":"This is a standard-sized (40mm; it will not overwhelm your wrist like larger designs, although I did think the watch would be a bit bigger), visually awesome watch that you can wear daily, and the 'Eco Drive' technology means you never have to wind it, move or shake it (like an automatic), or change batteries. What a concept! The typical wearer will wear it enough (several times a week) such that it keeps a good charge by being exposed to everyday indoor light and outdoor sunlight. It looks and feels expensive as well, with a good amount of weight to it. The only drawback (if you want to call this one) is that you will hear the phrase 'nice watch!' on a frequent basis! Incidentally, this exact model watch was featured in an excellent article on Citizen Watches in the April 2006 issue of 'Watch Time' Magazine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In 1 year sent back 4 times already","review":"I can't even express in words how much I hate this watch. Bought it for my husband for Christmas of 2007, by summer it had been back to Citizens 3 times. They want to blame it on my husband, (who has read the book that came with the watch cover to cover). He knows how things work with the watch. It suppose to forever almost hold a charge. Husband works outside full sun most of the time. They have replaced insides twice, if it was husbands fault, why replace insides, if watch isn't to blame. Won't just admit it's a lemon, will not get refund on piece of you know what. Had it back 4th time when it wasn't keeping accurate time again. They charged it and sent it back to us. They have done that before and within a week or 2 was keeping inaccurate time.

Only kept it a couple weeks. Complicated, hard to use, had to get the instructions out just to reset the time, and I hated it. The date is so small, I needed a magnifying glass to read it. The only thing that kept it from going in the garbage is that my daughter was visiting and I gave it to her for my son in law. He has a Timex. He tried the Citizen for a few days, but since then I see he is wearing the old Timex. He said he didn't like the Citizen either. Guess I wasted my money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great style and craftsmanship.","review":"This watch looks very classy yet rugged, and it feels very solid. The face changes color depending on how the light hits it. It goes from a shiny bright blue (bright sunlight) to a deep rich blue (little light) to almost black (little light).

Plus I learned some of the small tricks you don't learn when you teach yourself a piece of software.

But I thought it was funny how the New Zealand reviewer thought that Where'er you walk was the worst aria and Che faro one of the best. My impression was just the contrary! I liked Where'er you walk best, Vivi tiranno was probably next in line, but the Gluck was right down at the bottom: Scholl's intonation and phrasing in it seemed far inferior to the wonderful singing of this piece by James Bowman on the Malgoire recording (which I highly recommend).

Hay uses her own experiences with healing from cancer to suggest ways that others can put themselves in a \\"state of mind\\" of healing.

It really helps you to understand the underlying reasons behind \\"dis-ease\\" in the body from a metaphysical perspective, which I find to be fascinating. This book is excellent for those suffering with serious diseases as well as for those who are well. The information can help you to prevent illnesses by gaining a better understanding of how the body functions and the different effects that thoughts, emotions and memories of pain can have on the body. A truly down to earth, enlightening read that allows us to become partners with our thoughts and our bodies. I bought this book to help me understand my sister's cancer.

I am disappointed that from page 10-80 (83 pages) is listing the problems in alphabetical order and the probable causes in a few words and the new thought patterns.

The controls are the real problem. I died 12 times(no joke)on the first level just trying to aim and shoot at the same time. The gameplay consists of running preforming random video game tasks like \\"Open the locked doors\\" and \\"Stop the cargo truck\\". The graphics look like a bad PS game, and sound score is awful. Don't buy this game. Instead, buy MGS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of control","review":"This game sucks it is so difficult to control the character that they have to train you just how to control the way oni walks. what kind of [...] is that maybe others like that but I for one want to start the game not spend two hours in training rooms figuring out how to move that is crazy. I gave up after two hours of training and gave it back to my friend thank goodness I didn't waste money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oni...nope","review":"okay...I played this game and decided to take it back after the second day and get another game. Thank goodness I had bought it used. I don't think it was hard to learn how to control her in the training missions...it just made it wierd to try to aim and move and shoot with the analog sticks. I just didn't like the controls...plus the fact of this beeing my first PS2 game it didn't meet with graphical expections or desires.

The graphics blow: they would have been AVERAGE on the PSX. Same with the sound. The gameplay is boring and predictable.

Not only can whats-her-face do too much, which IS a bad thing, there are seperet controls for the same thing;i.e. press X to \\"use\\" and R3 to pick things up. But what can you expect from Take2Interactive. The only good games they've made they don't get any visible credit for,( Max Payne and Grand Theft Auto III,) what a shock.I summed up this entire review from five minute of play. And at the beginning of that third minute, I started realizing the opening anime cinema is the best part of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this game is fun not only do u fight using a hot chick with martial arts u get to fight with weapons each weapon serves their own purpose you can fire poisonous gas into a room and u can run away and wait for ur enemies to die you can shock someone you have a 45. that fires just like a real gun ofcourse it feels real and yes it hard and the controling isnt too bad at all .. to all the haters rating this game its because they have no skillz ... ooo and the cheats are awesome u can shape shift into the guys are u are fighting soo soo cool def. not very replayable but for 2 or 3 bucks of buying this game ITS DEF. WORTH IT !!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome game but could be better","review":"Oni is one of the first ps2 games ever to start off which means this is before it started to get the extremely beautiful graphics but this game has good graphics for ps2 at the time. Brought to you by the infamous Rockstar games that brought you such titles such as GTA Vice City and Midnight Club 2,it chronicles the career of Konoko an officer who learns that she is part of an experiment started by her late father and when she starts to uncover the truth about what she is everyone turns on her. Now she must fight for the truth and her life.Great plot with good anime cinematics the whole thing is reminiscent of ghost in the shell. The game play goes from descent to somewhat difficult at times and the game does have a few glitches but all in all it is a good game that just didn't realize its full potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than average","review":"This was one of the first games I bought for my PS2. I bought it since you could fight with and without guns and you could these awesome fighting moves. The game is awesome in every way. The story is very simple and the controls are a little hard for an unexperienced gamer. The length of the game is decent and the camera occasionaly gets in the way. This is why it is getting a 4 star rating. Other than that the game is good. It's not to violent and it is a lot of fun once you get the hang of the controlls. I recommend this game to most people who are able to learn the controlls of a game easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Siphon Filter nock off","review":"For any of you that have already played siphon filter for the PS1 then I will suggest you go back and play it instead of reading my review of this game. As many of you have already guessed Oni has the same general game play and feel as the aforementioned game. Additional control was added to give the player more things to worry about during game play but otherwise not much has changed mechanically. Now as for the storyline this game presents a classic, or should I say transparent, plot that does not develop into anything worthwhile. Each level is more of the same thing with the foreshadowing functioning as subtly as a herd of elephants. In short this game could only be redeemable if it had come out on the PS1. There is no evidence of the capability, or the price tag, that has become associated with PS2 titles.I would recommend renting this game instead of purchasing it. There is little to no replay value and the plot will not keep a player interested for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"oh, i don't know it lacked a certain something Whats the word FUN!

And in some respects, that's true. However, as a seasoned veteran of game systems, this is probably the hardest game to control I have EVER played. It's a rare thing for me to get so angry at video game. DOn't let the fluidity of Konoko's motion to confuse the issue... You can't control her. It's difficult to get used to using both analog sticks top control movement, aim weapons, and look around. That coupled with too many enemies that attack in groups will frustrate you. It's really awful to be having your tail kicked and not be able to even find who's got their foot in you rear. I found Oni to be a complete frustrating waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks, Rockstar!","review":"Rockstar, the developers of this awful game, sure have been pumping out the PS2 games. Smuggler's Run was fun and all, but this is just too bad. It fails in every way that a game can. The visuals are sub-par (PSOne games look 10x better than this), it controls like a cow, and the actual gameplay is repetitive and a chore to play. Not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a dime","review":"This is the worst PS2 game I have ever played. Boring, repetitive backgrounds, uninteresting weapons and characters, awkward control scheme, all on one disk. I bought this game used a while ago for $12.00 and I still feel ripped off.Did I mention the graphics? This game was released close to the time of the PS2 launch, and it shows. There are also some serious clipping issues.Simply put: Oni isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands down the worst game I have ever played","review":"Don't be fooled by the seemingly positive reviews that ... seems to give this game. The thing that realy does this game in is the extremly awkward controls. I'm sure they were trying to be inovative by coming up with a new way of doing things but in the end the game is supposed to be fun, and it isn't fun dying every 10 min because you couldn't accuratly turn around and hit the guy behind you. Add this in with a \\"been there, done that\\" storyline and you have a game you definetly can do without. This game is so bad that I rented it, only played for two days, forgot I had it and ended up having to pay the late fee when I didn't return it in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oni, you ain't no Lara !","review":"I didn't like it from the first time but gave it more of a chance and played it 3 or 4 more times until I gave up and probably won't touch it gain! I found the controls too complicated, the graphics annoying, and the characters not likeable or even interesting... But what bothered me most is the cutesy childlike voiceover which sounded like a 4 year old talking to you while Oni is reaching for machine guns and bazookas. A surreal combination. My experience with this kind of game before Oni was with Tomb Raider. This game doesn't measure up and Oni is no Lara Croft."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONI NOOOOOOOOOO....)0'.","review":"I love 3rd person action games, but ONI is NOT one of PS2's shining moments. first off the graphics are very DULL, there is no kewl storyline, as opposed to syphon filter, tomb raider resident evil ETC. and The controls really suck, especially for a action game. waayyy too many button schemes.This is a blatant ghost in the shell wannabe, and not for TRUE ANIME fans. (you know who you are..) if i had a choice i would rather buy EA's X Sqaud. it may be a lil' simplistic, but you'll get your $$ worth. i would pass on ONI and save ($) more to buy a DREAMCAST. iv'e seen much better games on SEGA's dying platform than the much hyped PS2.BUYER BEWARE.. Rent ONI, b4 you buy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring game","review":"I have almost played all the playstation games that exist. Let me tell you. Oni is nothing like Metal gear solid or some other good games. It's boring! period! And, not to mention the controls.

Boy, was I wrong. don't waste your money buying this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Oni did not live up to the hype. The graphics were dark, you can only carry one weapon, and the controls will cause you to go crazy or just cause you to return the game. Worst of all, the levels are just not that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oni, way to real","review":"Oni is a very beautiful game with all its stage and caracters. However one may try to put how good the game is, it will be hard to prove so in practice. I am confident to say that I am quite a hard person to frustrate, but this game annoyed me so much I almost broke the controller. Its much too hard to get used to the controls(use all buttons) and to fight the opponents it is impossible. They always comes in bunchs and with weapons, which makes virtually to kill some of them! The weapons are one of the worst things in the game. It's so hard to aim and get the opponent that its not even funny. Plus, they always have the recoil, which can be said to make the game real, but only ... you off. I would strongly recommend you to rent this game before buying it, because I made the mistake of buying as soons as it came out and I can say that I WASTED MONEY ON THIS GAME! So if you wanna try it, go ahead, but do not buy it if you haven't played yet! You will regret!"},{"rating":"1","title":"oni","review":"I THINK THIS GAME REALLY [stinks] I AM NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT THE GAME PLAY.

The graphics are great, and the fighting system is very cool! There are tons of cool moves that are pretty easy to execute, and lots of cool weapons. The storyline is also really good, and will really pull you into the game. Load times may be a bit long, but that doesn't take away from an otherwise great game. You may have a bit of trouble getting used to the controls at first, but they will soon seem like second nature to you. Casual gamers, hardcore gamers, and anime fans alike will love this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Trouble for the Money.","review":"Oni was way, way too difficult to control. I found I had to set all of the controls to my own ways because otherwise there would be no way I would ever get through it. The only real value to the game is that is good looking and has a lot of freedom. Unfortunately, the effort to give you freedom gave the game ... controls. The game also lacked originality and a sense of adventure that I hoped would come with it. Instead, it was a game where if you were patient in playing it enough you could get through it. I think if this was the first version of the game, as the manufacturer I would be pleased, but would have long conversations on how to improve it. As a result, look elsewhere to spend your bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screen protector","review":"This company offers overpriced screens and is unresponsive and unfriendly to customers who have a problem.

His first book, \\"The Koreans\\", is the best book on the South Korean people I've ever read and I was eagerly anticipating this book, hoping it would complement the first book. Unfortunately, it is mainly a compilation of other books with a couple of personal notes from an old trip or two Breen made to North Korea prior to the famine of the 1990s. If you read \\"Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" by Kang Chol-Hwan and \\"The Great North Korean Famine\\" by Natsios, you will have basically read this book as well.For the best information on North Korea and its people, \\"North Korea: Through the Looking Glass\\" by Kong Dan Oh is probably still the best book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and ill-informed","review":"I purchased this book with the intent of providing some back ground on Kim Jong-Il as I was reading his official North Korean biography, and foolishly thought this would be one additional perspective.I was wrong. This book essentially culls common western thought about Kim Jong-Il, references his state biography a few times and repeats many things from the press without note. Poor writing compounds. The only thing of interests were his personal experiences, which are fairly rare from North Korea and did shed some light.Overall, one would be better off reading Bruce Cuming's work on North Korea, either his book Behind Closed Doors or his excellent survey history Korea's Place in the Sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Rubbish","review":"It is not worth paying money for this book. Mr Breen offers no new insights into Kim Jong Il and has simply rehashed information available on the internet. I suggest anyone interested in North Korea and Kim Jong Il either select another book or save their time and money and spend 5 minutes doing a google search.In describing North Korea and it's leader in terms such as a \\"dump\\" Mr Breen has reduced this book from simply being boring and worthless to nothing more than tabloid type gutter press.Kim Jong Il is a major player in wrld politics and I was interested to see that finally someone had taken the time to write a book on him.

His Arkel set the standard for Debussyan chanson, too, and in considering that, this Terfel performance seems well within the French tradition and not Puccinian verismo at all.After all the nasty things I've written about Chung, I'll stick to giving him his due here for outstanding work. The Santa Cecilia forces have historically rejected anyone resembling a hack, and in accepting Chung, they give him their considerable all here.Reassign four stars on a rehearing...as blessed relief for all the precious British little boychoir performances we're saddled with in these powerful works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Hearing; Watching Doesn't Hurt","review":"This is a very fine opera, with a very surprising and powerful ending (the disk also includes an alternate \\"happy\\" ending which has nothing to recommend it except curiosity).

When Annie Garthwicke comes to Castle MacCain she doesn't expect to meet her destiny -- just to help her father.What makes this romance unusual is the richness of the evil and the buildup of the real tension in the story. Because it is a romance you know how it will end -- but if were any other genre, there would be considerable doubt if the hero survives!The only negatives I find is that it has tantalizing loose ends. Why does Annie \\"know\\" this place? What is it specifically about the villian that links him to the item-of-power (I'm not going to spoil it for readers)? I suspect that editors ask her to dump plot insights for more descriptions of sex, and more sex, and even more sex. Her characters deserve time to have more depth, and she needs a better cover.But The Shadowing is worth keeping on my shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"\\"Shadowing\\" by Joan Overfield is a gothic which tells the story of a man, the last of his line, who is living with curse that has been passed down the line for about 400 years. It takes the love a special lady to lift the shadows from his soul. He's not the only one who benefits though, she's been living with her own sort of curse in the form of a demanding, cantankerous father who treats her like dirt.This was an interesting, engrossing read and fresh in a gothic sorta way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling and intense!","review":"THE SHADOWING is all a reader could want in a Gothic romance and more. Of course, I LOVE \\"woo-woo\\" (better known as paranormal <g>) stories, and this is one of the best, IMO.Strong characterization, believable and sympathetic characters, a fresh and original storyline, all kept me reading at break-neck speed.Thank you for a wonderful book, Ms. Overfield.

I bought this bike seat from a mail order catalog on a whim ... having no high expectations.The seat exceeded my expectations, and I am riding every weekend again. No padded bicycle shorts or gel seat would accomplish what this seat does. I had tried them before giving up.No, you won't be able to ride w/no hands as mentioned in a previous review. But you have to prioritize. I'm 47 and my priorties do not include riding w/no hands.Prolonged pressure on that area can cause low sperm count, erectile dysfunction, discomfort, etc.So in the grand scheme of things....being able to ride w/no hands seems faaaaaar less \\"impotent\\", I mean, important :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hobson EasySeat","review":"I thought I would try this seat since it's not extremely expensive. I was looking for something more comfortable since I'm a large person. This seat is poorly made and is very uncomfortable. It was far worse than any seat that comes with most bicycles. I would not recommend this seat to anyone regardless of body size and/or weight. I didn't even take a ride using this seat as I saw no point in doing so. I just threw it in the garbage since I wouldn't give this seat too anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is awful","review":"I bought this seat years ago and after sitting on it for a few seconds took it off, it hurt and didn't fit right.

The pictures are surprisingly good concidering they are only a little bit larger than a stamp.

I'm not sure if I didn't like the book because I wanted the outcome to be different (unfortunately, the title was a dead give-away) or if I truly did not like the book.This book feels like 280 pages of a Celtic Bataan Death March. The Prince and his family/friends/companions travel the length and breadth of Ireland harrassed on all sides by not only the English, but his own people. It was written as a testimony to resilience in the face of starvation, exhaustion, betrayal and hopelessness. Unfortunately, it simply felt like a very long slog - both for both Llelyn's characters and the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful depictions of Ireland.","review":"What can I say..... she is one of my favorite authors and I love reading all her books.

It's not for everyone - but if you are on a serious spiritual journey (or wish to be), then this book is for you.It's not just about money. But it is about money. And it's about how to create your best, most fulfilling and abundant life. And gives you REAL TOOLS - not just concepts.If your gut says \\"yes\\" to getting it - just get it. Be open. Take what you like and leave the rest. I loved just about every word of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth Teacher","review":"I would recommend anything from Sanaya Roman.

Skip pages 140 through 195 and you should be ok. Now to my reason on giving this book a 2 star rating: there are several Audio programs offered at the end of this book with the same title as this book. DO NOT buy any of them, this book has all the information you need to know about manifesting and wealth building; those tapes are an absolute waste.Buy this book, relax in a silent room, read it slowly and follow the meditation techniques, it will help. You are the creater and the created, having said that, you can have whatever you want and this book will show you how."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me","review":"People have actually bought this nonsense. I've got a better idea. Send me the cost of the book and I'll wave my magic wand over your money and watch it disappear into my bank account. How's that for \\"channelling\\".

Live within your means and cut up your credits cards?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Channel Garbage","review":"This book has absolutely nothing to do with business management or ownership and is total nonsense.

I have become completely confident about my ability to create income and receive money from unexpected sources. $100 here, $80 there, and huge opportunities seem to be falling into my lap - it's like it has all come together with amazing synchronicity. Only it has more to do with my awareness and my magnetizing the right situations to me. Get the book, but try the tapes too. Go at it with an open mind and you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!!","review":"I have read many books about money and how to manifest it, but this by far is the most spiritually pure of them all. This does not involve get rich quick schemes, nor does it preach religious dogma. It truly comes from a place of love, light and sprituality. What's even better is that it does not just focus on money specifically, but abundance in all areas of your life. Definitely a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great historical view of early Texas.","review":"This book was recommended to me by a Border Patrol agent in Texas when I asked him to elaborate on the history of the Border Patrol and The Texas Rangers.

I even found a free .pdf file of it online and downloaded it to my phone! But I still wanted the book because as a writer, I value the time others have poured into their work. Cliche, I know. Anyway, I'm in a situation where I have needed to pinch pennies, so I wasn't willing to shell out twenty bucks for a book. Luckily, my best friend remembered the name and got it for me for Christmas!

Words can't convey how bad the acting is, specifically the kid that plays Mio.

He is a John Wayne super-fan and loves all his movies; I love to laugh. McLintock suited us both. It is funny throughout, portraying the state of matrimony with all its irritations and flaws! And of course, to appease the western-movie fans, there are plenty of scenes involving drunken brawls, cattle driving, cowboys and Indians, and of course, John Wayne!

I have tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase it on DVD in Canada. Finally, I decided to import a copy. BIG MISTAKE! What I hoped would be a pleasurable evening's entertainment quickly deteriorated when I saw the dreadful quality (or lack of quality) of this DVD. I have seen worn out rental VHS tapes that far exceed the quality of this particular DVD. The manufacturer should be embarrassed by the poor quality of this offering. I rate this copy at one star only because there is nothing lower. Those seeking this entertaining title should save their money and await the release of a copy of McLintock that is worthy of the Duke."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful shame","review":"This movie is (usually) a great way to spend a lighthearted evening. However, the production quality of this disc is so abysmally bad that it is difficult to enjoy the movie. I certainly wouldn't spend the money on it again. I would rather watch it on AMC, bowflex and dietary supplement commercials, notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away from this product as fast as you can!!!!","review":"This isn't a review of the movie so much as a review of the DVD itself. First of all I purchased this exact same copy from Target for 1.00. Yes you read right, 1.00. I now know why it was so cheap. This movie as well as another one purchased look like they were done by someone videotaping a TV screen with a cheap camcorder. The sound and pitcture are horrible. The screen is jumpy and will have you seasick by the time the opening credits are done. To put it simply, Great Movie but a Bad DVD. Wait for the Official version that I have read is coming out in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"McClintock DVD is of very poor quality","review":"I have previously purchased this movie on video casette. It was the authorized version by the Wayne family and is of excellant quality. I looked forward to viewing this movie on DVD, but was very disappointed in the quality of the Good Times edition. The sound quality is that of an old print of a black and white 1930's western. It is scratchy and very annoying to listen to. This wasn't a digitally remastered print of the original film. Good Times simply copied an old out of date print of the film onto DVD. The picture quality is poor with lines and evidence of the wear and tear of countless theater and TV viewings. I would suggest that anyone wanting to purchase a DVD of this film wait until a reputable company releases an authorized version that can be enjoyed. I certainly felt ripped off after watching ten minutes of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Poor DVD","review":"This is a fun movie. John Wayne, Maureen Ohara, Stephanie Powers, the Duke's son Patrick, plus all the other actors, must have had a ball making this film. It shows.

I made the mistake of purchasing this DVD because I thought FINALLY they've come out with the fantastic version that's on VHS put out by the John Wayne family. NO WAY!

I wish they'd hurry cause this is one of my favorite John Wayne movies!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Good Times release","review":"To all those customers out there that actually do read the reviews, there are two things that must be pointed out. First there are actually two different versions of this movie available on DVD and second, the reviews listed for the other inferior versions also get listed with this better special edition.This version of the film is almost as good as seeing it up on the big screen. The sound is fantastic, the picture quality is superb, and there are even extas on this DVD.The other version of the film is a substandard copy made from someone's TV copy. The picture is in constant zoom, there are scene's missing, and the audio is terrible.Please do not confuse the two. Stick with the DVD that says The John Wayne Collection at the top of the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality DVD for a great film","review":"I love this movie and was delighted to find it on DVD. I took it home to watch and was horrified to find scenes were cut short and dialogue was missing, most scenes were very grainy and the sound was terrible. Save some money and buy it on VHS. Be sure to buy the John Wayne Estate Authorized Edition for the best quality. DO NOT buy this great movie on DVD you will be disappointed at the quality!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor print leading to lousy transfer to DVD","review":"McLintock is a great comedy/western; the casting is perfect and the script intelligent and witty. However, Good Times Video treated this excellent movie with tremendous disrespect and cheated buyers of this DVD badly. The ancient Greek saying of\\"caveat emptor\\" or \\"let the buyer beware\\" fits well here.Anytime you see that the DVD comes from Good Times Video I highly recommend that you pass purchasing that item. Hopefully a REAL version of McLintock will be released by John Wayne's estate soon. This movie was not one of John Wayne's favorites and was released late for being such a good movie. Hopefully this had nothing to do with the estate of Mr. Wayne in releasing a crisp (and letter box) version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good film - Poor Transfer","review":"Goodtimes DVD transfer was obviously from a poor quality copy. Watching this version was like watching the movie in a matinee after the film had been shown a hundred times (accept that this version is a standard screen pan and scan version). You can see the film's imperfections, spots, vertical scratch lines. Some scenes even seem a bit out of focus. The color isn't too bad for a bargain video, except in a few scenes that seem washed out. I've always liked the movie and hope it is eventually released in a much better version. Buy the Goodtimes version only if you really love this film and you buy it at a really bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodtimes transfer as bad as it gets","review":"For all of you who got a DVD player for the digital quality, you will not find it here. Avoid the Goodtimes release and spend the extra $5-10 for the \\"Authorized by the Wayne Estate\\" version and you will not be sorry. The picture quality of the Goodtimes is not only poor and grainy, there are certain spots in the movie where a zoom effect takes place. I have seen this movie dozens of times on tape and if I had a choice between VHS and Goodtimes DVD, I would watch the tape. My family and I all love this movie but the Goodtimes version definitely was returned for refund at the store where purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I love this movie and I was hoping for a good DVD version which wouldn't get tired like VHS. WRONG. The quality of the cut is very poor, with many white and dark bits flashing and hanging around on the screen, similar to VHS drop-outs and a dirty film projector. While some of the sceens are sharp many look like a third generation VHS copy. Even all of that could be forgiven, or at least tollerated, for the inexpensive price I paid, but this movie screams for widescreen, or at least a good pan and scan, this cut has a fixed center frame, often with two noses or a nose and an ear talking to each other!!! I have an old, tired, VHS cut, with minutes missing, but a good pan and scan which I took off broadcast TV and will continue to watch instead of this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Read Reviews","review":"Boy, do I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this DVD. I love this story, but the video quality is so poor as to take away from the enjoyment of the movie. Far too many scenes are out of focus or the color is off.

About a week after they released it, John Wayne's son who had produced the movie, said that Goodtime had released it without his permission. He then released a much better version. BOTTOM LINE: DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM GOODTIME, ESPECIALLY THIS MOVIE. HOPE THAT WAYNE'S SON WILL RELEASE HIS VERSION ON DVD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"McLintock!","review":"The DVD is of very low quality due to the use of an old unrepaired master film.

The problem is that the transfer appears to have been done in a theatre, with a video camera using a very old print that has been run hundreds of times. This gives you images with what appear to be tears, burns and other image reducing faults. I went back to my old VHS copy to see what the real image was supposed to look like. All in all, one of the worst transfers I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mclintock","review":"Horrible picture on this DVD. The picture was faded, blurring, and out of sync! It was awful!

This is a wonderul, charming funny movie. However, the quality of this dvd is very poor. There are lines that move through the picture occasionally, there are bits of lint and dirt (like in a movie theatre),the sound is not always crisp, the film quality itself is sometimes fuzzy and unclear. I would highly recomend taping the remastered version off of TNT when it comes on, or buying the vhs version ( I believe it's better, but not having purchased it myself I would be careful before I buy). I do hope that they will re-release this movie onto dvd in its remastered format. If they do, it's worth the wait, pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie.

It was blurry at times, the color too much enhanced, and the film scratches too many. It was like watching a worn out film. In these times of refurbishing old movies to bring out the original feel, I didn't expect this product. This movie would have definitely been five stars if presented cleanly.

The Searchers movie is awesome as well as my other 60+ home videos) I do like the movie, (I always have) Good John Wayne quotes as always.

This film appears to have been transferred to DVD by simply capturing the center 4:3 portion of the picture. I don't know what the original aspect ratio of the film was, but there are a very noticeable number of scenes on this DVD in which the actors' faces are not visible because they are off the edge of the screen. In other words, they didn't use pan-and-scan. In addition, the image quality is not too good. I noticed what seemed to be grainy artifacts from the video compression process. Some scenes were out of focus. This could have been from the original film but I doubt it. The film this DVD was transferred from is very scratched. I hope there is a better copy of the film around and that a real DVD manufacturer makes a quality letterboxed version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd read the reviews first","review":"I purchased the DVD of McLintock about two months ago.

The picture and sound quality of the DVD version of McLintock was so poor that I could barely stand the first viewing. I was very disappointed.Needless to say I wish I could return it, but it has been longer than 30 days. I wasn't fast enough. I guess I'll just hold onto it for use as a \\"Frisbee\\" disc.

How this happens astounds me but I know the movie well and thankfully have kept an old VHS copy that is complete. The most notable exception is the scene where Maureen O'Hara bursts in on him playing chess and Birnbaum comments her hair looks a different shade. John Wayne laughs and says he is right, she did color her hair. Why cant they transfer a movie without cutting it up? All of John Wayne's movies need authorized editions that have been remastered badly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Good Point","review":"I bought this exact DVD before the official version came out. Yes, the picture and sound quality is terrible, BUT the only good point about this particular DVD is that it's in the Widescreen version.

Unfortunately these weasels have produced an amazingly bad, and at times out of focus DVD. Yes Virginia, out of focus. Sound quality is dubious and the best scenes in the movie are frequently the worst. *sigh*You own a DVD player to avoid seeing movies that look like they were recorded on a crummy videotape at LP setting.

Expecting the wonderful movie that so many know and love, I purchased this video only to discover on the back of the video sleeve that this is an edited version of the original. That's fine, but what these people did is unacceptable! They deleted all the original music, including background music, plus they deleted voices, and background sounds and replaced them! I could not even recognize John Wayne's drawl, (I don't think it's even his voice) and Maureen O'Hara's brogue has been replaced with the voice of someone else! On top of that, the timing is way off! I ended up turning the sound off and watching the movie in silence. Still a wonderful view, but for someone who went so far as to name her daughter \\"Kathryn\\" after the spirited character O'Hara plays, I am thoroughly disgusted.

It is a wonderful tale done by a great group of actors. The sad day comment is based on the totally pathetic quality of the DVD. To put is very simply it stinks. Not only is it not in widescreen it appears the film they copied it from was dragged around the parking lot for half an hour then danced on by a herd of elephants. I will stick to the VHS version of this movie until someone who is not out for a quick buck puts out a credible copy of this fine film. Save your money.

The overall quality (picture, focus, screen ratios, etc.) is absolutely awful -- this goes for both their VHS and DVD versions. If I could give it a half star I would.Apparently, the John Wayne Estate or his family lost control of either the reproduction or marketing rights to McLintock! some years ago, and Good Times took some Scotch brand tape, staples and chewing gum and patched together this awful copy.The good news is that John Wayne's family authorized a VHS version made from the original master footage, which is excellent. Look for an orange box with the Wayne family authorization printed on the front.

I reserve the star system for the movie as this review may be used for different media.George Washington McLintock (John Wayne) is one of the founding ranchers in the territory. He has many issues to deal with in a John Wayne fashion. These include dealing with new homesteaders, dealing with displaced Indians, and dealing with his estranged family (Maureen O'Hara and Stephanie Powers) returning for the Fourth of July celebration.The movie its self is top notch FIVE STAR. John Wayne used most of his standard crew (they can be seen in other John Wayne movies) and that formula plot that makes his movies great. The mud fight is one of the best parts.

I foolishly didn't look in this section and see the previous reviews of the DVD before I bought it. Bad move. This DVD is the worst quality DVD transfer I have seen. I compared the VHS and the DVD at the same time: The DVD was out of focus, color over-modulated and the picture slightly enlarged, so that, not only do you lose the Cinemascope aspect, but you also lose 5-10% of the vertical picture.

Many of the scenes appear washed out and the sound is so bad it detracts from the movie. It was obviously made from a well used copy of the film. There are many scratches and dust spots. On top of it all the physical condition of the disk is poor. When first played my DVD player indicated the disk was scratched or dirty. I tried cleaning it but it is still having problems. It seems a shame to waste the time and effort to produce such a poor quality product when a good copy could have been made. Hopefully a good version will be released soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I own the VHS version of this movie, and enjoy the film itself immensely. Unfortunately, the Goodtimes company has produced a very poor quality copy of the film.

WRONG! This movie is so poorly transfered it made me mad just to watch it. It needs to be offered in letterbox, sometimes all you see is the back of someones head and the person who is talking isn't even on the screen. Then the brightness goes up and down, and the picture gets fuzzy. If I had released this copy to the public I would be thourghly embarressed. I feel cheated out of my money and the fun of watching this movie. If another version is offered with letterbox and MUCH better quaility, I would buy it and throw this version in the trash. It has set a new standard in our house, rent the DVD first and check the quality, then buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad disappointment","review":"Everyone who has written about the poor transfer is correct.

Normally one of the funner John Wayne movies, a sort of western version of \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" it's nearly impossible to enjoy watching any of it due to the poor quality of the DVD. From the opening credits to the closing credits, the image is full of scratches and holes. There are even several complete scenes which are out of focus and blurry. This was obviously an attempt by Good Times to make a quick buck off of John Wayne's name. Let's hope that at some point in the future someone gets the rights to this film, restores it, and cleans up the images so that the charm of this movie isn't lost to future generations.

I watched the film because I thought it would be a great John Wayne western, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The plot is developed into something that could be good, but it never gets there. If you are looking for a classic western, this is not it. There is really none of the action one comes to expect in the John Wayne movies. The most fighting is a mildly humorous fight in a mudpit and Wayne chasing his wife through town. It could have been good, but it is not. There is a reason this film is in the public domain and free on Youtube. I would never watch this film again. It is a waste of the two hours that you spend viewing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dvd case was broken/ dvd scratched!","review":"I purchased McLintock on dvd from this company about a month ago.

However, upon watching it recently, it hit me like a sledge hammer that I do not want my daughter to see this movie. This movie, like \\"The Quiet Man\\", needs to be tossed, as I have tossed my copies. In violent American, where FBI stats tell us that violent homes are found in every tenth house on every street in America, the spectacle of a man chasing his wife through the streets and publicly (or privately) spanking her is not funny! Nor is the more subtle spectacle of that spanking being taken by the woman as a sign that her husband loves her. There is no love in hitting. There is only violence.

None of LEARNING EXPRESS's questions were on the Cal R.E. exam I took on April 17th 2004."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your dollars","review":"I didn't buy this book, not knowing the quality of the materials and saving ... Instead I borrowed from a public library. I spent innumerable hours studying and scoring 80% of the questions provided, including the useless CDROM. But I failed the exam.

It added some information that seemed unattainable elsewhere and caused me to reassess several conclusions I had come to. If you're looking for great writing in the fiction genre, this is not the book, though the author has a few surprisingly good passages that a good historical fiction writer might pay attention to, but for the most part, \\"Two Oceans\\" is a facinating factual account of some of the most grueling and exciting days of the war in the Pacific. Written by a Navy man -it has a touch of glory and shame for the seagoing and little detail of any land battles. For World War II buffs, a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best concise, single book history of WWII Naval War","review":"Admiral Morrison lived many of the events written of in his book. His telling of the tale is unequaled in any other single book, and is reflective of his much more extensive 15 volume set.The research, the attention to detail and the commentary regarding the strategic and tactical importance of various battles and phases of the war at see is very well done indeed.If the reader is not too familiar with the heroics, the savagery, the extents, or the sometimes very personal nature of war at sea , then The Two Ocean War is a must read.

I usually don't return anything to amazon.com, since most items are great, but these are loser baskets. First of all, they stink. They are so stinky, they give me a headache. Secondly, the wood is not smooth. Then, the paint chips. The liners don't fit. I am afraid to put my baby's blankets in these baskets because I think the wood may push through the thin, crummy liner and my baby will get splinters. YUCK.

I thought the were cute and would look cute in my sons room. I had planned to use them to hold diapers and baby toiletries. They would nave even worked nicely as little toy baskets, but I will not use them. The paint chips off VERY eaisly. It makes a mess of the whole house and fills up the baskets.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but Watch out for Paint Flakes!","review":"My husband and I were very excited to receive this as a gift off of our baby registry. As we were putting the liners in the baskets and placing them in the changing table, we noticed white paint flakes and white paint powder all over our hands, the changing table, and the carpet.We immediately sent these back, as we did not want paint flakes and dust floating around in our daughter's room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canvas Totes are the Way to Go","review":"I received a set of these for my shower. At first, they seemed ok, but after a short time of handling them they began to wear very easily. The paint does chip and the wicker becomes brittle and cracks.

About 15 minutes later I see white paint flakes on her chin and she is drooling. I managed to look in her mouth to find a piece of the basket in her cheek!

And I had heard that it wasn't very good, but I liked the idea, so I thought I would enjoy it. But it let me down, even from those low expectations. It was really dumb.

Do not bother watching !","review":"I have to agree with most of the reviews here. I read them and thought it'd suck but I went to watch it with an open mind. I was hoping it'd be a good one. Turns out this 1 h 26 min was a complete waste of my life. Bad plot, terrible graphics, decent acting but with no story the acting doesn't matter. Actors are not to blame the writers and directors are to blame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Gravity on the moon, not explained. Space crabs, lame. Terrible acting. There is NO action what so ever, not even an apex to the plot. Never explains how the footage made it back after they crashed. If I could I would create a class action lawsuit to get my 90min back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much far-fetched big conspiracy stuff...","review":"A movie like this is not compelling because of the all-too-often repeated storyline of an all-knowing government who knows all about the dangers and dead Russians but sent the men to the moon anyway. This is a real \\"9-11 Thruther\\" type scenario which falls apart as soon as you sweat a few first order logistical or historical details. My main objection to this type of movie is that it gives birth to the most meaningless and false tripe when the actual history is incredibly compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blair Witch Project Goes To Space","review":"This movie left me feeling like I'd been conned out of the cost of an Amazoid rental. While watching, I had feelings of \\"bad-movie-deja-vu\\"...like I'd felt this compulsion before. It was an irrepressible impulse to grab the remote and permanently pause this bit of filmic three-card Monte. Then it hit me---this was basically the Blair Witch Project on the moon! Meh...I hated the Blair Witch Project."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie deserves 1/10 of one star, no kidding","review":"This has to be the worst movie in the past 50 years or longer. It is slow to the point and extremely bouring. The only good thing about it was the discription of the movie. I will never trust another movie discription as long as I live thanks to this one it really deservse less than a one ratting. The best they could come up with for aliens was spiders what a let down. As soon as I saw that I was ready to turn it off but since I paid $6 to watch it I decided to get my agonizing moneys worth. I realy couldn't wait for it to end. This movie was such a disapointment that to mention anything good about it is a waist of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good build up and speechless ending","review":"Don't really understand why people are so disappointed? Yes the movie didn't have a huge alien that came out of nowhere jumped in the middle of the camera and said boo here I'am for the people that need to see the alien have 45 mins of screen time. But I will add if you compare it to the blair witch a lot more is shown, and explained. They make it easy to connect with the characters, and you feel something for them when one of them dies. So for that its a good movie. Maybe not as terrifing as some hoped for but it just looks great for the micro budget they shot with."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This movie didn't have enough scary parts in it. It's not like there weren't any scary parts in it, there just needed to be more. The beggining to this movie is VERY boring! Once they go onto space, it gets a little bit more interesting. However, it's still pretty boring. I woudn't reccomend buying this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apollo 18","review":"This is the worst movie I've ever seen. Only the truest form of idiot would believe there was one ounce of truth to this pathetic plot. The plot was miserable, the acting was anything but acting and the entire technical process of the movie was lacking. I would love to read a professional media review of this disaster to see if anything I felt about the film was viewed differently. I am a collector of film and my collection numbers in the thousands of titles and this is the only time that I could find no redeeming value in a film and decided to send it on its way to Goodwill.

The story is horrible it relies on cheap thrills and scary music, and quite honestly horrible acting, most of the movie is spent in the L.E.M. so all you get is a bunch of dialogue. Definitely save your money, barely worth watching all the way through. Great idea for a movie, just low budget and horribly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer","review":"I have seen better movies as a kid, and to see this at 73 just makes me sad.

It has a stupid plot and a terrible ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Movie. Ever.","review":"The only reason I give it one star is because Amazon doesn't allow negative numbers. This was quite literally the worst movie I have ever seen, beating out even The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity."},{"rating":"1","title":"2/3rd of the audience left the theater!","review":"I went to see this movie the weekend it opened. I had high hopes for it as the trailers and TV spots were pretty intense. I love a good consipiracy theory and when it comes to space, I am in for almost any good flick. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The so called \\"previously classified footage\\" was so horribly done and so boring I found myself looking away from the screen out of boredom. The story line was so thin the climax was laughable when you finally get what is going on up there. By the time we got to about minute 50 of the movie two-thirds of the audience had gotten up and left the theater. NASA backed out of any assistance in the making of this trainwreck and they actually need the publicity.I know it is one man's opinion and I do encourage anyone to see it just so they can weigh in on how much they too wish they had kept their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Happens","review":"This whole movie you simply wait for things to get cooking... they never do. And then suddenly it is over and you are bored to tears and sad because everyone is dead. I suggest you save your time and money and watch another movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful sci-fi/horror flick true to the Apollo missions","review":"This was a terrific, overlooked movie. I've seen it six times now (twice in the theater, and four times on DVD, plus all of the bonus footage) and have to say that it is one of my favorite sci-fi/horror movies of all time. Very, very well done, from the acting to the cinematography to the direction and everything else. If you like the concept, ignore the bad reviews and give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely dreadful","review":"The film is terrible - I only watched it to the end because I could not believe anyone could get away with producing something this bad. The idea is a good one - but the movie is so poor I would say only watch if you are compiling a list of the worst movies ever made. Its worse than Event Horizon which is really saying something. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"It takes discipline to sit and watch this video in its entirety. It moved very slowly and the \\"Blair Witch Style\\" video quality was to say the least, annoying.

This has replaced my most worst movie on my list. Using old Apollo films then having the stupid idea of secret Apollo mission which means nothing is not even something a 5th grader would think of. The worst thing is what I payed for it. Another bad thing is making it sound like another good movie like Apollo 13. Apollo 13 was very good and accurate. Dirty trick to make this sound like another good Apollo movie. Made me sick........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"So stupid do not waste your time. Not real footage. Aliens on the moon looked like crabs and spiders. Horrible acting and no score so the movie is extremely dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apollo 18","review":"I did not see this movie at the theater but only on regular DVD. I regret not seeing it on the big screen. I am not sure why the harsh reviews. Ok, it may not be Aliens, but I thought for a popcorn muncher, Apollo 18 goes down fine. I enjoyed the camera work -- as a teen in that era, the footage looked real enough to me. It made the movie more believable and realistic. People complain about the lack of action. These guys are on the moon . . . in a small modular device. There was hardly room to move and was only designed to be in it for about two days. You gonna run from giant CG monsters -- where you gonna go? It either gets you quick, tears up the ship, kills everybody (only 2 people) or you just let the drama unfold. I thought the movie did it. Half-way through, I though it was spooky and developed a mood of dread. I thought the end was only OK, nothing spectacular, but, still, I thought it was enjoyable and brought the movie to a fine conclusion. I will recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing!","review":"I saw the trailers for this movie. I love science fiction so it looked like it would be really good to see.

Bad movies always crop up now and then[ie--Killer Tomatoes] but this one seems to think its a serious contender---there are so many mysterious things about the moon that could have been used[see-'Someone Else is On The Moon']---instead they go the route of 'killer rocks'--I know they were low budget but this is just ridiculous....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time and money","review":"Rarely do I regret spending money on a movie, even if I don't like it.

What an utterly boring, uneventful, corny movie. Blair Witch was brilliant, Cloverfield was well done, but by Paranormal Activity it was proven that the gimmick of recovered footage wasn't enough to carry a movie-it needs a good story. Believe me, this is NOT a good story. I kept waiting for the movie to begin...and then it was over.

You will have a more enjoyable time reading the dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud warning","review":"Some of the reviews for this movie claim it is made from \\"found footage\\". There is virtually no found footage in the movie besides a few rocket blast offs. Just about everything else is new footage made to look old by jumping sprockets, bad focusing, flashing lights and other retro touches. It is really easy to tell all the found footage is fake. Just about all of the movie is supposed to be filmed inside the lunar module on the surface of the moon or actually on the surface of the moon. Unfortunately the producers didn't realize that gravity on the moon is 1/7th that of the gravity on earth. Yet the astronauts sleep in a hammock, sit down in the module, set things down to rest in the module and do a 100 other things that would never occur in a reduced gravity situation. This is a disaster movie but for all the wrong reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being on the Moon must be really boring","review":"When I watched this movie I thought it had great potential. The whole idea is great. The execution is terrible. It's very slow moving. There's no action and it's not scary either. One thing that bugged me is how long it took for the characters to do one simple task. I understand that people move slow in zero gravity. But the plot of this movie isn't subject to gravity. So why the heck did it move so slow too. When they finally encountered the aliens I got excited. But was soon let down. Please don't waste hard earned money or valuable time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best","review":"Good sf movies are few and far between. So are horror movies. Good horror sf movies are even more rare. Sorry but Apollo 18 was not a good sf or horror for me.Spoiler:The basic theme seems sound: There was a mission after 17 which went to the moon and discovered Russian cosmonauts had been there as well as a \\"menace\\" which had killed the Russians and contaminated one of our astronauts. This we know from secret film which was edited to make the movie.Supposedly degraded film and shaking the camera do not make a good horror movie or sf movie. This film is a big bust so don't waste your money or your time. The trailer was better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"How was the \\"found\\" footage found?","review":"Although Apollo 18 is fairly okay as a science-fiction/horror film, anyone with a little common sense will not believe in its authenticity. For one, it contains the classic alien spider that is in some other science fiction movies. For another, they never tell how the so-called found footage made it from the moon back to earth. And telling of all, why would so-called authentic footage contain four different alternate endings? if something happens in real life, one can not say, \\"I don't like the way this went. I think I'll make a different ending.I may have given it more than two stars if they had come up with some sort of original alien. The movie is okay if you like those type. But it's not the kind of film I would go out of my way to watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not that great","review":"I watched Apollo 18 at the theaters about a week after it came out and I wasn't very impressed. I am a die-hard science-fiction fan and the space/alien genre is probably my favorite. The movie has an interesting premise, a secret Apollo mission is sent to the moon to investigate the possibility of a successful Russian mission only to fall prey to some hidden creature. The story, however, ends up being not really that fascinating, and the source of the horror is laughable.Despite it being mediocre, if you are a fan of space horror and don't mind the \\"moving-camera\\" effects, then this movie may be watchable to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..... ZZZzzzZZZzzz","review":"Some cool scenes but just a bunch of weird stuff not connected to one another and way to many issues with the movie.I get the idea and what they were going for, but they failed to make a movie, rather it's just like watching youtube video(s) out of order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Now I know why the price was so cheap.

So what went wrong? Well, I found Apollo 18 to be -- gasp! -- kinda boring; despite some eerily suspenseful images, the movie takes way too long to achieve liftoff. Apollo 18 is the only surviving footage of NASA's final moon mission -- a mission that went so horribly wrong that the U.S. Government has denied its existence ever since. But what did those intrepid explorers find on earth's only satellite? I won't give it away, if you are crazy enough to watch it.

The movie was written as if it were an expose of the DOD hiding an expedition to the moon. The suspension of disbelief is a requirement to make the movie interesting.

If you're a fan of the Blair Witch type 'found/recovered' footage thing, this is for you. I was ok with it up to a point, but then it became irritating. A little of that goes a long ways but they went way past the jumpy blurry wrecked-edit threshold. On the plus side, it was a great recreation and the mood was definitely creepy. I got a sense, no matter how contrived, of what it might be like to be there under those conditions. As many other people have commented, don't bother with a Blu-ray version: it's a waste as virtually all of the footage has been so distressed, you'd only be seeing the distortion and flaws in a higher res.If you're into Lunar conspiracies, I'd instead recommend the fantastic book by Jed Mucurio, 'Ascent.'

An ordinary man is thrust into some extraordinary experiences in this tightly woven suspense/thriller. After a tragic accident takes the life of a powerful mobster's young daughter, the peaceful life of one man and his family becomes a desperate attempt to keep their own world from falling apart. Myler has woven the plot around a set of circumstances that leaves the reader on the edge of their seat wondering how much pressure one man can deal with in his quest to keep himself and his family safe from the consequences of a father's revenge. Psychological suspense at its' most chilling. Highly recommended reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, Tedius, Forgettable Characters","review":"I don't know if I was reading the same book as the other reviewers but this book was one of the worst books I have ever read. Forgetting about the many punctuation errors, the writing is formulatic and tedious. In real life, the main character would probably be whacked and never heard from again.

Unfortunately for Ben the other party involved in this accident is not a honorable man.The story is about Ben's struggle to put his life back together to the state it was in prior to the accident.I could have never predicted the twists and turns that this book went through. I was very pleased that this was not another generic mystery.It is impossible to put the book down during the last 20 pages. I was reading this book on the train.

His rambling style of writing makes it a difficult read, as others here have mentioned, but I think the biggest problem is that he implies a great plan behind every joke, an agenda behind every smirk. Sometimes this is true, and sometimes a gag is just a gag. For instance, he elevates the \\"Sideshow Bob rake bit\\" to a level I would argue it doesn't deserve. Please, pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this book.","review":"If you're like me and spent your mid-twenties watching the golden era of the Simpsons, then you can relate to the stories told.

I will definitely buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Badly edited but worth a look","review":"Underneath the unnecessary self promotion and personal references there is a lot in Planet Simpson for the Simpsons fan who wants a thought provoking look at their heroes place in Western Culture. Not to everyone\`s taste (and definitely best avoided if you have a \\"Bush 04\\" sticker on your SUV) but significantly more than just one guy\`s ranting about his favourite show. A good editor could have trimmed the self indulgence and left a slimmer and better volume for us to enjoy but Turner\`s engaging writing style makes even the endless comparisons (\\"funnier than...\\" \\"Better than...\\") easy to overlook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Tedious","review":"I myself am a very big Simpson's fan. A lot of the episodes I know exactly what happens but I still enjoy them. When I saw this book on the bookshelf I bought it automatically, soley because I was a massive fan not because I heard the book was good or not. I tried to read it and get something out of it but I simply could not.The author talks about why he loves certain episodes. He will go into details about the plotline, frankly it seems because he is so passionate about the episode or simply to fill space. Then he trys to justify how it is a brilliant analysis of modern civiliztaion. Bart is defined as the punk icon of the 90's. This just ridiculous. Ironically it is almost as if this was written by a real life Comic book guy from the simpsons.In short save your money, dont buy this, watch the show and enjoy. Thats what it is there for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomoric and self-indulgent","review":"In which Chris Turner takes over 470 pages to tell us that 'The Simpsons' is often satirical and self-referential! Brilliant analysis, Chris, those of us who watch the series hadn't noticed! 'Simpsons' fans understand all this already - it's why we like the series so much - and Turner is just stating the obvious at unnecessary length. The book is padded out with tiresome, lengthy retelling of Turner's favourite jokes from the series, cliched anti-Bush and anti-American rants (no, I am not American or a 'neocon'), and nostalgic references to the early '90s 'grunge' scene. And why all the Radiohead quotes? Reading this book was like reading a particularly uninspired Media Studies essay. Save your money for the DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did this guy have an editor?","review":"Wow. Another reviewer called the authors' style \\"rambling\\". That is an understatement to say the least. There are sentences in this book that run for over half a page.

Some great points, but, way too long and totally self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this but...","review":"Okay, so I LOVE the simpsons so it's obvious why I bought this book, but alas, I should have consulted the reviews on Amazon first!Whilst Turner makes a lot of interesting points in linking the rise and rise of The Simpsons to whatever is happening in the outside world at the time (Globilsation, Americans travelling abroad, immigration, Kurt Cobain etc etc) alot of time I found myself thinking 'Where is he going with this?'The first part of the book is interesting where he gives us a bit of history to The Simpsons, however the rest of the book is over analytical and self indulgent not to mention WAY TOO LONG.A determined Simpsons' fan will read it anyway, but I found myself skipping over pages, especially in the last three or four chapters when I started to tire of his claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jokes, I get jokes.","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. The tone is breathless; the book is hopelessly disorganized; and large sections are simply drawn-out descriptions of Simpsons episodes, with commentary to be sure that we readers, who are not as sophisticated as the author, really got the jokes. On top of that, the book is sadly freighted with the author's political views, which blind him to one of the most charming aspects of \\"The Simpsons.\\" The show generally lacks political biases; it lampoons every aspect of American life. \\"The Simpsons\\" is an amazingly entertaining show, even after all these years, and it is difficult to write a tedious book about it, but that is exactly with the author has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter drivel","review":"What was I thinking buying this? I'm a massive Simpsons fan - which is precisely why I DIDN'T need this book, and why you don't either. Most fans will know all the jokes, and will appreciate in their own way exactly why they are funny. If you want some geek telling you why it's funny, and which jokes and episodes he thinks are the funniest moments in the entire history of television (nothing that can't be browsed on a million fansites), then go ahead and buy it.

The straps on the blue and black one were very loose, which sometimes made it a pain because of them sliding.

The narrator is obviously reading from a script, pausing before every Spanish word and name, mispronouncing everything that could possibly be mispronounced, and giving completely erroneous translations of even well-known names. They translate Machu Picchu as \\"Manly Mountain\\" and Haynu Picchu as \\"Wind Mountain\\" when it is common knowledge that they mean \\"Old Mountain\\" and \\"Young Mountain\\" respectively. There is no attempt to prepare you for the trip or give you tips or recommend certain places. They are simply tugging you along on their journey, boring you with their amateur photography and lack of insight. You will learn NOTHING from this video so do not waste your money. Even if you can borrow it free from the library, as I did, don't bother. It will still be a waste of time.

This movie had no plot, no storyline... it was like watching people just do things that in the end had no point. The only saving grace in this movie was the hilarious scene where they kept showing this cop taking the same bite out of a donut. The ending was horrible (as in most zombie movies), but this one was especially bad. And what's with the scene where they keep showing the homeless guy?

I found Legends of Kitholan Vol. 1 to be a good background but its not significant enough for me to justify a high rating. There's no comparing this sound track to Midnight Syndicate; Legends of Kitholan is more of a generic feel for dungeon crawling. I would recommend this sound track to a younger audience.

There were many other awesome songs on there, including my other favorite- a very classic country song- called \\"A Man on a Tractor\\",and the first single off the CD (the title track) called \\"If You're Going Through Hell.\\" On Rodney's second CD, you can also find songs about where he grew up (Tennessee to be exact, as he mentions in \\"In the Middle\\" and is evident in \\"What I Love About the South\\" and \\"These Are My People\\"). Although he sings those incredibly well, he has a talent for singing slower-paced songs too, such as \\"Angel's Hands\\" and \\"Invisibly Shaken.\\"Overall it is a wonderful CD from who I would predict to be one of the next big acts in country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I enjoy every song on this CD.

It locks up on dialogue scenes, too!The nice appearance is totally negated by its lack of performace. Forget all the features most DVDs have--the player will lock up and you'll have to power down, wait for about 2 minutes, turn it on again, and cross your fingers that this time you'll be able to finish the movie!The \\"POP\\" it makes through my amp when I turn it on is so loud that we jump every time.What a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"problem dvd player","review":"I had bought this gift for my brother and his family for the holiday's of 2000.

You have got over 60+ wrestlers. Over 20+ matches. The best match is the hell in a cell. You can create a wrestler which is the best thing about it. You can pick over 200 moves. The season mode is where you got real shows Raw and Smackdown. No more house shows. It lasts over 20 years. You just gotta get this game if your a wrestling fan.

The different modes of play are also top class. The best feature in my mind is the extremely in-depth 'build-a-wrestler' section. You really can create precisely whatever you have in mind with an exhausting amount of faces, physiques, tweaks and colour/shade meters. My only gripe is that if you are playing a game against more than one opponant, the controls have a tendancy to make your character focus on just one enemy, which is very very frustrating when you've levelled somebody and you're about to pummel the next guy, but your wrestler won't turn around. They seem to just stand there staring at the body on the floor when the other guy is kicking the chocolate outta you. Anyway, fine game. Fantastic fun when you've got a group of drunken mates around."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAYING THE SMACKDOWN!","review":"This game has all kinds of matchs including ladder match and many more.

The publisher, Timeless Video, Inc., further mutilated the film by tacking on a ridiculously inappropriate sound track, starting with tunes from the musical 'Gigi'! (This I could fix: I turned the sound all the way down.) Photos on the tape's dust jacket are NOT from this film, and the dust jacket looked nothing like the one Amazon shows for this item. Because of the film's butchered condition, the plot made almost no sense--successive scenes often seem unrelated.

Actually, this is even better than most of her other albums. It is like a collection of short stories - some that are probably autobiographical, some that seem fanciful - set to wonderful, very memorable melodies. The vocals are stunning, and range from the soft and sweet Be With Me, to the howling mock-country of Cowtown, and the emotional rollercoaster that is In Times When My Head. Her cover version of the Doobie Brothers' It Keeps You Runnin' is also something to behold. Apart from the superior selection of (mostly original) songs and the great vocals, one distinctive feature of this album is that the production is sparse and focused squarely on Carly. If you like The Bedroom Tapes, and are looking for more, this is probably your best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites of Carly's","review":"Powerfully evocative \\"It Keeps You Running-\\", A hopeful Love Song that builds in it's intensity on \\"Libby\\".Jealous love vs. Healthy Love in the song \\"In Times When My Head\\".

He goes back and forth with references within the book, takes forever to describe a simple concept, and describes the mathematical side of physics poorly. On top of that, the layout is very poor. The examples in the book are in small print (8 point, maybe max 9 point font?) and the explanation for them are usually one huge blob of words. The text is just not clear for those who are more on the math side of things. To be fair, if you don't like reading science textbooks and would rather read something that is laid out to the most obvious detail, this book might serve its purpose. If you have a choice, Giancoli's Physics is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 lb paperweight","review":"The title of this book is \\"Physics for Scientists and Engineers\\", not \\"Physics for Science and Engineering STUDENTS\\".

I HAD a 3.9 until this course. I found a much smaller physics book written in 1941 (back when teachers actually knew how to teach) that explains in 700 pages what it takes this book to explain in 1400.This book adopts the philosophy that pretty pictures and un-related stories can be substituted for actual information.

It would be an OK book if you are a physics major and have lots of time to study, but is not really suitable for a 100 level class. The explanations he gives are unrelated to the problems, which are way more complex than what he covers in the chapter.The MasteringPhysics website which my teacher opted to use is also extremely tedious. Besides being $30, it is just a code, no supplemental CD or anything. Instead of being able to sit down at a desk and do homework, you must sit at your computer and key in answers. Forget about hard work paying off, if you try a problem too many times you get a ZERO for that problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT impressed","review":"This book is ridiculous. The examples and explanations in the text do NOT even come CLOSE to preparing you for the homework problems in the back of the book. If those are what your instructor bases his exams off of, you're hosed. Personally, I don't understand how this book makes it into universities.I'm holding a 3.8 accumulative and I'm FAR beyond the calculus series in the math portion of my bachelors, into 300 level math. IMHO, in a 100 level class, one should be able to sit down, read the chapter, study it for a couple hours after reading it and have a pretty good grasp of everything in the chapter. With this book, that just isn't possible. You're going to have to hope you have a good teacher, and utilize that teacher and other resources to grasp what is going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Mastering physics is only a so so physics book.

Considering Newton invented calculus to make physics problems easier and it is a calculus based physics course makes me wonder...The online homework is a pain in the behind and it only lets you print the problems AFTER you do them. It is a scam by Pearson to get more student money.Order it from Amazon UK and it is cheaper than Amazon USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Preferable to other physics texts","review":"I purchased this book after becoming extremely disappointed with Giancoli's treatment of electromagnetism. In kind words, Giancoli is less than clear. However, Knight's treatment of the subject is remarkably clear, with an emphasis on understanding the physical concepts that describe natural phenomena. He then progresses onto describing the mathematical models that help quantify the physical concepts. Giancoli, in contrast, focuses almost entirely on the mathematical models with little discussion on why they are important. The end result is exposure to a jumble of equations without fully grasping how to apply them. Knight's book does not suffer from this ailment and offers a deeper understanding of both the qualitative and quantitative models of natural phenomena.

I'm not sure how you could want to be a mechanical engineer but not do well with this book. I thought they made it very easy to understand and perhaps spent too much time re-explaining what was covered in a earlier chapters but you can easily skip those parts. A slightly more challenging book was the one by Halliday/Resnick/Walker because it relied more on calculus (at least my professor did) but it too was fairly obvious.

Yeah it says to wet your fingers and try again, lower your wrist below your heart, wait 3 minutes and try again...bla bla bla. When you're at your peak you want to know where your heart rate is. Not 3 minutes later after you are cooling down. I know that I burn at least 1,300-1,500 calories during my back to back spin/strength training class and my watch states that I burn less than 1 calorie per minute?? REALLY?? Come on!!

It's really annoying to have to press and hold down the sensors with two fingers to get a read and it barely reads when you're moving. By the time it reads, you've already stopped your work out. Also, there's no way for it to do a calorie count because it's not monitoring your heart rate during your work out. It must \\"guess\\" based on the 1 or 2 readings you're able to get at some point during your work out...far from accurate.Trust me, go for the strap. I'm sure you get used to it after a day or two.

In one 45 minute session on an elliptical it thought I burned 700+ calories, while the machine and another heart rate monitor both read as me burning about 250. I got this for Christmas otherwise I would have been shopping for a HRM with a chest strap like the Polar F6, which I will probably buy soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music but appallingly bad sound","review":"It's difficult to believe that a session recorded in 1947 could have sound this bad.

There are a lot of great Bunk Johnson recordings and no reason to buy this one unless you are a compulsive completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Learning Experience.","review":"From the very start Mr. Meinig teaches the reader, even learned ones, a new way of seeing how America was settled. His perspctive includes all members of the societies which he covers. While the book is very factual, it is written in such a way that it opens ones imagination. By using a geographical viewpoint, you are able to 'see' the topics he covers. My only criticism is that he does not reference his quotes in a traditional manner, though a quick perusal of the bibliography shows they are valid. Once you realize that he includes an extensive list of sources, this concern disappears. I recommend this to anyone who wants to discover more about the discovery of our land."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you love U.S., history and geography you'll this book","review":"This book offers a new perspective on a key phase of U.S. history, and in a very readable way. Strongly raccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate","review":"I came to this recording with high expectations because of Godowsky's reputation as \\"a Buddha among pianists.\\" The recordings were a terrible let-down for two reasons.First is that the sound quality is extremely poor, making the music difficult to listen to (and this from an avid collector of historical recordings!). The hiss/buzz is extremely loud and the tone flat and colorless.The second is that the playing just doesn't live up to Godowsky's reputation. He always did terribly in a recording studio, and never seemed to do justice to what he was capable of in live or private performance. Godowsky himself was aware of this shortcoming; he apparently wrote in a letter shortly before his death, \\"Do not judge me by my recordings!\\"I wouldn't recommend buying this recording unless you have a particular interest in Godowsky or are trying to compile the whole Philip's set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fall from Grace is Great","review":"Ok I've heard alot of people say that they didn't enjoy the VHS. But hey I did I thought I was great. I know I've said it once already. The eps. on it were great, and it had moments where you just wanted to hold on to your seat and not let go.

Pantera's first three albums are musical masterpieces with one of the best guitarists of the '90s, \\"Dimebag\\" Darrell. Anyone looking for an highly affordable way to buy three of the best albums of the '90s should buy this box set. I personally like it because Pantera is a great band and the music is excellent. The Great Southern Trendkill and Reinventing the Steel are also great albums by this extraordinary band. Pantera's musical talent is tremendous, and this box set is a great example of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIEVEABLE PRICE FOR AN IMPORT TITLE!!","review":"I just purchased this 3 cd boxed set from a local record store.

The disc art work is all the same except for \\"Cowboys From Hell\\", which is different from the american one. The catalog numbers are different from the american versions and each disc is labeled with a logo that says, \\"manufactured and distributed by Warner Music Australia\\" which identifies it as an Import, which is cool. Overall, for Under $25 bucks, you cant get a better deal on these three albums. At $15 each, it would cost you $45 for these three albums if bought separately. Bottom line.

Beats me! Maybe I should find comfort in the fact that music this great is not embraced by the masses. Patti's lyrics are intriguing and filled with straight up almost confession like truth and revealing emotion. The music is soulful and passionately compliments the expressions. Ms. Witten's voice is a delightful mix of the qualities of Joni Mitchel, Judy Collins, and Sandy Denny but distinctively her own. This CD is like a long intimate conversation with a trusted friend or not quite yet trusted romantic conquest. Her 2006 release \\"Tell the Wind\\" is just as good. Tryst? I'd be hard pressed not to carve my initials in the Sycamore."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD doesn't include the business plan","review":"The business plan in the book is a pretty good template to get you started, but it's an insult that the CD that comes with it doesn't have the business plan on it.

The Kirin label is supposed to be a picture of a lion. But there were no lions in Japan and the picture shows an animal with hooves and legs like a horse. It's clearly a picture of a lion drawn by someone who had never seen a lion.I've been listening to ragtime, early jazz and swing since the 50's, and the chord selection in these two fake books seem to be done by someone who has actually never heard the songs played the way they were orginally played. Neither my professional piano teacher nor I were able to get many of the songs in the two books to sound like anything without drastic changes in the harmony. I recommend the Warner Bros. books which have many of the same songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ragtime & Early Jazz","review":"Warning to traditional jazz musicians. Though the tunes included in this collection fill the bill, the chords given are modern interpretations, totlally unsuitable for traditional jazz performers - EVERY (yes every) major chord has been substituted with a major seventh chord (as in \\"Color My World\\"). The editor considers this a convention.I would suggest Hal-Leonard clarify this \\"convention\\" on the cover ASAP.There are already enough distractions on a bandstand without adding this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bruford & The Beat","review":"Good sound,lousy video quality duplication crappy at most.Center video line shown pretty much through out,at least on this 1 anyway and it's to bad too,because i really like the artist and his playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"To play, feel and think!","review":"Edwin Fisher was one of the maximum exponents of a bygone pianism when the imagination, splendor and sense of phrasing were linked with the inner expression. Subjectivity in the performance was in this sense a sort of signature, that carved in relief a statement, you might agree or not.Indeed, he was a devoted interpret of the piano, but still more he played with that profound conviction that was expressed along his entire records. This selection is indispensable for all Fisher' s aficionados and even for all those who have not had the opportunity to know and enjoy with the majestic of his playing.Bach never sounded better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anti-typical H. G. Wells","review":"This is not a typical (as in, \\"popular\\") H. G. Wells book. All Wells' books are written from an ideological standpoint, but \\"War of the Worlds\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\" are clouded by fantastic imagination. This book contains no fantasy, and therefore the ideology is clearer than in his others. He is attempting an expose of sorts on the English social system of the time. He draws the problems rather vividly, and at least makes an attempt at a solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't download","review":"I can't review this book because only one percent of it downloaded to my device. In fact, the same thing happened with three other downloads that same day, but I can't make another attempt becausd Amazon says that, according to their records, I've already downloaded it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet, funny, dry-humoured tale","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect in the first page or two, but persevered, and was rewarded with a main character richly drawn, supremely human, and quite funny. The tale of Mr. Polly, wherein things \\"just happen\\" to him, has resonance today and is a good tale in the H.G. Wells tradition. I found myself wondering how he was getting on, even after I finished the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic and comic and good","review":"The History of Mr. Polly is less known than Well's sci-fi classics and it is a different kind of a book too. It pictures a tragicomic story of an unusual character - Mr. Polly. The story is quite funny, but there underneath is a deeper meaning. There are people like Mr. Polly around us. They drift through their lives wondering if it is them or the environment that determined their fate.Although Wells and Dostoyevsky are extremely diferent, Mr. Polly in a certain way reminds me of some Dostoyevsky's characters.Very interesting book. Very well read by Clive Swift.If you like this book, I can recommend you to read both Invisible Man by Wells and Crime and Punishment by Dostoyevsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging game for family and friends","review":"I like Triple Four. It's easy to play. As soon as you open the package you know what it is about. Each player has a hand of seven cards and tries to match \\"Triplet\\" cards (i.e. cards with combinations of three cards). Some triplet cards are easy to match , some not so easy, and some difficult. If you can match four triplets first, you win. It seems one of the previous reviewers of this game overlooked a very important part of the instructions. Even if a player does draw three \\"difficult\\" triplet cards, the game has four wild jokers in addition to the fact that the instructions allow \\"taking your opponents cards.\\" This rule allows the player that has difficult triplets to still be competitive by stealing other players triplets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant look at post-punk, but buy the UK version","review":"Heard about this book in a review in Wire magazine, and my girlfriend kindly ordered the book from amazon.co.uk for me for Christmas. When the book came to the States it had lost about 200 pages and any sections on music that wasn't \\"as popular\\" on this side of the ocean. In the day of global information and the lowering of borders, this is just absurd. Buy the full book (a 5 star proposition), it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the newbie - frustrating for the fans...","review":"It's hard to find fault with one of the few documents of post-punk's history. The book is essential reading if you want to learn about the music and how critics have tried to write it off for more than 20 years. The problem with the book is in the details - how do you write about post-punk and gloss over a band like The Sound (one mention)? Quite possibly one of the most loved bands from that era. Also, no Comsat Angels or Chameleons, let alone any mention of cult acts Lowlife (Cocteau Twins) or Sad Lovers and Giants. Some of these bands might seem like mere blips on the radar, but their importance to the current scene grows every year. Otherwise, I still found tons of information that was new to me and more reasons than ever to believe that after the original British invasion, this was the 2nd greatest time for music ever!P.S. Buy the UK version of the book - better cover, more pages, pictures - better in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome; Must-Read","review":"I had read Reynolds' impressive \\"Generation Ecstasy\\" and been awed at the job he did there encapsulating and providing rationale for an entire musical movement. When I heard that he was going to write this book and speak to the incredibly fertile \\"post punk\\" years, I was very excited. As should we all be.And, it's a great book full of insight. Reynolds' level of ambition and capability eclipse any other writer who has taken on rock music or any subgenre within it.

The negative is that the nozzle on some of the bottles that I have received let out huge droplets versus a fine mist. Which results in me using my hands to rub the product into my pets skin.

It's great that it's so popular and that people are reading about the things of God. But because everybody demands that the authors write the next book right away, they don't have the time to put together a quality novel. Even John Grisham only writes one book a year. Trying to do two a year, plus the kids books, is dumbing down the writing. The dialogue is mostly inane banter, and there's only a few scenes with compelling action or writing (the locust plague, or the witnesses killing people). So much of the rest feels like filler. Tell the authors to ignore the crowds and take their time. I'd rather have one quality book a year than two books that are lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Read","review":"I really enjoyed the entire Left Behind series.

Left Behind is not only a completely enthralling novel, but I have learned so much about Revelation and what is going to take place at the end of the world. I strongly encourage Christians to read this book, but also non-Christians as well. The Coming of Jesus is at hand and we must all be prepared."},{"rating":"1","title":"More soap opera, little substance","review":"The \\"Left Behind\\" series is a perfect example on how to take an interesting concept and turn it into a bad series. \\"Apollyon\\" is the fifth book in the series and like the previous books, it is only a couple of chapters worth of material stretched into novel length. The first 200 pages should have been no more than 50 pages. Not until after the 200 page mark do the locusts appear and things start to get interesting, but this only lasts for one chapter. After that, it's back to the usual slow soap opera.I'm not going to say anything about the theology or morality behind the book; I'm trying to read these books as entertainment, but in that area, it fails. It is slow, full of lengthy monogolues and badly written dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk!","review":"A cliche-ridden piece of evangelical hog-wash. The only people who could love this series are a truly frightening cult of christen's who thankfully do not represent the whole. Even if I could buy into the authors' theology, I would rather join the bad guys--locusts and all--than spend time with the stupefyingly dull, self-righteous protagonists. The writing is soooo bad, all I wanted to do is get to through last page so I could throw the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"how about a zero star rating, guys?","review":"This LaHaye guy is basically the modern-day equivalent of the old tent-revival preachers, except that he is pocketing millions instead of pocket change. His books do achieve one worthy thing, though: they actually make organized religion seem dumber than it already is. This one panders shamelessly to the pre-millenial panic crowd, and I'm sure a lot of them will stock up on copies of LaHaye's books along with the Spam and portable generators. Verdict: just another end-time huckster trying to make a few million bucks before the big nothing at the end of the century. A side note: since when did fundamentalists become so interested in computers, anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fiction?","review":"This book continues the saga and by now the characters have become very soap opera-ish. If you've read the previous books in the series, part of the draw is to find out what has happened to those left behind. You won't be dissappointed either as their are more twists and turns to this preachy soap. The intrigue is there but something is lacking or maybe it is that the formula has been streched too thin and this information could have been condensed into less than five books. The suspense will still keep your attention but it won't keep you riveted like before. The messaage permeates the book and you cannot escape the inevitable question concerning your own personal salvation. An easy read that entertains the mind and soul, for believers mostly but fun reading for those who still walk the tightrope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contiued excellence","review":"Despite some negative comments here, I still believe these books are wonderful writing.

The 1st (Left Behind) was excellent and I couldn't wait to read the next 2 (Tribulation Force and Nicolae). They seemed to slow down a bit, but still kept me interested. Soul Harvest and now Apollyon have been entirely too slow and the characters don't really interest me anymore. The dialogue seems forced and stiff. La Haye and Jenkins need to slow down themselves and take the time necessary to generate a good product - a book that is not slow-moving, but has more action and substance. This subject matter is too important! This series still has great potential and I'll probably continue to read the books. I'll just be sure to check them out from the library next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Apollyon,\\" fifth selection in the LEFT BEHIND series continues with the end time Judgments prophesied in the book of Revelations.

Apollyon is probably the most suspenseful of all the books thus far, and I can't wait until the next one comes out! They really cause you to evaluate your own relationship with Christ and make you want to go out and let the whole world know that \\"JESUS IS LORD\\" and that He loves them. It really grieves me to see so many Christians criticizing what these two brothers have done in preparing this series.

I'll bet there are Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries that are more well written than these books and Apollyon is the bottom of the barrel.It's really an embarrasment.It's been my experience as a Christian that we always seem to close ranks behind christian anything and nobody ever tells the truth about how they feel about things lest we be judged by other christians for having a heretical perspective.Sorry,I refuse to play.The emperor has no clothes.THESE BOOKS STINK!

Thank you Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked this one . . .","review":"While I found much to like in this series (and I've read them all so far), anyone who thinks this book is provocative should test their nerve on the most awesome \\"end-time\\" book of them all--Glenn Kleier's \\"The Last Day.\\" You can't read it without coming away with a most profound feeling that you've just been in the presence of a true divinity and a divine revelation. An extraordinarly impressive story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not thier best.","review":"I feel that the authors are too influenced by marketing now. In the beginning the book gave me the feeling that they were honestly trying to tell a story. It was an honest hard worked effort. Now it seems that the motive to me is making sure that thier bank account is full. In other words the books need more time to develop and they are taking much too long to tell the story. I do like the fact that the books may be druming up interest in Christ and that some may actually get the message, after all Paul said as long as they preach Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book i've ever read","review":"what can i say, apollyon is definitely the best book of this tremendous left behind series. i'm not a big reader, but this book was recommended to me by a friend. i bought it, and ever since the second i picked it up.. i could not put it down till the last words of the book were read. definitely a must read for christians and non-christians alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-Changing Book for Beleivers & Unbeleiver Alike","review":"Can someone please give me the correct sequence for reading these books. I have read the original \\"Left behind\\" and also \\"Tribulation Force\\", I think the next one is Apollyon: The destroyer Is Unleashed. I also have Soul Harvest, and I see there is also Nicolae: The Rise Of The Anti-christ, I'm sure this is the last one so-far of the series. Please someone help me in the order of these life-changing novels. Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"This is a very good, very accurate book (in terms of the Bible vs this book). While I don't criticize the book for anything it has in it, I'm criticizing it because I thought the other ones were better. The one that had me hanging by the seat of my pants was Nicolae. But still, this is an excellent book that I recommend that you read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Series! Each one brings me closer to God.","review":"This was the most exciting one yet! Maybe I differ from some of the other readers. Maybe it's because I have the money to purchase the books. But I want the series to go on and on. One reader suggested that none of the charactors ever suffer. What about the Captain's loss of his wife. What about the loss of Bruce in the first book. What about the fact that they all share a tiny little apt. And this book has even more losses! The story has to maintain its core charactors. Lets face it, the books are pretty close on how scary it will be, but we all still want our charactors to last, otherwise, how would we continue to relate. I say, excellent job to the authors. And I bet if anyone checked into it, they would find that people are being saved through these series of books. I would say that's a good use of our money for the cause of Christ!! And as a believer, this series only serves to bring me closer to Christ and want to serve him more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing Lives","review":"I am completely thrilled at the way these books are changing lives around me. A friend recommended them shortly after the series started and I was instantly hooked. Since then I have marvelled at the number of \\"not-religious\\" people who get chills reading the books and can't put them down. They are easy enough for anyone to understand the simple truth in them. My friends and family have become engrossed in the stories of these peoples' lives. In my opinion, nothing short of the apocalypse could have had such an impact on the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the others","review":"Although I appreciate the focus on characters and their day to day life situations during the tribulation, I am disappointed that more time is not spent in the world's reaction to biblical calalmities and how it affects them. The whole section with the locusts could have, and should have in my opinion, been expounded. I sense the build up in the book, see it come to fruition, but the climax is wanting. It seems more like a bee sting, shocking and painful at first, but leaving no permanent difficulties and soon forgotten. The situations with Chaim and Hattie and getting a bit long for my tastes. They remind me of a Felix Unger or Steve Urkel, interesting at first and amusing, but ultimately leading to more of an annoying feeling the longer they go on. I'd prefer to see some kind of meaningful change in their respective situations, either one way or the other, instead of the status quo."},{"rating":"1","title":"apollyon","review":"this book was too long and had barely anything good in it, the book mostly consists of speeches by nicolae and it was boring. the only good psrt of the book lasted only 25 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who will be exempt from the torture of the destroyer?","review":"This book picks up where book 4 left off, with preparation for the meeting of the witnesses in Jerusalem. Nicolae tries to prevent the meeting then tries to take it over when stopping it isn't possible. God's judgments grow fiercer when after the meeting, the first of the Angel Trumpet Woes hits, with all non-believers being attacked by hideous creatures led by the demon Apollyon. Hattie is more an more torn over the pending birth of hers and Nicolae's babies.There is more action in this installment, with all the action surrounding the Meeting. the description of the meeting is vivid and very realistic for an event of such magnitude. The demon locusts unleashed are suitably hideous and the suffering of victims is intense in its occurrence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - Eagerly awaited - too soon finished","review":"Congratulations to the authors. They have tremendous imagination and insight. This series will make the biblical Revelation explode in your mind. A group of us here at Ohio State University are glued to the books for their biblical interpretation and character development. We are eagerly awaiting the next book. I'm glad to see that you have 12 books in mind. Seven was not enough. Keep writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book, along with the series, really got my attention.","review":"I found the content of this book most intriguing.

Looking forward to Assasins."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LEFT BEHIND SERIES IS THE BEST SERIES THAT I HAVE READ","review":"This series of books is a vary good example of what the last days on earth might be like. The previous books were vary good but I think that this book dosent live up to its name. They only say the name of the demon 2 times. The books are vary well writtin and I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book! Can't wait for the next in the series.","review":"I can't seem to get enough of this series. This book is one of the best in the series. I am looking forward to the next one. I don't want to wait until August 1999. Everyone will enjoy this book. It really makes you think about the future. The authors have a captive audience that really believes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't this gone on long enough....","review":"I've been a big fan of this series, but I am reaching the saturation point. This story just NEVER seems to take any significant steps. Those of us who continue to buy these books are shelling out a lot of money for a story that could have been easily told in one or two editions. I suggest that the erstwhile authors may be guilty of a deadly sin: GREED. After all, the more volumes there are, the more royalties come their way. I say BRING THIS STORY TO AN END."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! This series forces you to pay attention!","review":"A minister friend recommended Left Behind to me and once I started it I could not put it down. Since following up with Tribulation Force and Nicolae, I cannot wait to read Soul Harvest and Apollyon which I have just ordered. God Bless the writers. They are truly inspired to present such \\"fictional\\" work that is so prophetic. Sharing the books with close friends and relatives and recommending them to all has become a personal agenda for me. What a wonderful way to bring Christ to others who may not have had an inkling or desire to approach anything that appeared to be \\"religeous reading. As a practicing catholic I have found myself returning back to my Bible -especially Revelations. Thank you for helping me to renew my Faith. Keep writing, writing, writing......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop Awe and Excitement!","review":"This the kind of book that once you start reading it, you can't put it down!

There is not a dull part in it!This book is well worthy to be in the \\"Left Behind\\" series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apollyon is a great continuation of the Left Behind series.","review":"The Left Behind series is intriguing and a page turner. Apollyon continues the saga and leaves the reader hanging, once again, in anticiaption for the next novel. I recommend the series from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apollyon was exciting with many different twists.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It made me refer to Revelations many times. When I was done I read again to see what will happen next. I share my books with believers at work. They too, feel it is Biblically based. I will pray for those that rated them with one star. Satan is at work there. Especially the person who compared these books with the works of Stephen King. These books are not to be put above the Bible but they are not garbage. Hats off to Lahaye and Jenkins. I pray for you both to convey God's message through your story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apollyon","review":"I would give 5 stars to the Left Behind books before this one (which I think is #5) and though this one was good, it really dragged toward the end so I skipped through it. I am reading the Assassins now, and it is exciting and addicting as the first four."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, stupid book","review":"i wish i could have given it less than one star, but they don't allow that.poorly written, limited point of view, not even really written by tim lahaye. jenkins does all the work.i should have been reading harry potter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much better endtime thrillers out there","review":"When you have a topic as rich with possibilities as this, readers should expect: #1 terrific writing, #2 strong characters, #3 chills, thrills and hair curling suspense. Unfortunately, the LEFT BEHIND series disappoints on all levels. This is very lightweight stuff, people, in my opinion. The very finest of all endtimes novels, without question, is the quintessential Judgment Day suspense thriller, THE LAST DAY (Glenn Kleier, 1998, Warner books). If you want to read a gripping, intelligent and thought stimulating drama that will alternately fascinate you, amuse you, scare the living bejeebies out of you, and keep your mind boggled till the wee hours, there is none better. LAST DAY is the ultimate Last Day experience, and if you haven't read it yet, you're in for a soul-quaking treat. Not a one of these LEFT BEHIND novels comes anywhere close"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offending Propaganda","review":"The author uses this book to, aside from make money, express all of his far right ideas. He shoves the message of \\"Christianity is best\\" every few pages, and also shows his anti-abortion status. As a \\"non-believer\\" (who LaHaye and Jenkins were kind enough to tell me would be tortured by demon locusts by their loving God of kindness and mercy, just because I didn't believe in their religion. Question: What religion was Jesus, Moses and Abraham?) I found this book offensive propaganda. Furthormore, it is very badly written. You get the impression someone just read Revelation, strung a few stereotypical characters, and tried to fill the pages that weren't filled with \\"Christ is Great\\" propaganda with monologue scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive trash.","review":"What is this book about? If you're a pregnant non-Christian, your baby will die. If you're a pregnant Christian, your baby will be just fine. That's what it all boils down to. Just like Soul Harvest said that the only role for women was to get pregnant or die, now Apollyon says that good girls have babies while bad girls lose them. Such drivel is hardly a charitable presentation of the Christian gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous book","review":"Anything that influences people to accept Christianity because of fear that they have for some fictional event is dangerous. Books should free the mind and spirit, not chain it to a faith that rarely serves as more than a heavy anchor. This book is garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive. The tool of the devil.","review":"Has it occurred to anybody that perhaps these books are the tool of the Antichrist? Wouldn't that be the ultimate deception? If evil comes disguised as good, then it is entirely possible that these books, rather than warning Christians about the end, are being used by Satan to deceive and mislead Christians. Perhaps Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins are actually the mouthpieces of the enemy, wolves in sheep's clothing. Do not be deceived. Trust in the Lord, not in Left Behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should you be left behined?","review":"I read this book and I found that I could not put itdown. Which I didn't. It keept me interested the whole time. It wokeme up from my dull life and showed me that I need to tell my friends about Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far absolutely the best one yet","review":"I get nervous every single time there's a confrontation with the two witnesses. I got nervous the first time I read of their story in Revelation, and Jenkins' storytelling has given me the same feeling while reading these books which has really make these books that much more enjoyable and fun to read.This book topped all expectations. I read all it in 8 hours. I only wish I had Assasins right now because I could probably finish it tonight too."},{"rating":"1","title":"one-dimensional characters and dispensationalist propaganda","review":"I've read every book in this series (borrowed from a friend) and am incresingly frustrated at the authors' inability to create characters that are anything other than victims of the plot in which they are trapped. All their actions read like something from a comic book. What is also distressing is that the authors appear to be using this story as a thinly veiled attempt to prove their personal theological ideas. The Christians in the book are weak, powerless, petty, and usually self-serving. They scoff at the suffering that surrounds them, and the Holy Spirit does seems to be replaced by the human spirit in all of their 'triumphs'. This book is distressing in its pridefulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible theology; scare-tactic evangelism","review":"These two authors have decided that the only way to push forth their biblically inaccurate pre-millenial, futurist viewpoint of Revelation is to make trashy \\"novels\\" which scare or turn-off seeking people and make like-minded Christians feel self-righteous. The cause of Christ has been stained thanks to these \\"books\\". And evangelism has been substituted for marketing and profit. Way to go Jenkins and LaHaye . . . at least they will have to answer for this when Christ comes again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put it Down!","review":"The contiunation of the series, Appolyon is a sure-fire hit!

It's awsome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"More of the same terrible writing. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm almost embarrased when I read some of these reviews talking about how well written this garbage is. It's horrible.

I have seen over and over again how it has changed peoples lives. I received the first book as a Christmas gift and after I finished it I ran to the book store to get the next. My husband never liked to read much and only read one book in his life prier to Left Behind. He has read all six books and has recommended them to at least a dozen people who have read them and recommended them to others. Each character is so diverse and unique to the situation. The story lines are entertaining and action packed, all the while, sending the reader a deeply religious message. I find myself referring to my Bible often and understanding what I read for the first time in my life. I'm anxiously awaiting book number seven, The Indwelling, which I have pre-ordered from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action packed read!","review":"Biblical fiction based on the Rapture, great action, non stop drama and good guys win! I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I agree with at least one reviewer (\\"a reader from USA\\"). Left Behind was great. Tribulation Force was mediocre. Nicolae and Soul Harvest were very good and exciting. Appolyon was pretty bad. The only interesting part of the book was the end and the interaction with the 2 witnesses. If I had to read one more page about how much Buck missed Chloe I was going to give up on the whole thing. Hattie is tiresome. In fact, Nicolae and the witnesses are the only interesting characters. I found myself being totally turned off by these totally predictable boring characters. The biblical prophecy and the excitement of the truth of the coming appearance of the Lord Jesus is what makes these books. Stick to that and maybe the next book will be readable. The margins are wide, the print is large and the filler is immense. The book could have been done in 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZON.COM WAKEUP!

AMAZON.COM needs to be a little more QA/QC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just plain awful.","review":"Good God, we ought to be ashamed that this kind of trash is passed off as \\"Christian writing.\\" This series is so uniformly bad that I could not in good conscience recommend it to anyone older than 10 or 11 years.My brothers and sisters, I beg of you, read real literature, not this crud. God will work through that too. It may be harder, but in the end it will be more rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable fiction, with an outdated '70s prophecy angle","review":"The \\"Left Behind\\" series has been somewhat entertaining so far. It's passable fiction, worth reading. But the theology the authors use in writing leaves a great deal to be desired. Most Christians who HAVEN'T studied the Bible in great detail lap this kind of stuff up, without realizing that the \\"Rapture\\" has been predicted (without any success so far) since the 1930s. Hal Lindsey may have made it a little more famous since the '70s, but it's still an outdated concept that you really won't find in the Bible...unless you look VERY hard, and mismatch a few texts to fit your outlook. \\"Left Behind\\" is little more than the \\"Thief in the Night\\" movies turned into books, with 21st century technology tucked in to make them contemporary. If you're expected all of this to happen someday, I'd suggest you starting truly studying the Bible, and plug back into reality...the rest of the church is waiting for you to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disagree","review":"My disagreement of this book is brief: the word \\"rapture\\" appears nowhere in the New Testament, which is embarrassing to many who hold the position that the rapture will be real. Additionally, \\"Anti Christ\\" appears in 1 John 2:18-22; 4:3 and 2 John 7, describing apostaste Christians who were teaching false doctrine regarding the nature of God and Christ. These are the only references to \\"Anti Christ\\" found in the Bible. Something to think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting...As good, if not better, than the previous four!","review":"Great work Jerry and Tim...I love to see the Lord work through your hands. This series has opened my eyes to the book of Revelations and is a great witnessing tool. I'm estatic about the upcoming movie...I've been praying for years for God to bring about exciting Christian reading and movies.I was intrigued with the result of Hattie's pregnancy and I loved what happened with the confrontation between the 2 witnesses and Carpathia.My heart hurts for the individual who gave your books only 1 star. Your books are truly anointed. You are both mightily blessed and God is doing a great work through you.Keep the faith and may God's guidance, wisdom, and anointing be on you both. In Jesus' name...A prayer warrior."},{"rating":"2","title":"This reminded me of the importance of prayer.","review":"I really enjoyed this series, and have many chances to discuss it with others, because I know many people who are reading it.

Anyway, I hope they push for a little better quality, and move on a little faster, or this may end up being 18 books in the series. People will lose interest on a series that long.Also, get rid of Ernie, and Bo please."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gospel message is presented throughout this book.","review":"I loved this book and feel like it runs a close second to the first volume, Left Behind. I have studied the book of Revelation several times and as I was reading Apollyon, it just seemed to bring the book of Revelation to life. I am Media Library Director in my church and this series is very popular--one or more of them stays out all the time and there is a waiting list for Apollyon. I highly recommend sharing this series with people who need the Lord because Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins do an excellent job of presenting the Gospel message repeatedly in this series. I have enjoyed Apollyon and couldn't put it down. Keep up the good work guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"loony tunes","review":"this is no more inspired by the word/spirit of god than the \\"book of mormon\\" is. jesus is love and i sure don't see love in these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, good intentions don't excuse poor talent","review":"I have no doubt whatsoever that the authors have the best intentions with this novel. Unfortunately, those intentions do not make a good read. This is a very poorly written novel. The message is wondeful, but I found myself turned off by the lack of talent. There are many ways to spread the Lord's message, and I quite simply don't feel that Jenkins and LaHaye are suited to doing so in a fictional novel. I understand that these novels are very popular, but I think that the message has been better served fictionaly by more competant novels such as We All Fall Down by Caldwell. The Bible tells us to make sure that our actions never appear to be anything other than holy, so that those who are looking for the truth will not be put off by our outward actions. The same holds true for novels. The messege is often judged upon the messenger, and badly constructed novels do not do the message of God any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Series of books drag on forever","review":"This series of books started out interesting but then it just dragged on forever as though they just wanted to make money by getting you to buy the next book. The whole series could have been done in 1 or 2 books. Only one significant thing happens in each book which should be a chapter in a book not the entire book. It also starts to go in to the ridiculous and never ends. I quit and don't care about what happens. Enough is enough all ready. The series is way out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boys & Girls, This is Ludicrous","review":"The first book was not well written. By this time, I would expect some improvement, but no-o-o! Not these folks!Not only is the writing just as wooden, just as scarily unconnected, now there are active contradictions. Not minor stuff, either. Steele's wife's name. Behavior. Actions.Look, characterization isn't that hard. Neither is writing emotions that convince the reader. These people don't experience faith, or fear, or any other feeling. We're told about it.Spare me! Stop writing this stuff! Or write better, one or the other. I know you can sell millions of these awful, thinly-plotted, badly characterized screeds because believers have far too little to read that entertains, enlightens and instructs. But please, work harder! And you readers! Just because it's about Christians facing the apocolypse doesn't mean it's any good. Figure that out and stop giving this stuff five stars!Ok, I've vented. But don't read this! It's gone beyond bad to squirmingly embarassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What if morons were the only people left?","review":"I'm sorry, but these books are just terrible. It's hard to determine exactly what makes them so bad. The pace is terrible. The plot is ridiculous. The characters are incredibly thin. But, after reading \\"Apollyon\\", I'd have to say the worst part is the dialogue. The things the authors have these characters say to each other actually make me groan every page or so. Don't read. These books may make you stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The First Three Are Good - These Past Two Are Not As Good","review":"Book five continues the twist and turn towards something that feels more like a Bible tract that needs to be handed out door-to-door. Moving away from the fantastic plot and character development of the first three books, LaHaye and Jenkins really begin a downward trend of not following upon previous successes for the series. There are several new characters that get added to the mix - some believers, some not. No background is explored on these new characters - so it is as if they are just dropped into the story as convenient stage props for the story. Honestly, this is the worst of the series thus far, simply because of the poor plot and character mechanics that these two have chosen to ignore in favor of treating the story as a well-bound Bible tract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noah","review":"Awesome series.

Clean and concise...the first 4 books were, what happened here. I hope Assassins is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to wrap up the series!","review":"I was disappointed.

Where did our intrepid authors come up with these corny names, an old copy of Boy's Life ? Then there's these goofy pregnancies . . . didn't Wilma Flintstone and Betty Rubble both conveniently get pregnant when people started losing interest in The Big Show ?

What are they thinking? The whole world is about to go kaput, and they're trying to repopulate the world? Lame plot line. Now the future books are going to be saddled with stupid things about raising a kid - midnight feedings, postpartum stretch marks, cloth vs. disposable diapers. As if you could even get diapers in a world where millions have perished and the infrastructure is demolished. At least they won't have to start saving for the kid's college fund, since he won't live to see kindergarten. Spare us the parental details, kill off the kid (or the parents) and get back to the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's become a soap opera, sad to say.","review":"The series started off okay, but it's really gone downhill the last few books. It now feels more like a made-for-TV movie or miniseries, and an overly long and drawn out one at that. Now that they're cranking out the books twice a year, they necessarily have to drag out the action so barely anything happens in each individual book. Just like daytime soaps, where not much happens from month to month. I'm sorry, but I'm no longer impressed and don't think it's worth buying in hardcover anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book, like the 4 previous is so totally AWESOME, I can't wait untill August when The Assasins is released.

However, I thought Tribulation Force was a bit long winded. Then I was caught up in Nicolae and Soul Harvest. I thought a streak of excellent story lines would be coming. Alas! Then came Apollyon and I found myself wanting to skip pages. The \\"fillers\\" had returned. I know about the character's pasts, I read the books. Moreover, I really do not need each book to go over the same personal details again and again when the story could be moving on. I simply found Apollyon boring. I do not plan to give up on the series yet, because the overall story is interesting. I am not religous, but this series made me think about the meaning of the Bible. However, even with this in mind, if the next book in the series uses old details as \\"filler\\", I may see this as a ploy to make more books than necessary (meaning more money to be spent by readers). I would find this truly sad considering the impact of some of the earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I was practically forced to read these books by my relatives, who think they're great.

It implied action, and while I must admit that the storyline did indeed pick up some in the fifth book over the fourth, the series itself is still losing momentum. The first three books captured my attention and riveted me but these last two have left me feeling a bit \\"preached to\\" and not really feeling the characters as much as I'd like. I'm not happy about the writer's decisions about what to do with two of the characters I thought were leads who seem to be absent from the plot now. It left me feeling a bit dispassionate about the series compared to how I felt before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"You read the books quickly, not because they're so gripping, but because there's nothing to them.

Without question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the weak minded","review":"Parents Beware! These books are NOT suitable for children. These books deal with mass disapearances, death, plague, Evil figures, Satan and brainwashing. These books are poorly written and deal with VERY Evil events. These Books are not for young minds who are easily influenced and impressionalble. Imagine if they start to run around the school yard believing that all this is true? Schools should pull these novels from their shelves. Book stores should prohibit the sale of these books unless the child has written permission.Want to give your children some books that will stimulate their imagination? Give them a Harry Potter book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holds Your Attention","review":"The entire series, from \\"Left Behind\\" to Apollyon\\", has held my attention. The fact that I just found out about these books has allowed me to read them in quickly in succession. The only negative thing now is that I must wait until August for the next book. \\"Apollyon\\" was action-packed, the most gruesome thanks to the locusts and yet keeps the reader's full attention. Whether it was wondering when Buck would get home, if Hattie or Chloe would actually have a baby in that terrible world, what would the witnesses do next, Tsion's intrepretation of the next event or if Nicholae would destroy more of the Tribulation Force, my attention was keenly focused on this material. Another benefit is that I have found a deeper desire to try and read Revelations again. Thanks for an exciting series and I look for to reading \\"Assasins\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash!","review":"These authors give a bad name to true Christianity! I could write better prose when I was in third grade. Though I will admit the series has kept me turning the pages just to see what absurdity will happen next.

I have read this series not as a true account of Bible prophecy, nor even as fiction, but merely as slightly interesting science-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, the best since Left Behind","review":"This book series is truly inspirational. If anyone has ever been curious as to what may happen at the rapture, then this is the series to read. This may not be exactly how things will turn out, but I share the views of the authors as do many others.

Apollyon is the best one yet! I was done with it in two days (it took so long because I had school and homework!) Apollyon has got plenty of action and can really keep you guessing. Sad times, happy times, scary times, peaceful times...I don't know how they do it! EVERYONE READ THIS BOOK! It's going to be a very long wait for Assassins.

This character sounded like the satirical Apu from the Simpsons. There are no people of color, any color included in these books. I started out liking the books but was disturbed by the incidents of racial stereotyping. What is most disturbing is the fact that White Supremecist Matthew Hales is known as Pontifex Maximus of the One World Church of the Creator.

I have bought 5 copies and started my family and friends with the first copy and they find the rest of the series, or get them from libraries. The best series to start a witnessing program. It took me one day to read Apollyon and I know the 6th book is out, have to wait till August 5th. When they make this book into a movie, hope it has the same effect on people as the books do.

After about 4 weeks, believe it or not, I lost 12 pounds and went down 2 sizes. No special dieting, no Atkins, South Beach and the rest. Just healthy eating and this tape 4 times a week.

The footage here was shot in the first half of 1982--and we know it was the first half, because Art Pepper died in June, 1982. Yet there's not a single hint that this about a man on the verge of death: he's vital, and funny, and deep in every frame, talking about his love of life and love of music.

You just can't compare the skill, creativity, songs that were created by Alvin Lee, to an amateur trying to imitate Alvin Lee. No energy. Please fans be aware of what is going on here. NO ALVIN LEE, he has absolutely nothing to do with this album and he pleased with the group to use another nane. But there is no money in that one.What a downer to hear the lack of energy and lack of creativity to a group trying to call themselves TYA.

Again; card stock! And the paint bottles it came with are TINY! Unlike the original paint that came with the spinner, you had to cut the tips off, and no matter how carefully you cut the tip off to the end as much as possible, it was too big and came out too fast.Save your money; re-use the original spinner bottles, make your own paint, and cut out the paper from cardstock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I am rather disappointed. I had one of these as a kid and loved it. I have never had a problem with the original stuff that came with the spinner. The paint dispensers are terrible! The purple one exploded when I cut the tip.

There were two different sizes of paper and even the largest didn't come anywhere near the paper guides, making both sizes unusable unless you attach a piece of tape to the back of the paper. The instructions that came with the refill set said that it included glitter--it did not. The paint was incredibly thick and two of the bottles were completely cracked all around the neck. I had to add water to thin out the paint and it still kept thickening up. USELESS, USELESS product. I recommend to try and find refill kits sold by Imaginarium if that is the product you have.

I like childens movies. Air Bud was far better. Poor editing and bad acting and a bad story (including a criminal after a dog!!!!!!!) made this hard to watch. When the dog plays soccer, it looks so fake. You see a goal and then a super-imposed dog going over it and hitting a ball. I am twelve years old, and I saw the most mistakes I have ever seen in a movie (and I've seen lots of movies). This movie is terrible and too mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie for children!!!","review":"This purports to be a fun children's movie about a dog playing soccer and an orphan fitting in with his new family. Instead, it has an evil twist that includes a demonic dog catcher that terrorizes the canines and mean-spirited children being nasty to other kids. I ended up fast forwarding to only the dog playing soccer parts; the other parts were either too stupid, scary or ill-conceived to let my daughter watch them. I don't know why a child's movie has to have such cruelty and nastiness.Besides the above, the plot and dialogue is terribly crafted. This is one I would definitely avoid--regardless of the cute cover that appeals to children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red carded","review":"We have two young boys who love soccer, so this movie seemed like a natural.

I am reviewing the boxed season two of Lexx sold by Alliance. The discs are held by plastic prongs that require the DVDs to be slid across one another and the packaging. The result is inevitable damage. Because of the poor design, it is likely any copy you buy will be damaged in shipping, as the discs can come loose easily from jarring. The same problem exists with season four, not so much with season 3. I had trouble finishing two episodes in the second season the first time I tried to play them. For some reason, the Blu-ray player was able to read them after I lent them to a friend.

But the scripting and directing are really terrible. A lot of the time the actors just stand around looking like they're trying to fake it while they remember their lines. There is no emotional immediacy or suspense, and you never worry about the fate of any of the characters because they themselves only seem mildly interested. The characters often seem to be acting at random.The special effects are a lot better than the guy in a gorilla suit of yesteryear, but aren't up to modern standards. My recommendation would be to try the pilot movie (I Worship His Shadow) and if you like it enough to want to watch a series that is only about half as good, think about it from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest -- but too much Chopin!","review":"Sofronitsky is one of my all-time favourite pianists: his playing seems ot burst at the seams with passion.

Perhaps that was a shocking consideration in 1950. Nowadays, erg, it seems trivial. Add to that that the acting was often silly and overdone in a big way (seemed more like Kabuki than film), the silent film-esque sort of vibe got tedious, and the music grated on me after a certain point.All that said, perhaps this film was a mind-blower sixty years ago, but I can't help but think that the Wizard of Oz seems a hundred times more modern than this and came out 11 years earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kurosawa's examination of good and evil","review":"In Kurosawa's examination of good and evil, he missed the point, namely, that all men are evil. This is a film which featured four different accounts of a rape and murder, seeing it from different points of drunkeness. There are several reasons why this film is painful to watch. The first reason is the childish cinematography. I have a somewhat ambivalent reaction to it. Though the film is entertaining if the audience is gassed with sleeping fumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've all been fooled!","review":"I'm afraid I'll get a lot of heat from this, but if you liked this movie, you've lost your mind. I'm afraid all too often people are influenced by critics and intimidated by old black and white films with subtitles. Though it may be a ground-breaking style of film, that does not make it a good film. In a sad attempt to confuse the truth about the death of a man, Kurosawa frustrates audiences with a bad Twilight Zone episode; too long and without that creepy plot twist so very needed.

I re-read WHITE FANG two months ago and there is precious little in this movie that was in the book. Jack London did not write kiddie books (nor did Anna Sewell, for that matter) and I understand how difficult it would be to adapt his works to the screen and get a family rating.

It's like the same person purposely ripping down a forest and then caging animals in a zoo and claiming to \\"help\\" them.Second, I know that dog fights are very brutal, but I thought the film could have been made without showing the actual dog fights (several minutes worth of dog fights are shown.)Third, the movie shows wolves as savage purposeful killers of man, which is a myth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks depth","review":"* Well acted movie somehow lacks depth. * Wolf and Boy should meet earlier on in the movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over it!!!!","review":"Ok, so this movie does not follow the book to the \\"T\\".

As usual the plot takes many twists and turns, some predictable, others not so. This is an extremely well written, engaging mystery series and is an enjoyable fast paced read. Strongly recommended for anyone interested in this genre, but I would suggest that if you haven't read Massey before, start at the begining, \\"The Salaryman's Wife.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pearl Diver","review":"Fantastic Item; Wonderful Condition; Very Heppy; Would do business with again; A+++++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally phony","review":"The impression I get was that this book was written for effect. It is as if Massey wants to prove that she is a hard-core Washingtonite (if I may use that word). Throwing in the political angle was superflous as well - Senator Snowden - give me a break.There is no real story here - the plot about the pearl diver is just added in to connect the ramblings about the restaurant and Washington political scene.On the whole this was not a satisfying read at all.And finally why the negative review of Rei's work at the restarant? What did that achieve?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first in the series--skip this one","review":"I'm not moved often to write reviews pro or con but this book was so terrible I had to act. I gave it one star because the writing is literate.I will only say that I have read all the other books in this series except the one immediately before this one. I missed it and was excited to see a new one! Alas, moving to the U.S. seems to have completely changed her personality. She has become tedious, whiny, and tentative. The plot of this novel is uninvolving and very slow to get started. The other characters, except Aunt Norie, are pedestrian.If you want exciting books about Japan, read the Isaac Adamson series with Billy Chaka or, for a slower pace and intriguing characters, the early Banana Yoshimoto. Check out Haruki Murakami. There's good stuff out there. This isn't it.Lose Hugh and send Rei back to Tokyo.

Rei is a smart and interesting protagonist and is usually surrounded by equally interesting characters. Something went wrong with this book. I think Massey was trying to show a different side of Rei, unhappy with where she's living and with her relationships. Rei comes off, however, as whiney, shallow, and uninteresting. Aunt Norie is the only truly interesting person in this book. The new characters are all superficial and border on off-the-shelf stereotypes.

When I first started reading this book I intended just to read for a short while, taking a break from a hot day, but I ended up reading the entire book in one sitting!I loved the setting and the way the author made you feel it could almost be anywhere in the world. Portions had me thinking of Canada while other descriptions made me think of places in Wales and Scotland. Plus who wouldn't like to live in a lighthouse.If you enjoy magic and mystery you will certainly find this book engaging. The twist at the end was wonderful and I did have my suspicions but not until much later on in the book. This is a book that I am sure to read again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-compelling","review":"I prefer mysteries that keep me guessing up to the explanation at the end, and I figured this one out by the end of the second chapter. By that time I also didn't particularly care for the main character, though I liked her older son. I found the constant references to the missing husband rather irritating, especially since the author doesn't tell us who Alexi was until his mystery-shrouded name had been sprinkled through the text five times. One reviewer liked the lack of explanations in the book, but I don't enjoy passages that make me feel like the author is trying to play games with my head. If the character doesn't know something, I'm OK with not knowing it, but pages of gloomy \\"Alexi is missing\\" with no explanation of who he was to warrant this attention made me grouchy. I skipped to the end to confirm my guess and didn't feel any need to fill in the missing chapters. Overall, the author uses words well, and I'm sorry that I didn't find the book more compelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat's Paw","review":"A cute story if meant for maybe 5th-8th grade readers.

I enjoyed the fact that the main character was female. It seems so many of the ones I read are male.I am not too keen on mysteries but enjoyed this mystery.

I also liked the heroine, a small town lady, who kept growing stronger as she searched for her missing husband. Also interesting was the strange cat that she took with her as she searched.

At the time when it was published, 1946, no book had been written about racial tension in South Africa, especially fom the eyes of a Black South African.

Anyone interested in Current Events or the History of South Africa and its transformation from Apartheid and White Rule to One Man One Vote and Democracy needs to read this book. I had no idea that Mandela and the South African government had been in negotiation long before Mandela's release. I also had no idea how well Mandela used his ability to speak Afrikaaner and his knowledge of Afrikaaner History to while negotiating to end Apartheid. You see the challenges DeKlerk, Mandela, and all of South Africa had to overcome. And they did. This is a short book, but after reading this you will become an expert on the events that led to the end of Apartheid and the beginning of Democracy in South Africa.

First of all, it's filled with almost 15 pages of \\"Errata\\" - including the author messing up a Taylor Series Expansion. That's ridiculous - no publisher should have allowed this book to go on the market so full of mistakes with the author so unwilling to correct them.Secondly, the book teaches you absolutely no Math at all. Half of the lectures in each chapter are obscure, random models the author picked, and suddenly is capable of making assumptions about each model that seem completely arbitrary. There is no reasoning behind half of the steps the author takes.I'm sorry, but I swear I'm becoming bad at math trying to use this textbook. Using this book is a waste of time and money.

Rather than actually correcting these errors, the publisher instead decided to put an \\"Errata\\" section at the beginning of the book, leaving the mistakes strewn throughout the text. So, prior to reading a chapter, one must look up what errors there are and either make a mental note or correct it by hand. Since the errors are quite copious, 16 pages worth in all with an error every 5 pages, it becomes extremely distracting.From the author's webpage, the following is a list of errata in this edition: [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a fun movie...I should know.

When I gave up on the thing and reverted to my old method of connecting by stretching a phone wire across the kitchen to get to the phone jack, everything worked just fine. I was very disappointed and had to \\"eat crow\\" for being so gullible as to believe the package claims without checking any further.

It worked in the beginning for about a week with no problems. Then it started acting up. The extension unit would lose the connection about 2-3 times a day. Sometimes it would self-restore, sometimes needed to reset. It was a nuisance but we tolerated it. Then about a month after we bought it, it completely failed to connect. I tried all the troubleshooting tips, and even did the new channel set-up shown in the manual. I work in electronics, so I tried other ideas I knew as well. Still doesn't work.

The transmitter and receiver are IN THE SAME ROOM and can't maintain a signal. It seems like the cordless signal interferes, which is ridiculous.

I thought the acting was very strong and the story was inspiring. Roger and JP are two young boys living in a foster home under the care of the kindhearted Maggie. JP is your typical adorable and happy-go-lucky (for the most part) kid, but Roger is still hoping that his messed-up father will come back for him. Apparently, Roger's father tells him that he will only come back if the California Angels baseball team--the worst team in the league--wins the pennant. So, Roger becomes an instant fan, and he and JP begin to follow the team. Manager George Knox is bullheaded and about ready to pack up and leave until Roger starts to see angels who just might be able to carry the team where they need to go. All in all, it is just a very good film that has something powerful to say about having faith, pulling together as a team, and forming your own family bonds when the ones that you have are broken.I recommend this one 100%, and it is worth every cent of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney, What Did You Expect?","review":"This movie is not funny (unless you like to watch people to fall down), it's not charming, it's not warm, it's not good.

The Disney machine cranks out another loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatchamacallits in the Thingamajig","review":"A theologically murky, emotionally maudlin, dramatically musty baseball comedy that is visually meritorious. At the press conference, the statements about God and angels are so vague, bland and incoherent as to call into question the wisdom of including angels in the plot at all. Based on the press conference, the movie should have been called whatchamacallits in the thingamajig. Why was the Mel Clark disease plot point sprung on us unless it was to jerk more tears? Was there any other plot point that wasn't telegraphed like a pitcher with a tell? The movie does look good and young children will probably enjoy the slapstick but it isn't very satisfying for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty sappy stuff","review":"Foster-child Roger (Joseph Gordon-Leavitt) prays for the California Angels to win the pennant in the mistaken belief that it will lead to reconciliation with his father (Dermot Mulroney). Angels begin to intervene on the Angels' behalf, bringing hope, faith, and a renewed sense of self-worth to bitter manager George Knox (Danny Glover) and his clumsy team. Diabetics should avoid this film at all costs. It goes for easy sentimentality every step of the way, leading to a very predictable outcome. Kids may like it, though I don't want to be the one to explain why God would pick sides in a sports contest, especially since He and His angels ought to be well aware that answering Roger's prayers will not lead to the outcome he so desperately desires. Oh well, if you can put your brain on hold and get misty-eyed over a stadium full of spectators flapping their arms like angels, you ought to have a good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actual title is: Guion Miller Roll \\"Plus\\" ...plus","review":"1909 Guion Miller Roll \\"Plus\\" of Eastern Cherokee East & West of Mississippi 1909 plus the 1898 Dawes Roll information.

At some points it was hard for me to get off of one page because it was so boring. And the way she called Chink, \\"Daddy\\" was kind of corny. Yeah the pain and the love between the characters was understood, but maybe this book could have been written better. So i guess im in the minority here but I would not recommend this book to anyone.

Sandra (the main character) was lost from the moment we were introduced to her, but it wasn't her fault.

Throughout the story, Goines shows how their bond became stronger and it remained that way until the very end. She found someone who believed in her, and in return, gave him all she could all the way to the climax.

They created music because they were artist & expressed themselves beautifully. This kind of attitude should be celebrated & promoted by the industry today. Unfortunately today the only thing it takes to get a recording deal is a pretty face & a voice suitable for digital inhancement.

More fundamentally, how can one not begin?\\" It heads straight downhill from there. On the up side, page 103 has perhaps the most spirited collection of invented academic terminology that I've seen since undergraduate days, so if you're a collector of that sort of thing, this text is a must-have.

He really shows how passionate Hank Aaron was to not only play baseball, but prove that whites and blacks were equal. No matter how many people told him he wouldn't make it, or said that because he was black he had no chance, he kept striving towards his goals. Aaron really didn't get much credit in his early years of playing. It was only when he started threatening Babe Ruth's home run record. I had always thaught that he was a recognized player. Hank Aaron has been a hero for anybody who has been turned down wanting to acheive a goal, and many other people. He has been one for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's more odious than a blackmailer?","review":"A murderer, that's who. As much as Miss Maud Silver hates blackmailers, it does not justify murder in her mind. When she is spending a summer holiday at the seaside with her favourite niece, Ethel Burkett, strange happenings are occuring at a neighbourhood house. Miss Silver gets drawn into it when someone is found dead in a beach house. In this case, the murdered victim has more enemies than enough, and there are more motives than enough so it makes it difficult to find the killer. But, never fear, Miss Silver is there to figure it out, but not before there is another death. This is a book with two murder victims that are both very unlikeable people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy, yet compelling.","review":"Any fan of Agatha Christie's MISS MARPLE will certainly enjoy Patricia Wentworth's MISS SILVER.Having been endeared to the local authorities, Miss Silver quietly unravels the tangled ball of yarn that is the past lives of those whom have assembled themselves in and around a quiet country manor.Cozy, yet compelling.

I'm only a first-year student, but so far this book, which was required for class, has been absolutely useless to me.***REVISED REVIEW***I've graduated from nursing school now and entered the working world. In school, I finally figured out how to use this book efficiently, and it was useful. I never did get sold on the nursing diagnosis scheme this book relies on, and I've never made use of a nursing diagnosis in the hospital setting except to fill out busywork paperwork that nobody refers to.If you buy this book for school, you should be able to get away with a used older edition for cheaper cost. Orient yourself to the book for a while before getting into care planning. Then use the book and don't sweat the small stuff. You need to get through school, but basic pathophys, pharm, and getting the most out of clinicals are the important things for post-school life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best value for the money","review":"Of the five or so diagnosis handbooks that I have purchased, this one is the one that I reference the most when doing care plans and research - the least expensive too.

Four Arrows has gathered together a number of essays that speak to the damage that continues to be inflicted on America's Indigenous Peoples. The essays are well written, cogent, and enlightening, showing how deeply the language of conquest is embedded in our national literature and how it damages our citizenry. For, while the oppressed receive the greatest damage, the oppressor is also negatively affected. In trying to justify the actions that deny Indian citizens their rights, the majority utilizes every kind of lie: anything built on lies will eventually collapse. We must stop telling lies and live up to the treaties we made with the Indian Nations. We must insist on our courts meting out justice based on law, not on prejudice. We must unlearn the language of conquest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cinema record breaker!","review":"And now.. the envelope please.

Besides, it's just plain remarkable, especially when you live in Paris, to hear Bob talking French to his buddy Jean Reno. Of course, one will recall the car chases for a long time...Hey, what's the big deal, they ALL drive like that here ! All kidding aside, to shoot an American action movie in Paris must have been quite a challenge, and the result is pretty good. Don't miss it.

I didn't expect much as a movie, so in that sense, my expectations were met. Robert De Niro is Robert De Niro - always enjoyable to watch but \\"What's a nice actor like you doing in a movie like this?\\" The characters generate no sympathy. The story is an inventory of cliches and formulas. As for the car chase, I was not impressed. To be fair, it may have been better on a full movie screen in a real theater. But the story seems like so much filler between the car chase and all the flying blood and bullets.

Not mentioned in other reviews of this film is that the script is ghost-written by playwright David Mamet under the name of Richard Weisz. Also I believe that the ghost of the great noirist director, Jean Pierre-Melville hovers over this unique film. DeNiro is fine as always as the key protagonist and he's backed by Jean Reno (The Professional;Crimson Rivers), Steller Skargsgard, Natascha McElhoe, Sean McBean, Michel Lonsdale (Day of the Jackal)and Jonathan Pryce. Full of car chases and double crosses plus the \\"McGuffin\\", this slick action film is one great chase reminscent of the great Steve McQueen action flicks of the 60's and 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see !!!!","review":"Car chase out of this world.

They kept this movie interesting throughout without requiring expensive special effects and stuntwork like some other action movies try to do to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretentious film about nothing","review":"This is pretty aweful. The film tries (very unsuccessfully) to study \\"the reality\\" of assasins and former secret agents. It tries to convey how void of meaning the characters's lives are and how bored they are. But that is done at the cost of boring the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is it?","review":"where the hell is my Blu ray? i ordered it last month, i got 15 of what i ordered but I'm missing this one.i wonder where it is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....except for the car chases","review":"What a disappointment.

I am amazed that other reviewers are discussing plot (was there a plot?) and I am equally amazed that Robert De Niro couldn't find something better to do. It must have paid well. The center of the story is a mysterious brief case... It does afford an excuse for a couple splendid car chases in splendid European cars that you won't see on the streets of the U.S., the only reason I gave it even one star. Oh, and there is the usual beautiful 20-something girl who... So we get conflicting and, the director probably hopes, self-cancelling sexist/feminist versions of the usual Hollywood cliches.

Great cast--makes you wonder what the producer had on them to make them waste their time (and ours) on this.Biggest plot device to keep us in suspense--don't tell us anything about anything!Biggest surprise at the end--none!Least surprise--what was in the case they have all been chasing since the get-go.

While watching the movie I felt that we were seeing the dirty underbelly of espionage.Frankenheimer did a great job a creating the look and feel of dangerous professionals going about their jobs in the shadows of society.From the beginning Deniro paints a great picture of a cautious professional spy that has lived a long time and plans on living longer.There are some good twists in the movie. And overall the acting was excellent especially Deniro and Reno.For fans of good storytelling or espionage buffs this is a can't miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-rated thriller that's a lot more than car chases!","review":"RONIN, despite what other reviews may state, is not just a car chase movie. It's cut from the same mold as THE DOGS OF WAR, i.e. a movie about world-weary soldiers of fortune and the lives they lead. In addition, it has a great surprise ending and crisp acting from DeNiro, Reno and everone else. Sure, the car chases are spectacular. But what's overlooked are the crisp editing, the pacing, and the realistic downbeat tone of the film. Overall, this is a well-made spy thriller that is much more than a superficial action flick if one cares to look for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many car chases get in the way of a great plot","review":"Plotwise, this thriller is top-notch: Simple yet tantalizing, classic yet unpredictable. The acting is also great, especially of course DeNiro, who is also given the greatest lines (\\"I hurt a man's feelings once...\\"). From the very getgo there are terrific suspense sequences, but towards the end the plot is propelled forward by countless car chases. The first one or two makes perfect sense, and in a way the third does too, but one can't help but think that Frankenheimer lets the narrative slide only to blow up more cars. Still, the wonderful finale in the ice arena makes up for anything. A great thriller AND a great action movie, even though the parts don't always harmonize."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen!","review":"All I understand about the movie is a lot of car chasing which are surely commercials for Audi, Mercedes, Toyota, ... you name it.

Movies are supposed to convey information to its viewers.

The cast includes Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Jonathon Pryce and Sean Bean. All are excellent and the opening setup scenes are tremendously well-done, with Frankenheimer making proper use of DeNiro and Reno's magnetic screen presences.The plot concerns the retrivial of a mysterious brief case. All of the above cast members are hired mercenaries paid to get it back for an Irish lady. This is where the title comes from. Ronin were effectively freelance Samarai.

De Niro again successfully provides proof that his acting carrer is coming to an end. I was confounded by Jean Reno's performance, he was hilarious in Les Visiteurs and Rosanna's Grave, a convincingly trechorous villian in Mission Impossble and an uneducated unsocialised assasin in Leon; yet his thespian projection in Ronin was neither interesting nor accurate and unfortunately for all concerned - explosions can not compensate for a unimaginative script.

I found it virtually impossible to suspend disbelief. The script seemed canned and by the numbers instead of creative cinema art. De Niro is one of my favorites, but even he couldn't overcome the lousy directing and crummy script. The accents of the characters were transparently fake.
