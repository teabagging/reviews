The sound quality is poor--you could hear the scratches and pops of the original record. The recording itself--made off a radio broadcast--is not too great to begin with. What's more annoying--for me anyway--is that the radio announcer kept coming on to introduce this and that song, thus ruining whatever mood the album and the individual songs produce in the listener.

After putting it in my C.D. in my truck and listening to the first tune I knew I had made a big, big mistake. Every song that it played was that whiney-ass country music that rednecks seem to love. This is NOT country rock! It is pure country music and the kind of music most people who listen to rock and roll absolutely hate.

Without the (waning) excitement of live concerts what other motivation was there to seek out new material?Fortunately, the love of music. As this album testifies, the past still provided the adventurous artist with enough richness and diversity to excite even the most jaded performer. Chuck Berry's anthemic title track is the prime example, as Elvis pours all of his considerable energy into making this song his own. Add to this some beautifully performed contemporary numbers such as \\"Your Love's Been A Long Time Coming\\", \\"Thinking Of You\\" and Waylon Jennings's \\"You Asked Me To\\", and \\"Promised Land\\" delivers the sense of purpose and energy lacking in many of his other album releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Care of Berry","review":"I can't think of a better song to listen to when I'm cruising down the interstate in a pink Cadillac than Elvis's version of Chuck Berry's \\"Promised Land.\\" It really TCBs.

This is neither an extension of those nor an interesting alternative. The look is goofy. The characters are larger than the buildings, the colors are too vibrant. Really quite a let-down. I also have no interest at all in the heroes (and the silly RPG that goes with them) that dominate games like this. In an effort to combine RTS with RPG, you get something not adequate to the best of either. If you liked the AoE/AoK/Conquerors stuff, go to Total War/Medieval. Leave this crap behind and hope the makers return to form with their next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Disappointed","review":"I was truely looking forward to playing this game. I grew up playing these types of games, but Age of Mythlology may as well been released back in 1991. Maybe then it would have blown me away with hours of entertainment. However now, with the advent of realistic strategy games and appealing visual effects and artwork, Age of Mythology fell short. For those of you who were looking for a great sequel to Age of Empires, i reccommend that you look elsewhere. I returned Age of Mythology the day after i recieved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent enough game","review":"I got the Gold Edition about 2 years after the original AOM came out. I played the storyline editions for both the original and the Titan expansion, as well as a few random maps.The random map play is not all that. Most of these games are expectedly of the ilk \\"amass, upgrade, overwhelm\\" and this game does have a lot of cool units, but it was missing something in the random map game.The storylines, I found entertaining, and they would be more challenging on harder levels. I wish they had come out with more, for those were the really entertaining parts of the game. Now that I have completed them, I don't know if I will continue to play.Overall, i recommend getting it on the cheap if you are a fan of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A STEP DOWN FROM AOE 2","review":"My friend bought this game (luckily i didnt waist my money). I borrowed it from him and i kept it for the next 1 and a half hours. I played it, and it sucked. Thats all there is to it. The graphics are about the level you would expect from age of empires 1, and the fighting was terrible. The new gods and mythical creatures are just boring and it isnt realistic at all! If i could think of any more insults i would say them. But i cant, so all i will say is... DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!","review":"I bought this game expecting the best RTS game to date but instead I got a rehash of every game of this nature ever released. This game is boooooooring. I beat it my first day playing it, on the hardest level because it's so easy. The characters/units are uninteresting and there is nothing really that good to say about the battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next Home Run From Ensemble Studios","review":"This is an amazing game. There's the similar gameplay to the Age of Empires series that has sold 100,000s of copies with more appeal and advancements. New, more realistic graphics such as falling snow and accurate attack movements make this game even more exciting than the Age series games before it. Getting to choose exactly how you advance through the game gives a whole new level of complexity. There are endless ways to play by simply picking different maps, opponents, ways to win, civilizations, and how to play those civilizations. The detail and gameplay is an enhanced version of the Age series that I still play though it has been out for years. This is a must by for anyone with an interest in strategy games. Also, it has a great deal of history, good for students like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-Down - the best RTS game of the year!","review":"I was lucky enough to be a recipient of the marketing beta for this game - developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Microsoft. This game blows away all the other \\"Age of\\" games of the past few years. From the second the game takes over the screen until hours later when you go to sleep, the gameplay is smooth, fascinating and exciting. The Gods and their powers are an incredible addition to the standard RTS gaming world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A step backwards","review":"I've bought all of the \\"Age of...\\" games and have enjoyed them more and more with each new release. However, Age of Mythology has broken this trend and taken a step backwards in many ways. The only positive thing is the improved graphics. Everything else is worse. The number of possible opponents is fewer, the world (playing field) sizes are fewer and smaller, the number of levels of difficulty is fewer. In the last regard especially it suffers. The step in difficulty from easy to moderate is too large, from too passive to too aggresive opponents in one step. The game also lacks any feeling of strategy other than \\"build as fast as you can and then throw everything at your opponent\\". The small world sizes are a part of the reason for this as well and make anything other than 1 on 1 matches too crowded. Save your money and wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as addicting as Age of Empires","review":"This game plays similar to the Age of Empire games. The graphics are incredible and the mythical creatures look awesome. Few minor play details that I like better in the Conquerors expansion of the Age of Empire games that I would like to see incorporated here. Bewarned, if you like the Age of Empire games, you are going to be just as addicted to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action/stategy game","review":"pretty good overall. Great graphics and sound. Probably the main debate in this game is the story. The story is pretty decent, the end sorta stunk but the story still is good. I like the fact that you can make myth units. I didn't know half the units untill I played the game! pretty good get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet from Ensemble Studios","review":"Awsome graphics. Superb sound. Impeccable game interface. This game is certaintly the best in the Age of Series. The balance is good. I very much like the 3 types of units (human, heroic, and mythic). It gives the game more variety and tactical challenge. The only thing is the game is too slow for me (45 min. to 2 hr.), so I would reccomend Red Alert 2 for those of you that are like me. Other than that this game is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun family game","review":"As a huge fan of this type of game, I was excited to play something that dealt with mythological creatures and magical powers. While not as robust a product as Empire Earth, or even Age of Empires, the game is a lot of fun. The real test is how my kids respond to it -- given the choice between Age of Mythology, Empire Earth, and Rise of Nations, they prefer AoM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you enjoy frustration.","review":"I really have enjoyed age of empires, but this game is one big frustration. I have not been able to actually play the game. It always stops responding after two or three minutes into any part of the game. Microsoft's customer service has been of no use yet. Their general suggestions is to upgrade everything. When I get a game I don't want to take all day to download updates so it will work on my computer. My computer passes the requirements posted on the side of the box. Maybe they think everybody buys a new computer every month or so. I have been reading on newsgroups and forums and there are many buyers with similar problems.It might be a fun game if I every get it to run. Save your money until Microsoft comes up with a new version or a patch that will fix it numerous problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: Administrator Privileges Required!!!","review":"Because this game requires \\"Administrator Privileges\\" to run (not just install) I can not recommend this game if you share a computer with others -> especially younger others who may inadvertently do damage as \\"administrators\\".You would think Microsoft would have the brains to figure this out!

But since they were making it anyway I thought I might as well try it out. It definitely didn't have the same feel as the other age games. Sure, you started out with a town center and some villagers and a scout, but the 3d just looks bad. And the sounds weren't very good either. And only 3 races! I was very disappointed. I hope they hurry up and deliver the next age game and make it right next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad","review":"can u image that this game would make a super computer which is bulit in intel P4 2.1G, Geforce4 Mx440, 512 viking Rambus Rimm Memory... restart a few times when I was playing it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If its not broken, don't fix it.","review":"If you are a Age of empire loyalist, do not waste your money on this stinker.

The graphics are high quality. They are much better than that of a seemingly stunning Warcraft 3. The units are good. They are similliar to those of Age of empires.

If you have the requirements (which my PC MORE than has), the game should run. You shouldn't have to worry about your BIOS or DMA or whether Virus Scan is running to be able to play.I had problems with this literally from install. Then I couldn't do little things like adjust the resolution so that I could actually SEE the units. Not that it mattered since it would freeze my entire computer to the point of needing to unplug it a before I even got into the game itself. This one's going back to the store until I find out they debugged it enough that the average layman can install it and actually play."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"The first thing I noticed was that the units, buildings, and interface were almost identical to AOE. Though Micrsoft claims that it is 3D for some unknown reason you can't rotate the camera. Nothing is 3D except for some of the units which are kinda 3D. Same boring tactics that are used in Aoe. Just more rushing. Not much when compared to Ground control or Earth 2150. It is better than Starcraft but not by much. Microsoft has donea very bad job at their first attempt to create a 3D game. Also the sides are very similar. Hardly any strategy involved. Por lighting and speciial effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"The previous Age of Empire games worked fine on my computer, but this one evidently won't because of my video card.

The graphics are beautiful, the background history (though generally glossy) is interesting, and the units are great and varied.I disagree that this game is very much like Age of Empires, a game I found difficult and overly uniform. In AOM, the units and buildings vary significantly - both by function and looks. All 3 races are unique and interesting.Overall, a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"Its the king of all strategy games. Add superb graphics, great gameplay, awesome attacks, cool characters, and a whole bunch of fun together, and what do you get? Age of Mythology. Microsoft has made some great games in the past, but this by far is best. There are practically no errors in gameplay. The price is a little high, but its definitly worth it. It takes some space though as it uses 1.5 gigs on your hard drive. Besides that I see it as the perfect strategy game ever. Bottom line: If you want a superior strategy game, buy Age of Mythology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age Of War, War, WAR!!!","review":"If you like strategy games like \\"Age of Empires\\", \\"Rome Total War\\", or \\"Warcraft 3\\", then you should enjoy this game. If not, well, don't bother. I liked it. The graphics are good, the sound is good, the control is good. You get to expand your own ancient civilization, use god powers and mythical beast units on your enemies. But it's all about war. You rush through the building process, collecting food and so on, and building up your culture, only to fight and conquer, or defend. Some may prefer more creative space, some not. I couldn't figure out the Editor -- I couldn't figure out how to make my enemies do anything!

The most important parts are the three unique civilizations, god powers, and mythological units. For example, if you decide to worship Hera, you can get Medusas and the lightning storm power. There is also a really good campaign, with more than thirty levels, where you play as the greek hero Arkantos.

Very practical information about what pugs need as far as bathing, skin fold wiping (beware of swamp face), and other general pug hygiene. Very practical training tips, such as belly rubbing to assure your pug that you are dominant (as well as providing a delightful belly rub) and choosing useful words for training, such as \\"off\\" instead of \\"no jumping,\\" so that that your pug can be praised with the same word, for example, \\"Good Off,\\" which then serves as a built-in reward (and doesn't exhaust the word \\"No\\"). Interesting and funny information on pug personalities. What's not to love about a pug?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pugs are Lovable","review":"Wonderful book replete with information about pug care, i.e. grooming, cleaning their facial folds and finger curling their doubly curled tails when they are still puppies.You also get to read about training and breeding your pug and overall good dog care specific to this breed.

These cables will make a fuzzy blurry picture quality to a much sharper and crisper quality...but still not the same as real HD, or the quality of HDMI.

One of them came completely smashed to oblivion. Amazon quickly replaced it. Overall I really like these shelves. I have two of them mounted one above the other. The mounting screws are long and ridiculously tough to put in with really soft heads. The shelves seem solid enough. One is the perfect size for my blu ray player the other holds my xbox 360 and its power box and my wii. The plastic covers are really flimsy but you can sort of hide wires in them.

The shelf is tempered glass and very strong. It looks very nice when its mounted. The only problem I have with this product is the cheap plastic component that hides the mounting hardware once the installation is complete. It's hanging on by a dream. All it has to keep it in place are some small tabs that are supposed to clamp onto the mounting bracket. Mine is on, but if I get to close, it just falls off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For the Price!","review":"Its a great product for the price. It doesnt look cheap and it was easy to put up!!!

Its a great piece of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shelf after you get it up","review":"I purchased this shelf because I was looking for a lower profile shelf to hold the DVR box. This shelf is nice and fits our needs for that lower profile look I wanted. Considering the price, and that the prices of similar items in most stores is 2-3 times more, it is a great buy! The only trouble we had was a little difficulty mounting it. My husband didn't have a tool to fit the bolts that came with it and after visiting and calling a few stores to get the tool that would fit I found out that it is actually a very odd size and is mostly only used by mechanics. My husband ended up mounting it with a wrench to tighten the bolts. It worked but was just a little bit more of an inconvenience and took a little longer. We mounted it in a stud and I really wouldn't suggest mounting something this heavy that is also going to hold the weight of other items without a stud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Shelf","review":"Mounted this shelf above a wall-mounted 32\\" TV in our living room.

I love the quality of the products from OmniMount and this component shelf is very strong and it right now holds my DVR, DVD player and I also placed a laptop on the DVD player. The only thing I worry about is if the stud can hold the shelf and it's contents.Good:- Installation was pretty easy and straightforward using the hardware included with the product. You should have a better stud-finder and a stronger drill.- Very strong and sturdyNot so good:- Protrudes far away from the wall. If you have installed it above 4 ft, you have to watch when walking near it or bending down under the shelf to pick up something from the floor. Though it took a while to get used to this protruding from the wall, now I am alright.- I would have loved to have a shorter (at least by 3 inches) and fixed arm. Currently it can swing, for which I don't see any use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality Shelf at an Inexpensive Price","review":"I would highly recommend this shelf for anyone looking to hang their cable box or dvd player underneath the tv. It is a very sturdy high quality shelf. One recommendation since it is very heavy is to make sure it is put into a stud in the wall. The shelf also looks almost invisible which is nice. I definiltey recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Priced very well, quality product. The shelf arm sticks out a bit far from the wall. The pic is deceiving.

Now I use this shelf to hold my laptop out of they way and off my desk in my office when re-charging the battery or when I'm not using it. I had it mounted in the corner so the cut off corners of the glass shelf is perfect for not scuffing the wall as it swivels slightly. It is also very good looking when my computer is not on it.

It works great, it looks good, and was easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for the price","review":"I have to agree with all the 5-star reviews: This is well made, attractive, fairly easy to install and nicely priced. I bought it to mount a 17-lb Epson 8350 projector behind and above my plasma TV to project on the opposite wall. I had a friend help locate the wall studs and figure the proper height and center point for the bracket. The bolts are a little hard to drive home (we used a power screwdriver and really had to lean into it), but the bracket is certainly solidly set in the wall. I think that screws half the length of those provided would work just as well. The rest of the setup was easy. The shelf rotates left-and-right, which makes it easy to access the ports on the rear of the projector. You can't make up-down adjustments, but the projector has adjustable feet for that. I would definitely buy more of these if I decide to mount, say, a pair of fairly large speakers or another electronic device."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy attractive glass shelf","review":"I purchased this shelf to go under the wall mount of my 32 inch flat screen to hold the Direct TV HD receiver.

It is currently holding a PS3 and a Wii. Looks great. The swivel is handy and the glass fits a modern entertainment area.The installation was a breeze. It is SOLID.

This one is much cheaper. Although it was taped in 1953, the sound quality isn't all bad but I'm not sure if it has been digitally re-mastered. Regardless, this more big band jazz orientated cd gives the listener a chance to hear what is probably Les's best band ever. Some of the featured soloists include Don Fagerquist, Ronnie Lang, Dave Pell, Rolly Bundock, Ray Sims and others. This band really cooks, and, because it was recorded live, the spontaneity is obvious. This is a \\"must own\\" for any true Les Brown fan even though there aren't many of his old standards on this cd. There is lots of excitement here. It's too bad that the engineers injected the \\"fake\\" applause and cheering after and during solos and at the conclusion of numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"something old is new again","review":"In high school I wore out this 2 disk LP. Wonderful to see it out on CD. The quality of the soloists, the variety of the arrangements and the power of the swinging rhythm section keeps this antique set from ever growing old and stale. The enthusiasm of the large crowd was an obvious inspiration for the band, and they rose to the occasion. The music and the band never sounded more fresh, even 60 years later.

I played the CD 2 days after the show and was able to recognize all the songs they did right away. Tracks 2 and 5 are real jems. Ms.Echo's slightly raspy voice is perfect and needs no improvement. The ocassianal lead synthesizer played by the guitarist,along with the standard guitar/bass/drums set-up tops off their great sound. I was able to meet Aimee Echo and Jeff the bassist briefly after their show and they didn't pull any of the typical cocky rock-star attitude either(they seemed a bit tired though. can't blame them after such an outburst of energy). As for their sound.. hmmm.. Nirvana(they did a slammin'cover of breed) meets Garbage. And that still doesn't really say it all. Get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"where were you at theSTART?","review":"I discovered theSTART sometime last year, and my life really hasn't been the same since. I decided to check them out because of their amazing lead singer, Aimee Echo of a great band called Human Waste Project. I was pleasantly surprised. Let me start by saying that Aimee's vocals are the only thing that connects theSTART with HWP. And that is definetly not a problem.This album is sure to pull anyone out of a bad mood. From the title track to \\"Hang on Me\\" to \\"Kiss it Better,\\" it will make you want to get up and dance. My personal favorite track is \\"Her Song,\\" which also happens to be the first song I heard by the band.In short, I would recommend this album to anyone who loves great music. And if you enjoy it, don't hesitate to check out the Death Via Satellite EP from the band's website.\\"You're all dressed up and you've nothing to lose/and I see you brought your dancing shoes/well, let's figure out how to use those things!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It is ok but .......","review":"But, when I heard \\"The Start\\" .... it sounded like new wave pop.

I would have to say the stand out tracks are \\"Hang On Me\\" and \\"Gorgeous\\". If you like bands like \\"No Doubt\\", \\"P.J.

There are some good tunes on the album notably \\"The bomb\\" and \\"Give it all your heart\\" (which at 7.39 is the longest track).It has to be said that this an album for Hancock completists only"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appropriate title...","review":"The title of this album is right on target--was Herbie trying to tell us something? Producer Rod Templeton scored some memorable hits for the likes of Michael Jackson, but here there's little in the way of memorable tunes, the production is by-the-numbers even by the slack early-80's pop standards, and Hancock is little more than the stock keyboard player on a mismatched gig. I support Herbie's right to record anything he wants, including this disc. However, I don't think at this point in time that it will have much appeal to anybody, no matter what genre of popular music you prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not high quality","review":"Not a heirloom.

It is one of the few fragrances that lasts and lasts on me. After I use it, I can still smell it on my clothes for days. I am told YD has a high concentration of essential oils and that is what makes it so long lasting.If you like sweet, complex scents, this one could be for you. I would probably classify it as a spicy floral with rose and jasmine as top notes. As the fragrance wears, the spices deepen and I think, become more pronounced until you end up with primarily sweet and spicy bottom notes.Before you buy a bottle, go to someplace like Sephora or Ulta and try it on. Live with it for at least 4 hours before you decide to buy.

While no singles were immediately released from the album, a few years later Joshua Fit The Battle / Known Only To Him and Milky White Way / Swing Down Sweet Chariot would be released. Swing Down Sweet Chariot would reach the top 10 in Italy in 1962 while Joshua Fit The Battle was a number 1 hit in Sweden in 1966.

If you are already a part of the progressive-green-libertarian movement that he looks forward to in the 2002 volume,than much of this is old hat.

They've chosen some of the best trax from the album. Then there is the absolute gem...Luis Bonfas \\"Gentle Rain\\" which George takes to new dimensions. He REALLY stretches out on this track and teaches one what improvisation and scale substitution is all about.None of his pop ballads are touched on here but the material deals with a rather obscure (pre-1976)time in Georges history i.e the Kudu Years when his playing was tempered with fire and aggression.

Despite the fact that Grant has no child, he makes one up and joins a single parents' group so he can meet women. Soon he becomes involved with a woman whose friend is suicidal and who has a son who is teased at school for being a nerd. Grant is not pleased with the fact that the boy likes to hang out at his place after school, but he doesn't have the heart to kick the boy out. Later on, the boy becomes an asset when he meets a woman with a son his age. Again he lets her think that he is a single father, but this leads to even more complications. This is a charming movie about a man who thinks that he can be an island, but who finds out differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"About a What?","review":"First of all Hugh Grant? Why?This is a film that makes absolutely no sense and has abosolutely nothing of value in it. It quite frankly put me to sleep faster than Moulon Rouge, and that didn't take long. This is what seems to be a british attempt at comedy which failed miserably. I can't handle Hugh Grant any more than I can handle watching someone vomit. And for someone to pay him to actually put him on the big screen is absoulutly absurd to me. If you seriously want to walk away from a movie being less intelligent than when it started, then watch this moive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"About A Boy is a bad movie.

Not precisely a romantic comedy, the film mixes a genuine sweetness and humanity with just the right dose of unsentimental reality to prevent it from becoming formulaic or saccharine. The cast is uniformly strong: Hoult convinces as the sweet but not traditionally cute kid, and I have always liked Toni Collette. As for Grant... I generally prefer him whenever he's playing a bit of a cad, as he does here. (Grant has always seemed a bit liberated whenever he's not stuck as the \`aw, shucks' romantic lead). By the end of the film, the characters haven't had sudden and conveniently scripted epiphanies as they might have in some lesser, more formulaic comedies, but they do seem to have evolved as human beings. Good stuff, and worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is such a great movie. Parts are very realistic and it gives you good insight into a kids childhood with being bullied and who's mom suffers from depression. But many funny and happy moments.

Those who enjoyed \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" for the father-son relationship that developed between the old man and the boy will enjoy this for many of the same reasons .... although this is more of a older/younger brother story. Hugh's character starts as a lonely self-interested bachelor hitting on single mothers desperate for attention, and ends up discovering that he too is missing something that only a more complicated human interaction can provide. Mostly a comedy, it still weaves between comedy and drama the way so many older movies use to. Never a dull moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont get tired of this ...","review":"About A Boy may not be for everyone, but it works for me. The acting, writing and directing make this one of my go-to favorites, up there with Jerry McGuire and As Good As It Gets.

Good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winning adaptation of a superb novel","review":"I had high expectations when I heard that Nick Hornby's wonderful novel \\"High Fidelity\\" was being made into a film. However, I was very disappointed that the film removed the protagonist out of London and into Chicago. The London setting was part of the charm of the book, and turned a wonderful novel with a wonderful story into a mediocre film. So it was with trepidation that I greeted the news of yet another Hornby novel, \\"About a Boy,\\" being adapted for film. I was pleasantly surprised when the film turned out to be every bit as good as the book. If you are a Hornby fan who was dissapointed with the Americanization of \\"High Fidelity\\" rest assured that this film retains it's English charm and self deprecating humour. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my opinion","review":"i'm just making my experiment with the movie i've rented i.e. just watch and turn off the sound and i find this movie's pretty boring people sit down talk talk stand up walk and talk it seems nothing's really happened and all of the roles look not so interesting so i don't have patience to watch it again...i mean formally. but all the things in it like Will's car and house and his friends' apartments, shops and the goods in them and the scenery of the city(which one is it? London?) are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugh Grant doing what he does best","review":"For those who saw Four Weddings and a Funeral this has to be Hugh Grant's redemming picture, after some of the films he has been in.Grant is back to being his usual cad self, who finds his life turned upside down, and his values questioned, after a lonely boy enters his life. Grant fits the role like a glove, and his performance along side his young costar really make this film shine.While comedic in nature, it is also a moving films as we watch these two unlikely companions challenge each other and themselves. Based on Nick Hornby's book of the same name the film sticks fairly close to the story line with a few minor changes.About A Boy is a well made, well acted film that is sure to entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky comedy with substance","review":"This movie has just moved onto my all time favorite list. The plot is unique, touching, interesting and never gets boring.While I am not a major Hugh Grant fan, I think that he is endearing, and real, in this film. As a 38 year old bachelor, it is clear that \\"island living\\" has isolated him from almost all the love and meaning that life has to offer. (Think, \\"no man is an island.\\") Through the course of the movie, he becomes entwined in the lives of others, and he finally finds that life on a (deserted) island may be a little lonely after all.The supporting cast, as in many British movies, are very real and provide depth and interest to the film. Marcus and his mother are both delightfully complex.Great characters, insightful story, no violence, no slapstick, no gratuitous sex, and plenty of quirky plot devices all contribute to make this a new favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it might be...","review":"What a pleasant surprise! I had skipped both the book and the movie last summer, but picked up the DVD on a whim. Hugh Grant (the initial attraction for me) does a terrific job portraying a single man who seems as if he's trying to convince himself that he is happy with his lonely and disconnected existence. He reluctantly becomes involved as a father figure to a 12-year-old misfit of a boy, and discovers that he has a knack for helping this kid through some troubled times (at school and at home). Even my husband, who frowned when I didn't return from the video store with \\"The Bourne Identity\\", confessed that he really enjoyed this movie. I think he (and a lot of other men) can relate to the main character's feeling that he was an \\"island\\" but is now part of an \\"island chain\\". :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"About a boy charms with wits","review":"What do you get when you pair up a worthless trust-fund scion with an ordinary boy of low self-esteem? A hilarious comedy that piercingly dissects family quirks, friendships and relationships. Hugh Grant exudes a cavalier charm as Will who finds himself gravitating to the young Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) in their pretense as father-and-son to impress on his love-interest (Rachel Weisz). Marcus, in the process of avoiding his suicidial-prone mother (Toni Collette) finds Will a surrogate daddy-figure. Their affecting screen chemistry graces the excellent adaptation and direction by Chris and Paul Weitz of American Pie fame. Punctuated with provoking dialogues edged with sarcasm and rapier wits, About A Boy is an earnest comedy of dysfunctional families, dislocated society and humanity that is cuttingly poignant and sharply observant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Fabulous Soundtrack","review":"This movie has some of the best music in it since another favorite of mine - \\"Rushmore\\" (if you haven't seen that film you're missing a treat). Hugh Grant is perfectly cast and everyone else is great also. I recommend this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugh Grant is Brilliant!","review":"This movie made me a Hugh Grant fan.

I have read a great deal of Joey's reviews and have a few things to say about them. They are short, badly written, have horrible grammer, and are of little use to interested customers. Even the things he likes he can't manage to express himself in more than 4 lines of split infinitives and incomplete sentances.Now that that is off my chest we can get to the good stuff. About A Boy is a wonderful flick and can only be appreciated by those who are willing to delve into its subplots. Hugh Grant brilliantly plays the shallow, self-absorbed playboy who befriends a socially gauche teenager at first to make himself look better in the eyes of a single mom, and later realizes that in Marcus he has found himself a friend. I really enjoyed this movie and the book is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugh Grant's finest hour.","review":"Hugh Grant is pitch perfect in his role. He's been quoted as saying it's the only movie he can watch himself in and not cringe. I've always been a fan of Hugh Grant, but was pleasantly surprised when I caught it on DVD. I've watched it again numerous times and have fallen in love it. As with any movie that withstands the test of time, repeated viewings reveal that this a much deeper movie than it purports to be upon first sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"I skipped seeing this film when it was in theaters. Though I had a bit of interest in seeing it becasue it was based on the novel by Nick Hornby, I was afraid that the dircetors of American Pie were going to screw it all up. Well, when it finally arrived on DVD i rented it, and was very glad I did, because About A Boy is a wonderful film.It is funny, moving, and Hugh Grant fits his part perfectly.On the whole, I wouldn't say it is on par with High Fidelity with John Cusak, the other film based on Hornby's work, but it is very entertaining nonetheless.Be sure to check out the soundtrack as well, performed by Badly Drawn Boy. Also check out his new album \\"Have You Fed the Fish?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming light hearted fluff","review":"3.5 stars. If this hadn't been an adapation of a novel, I would have sworn Will was written just for Hugh Grant. I don't think this film would've work with any other actor.

Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hugh Grant at his best","review":"This is the greatest showcase for Hugh Grant's talents. He really got kind of type cast in the 90s with pretty much every movie he did playing the stammering, floppy haired, nice guy. But this was a truly breakthrough role for him (along with his character in Bridget Jones' Diary). I'd kind of liken this role to John Cusack's in High Fidelity. Two guys who you shouldn't really like, that you absolutely love. I also enjoyed the supporting roles by Rachel Weisz (who's great in EVERYTHING she does) and Toni Collette and of course, Hugh's co-star Nicholas Hoult. My favorite thing about this movie, besides the movie, was the music. The entire soundtrack is from Badly Drawn Boy, and every song captures the feel and emotion of the movie. The standouts being Silent Sigh and the instrumental I Love N.Y.E., Donna and Blitzen, and Something to Talk About. So after you buy the movie, go out and buy the soundtrack as well. They're both excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the watch","review":"Story line almost made up for how bad this show was.

What happened to Marcus? I don't recall him being as half as annoying in the book, and he was annoying. None of the other people got to devlope the way they'd did in the book. In fact this whole movie seemed to be about...nothing. And Will was just a moron. Hugh Grant as a bad boy in Bridget Jones. Charming. Hugh Grant as a bad boy in this movie. Well it was just sad. And the whole singing thing? Was that meant to be funny.I was like god why won't this end. I saw this movie for free and still felt ripped off. Making a movie about a book can't be that hard can it.

About A Boy has got to be one of the worst DVD covers I have ever seen.

Isn't that normally reserved for the back?I understand that in this day and age of over-marketing, any chance you get to get someone to buy your product is more important than the integrity of the product. And that is why giant quotes and huge, uneccessary type adorns most DVD and music releases. But why can't that be placed on the back of the package or on a sticker. I don't want to look at that cover everytime I reach for the DVD to play it.

There was perhaps two points where I laughed, which is not good for a film which bills its self as a comedy and is made by the directors of comedy hits like American Pie.So over all I'd say give this one a miss and rent something else, it doesn't really matter what - its bound to be better than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Does NOT Do the Book Justice","review":"If you've read the book, I wouldn't bother to buy this.

He says to listen to others for book ideas. He hasn't a clue about modern block-busters we want to write. I have about twenty books on writing, and no good one on dialog yet.The author is indeed high in his ivory tower looking down on his ignorant students. He is a teacher, not an author.

Sure that helps. His sugestion (actually, his ONLY sugestion): take notes of other people's words. Again: sure that doesn't hurt. But written dialogue is different from everyday dialogue. Like always in art, if you want to make it real, you have to fake it. So his advice is misleading, in my opinion (gathered from my 15 years of experience as a professional writer, screenplay writer and teacher). At best, it could be a useful advice to write \\"realistic\\" dialogue; but that's just one of many different kinds of dialogue a writer needs to master. What about comedy dialogue? What about sofisticated, original, artificial dialogue? Not everybody wants to write soap operas (a point that seems missing to many of this \\"cook-book\\" authors).

It's simple, nothing is scarier or more creepy than children who kill people. The eighth film, like several of the other sequels, doesn't take place in Gatlin, and is very loosely tied to the original story. I give this movie credit for possibly being the creepiest children of the corn, and for doing it without much of the gore the other films featured. A lot of the credit goes to veteran movie actor, Billy Drago, who is just creepy by nature. There is no denying the film is creepy, but is it good? No, not really! The story is very slow at times, inconsistent, and some what predictable. Genesis had a bit more potential than some of its predecessors, but in the end, despite the creepy vibe it gives off, it's just another really bad sequel that we didn't need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Children of the Corn: Genesis","review":"Tim and Allie are taken in by a crazed preacher and his wife after their car breaks down in the desert, but the dark forces at work on this remote farm refuse to let them leave! The eighth film in the CHILDREN OF THE CORN series is a bit of a mystery, especially considering the complete lack of both children and corn. GENESIS could have been filmed under any other name and remained just as ineffective. Billy Drago is creepy enough in his own right as Preacher, but he can never take the place of the murderous Gatlin children that are only alluded to in the plot. The opening act sets up an intriguing rebirth for the series that only becomes increasingly more convoluted and confused as the film goes on, until things finally fall apart in the end. Like HELLRAISER: REVELATIONS, CHILDREN OF THE CORN: GENESIS is a failed attempt to revitalize the series, and it ranks amongst the worst of the many sequels.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"},{"rating":"2","title":"Preacher's unwed daughter in college with a child","review":"I highly recommend Dr. Nielsen's book and suggestions for anyone who wants a deeper relationship with their father.

Through her suggestions, relationship building tools, encouragement and understanding I started building the relationship that every daughter desires and needs to have with their father. With Dr. Nielsen's help I realized that if a daughter never embraces their father, his experiences, and understands his love they will never truly understand and love themselves.

The contrast is with traditional teaching, where the instructor and students are in the same classroom.

But consider the word 'communities' in the title. It means more than just a student asking questions of the instructor.

Unfortunately, he leaves out many of the most important factors that make lean manufacturing so important on the Japanese factory floor. I find it very odd that someone with no manufacturing experience would be able to critique and draw conclusions on vehicle manufacturing in Japan.

Now they have fans as diverse as Dave Grohl, Jello Biafra, Sleater Kinney, and The Hives. Turbonegro are like a punk band who is fascinated with 1970s rock music like Alice Cooper and Alex Harvey. Glam rock songs like \\"Gimme Some\\" are just mind-blowing. They seemed to have a sense of humor about a backlash, in a song like \\"Turbonegro Must Be Destroyed.\\" Rock and roll is the altar. Bodies come and go. Hank Von Helvete is one of the secret rock icons of our time. Recent shows have brought the rock to US audiences. Their theatrical show has created a fanbase overnight. They have dealt with dark themes in the past, but this record is mostly upbeat and seems totally new and modern. This is one of my favorite releases of this year.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Gay Metal Ghetto","review":"Norway's Turbonegro take the homoerotic underpinnings of heavy metal, flaunt them up front, and turn the volume up to 11. On Scandanavian Leather, they reign in their punkier tendencies for a more streamlined approach - Judas Priest, for example, if Rob Halford had come out and stayed with the band. (FYI - a reunion is in the offing.) But their metal dreams aren't limited to the gay rock ghetto. \\"Wipe It \`til It Bleeds\\" is a hard sex anthem regardless of sexual orientation. \\"Gimme Some\\" is about money. \\"Sell Your Body (to the Night)\\" a hustler's lament. \\"F**k the World (F.T.W.)\\", well, you can figure it out. They even have their own public service announcement: \\"Turbonegro Must Be Destroyed\\". Their biggest supporters (so far) are Queens of the Stone Age and Dave Grohl. Not bad recommendations at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album ruuuuuuuuuulllllllzzzzzzzzz!","review":"quick turnaround - perfect condition - if you can find me toilet boys/toilet boys, because another seller didn't mail the right one, i'm a lifelong buyer!thanks alot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Turbo I've heard, hands down","review":"I'm a Turbonegro fan ever since a friend a couple years ago sent me a tape of Apocalypse Dudes. (FYI - Rob Halford is the best Metal singer ever!) This is the 2nd album of TN that I have purchased. I must admit I have not heard any other TN albums besides this and Apocalypse, but I just want to say - yes, this was a huge departure from Apacalypse Dudes. When I first played it, I didn't know what to think. It has introduction music and it is just different in alot of ways. But it totally rocks. It is now my favorite TN album and I would highly reccomend it to anyone. I am purchasing this one, instead of Apocalypse, to give to my brother-in-law for his birthday. That is how much faith I have in this album. And while I am here, I am purchasing the other two TN albums that I do not own for myself. - Buy this with confidence.- Michele FlipsideFlipside Fanzine"},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"Turbonegro is still the best punk rock band going today, and Ass Cobra was THE punk album of the 90's. Needless to say, when I heard they had reformed, I was very excited to hear what they would do next. Unfortunately, Scandanavian Leather just falls flat. Its funny, as all TN's albums are, but what always set them apart was that they rocked, and I mean ROCKED. This album sounds more like satire, a parody of a band like Poison. Again. its funny, but if I want musical parody i'll pick up some Weird Al. Aside from two standout songs that would have fit in nicely on Apocalypse Dudes (Drenched in Blood and Turbonegro Must be Destroyed), this lackluster album does very little for me. I have high hopes for these boys, that their next album will get back on track, but for now i'll just have to keep Ass Cobra and Apocalypse Dudes in regular rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"Reads more like the story of a transvestite than a transsexual. The author was clearly rather obsessed with clothes, and much of the book revolves around the various episodes of cross-dressing. I had a real problem with the author's homophobic views (how can a man dressed in a wig and gown dismiss a gay person as \\"disgusting?\\") and his grossly distorted views of women (his idea of acting like a woman involved getting men to buy him drinks and behaving like \\"a silly little thing.\\") Add to this an affair with a married man, and it makes for an unpleasant read about a rather unpleasant personality. If you're looking for a good transsexual narrative, I highly recommend Christine Jorgensen's book, or Caroline Cossey's, over this sordid tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transsexual history lesson","review":"The author and subject of this autobiography is (was) a long lost relative of mine, so I found it fascinating.

She just can't get a good story out lately. This is not worth your time or money. I buy her books because they have her name on them and I have certain expectations because of that. Now I feel that just because it is a Lori Wick book doesn't mean it will be good. The book rambles and jumps around with too many characters. Worst of all it doesn't have an ending! Just finish it Lori!

Each of her previous books got better and better, and this one was definitely a lightweight. I had to make myself read the whole book, whereas I could not put down others of hers. She spoiled me after the Kensington Chronicles, the English Garden series, Pretense, Sophie's Heart, Bamboo & Lace, and others. I'm wondering if she might not be spending less time on her books now than before, and she's just writing to get more published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moonlight on the millpond","review":"I think this book, like another reviewer said, is written as if the author were 14 yrs. old. It seems like the book consists of the characters asking each other \\"Are you okay?\\" Not only are they immature in their faith, but in everything else as well. I thought it was hard to keep reading it. The fact that Maddie keeps worrying that Jace is going to spike her drinks to have his way with her is far out. Not Lori Wick's best book by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I love Lori Wick and can read her books over and over. However, this one left much to be desired. I still haven't picked it up to re-read it. For me, the getting drunk to the point of no memory on a little alcohol is completely rediculous. You have to drink quite a bit to get to that point, so much so that she could probably barely stand... and no one would notice this? Anyway...a good story has to be believable, and this one did not pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Try as I might, I can never seem to get into Lori Wick. I find her plotlines under-developed and completely unrealistic, the dialogue stiff and boring, and more often than not the characters aren't even likable. This is the case and even more so with \\"Moonlight on the Millpond.\\" Jace and Maddie's characters are never fully developed, and their love story was boring and abruptly changed paces. One minute she can't stand him, the next minute they're making out. Then suddenly she hates him again...and then the next morning they're married. You could hardly feel sad when Jace's uncle died because you felt as if you barely knew him. The chapters skip around to several different plotlines that remain undeveloped and unresolved by the end of the book. This book was an utter disappointment.If you want good fiction with depth, development, and great dialogue, I would recommend Francine Rivers, Karen Kingsbury, and Liz Curtis Higgs."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"I have read many of Lori Wicks books and find them all to be much of the same. This is true with this one also. Sometimes I think that Miss Wick just changes the name of the town and the characters. I also found that this book was written more toward a teenagers level. I also didn't appreciate it that the story doesn't end with this book. You will need to buy another book to find out what happens to the lead characters in this one. So I need to spend more money?? No thanks! It's not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - again!","review":"Like some of the other reviewers have said, I too became a fan of Lori Wick several years ago and have just about every book she has written. However, like the last series she wrote - this book is a huge disappointment. The characters are so shallow and just unlikeable. I tried very hard to give her the benefit of the doubt because I have loved her writing in the past, but this just doesn't cut it. If you want a great Lori Wick book - read Sophie's Heart.

This movie is the only reason I bought this set. At least Shout! put it on a single dual layered disc. But still, was hoping to see a better image of this drive-in classic. The other two films are pure filler. They, too are not very good transfers. Fly Me is from a bad print that is faded and has heavy lines all over the image (can you say grindhouse?). I feel bad giving this set such a low score, but I feel I need to pass on to the consumer what I really think. And I love The Arena and wished Shout! would have treated it better (like their other Pam Grier movies) with better transfer. I am still a fan of Shout! releasing these classics from the '70s but I can't recommend this particular purchase. I guess they all can't be winners.

This book is no exception. Ofri's willingness to learn from her patients is quite impressive, given that so many doctors in this day and age do not think anyone without an M.D. has anything to offer them. The nature of the book allows it to be read in short bursts, which is a plus -- but, alas, she writes so well that the temptation to read through the entire book in a day, ignoring things like work and family, is great.

The last two albums seemed to be filled with variety just for the variety's sake. This album's heavy songs blend well with the more folky songs later on. The only song that I did not enjoy was Jerusalem. I like political songs, but not when they are wielded with such a heavy hand, like on the song Jerusalem and most of Steve's new album. I'd pick the subtler Copperhead Road, Christmas in Washington, and Taneytown as political songs that I like better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the year","review":"It's sad that most of the the talk generated by this album has focused on the song \\"John Walker's Blues\\" -- a tune whose message has been totally misunderstood by the goofballs in the national media.

I feel that we have the duty as Americans to purchase anything that anyone wants to ban in this country. It is the exercise of that right that will keep this country what we want it to be. I found I loved the CD. Musically it was great and the lyrics actually had something to say. Being a product of the 60's I tire easily of CD's that whine over and over about lost loves, etc. There are only so many ways you can sing that one. I respect people who put their ideas into songs whether I agree with their views or not. In the current climate in this country where so many are afraid to speak out and question the party line from Washington it is good to know that someone out there had the courage to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Earle album","review":"As I sat down to listen to Jerusalem for the first time today, I wondered if Steve Earle could continue to deliver the incredible music and lyrics that have made Train A Comin', I Feel Alright, The Mountain, and Transcendental Blues such great albums.

Makes me really want to go see him perform live again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steve missed the mark on this one","review":"Never thought I'd say this about a Steve Earle album, especially lately, but when it comes to \\"Jerusalem\\"...save your money. It's long on hype and short on substance. The hype being the controversial \\"John Walker's Blues\\", about John Walker Lyndh, the American Taliban, which proved to be rather innocuous and boring, rather than the Woodie Guthrie-esque risk that it was billed as. The rest of the album isn't much better, though it picks up a little at the end. The only stand-out track, \\"The Truth\\", is an add-on from a recording session several years back, when Steve was putting together better music....I was particularly disappointed due to the fact that he had been on such a roll since he got out of prison: \\"Train A Comin'\\", \\"I Feel Alright\\", \\"El Corazon\\", \\"The Mountain\\" with the Del McCoury Band, \\"Transcendental Blues\\", and \\"Sidetracks\\" were all stellar.

But this one won't get another listen. It's not the politics (though maybe Earle should have reconsidered releasing \\"John Walker's Blues\\" now that Walker has admitted to aiding terrorism and journalists are starting to discover Walker had a hand in the ... of an American agent over there). Earle has always been a proud voice on the left. The music itself varies from dirge to cacophony, almost as if Earle thought that controversy could replace musicianship.

I have listened to his music since the late eighties. He has progressed and his style has changed but I have been fine with that he is a great story teller.

I'm certainly no conservative wag, but this parade of rhetoric made me want to pull the soapbox out from under Earles feet. It is a dissapointment, since he is a talented musician, that these strong songs are accompanied by awkward posturing instead of engaging storytelling. I don't mind John Walkers Blues, though. I think that Earle approached that song deftly, and the non-political songs are good. Go ahead and buy it if you like overt political stuff in your music.

However, \\"Jerusalem\\" does not even come close to his recent work. Instead, it is overproduced, disjointed, shallow, and depressing. He beats the listener over the head with the political stuff, but doesn't seem to be paying any attention to what really matters: the music.

If you dont, then you must be suspect.As a long time Earle fan (Early Tracks anyone?) I was totally disappointed to find that Mr. Earle felt the need to beat me with his political views for almost an hour.

There are bluesy, dowtrodden, blue-collar politics in a lot of Earl's lyrics -- the politics of the little man, the outsider -- but some of the lyrics on \\"Jerusalem\\" go much further and are actually painfull to listen to.The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as some things here at home have brought out cynicism and venomous politics in some, and Steve takes that to extremes on this CD. It's a wrong turn for him, but he's taken wrong turns before and gotten back on track again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotional and Provocative !!!","review":"... Steve Earle has a gift (through words and his music) to tug at the emmotions within our communities and promote healthy debate on our most critical issues, he stirs up these thoughts and exhibits a genuine concern for the path his country is taking and it's sometimes questionable motivations, We always need to ask these things, above all I consider that as being democratic."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"Was a little skeptical with the whole magnet scene but for the price I'd thought I give it a try.

Jeez. It was an alright book. Basically it was about a woman who was trying to succeed in a company partnered with two men who had very strong opinions about authority. She ends up meeting a one-time hit rap artist who is interested in her. In the mean time, she has an unattentive fiancee and another ex-fiancee that she hasn't quite gotten over. Three men circle her love life in different ways and her mother may have cancer too. When it rains, it pours. The rap artist was an interesting guy, and I was more interested in him and his history with her two male co-workers than I was with her. She spent too much time crying and cheating for me. After awhile, I was just bored with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"would i lie to you","review":"This book was great!

It's a fundamental musical truth that when you have no dynamic range, even the most balls out playing becomes dull. Add to that fact that the rhythmic figures are so simple (nearly everything is in 4/4, the accents are all on the beat, and the phrasing is dictated by the beginnings and ends of measures) and you simply have highly repetitive, boring music. This is true for nearly all death metal, and it begs the question: why do extremely fast players who are capable of doing very complex things write such boring, straightahead rhythms?There is nothing sophisticated going on here, there is nothing musical going on either. It's a flat out bore that makes the listener believe these musicians must have the intellect of a caveman if they actually enjoy playing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"when I heard this album open up... and heard what seemed to be a bit of Von Kulten Usspruchelin from their previous album- Annihilation of...- I knew this was going to be good. Basically... I think we're looking at Annihilation part 2... because this sounds very much like their predecessor... but who's to complain? It's excellent... just excellent stuff. And as always, Nile gives you your money's worth by clocking in a few epic tracks to keep your earhole satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!","review":"Ithyphallic is by far the album of 2007 so far...The production, finally is top notch for a Nile release. The songs all blend in great, Karl shows why he is one of Metal's best musicians out there..what about the amazing solo to end the album..Impressive"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nile Keeps Raising the Bar in the Genre of Death Metal","review":"Clearly with this release Nile have yet raised the bar again in the genre of Death Metal.When I first picked this album up it did take a few listens through to really absorb all that's going on in the songs and to get a feel for the album.The production is great as you can clearly hear the drums and the dual guitar work going on. I think the vocals are also a bit more clearer than they have been on previous albums.The technical guitar work and drumming is rather astounding and is performed in top form. Fret-less guitars are used on a few tracks which sounds truly amazing and different.I highly recommend this to any fan of Nile or any fan of brutal Death Metal. Hands down something you don't want to miss out on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This bra is terribly uncomfortable. The elastic band at the bottom rolls up and digs into your skin. It requires 2 hands to get it snapped after you are finished nursing, which is next to impossible when you're holding a baby. I use this bra as my last resort if my other 2 are unavailable (i.e. they got spit up on or milk leaked on them). I got the other 2 at Wal-Mart for $10 each and I love them! They are very comfortable. This bra was $35 and I can't stand it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book on non-j2ee java.","review":"I have read over a dozen books on the java and this by far the best one for learning the language in its entirety. Obviously, this book can't cover everything but it gives a very thorough and in-depth introduction. If you can only have one book on java 2, make this the one you pick. Many other books on the subject waste tons of space with simple examples that aren't very informative. This book cuts through the nonsense and gives you all it can in its 700 pages. Great explanations, Great Code Samples, all around top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you more than you hoped for","review":"I always get suspicious when people are throwing five stars at a book. But frankly - I find no reason to remove any stars. I bought it after deciding to take the Java 2 programmer certification and after having read readers reviews on several study guids. I was not dissapointed!Even though I had read a couple of Java 1.1 books like \\"Teach yourself...\\" and \\"Mastering Java 1.1\\" I'm glad I got this one. It was richer in detail (filled in a couple of holes), well structured making it easy for me to work through it. The exercises with answers were very helpful for me and some of them where in fact a lot more difficult than those given on the actual exam. ( I passed. ) I found it very satisfying and motivating!You still have to sweat unless you are a hot shot Java veteran but this book is much more than just a dry exam-cram!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book got it all.","review":"What an excellent book. So far three book available in the market for Java programmer certification. But this is really cool. At the end of each chapter, the questions are very tricky and, it gives you good concepts of each topic covered. Compared to other exam preparation book, this book gives you in-depth knowledge for each concept in Java. This book not only prepares and focuses you for the exam but also helps you to learn details of Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"high standards. thanks Mughal and Rasmussen!","review":"I got 84% alas... aimed for 90 :( However let me critique this book:I bought this book blindly - just by reading the other rave reviews here, and I was not disappointed. I cannot praise this book enough. It really does help you master Java without reading lots of fluff and wasting time. The authors have very high standards, which is why I predict you will find it becoming a classic (like K&R).Do not buy any other book. However, you need to additionally do online mock exams - again, there are too many substandard ones. The good ones are - this book's exam, JExam, Applied Reasoning, Bill Brogden, Absolute Java, Jaworski, Java Ranch Roundup. (Simply go to a search engine to find them on the internet)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive amount of detail","review":"This has to be one of the better certification guides available.

Both strongly encouraged getting the book as preperation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly the best","review":"I am a student of one of the authors of the book. The style is dry and uninteresting. His descriptions are confusing and repetitive. And he has an obsession with \\"class Light\\" and all of its friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For The Certification And Beyond","review":"Simply put, this is an awesome technical book on the Java programming language that is useful for the certification exam and for any Java programmer. I own at least a dozen java books and this is the best of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book For Exam Preparation","review":"I am taking this opportunity to express my thoughts concerning this Java certification book. After reading the book in little over three weeks, working the review questions and taking the practice exam via the mock exam engine, I passed the Sun Certified Programmers exam for Java2 Platform with a score of 84%. I chose the book primarily based on the excellent reviews presented here.Admittedly, I did not want to read several books on the subject but instead preferred to complete one comprehensive book, then take the exam. This book is a thorough and extensive work covering the necessary material you will need to pass the exam. As pointed out in other reviews, the questions in the book are more difficult than that presented in the actual exam. The latter is certainly a safe means of preparation.I highly recommend the work as a source for programmers desiring to succeed on the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll need more than this book to pass....","review":"For starters the questions in the book are NOT like those you will encounter on the exam, so don't think your doing yourself an immense favor by focusing on them. The book gives you a smattering of the \\"general idea\\" in a lot of cases and few actual use cases to work with/figure out. Important points are listed, but are not fully covered in the questions not to mention that the book concentrates very heavilly on topics that are NOT TO BE FOUND ON THE EXAM! Forget about applets, graphics, and swing (ie chapters 15, 16, and 17). It would be nice if they had concentrated more on java.lang.* garbage collection, and dedicated twice the space to threads and what happens with them.Make this your only source and you will fail the exam, period."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only book for your getting the certification","review":"I got my certification after I spent two months to read this book. Now I am using this book as java dictionary for my java project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the java2 exam","review":"This book along with Bill Brogan's java2 exam cram is more than adequate to pass the java2 exam. Coverage of Threads on the exam was more than the material presented. The questions and answers on all topics covered in the book are insightful & deligtful. In all an excellent resource for passing the java2 certification exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ideal certification book","review":"This books takes through the language very neatly and clearly. An ideal book for anyone who wants to learn Java and also complements by preparing one for the Java Certification.The review questions are pretty challenging. The mock exam included as part of the book is also a useful preparation guide for the exam. I have no hesitations in recommending this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass Sun Certified Java Programmer","review":"I am an international student from Taiwan with Bachelor of Business Administration and now taking MS in CIS in Baruch College. After I spent one month and three weeks reading the book twice (only this book), I passed SCJP with 88% score recently. I think this book is very excellent.

Hope you pass it with this book as easiliy as I."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Splendid book for SCJP2","review":"The Book is really Useful. The topics covered by the book are really comprehensive. All the topics are really explained well. Topics including Inner Classes,Object Lifetime,Intializer Sequence, Inheritance,Operators,java.lang,java.util,java.awt,java.io all are covered comprehensively. I appreciate the way in which authors have described each and every topic,really good. I read the book for around 40 days and gave the exam in 3rd week of Jan and got certified with 93 %.All the topics are really very good. Thanks to the authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna certify?, Get it now ...","review":"This book proved to be really great. My advice to any fellow who wants to get the programmer certificate, read this book, carefully. Then to get a focused view to the exam, go quickly through \\"The Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide\\". Solve a few exams, and then you're ready!I did the exact same thing and, thanks God, I got 96%.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old professorial approach","review":"Someday I will find out why the impenetrable \\"you will understand what I'm saying only if you already understand what I'm saying\\" approach to technical books is so widespread when it's so ineffective. This book makes you struggle to figure out what the authors are talking about, and by the time you finish, it's time for bed and you haven't learned anything yet.Having discarded this book, I've just started looking at the red and blue Osborne Certification Press book by Sierra and Bates. I like it a lot better than Mughal, it's more like normal humans talking, and the explanations are better and quicker to grasp."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you seriously read this book , you will pass the exam","review":"This books covers everything you need for passing Sun Certified Java Programmers Exam.The Explanations are so clear that even a person with no previous programming experience can easily understand the complications of the Java language .Very difficult topics like inner classes, Threads, I/O are explained in a very understandable and intresting way.That book will, for sure increase your interest in the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Garbage","review":"Takes basic concepts and with fuzzy explinations and incomprehensibly difficult examples makes the subject completely confusing. Chapter 4 on Arrays is a prefect example of the author's incompetence. How do you go from explain comcept to absurdly difficult trick question? Need more in between examples. Avoid this useless book. I paid $7.00 and I got ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Original Work","review":"The content is accurate, but so much of this book seems to be taken, with superficial changes, from the Roberts/Heller/Ernest book. A lot of the chapter titles are identical, and the organization by objective is nearly the same. The content is often very close, just presented in a different order. Some diagrams are almost straight-ahead copies. If I pay good money for a book, I want original work, not a copy of something someone else wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Helpful for certification","review":"I found this book to be a very useful resource for the Certification. The questions and mock exam were closer in quality and difficulty to the actual exam compared to other mock exams. I found quite a few other mock exams on the web to be misleading about how difficult the exam would be and also about what type of questions would be asked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, but maybe more than enough","review":"This book covers all the areas and concepts u need to know to pass the exam. If you really go through the book and try the questions, the exam is not a problem for u. (the questions in this book are more difficult than those in real exam) However, seems to me that this book is just trying to present all the facts, possiblities and combinations of java, without proper explanation or any indication on whether the concepts is required or it is just for reference. Using this book to prepare the exam requires you to memorise lots of facts and rules, in which quite a lot of them are not necessary. It is because, many of them can be deduced once u know the main principles, or just because they are not included in the exam objectives. In conclusion, the concepts discussed in this book are more that the exam required, and one may take quite a lot of time to digest them all. ( it is good for java programmer anyway =) )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Thorough","review":"This book was extremely thorough in its preparation for the Certification Exam. I found it better on several topics (Threads, Collections) than several other books I read. The practice questions and sample exams were much more difficult (and therefore helpful) than others as well. Even now that I have become Certified, I keep this book around as a reference for some of the tricky language and API features. Definitely worth it, although I would supplement it with some of the good web sites and possible another book as well (I also read the Sybex one)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book to learn java if you already have programming exp","review":"I found this book to be very good for someone who already has programming experience to learn the java language. It has plenty of examples and exercises. This book will also help in the future as a reference since it contains a lot of detailed information. As far as certification goes, use this book to LEARN java and then use the Complete Java 2 Certification Guide to PASS the exam. (i.e., I'd recommend buying both books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading, tricky, hard to learn","review":"I found it scholastic and dogmatic in the bad sense; the examples are forced out and do not make (much) sensible sense, they are there just to confuse you more.

Roy Roger's has always been a role model for young children, clean, honest and his films were decent viewing for the entire family. His kind of clean type image in the movies will be greatly missed. As now most of what Hollywood puts out are R-rated. Is it because our mature Producers and Directors are replaced by Kids?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfy for baby","review":"We needed a highchair for our 5 month old son. He has some special needs that includ extra support and stabilty, as well as the ability to recline in the chair. We went to a local store and played with their chairs for a while. We found the Combi easier to manipulate than the other brands in the store, as well as more sturdy. It's a very stylish chair also. My son is in the upper percentile in weight and growth and this chair only goes to 40 lbs, but we figured down the line we would probably get a different toddler-friendly chair for him to sit in.The only really strong negative I have about this chair are the toys. There were no batteries in the samples at the store, but when added, the music that plays or \\"croaks\\" is pretty awful. My little one still enjoys pushing buttons and rolling things, but the three \\"play\\" elements were very annoying for adults. But since the point of the chair was for feeding, we figured we'd have limited exposure to the toy sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"We have been very happy with this high chair. My son is 6 months old and not only does he like it but its also elegant looking and it folds up easily for storage.Wheels on the bottom allow me to bring it from room to room easily and the reclining seat allows my son to eat his solids and then lay back to drink his bottle afterwards.I give this high chair 5 stars! The only negative thing I can think of is that the chair is very heavy, but since it has wheels it makes no difference to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Highchair","review":"I recently purchased the Combi Breeze Highchair Carribbean. Assembly wasn't so difficult, a little confusing though when atttching the legs of the highchair. I find that the buckle is very difficult to open. When the toy is not in the tray, it is difficult to clean out the food that gets into the slots that hold the toy. The brakes are difficult to adjust with my foot because the levers feel a bit flimsy. I really thought the chair would be a better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be called \\"How I Got on the Sally Show\\"...","review":"..because that's really all it's about. The abuse, while unforgiveable, didn't make this book any more readable. For all the beatings, no one ever ended up in the hospital. I've read much more serious cases of abuse in books. The author seemed more intent on \\"telling on\\" his dad and bragging about getting onto a talk show than he did with actually telling his story. Where's the closure? You get the feeling he's still battling his demons. And what's going on with his parents these days? What's his relationship with his dad like now? You won't find answers here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is a Joke!","review":"Personally knowing the author, Wayne Theodore, I can tell you that this book is a joke. He is not a survivor but still an abuser to all that come in contact with him, even to his own children. This book was written as another one of his get rich quick schemes. I think that it is discusting that this book is being used in schools for kids when Wayne himself, as he portrays himself, is nothing but an abuser.I urge anyone thinking of purchasing this book to do their research on this man to find out the truth themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read!","review":"One of the most compelling and inspirational stories I've ever read. As a child, Wayne Theodore faced the worst kind of emotional and physical abuse at the hands of his father and mother, but he was able to find the strength and courage to survive against all odds. You'll feel like you know Wayne personally when you're finished reading the book, and his story will convince you of the incredible power of the human spirit. This is a must-read for anyone who cares about children or who has faced childhood demons of their own. You'll be thinking about Wayne and his remarkable story long after you've read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great controller and still is!","review":"first of all, the controller is a great design with the rubberized grips. I had a great experience playing with this controller and i love it. it never made a game crash and it was always dependable. the 2 analog sticks were very responsive. The 5 foot retractable game cord was a breeze to use but the only thing wrong with it (which it tells you ont the controller itself) was that if you were to extend or retract the cord during game play then the computer would not recognize a controller anymore and you would have to plug it back in.

It works good as long as you are not buying it for the auto-fire and don't change the cord length while using it. I have had a problem with its buttons always sticking in the down position. I think this may be because my hands sweat alot. If you had a choice between this controller and another, I would seriously consider the other controller first.

But it also has a lot going against it; the worst of which is it's turbo-fire feature. The turbo function is woefully inept - it doesn't repeat nearly fast enough. It's almost as if the turbo fire only repeats intermittently. This game pad is totally unacceptable for games on your PC requiring keeping your finger on the button using auto-fire.Other problems include your PC forgetting the pad's plugged in whenever you retract or extend the cable. That shouldn't have anything to do with the controller's connection! Also, the digital thumb pad feels cheap...a common problem with game controllers.I know there's a drought of dependable PC game pads with turbo fire, but purchasing this one for it's auto-fire merits would be a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I use this controller for the various emulators I have on my computer and I've yet to find a better controller!

The smallest dink with the spoon and the glass is cracked.You need to be a surgeon when washing these, the slightest bump, cracked.So unless you have a maid you can blame for breaking these, and take it out of their pay, don't waste your money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all they're cracked up to be","review":"A wonderful concept that needs more work.

The only ones left intact are the coffee mugs. ALL of them cracked around the rim after being washed in the dishwasher... hell, even the mugs cracked around the rim, but they have remained functional and so I still use those two. Not a single one was dropped or mishandled. I was pissed as it is so obviously a flaw in the glass when they all crack around the rim, however Bodum will not warranty glass products as there is apparently \\"No way to tell how it was broken\\". I think its pretty obvious how it was broken when there is no spiderwebbing of the glass or any cracks at all aside from directly around the rim. If you get these glasses, I would warn against ever putting them in the dishwasher. Also, I dont find they kept my beverages any hotter or colder, but the lack of condensation is pretty nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glass for a (fill in your drink) on the rocks","review":"These double walled glasses are awesome for an evening drink, the ice seems to last a little longer than just a regular glass, but it might just be me trying to excuse paying for these glasses.

So now I'm trying to decide whether to buy two more. Tea just wasn't the same this morning, but it's pretty expensive to keep replacing them.12-30 I decided to buy more and it was the right decision.

There is a very small hole on the bottom of every glass, left over from the glass blowing process I presume. Water seeps *INTO* the glasses through this hole and fills the inside of the glass with dirty dishwater--not a good look. I've washed them by hand and ran them through the dishwasher, problem persists. Not only is it gross, but since the hole is on the bottom, when you set the glasses down they slowly leak! I found this out AFTER one had been placed on the wooden shelf of my bar.

This must be a new 'feature' as none of the pictures ive seen have the plugs either. Also, the silicone seal/glue they used was done very sloppily as well..excess is streaked on the bottom of the glass. Such a bummer :( I'm assuming functionality is still the same, but id say at least 50% of the appeal of these cups is the appearance, and the silicone gaskets definitely ruin it for me.Anyone else experience this with recent orders or did I get an odd set?

They offer a very pretty presentation for your espresso, especially when your favorite beverage is properly made and the crema is prominent. Why not 5-stars? They don't FEEL like espresso cups to me.

They will keep a cup of coffee warm for an amazingly long time, without getting uncomfortably warm to the touch.Still, there are two caveats: First, you can get a drink that's much hotter than you expect when you actually take a sip, and second, they are fairly fragile, thin glass. We've gone through several sets due to breakage from fairly mild handling - putting down too quickly on a tile counter for example.If you love coffee and like to take your time drinking it, I'd recommend them, even with those caveats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great glasses, lousy shipping","review":"I like these glasses so much that I wanted to send some to my sister in Colorado.

I requested better packing or an alternative shipper (the first was UPS). The second set arrived via USPS with two of the glasses again is shards. Amazon told my sister this was a common problem, and they could not resend a 3rd time. They did send her a gift certificate, which she appreciated as in lieu of my gift. Nonetheless, I am very disappointed that Amazon cannot figure out how to have these packed properly for shipment. Though the product itself is very nice, I am compelled to report that the packaging is inadequate, so you are taking your chances if ordering. In other words, you may wind up having to go through the hassle of calling for replacements or refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good design, easy on delicate fingers","review":"We own several Bodum double wall products and they all have the same pros and cons. The design looks great, especially with colored liquids, i.e. beer, wine, cola, you name it. The \\"floating liquid\\" appearance has brought compliments from friends and coworkers. The cups are easy to clean, needing nothing more than warm soapy water and a sponge. The cups are not as fragile as you might think, regular handling will not randomly cause them to crack. However, they are more fragile than regular mugs due to the thin glass. I've accidently dropped a spatula on one and the cup shattered, so you do need to be careful when handling these cups.We have had issues with how these cups are shipped and several times when the cups arrive, we find that they were literally shattered into hundreds of shards of thin glass. Be careful when opening the package, you should probably shake it first to see if there are any broken glass inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product until I dropped them","review":"I'm clumsy.

As you pull a shot, you can see exactly when the crema begins, color shifts during the duration of the pull, and whether it stops. Whenever I work with new beans, I pull my first few shots into these glasses so that I can dial in. More than just beautiful glasses, these are an extremely useful tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"These cups are made of extremely thin glass and are as fragile as they appear. Within several days of use, one broke from an accident that a normal glass cup would have survived. Ultimately, this defeats the point of owning the cups in the first place. The main reason in buying these is to have the aesthetics of a glass cup without the tendency to break from thermal stress (as normal glasses are wont to do). If the glasses are this fragile, they AREN'T EVEN WORTH BUYING. They're pretty, but just not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bodum 12 oz great gift","review":"great item, like that it can be used for cold or hot.

My Australian friend had one break when she used a metal spoon in it, she contacted Bodum and they replaced the glass for free, so...Bodum also has great customer service (granted, I don't know if anyone else has had a glass replaced for free, but if you are careful and your glass still breaks, it could be worth calling the manufacturer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"these are great","review":"They are double-wall, which means 1) they are more sturdy, and 2) they do not get as hot when filled with fresh from the machine espresso.

They were previously a single piece of glass without any holes, and thus with a perfect barrier to create an insulating air barrier inside. Now they have a small hole on the bottom filled with a clear-ish rubber plug that pretty quickly allows moisture in so that you get internal condensation.

All of this from a glass that claims to be just as strong as regular glass even though it's signficantly thinner. While I was a believer, my painful finger has made me a skeptic.

These are super light, which does cause them to wobble slightly on my Nespresso machine when the coffee is being poured. These do keep coffee hot for way longer than my regular demi-tasses. Finally, it is quite pleasant to be able to see the actual espresso's deep color and rich foam from all angles.

After a career as an artist/professor I enjoy using aesthetically pleasing objects day to day (I could never afford a Ferrari, but I admire them). I can afford these glasses and I must say they work very well! Liquid temps are maintained longer and they feel good to hold. I'm buying several more variations and a carafe soon. For those who can't bear to expend a little extra care in cleaning and caring for them, stick to your Chevys."},{"rating":"1","title":"espresso glass","review":"While the concept sounds interesting, in reality, this \\"thermo glass\\" is completely frivolous. An espresso is served cool enough to drink right away so you don't need double walled glass to protect your fingers.

Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 0z.: beautiful but fatally flawed","review":"First, these are objects of beauty, in form and function, Those of you who appreciate fine objects will understand as soon as you see them and pick them up. The glass is smooth, light, and airy--and unfortunately very delicate. The narrow base combined with the light weight in this design leads to tipping over and breaking. Unsafe for any household, regrettably! Maybe the smaller sizes and/or wider base designs would work. A real pity, but this is one case where the designer did not work with the engineer ;-(I have reported these to the Consumer products safety commission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and temperature retentive","review":"Very attractive and novel glasses in this Bodum Pavina line, which keep hot hot and cold cold, while leaving one's hands at room temperature.

The positives to me are 1) double insulation keeps expresso hot while I am frothing up the milk and 2) they are a sexy and classic design. My only problem has been that when the expresso machine is vibrating as it dispenses expresso, the glasses tend to vibrate as well. They often move from directly under the dispenser. I have had to hold them in place for much of the 30-seconds it takes to produce the expresso. Also, due to their shape, with the base being rather small compared to the sides, a few have slipped out of my grasp resulting in a broken glass and expresso to clean up. I am ordering another pair as I broke my second glass in the past 12-months this morning. I'll try to be more careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool design & keep hot drinks hot!","review":"We've had these in the 2 oz., 9 oz., and 12 oz, sizes for a couple months and they are used daily.

Not certain if they are to go in the dishwasher but about half the time we put them there. I would have given them 5 stars if it were made in the US or UK, not China; I failed to notice that they are made in China and mistakenly assumed they were made in the UK since they've won so many awards there.

Over time and many washings, this came off. Now, there is water inside the double wall:(. Looks ugly. I don't understand this. It can't save all that much to just seal it right.

They were our absolute favorite glasses. We washed them carefully but eventually they did break because we used them daily. I purchased 6 more when the last of the originals finally broke, and noticed that they have a silicone plug in the base now which makes them stand up to the temp changes of the dishwasher soooo much better. We now wash them with all our other dishes and have only lost 1 (but how can you really blame Bodum, any cup would break if you drop it from counter height). I find them to be rather tough considering how fragile they look. I don't expect them to hold up to children, but we use them daily and they suit our needs perfectly.I would say that we break these about as often as we break any other dish in our cabinet (which is not very often considering their use). I plan on buying more for myself and give they as gifts often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and Fragile","review":"I purchased the whole range of sizes of the glasses, plus a pitcher and teapot. After one and a half years, most are broken despite careful handling. The smaller sizes, 2oz and 9 oz have stood up better, but almost all of the larger sizes, the pitcher and the teapot are gone. Some broke in the dishwasher without any impact whatsoever, a couple broke from dropping an ice cube in, some from an accidental tap against a plate or another glass.It's a beautiful product and works well at insulating, but they need to switch to a tougher glass formulation.

I was very careful to place the ice in each glass and proceed to pour water into them. Two of my Bodum Pavina were shattered at the bottom.

Upon inspection, one of the glasses was tilted and not flat at the top. Upon comparing, the base of the inner wall sits lower than the other!!Paying as much as you do for 2 glasses, you'd expect that the Quality coming from Bodum should be better...

I use them for expresso which is by far the best expresso cup I have ever used. They stay warm for a very long time which is important if you are a slow sipper like me.The one draw back is that sometimes water gets in between the two layers through the vent hold on the bottom between the two layers. I guess they need the vent hole during the manufacturing process to they don't explode. But eventually after you wash them enough times in the dishwasher they get water inside and then that dries out and leaves water spots. Not the end of the world.

The liquid inside seem to float, which makes for a very attractive presentation. I also love that they are so versatile -- they can be used for both hot and cold liquids, and can go into the fridge and microwave.But I do have concerns about the failure rate of the little plastic valve on the bottom of each glass. The valve regulates the pressure between the two layers of glass.I ordered 4 sets [a total of 8 glasses]. The first time the glasses were washed, the valve on one of the glasses allowed water to get trapped between the layers of glass. Amazon immediately sent a replacement set, but I encountered the same issue with one glass in the set as well -- water got trapped between the glass layers during first washing. So, out of a total of 10 glasses, 20% failed the first time they were washed.Bottom line -- as much as I like the concept and the looks, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll have no more problems with leakage."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke first use","review":"Dang, I thought the pressure valve would actually do something.

My suggestion is to look for the glasses in a store and carefully bring them home yourself. I have another and older set, and one of them broke just by placing an ice cube in the glass. So ice cubes have to be gently placed by hand (or tongs) in the bottom of the glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glassware","review":"These glasses are truly unique. Very good quality.

It is so much fun to catch the color of the wine and not disturb its temperature due to the double walled construction. The beauty of the wine seems to just float in space and if you just fill the glass half full there is room for the nose of the drink to develop. Also, they are a lot of fun with the morning cup of joe. All of my guests comment on them and say they would \\"like to get some of those glasses\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, cheap, cheap","review":"I bought 4 sets of Bodum glasses -- several different sizes.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"There is a hole in both glasses - intentional or not - it is there, as others have mentioned. Small enough to let any liquid in, but not to let the liquid out easily. Try as hard as you might, liquid will get in and remain, either as a liquid, a stain, or a water mark. If you plan to use these with guests, you better hope your quests don't mind drinking out of filthy looking glasses.But, they do look OK when they first come out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thing there is a set of 2 . . . .","review":". . . . because I managed to fumble the box which slightly bumped the 1st glass. I watched it slide off the counter and land on the linoleum in a spray of small glass shards everywhere before the 2nd glass was even unwrapped. These glasses are very lightweight and fragile so be careful. Other than that, I love using the remaining glass. No more burned fingers and it is wide enough at the top to collect both shots of espresso."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just don't break them!","review":"Ever since I got my first set of Bodum coffee glasses, I have slowly been replacing my glassware with Bodum. Besides being unique looking they do an amazing job at keeping your drinks warm or cold and insulating your hand from the internal temperature of the glass. However, do not by these if you have children. When these glasses break they explode into tiny fragments that you will spend hours sucking out of every crevice, nook or cranny in kitchen or other room that the incident took place in. That said these larger glasses make fantastic coffee mugs, beer steins or tea glasses and will immediately astound everyone that picks one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"expresso cups","review":"great little shot glasses, the double wall prevents the cup from getting hot and I love that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodum Glasses NO GOOD","review":"I purchase a 8 complete sets of these Glasses ...

I had been eyeing them for so long to use in my Keurig mini brewer. When I received them they were so light and I loved the \\"modern\\" design. Right away the glasses were too light to use in my brewer so I was freaking out. Then I put a plate under the glass to use it. I figured ok dissapointed but no biggie. I was hand washing them. With a sponge. I used hot/ cold as it says you could. One day the glass just cracked on the bottom on it's own as the other reviewer had wrote. So I am super dissapointed. I also have cheap ikea glasses that have lasted years without any cracks so what's the point in paying more ?? I will try and contact the company to see if they'd replace... I hope so..

My friends and family love them when ever they come over for coffee, they always fight to use these glasses"},{"rating":"1","title":"Functions well but some quality problems","review":"Even though this product works great, the edge can break or crack easily. The edge is where the glass doubles back to create the space between the two walls. When you have any liquids in the cup, all that weight is being cantilevered from the outer wall to the inner wall, i.e. suspended. So, if you happen to bump or shake the cup while it is full, that puts a lot of stress on that edge. I've had 1 cup chip. I also bought the water jug but that one just broke when I bumped it against the sink after filling it. Yea, the worst possible scenario. So, if you are willing to pay for the great looks and functionality buy this but do expect that they won't last as other cups that cost less.The double wall really does insulate the contents, hot or cold. So, your contents last longer and your hand does not get hot or cold. Great for ice cream and tea. Their tea pot is also very good. I haven't broken that one......yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double walled glasses","review":"I like the glasses very much. We have been using double walled plastic glasses for years because they keep drinks cold and don't sweat. These glasses are not quite as effective in preventing all sweating, but they are much better looking, comfortable to hold and, unlike plactic glasses, are dishwasher safe.

Was a little concerned about the strength of the double-walled glass, but they seem good so far, though they are so light you almost throw them when picking them up at first.Great insulating quality...don't even need a coaster. They also seem to do better than traditional mugs as far as how long the liquid stays warm.Coming from the perspective of an industrial design student, the appeal of actually seeing the liquid though the glass in the rounded interior is very pleasing, especially with a frothy cappuccino. The balance of holding the cup is interesting since there is very little mass per volume-- the liquid sloshes around very well. Also cradles in the hand well with good grip to the glass.Nice product. I plan on eventually getting more of Bodum's double-walled vessels."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool cups","review":"I really like these glasses. They are mouth blown, so each one is a touch unique.

On the positive side - it's great to use one set of glasses for both hot and cold drinks. Also, it's nice that you don't need a coaster because the glasses don't sweat. They also look nice.The negative is a big one. These glasses are VERY fragile. We have a new, high-end dishwasher. We wash these glasses in the upper rack right next to our crystal wine glasses. Not one of the crystal glasses has broken but we've had several of the Bodums break. We don't have kids and we're pretty careful with our things. These just break in the dishwasher. We wrote to Bodum twice to ask if they guarantee their \\"tough\\" glasses that they advertise as durable and dishwasher safe, but no answer.

I didn't realize all hand-crank sifters are NOT created equal. The first time I used this one I could hardly get it to work because the sifter \\"wires\\" were not securely anchored into the side of the sifter opposite the handle. I tried to fix it myself, but it still turned really hard against a load of flour. So, I got out my old small sifter to see what was different, and if possible, what brand it was. First, I discovered that instead of 2 sifter wires like Mrs Anderson's has, my old one has 4 wires, which allows it to operate more smoothly and move through the dry ingredients and actually mix them. (Isn't that the purpose of sifting, anyway?) And the brand?....imprinted on the side of the sifter...Jacob Bromwell's. I have since ordered a 5 cup Jacob Bromwell's sifter directly from their company. It works like a dream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy - Works Poorly","review":"If you are a serious baker, this will not do. The construction of the body of the sifter is fine.

I would not recommend this sifter, even on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing But Disappointment!","review":"I was excited to purchase this sifter because my squeeze handled one was becoming difficult for my hands. So I put 2 cups of flour in and cranked. I made it through 1 and 1/2 revolutions before it became stuck! From then on I had to pull and struggle to get it to go completely around and in the mean time the flour was being thrust all over the place.

It's the simple things you can't find in stores anymore!!! I needed a replacement as my previous unit broke several years ago.

I would then have to push the crank from a spot on the lever closer to the side of the sifter just to get it to turn. On top of that, the flour kept coming out of the holes in the side of the sifter. I ended up just holding it in my right hand while smacking the side with my left hand. I could do that with a strainer, so what's the point?

Although it's a 5-cup sifter, don't even try to put that much in it at one time. The weight of the flour is too much for the wire turner inside to handle.

Turning the crank isn't a smooth, fluid, motion, like I was hoping for. It has only two wires and one popped out of place while I was sifting. Although it can hold 5 cups of flour at once, you can't sift that much at once because the crank mechanism isn't strong enough. It can reasonably sift maybe 2 cups of flour at once without popping the rotating wires out of place. My advice is to order a larger sifter than you think you will need.I used a friend's sifter recently that great - strong, sturdy, and efficient with a solid body and multiple, turning wires which made the sifting process quick and easy.

I wonder if I could purchase a fine mesh screen to insert into this one instead of throwing it out or having to find another replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully simple","review":"Sturdy construction for the home user. Somewhat coarse screen, so it sifts FAST; I actually wish it were a bit slower for applications like dusting a counter for a pizza crust.

When I called back, I was told that the two gears that were broken in my unit were not available for purchase (since they never break, duh).

William Souder wasted his time writing this book, and my time reading this book.This book is 304 pages of the exact same thing. The only way that this book could be classified as \\"Horrifying\\" is for the fact that it was actually written and published.

At the time I took them merely becaues I thought they were fantastic and would be a good story to read, and you know what, I wasn't wrong. Now, today, this series of novels is considered a collectors item, and I could not be happier to know that, because these really are great books, and a great bedtime story to read on those long rainy, dark nights when you are curled up under your blankets and really enjoy a good fairy tale read of two ghost twins who solve mystery after mystery along with their faithful canine companion. I recommend this book for anyone with kids or who is a kid at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging life questions are made approachable","review":"Wow! This book challenges us all to use our big minds to chew on the thought-provoking topics contained. Thank goodness for chapters! Each one is worthy of stimulating conversations- and the meaty discussion questions that are offered are a great place to begin.This is a read-out-loud type of book, one to be marked up and ruminated upon. The implications for teaching critical thinking skills for children are staggering. Adults, be prepared for mind-stretching responses from the little big minds. For children and adults alike, we need this book. The potential for lively dialogue amongst people of all ages abounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"About time...","review":"It's finally here. A book which celebrates and embraces - in plain, uncluttered language - the greatest thinkers of all time; our children. A wonderfully thoughtful guide (rife with teaching tips for those who may wonder, \\"how?\\") this book goes to the heart of philosophy and gives us the gift of possibility by illuminating that which can be a little daunting - examining the Big Ideas with our kids. Little Big Minds is an invaluable resource on more levels than can be enumerated here, but as a teacher and a parent I can say without reserve that if what we're after is a tolerant and peaceful world, Little Big Minds is a must-read. So read it, then teach it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be good for classroom setting with 3rd graders","review":"Oh, how I hate to be the one to criticize a fellow professor! But, even as a literature/philosopher professor myself, I would have trouble implementing the ideas in the the book. I also question using the particular works/poems she chose to explain the philosophical concepts. I have no doubt that she does a terrific job in the classroom, but I'm less sure about how easily that expertise can be translated in a book like this. Although she says that the approach is good for a wide range of ages, I doubt much of the literature she selects would be accessible for kindergartners-- the vocabulary is just too sophisticated. This book just did not live up to my expectations...."},{"rating":"1","title":"More what to teach -- less how to teach","review":"I bought this book to learn more about what my 8-year-old grandson was capable of learning about philosophy.

With their years of experience, wit, and wisdom it makes for a very enjoyable read.

The story and music are so romantic and charming, and the original cast always delivers the most heartfelt performance.

A lot of other reviewers complain about the poor sound, but quite frankly, it didn't bother me at all. I didn't even think about the sound quality....I was so delighted by the enchanting music.

He has a lot of fun on this album probably because he is playing to his hometown fans.It is not my favorite of his live albums but it is a very good live show. I do not like it as well as the others because the orchestra only has the brass at this show. It is minus the strings and reeds and the overall effect isn't quite as good as it is on Madison Square Garden or the Aloha From Hawaii Albums.Hopefully RCA will re-remaster this album and bring out the backbone of the show (the band) a bit more like they did on the recently released 25th anniversary Aloha show.The horns are overbearing and need to be toned down.Overall its a good album and worth having in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-appreciated live recording.","review":"I have not yet purchased the CD of this set, but the vinyl serves me well: it's Elvis best live-in-concert performance since the '61 Benefit show. I think the '74 effort was dismissed because it was deemed yet another in a long series, actually starting in '68. But many factors make it a very significant event: Elvis' vocals, noticeably stronger and \\"brighter\\" than on the '73 Hawaiian show; the hometown atmosphere; the version of \\"Let Me Be There\\" which was so good that (reportedly) a test 45rpm promo was made and the cut was issued a second time on a later album; \\"How Great Thou Art\\" from the l.p. which won a Grammy! And I still think that the rock and roll Medley was good enough to release on a single A-side! Fans, go back and listen (Reconsider, baby...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"Great performance by Elvis.The only downfall is this is not the entire concert,RCA must have deleted some songs due to lack of room on the album.Hopefull in this day of cd and dvd they will release the entire concert.Great concert and Elvis never sounded better."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unbiblical View","review":"I saw this book in the store and the title got my attention, as I am always looking for more material on women in the Bible. However, as I sat down to read through it, I realized that the author -- and we don't know if it's a male or female -- writes with a punishing view. In the story of Jepthah's Daughter, for instance, the daughter is portrayed as quietly accepting her fate, and she is upheld for that decision. In the story of the Concubine in Judges, the re-telling is written in such a way as to suggest that if she had listened to her mother and not complained about her husband, she would not have been raped, murdered and dis-membered.This is a dangerous book for anyone with a serious bent to study the Bible; it is especially dangerous to our daughters.PLEASE! Do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is that what happened???","review":"I have started reading my study bible everyday and decided that this book might be nice to read as I learn about each women of the bible. I was shocked at how \\"made-up\\" the stories were. I felt confused having to go back and read the bible again to see if that was what happened. For example, I read in the bible that Dinah was raped, but then in this book he makes it out like she wasn't and really glamorized the encounter she had. I don't want to read a bunch of nonsense when I am trying to really understand the bible. I would not recommend this book, esecially if you are just setting out to read and understand the bible, this book will make the stories mixed up in your head, making it difficult to discern fact from fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you're looking for factual information about the women in the Bible, this book will not provide it. Instead it's a compilation of personal fantasies of someone named M.L. del Mastro (not identified anywhere in the book) geared to justify the poor treatment of women in the Bible. The stories have no basis in history. They create circumstances, as if the writer was the woman's relative, who had a license to make up any history of choice. They're written like children's stories and contain chauvinist, Christian fundamentalist bias that is outrageously blatant. This book is garbage. If this review could have been posted with NOstars, I would have done so, but the computer program would not permit it.Believe me, this is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mp3 player","review":"this is a great mp3 player for the price, especially now that you can update the firmware to run a 2 gig SD card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablos Comment. a Tired Alejandro","review":"Comparing this DVD with the previous one of he is not the Same thing in truth gives pain of as they could call this a finished product.

The sound of the band is not as good as what normally there is customary Alejadnro to us.What has happened to him to Alexander with these bad productions?I give rating him of 2 stars because the performance of the band is spectacular although the rest of the product leaves much to be desired.

As a 35 year old female who has held management positions for the past 6 years in a large, male dominated company, there was little I could relate to. The frequent references to the way women operate did not reflect how I or female managers around me operate. How we supposedly were raised and socialized did also not strike a chord. Perhaps the book is for an older generation that faced more of these issues, or perhaps I've been lucky or worked with enlightened women. Either way, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes the Scales off your Eyes - Now I see what's happening","review":"As women we view the world through what our childhood games and expectatations have taught us. Pat Heim does a great job of opening our eyes to how the \\"boys\\" view the world. Since men have shaped the business world like their childhood games, it makes a lot of sense that women have to be aware of the unwritten rules. One of the most important eye-openers to me had to do with hierarchy and winning in contrast with \\"let's-all-get-along\\" and consensus. No wonder women get mired at the middle management level, and as managers are viewed as mother figures or babysitters. Any woman who wants to penetrate the higher echelons of management needs to understand the dynamics portrayed in this book. This book is vastly superior to \\"Games Mother Never Taught You\\", because it does not tell women to be just like men, but rather to adapt the game to our own unique advantages while being aware of how the boys do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guidance for Women","review":"Working in a male-dominated company in a male-dominated field (sales) I had noticed some of the behaviors mentioned in this book. However, \\"Hardball\\" gave me insight into WHY I saw these behaviors and how to deal with them. The book is getting a little dated (the power suit/skirt is out, the power suit with slacks is the choice of women executives these days) but still very good information. You must keep in mind that not ALL men think this way - as with all generalizations you have to keep flexible and adapt to the situation. A must read for any woman who is mystified by the behaviors she sees around her and wants to move up in the corporate world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely excellent","review":"As a woman who's worked in a \\"man's field\\" for 20+ years, I really thought I knew how to play hardball. Boy was I wrong. This book by Pat Heim and Susan Golant really showed me where I was making sometimes fatal errors and how to fix them fast. The result has been more respect at work from my male peers and enough confidence to ask for -- and receive -- a substantial raise. This is a must-have book. I just wish that I had found it many years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Unit for the Size","review":"If you buy this unit, realize that it is a 5,000 BTU unit and only has enough cooling ability for small rooms. That being said, so long as you use it appropriately, it is a very good unit. The only reason I gave it 4-stars is because I have to leave the thermostat at nearly 7 (Max) to keep the room around 70-72 degrees F; if I turn it down to 6 or between 6 & 7, the room gets up to at least 75 degrees F before the compressor turns back on, which I don't want.

It made my room bearable last summer, but not what I'd call comfortable. My roommate's air conditioner worked much better. It didn't seem to be very efficient, and the accordion panes that came with it to cover the rest of the window opening felt very flimsy and drafty. The immediate area around the air conditioner seemed like it cooled alright, but I lived in a pretty small room, and it didn't seem like it made much of a difference, even after running for a few hours. Sometimes it felt like it was just acting as a fan - the air coming out didn't always seem significantly cooler than the air outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright enough, Not for all day though","review":"This unit if perfect for those 1-3 hour repair jobs.

First of all, the pictures are black and white so you really can't even begin to understand the beauty of these wonderful anamals. Second, and most suprising of all, a good half of the dogs featured in this book are not even CLOSE to rare. As a matter of fact, most all of the breeds can be bought at a local pet shop. Lastly, the breed discriptions are marginal at best. The breed standards are way off and most of the text is babbling commentary rather than usefull information. You would get better information from a part-time pet shop clerk than this book.

The worse surprise; however, is that most of the texts are pertinent to very specific examples of very specific works of very different types of translations. I expected a full meal with this book and all I got was a tossed salad with very few ingredients. May I suggest another book by the same press? It is called \\"Theories of Translation\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"companion to Theories of Translation","review":"This is a companion to Theories of Translation (recommended by the previous reviewer). The specific and thoughtful essays on craft are very helpful--they raise points and considerations most people do not consider until they are actually in the throes of translating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep!

But I like the firmness of the bristles and it does the job of teasing for me very well. I have not had any issues with bristles falling out. I would recommend this brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged goods","review":"A quick last-minute check of this brush before packaging would have revealed a large portion of the black glossy finish chipped from the surface.

It works alt better than any teasing comb. I would definitely recommend this teasing brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly horrible book","review":"I can only assume that the glowing reviews of this book are mistaking it for \\"St. John: Feet, Fins, & Four-Wheel Drive\\" or \\"St. John Off the Beaten Track.\\" I've got all three of them, either of the others is great but this book is terrible. Its very thin, doesn't have much info and the plants and animals are mislabeled. There's actually a photo of an American Anole in the the \\"Fauna\\" section simply labeled \\"Lizard\\" - I assume the author was too tired to make any attempt at even guessing the species.Save your money and buy one of the other books. This one isn't even worth 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"This is a very superficial treatment of the island. The poor quality of the photos makes the book worthless even as a souvenir. You'll get better info at the National Park Headquarters. Wait til you get to St. John and then buy books or maps that suit your needs (hiking, snorkeling, history, flora/fauna, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. John guidebooks","review":"My wife and I recently visited St. John, and found this book very helpful. The authors obviously know the island quite well, and there's lots of good information and photos. I thought the book was well written and well organized. One of the better guides I've come across."},{"rating":"2","title":"St. John Guide Book","review":"A great buy! This pocket-sized guide to St. John contains factual information with spectacular photograps.

Good story content as only Denzel can do. These movies do not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you want low space & high style!","review":"This table is both attractive and versatile. Get lots of compliments. Very easy to assemble. I was having trouble with hardware cover knobs fitting and then realized I put the spindle in backwards. So if you follow directions, you can assemble it perfectly in 10 minutes or less with someone to hold it up for you as you assemble. Only problem was when I was polishing my wood furniture. I gave this table a quick swipe with a cloth that had polish on it and now I have streaks I can't seem to get rid of. My fault...It is a laminate, not wood so it's best to just stick with a damp towel to clean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegance and ease of use with economy","review":"This table has a very elegant, graceful profile and provides extra room for guests, when opened. It looks great in front of my leather sectional, when in closed or open position. It required minimal construction on my part.The construction is not the very best, but it is good enough that everyone is impressed with the table's looks and functionality. The colors of the inlaid wood give it a warm, glowing look, as well. Great table and look for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Table Although Did Not Assemble Perfectly","review":"This is a fabulous, space-saving coffee table. It was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition. The table was quick and easy to assemble. My only issue was that the spindle (barely visible in the above pic) did not tighten properly and, therefore, the wooden plugs would not secure themselves into the wooden leg assemblies. This left the hardware slightly exposed. Not a huge issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance continued or ... not?","review":"Nocturne was one of the 87th Precinct novels I looked forward to most because I was hoping it will continue the stories started in Romance. I devour every Ed McBain/Evan Hunter book and I still have to find one that I did not love. Nocturne is still great, but not what I expected. Maybe that is why it left me a bit disappointed and betrayed. Nevertheless, it is another stellar addition to my library and I would not give it up for the world. Go, 87th Precinct, go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The violence overwhelms the story...","review":"McBain pushes a bit too far into the darkness behind sexual assault in this disappointing addition to the 87th precinct series. A group of college boys out for a wild night that ends up in page after page of depravity, something that is there to shock, but does very little to move the book forward. It starts to become violence for its own sake and if McBain was looking to desensitize the reader he succeeded. Violence is necessary in these books, they depend on authenticity to create this world effectively, but here McBain just seems to get carried away by it and the story suffers. For me, probably one of the most disappointing books in the series and I'm pretty sure the only time I've ever given one star to a series that I've enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nocturne","review":"The characters never developed. There was a lot of drama, but I couldn't get into it. He talked about characters that you had no background on and knew nothing about.

Here's your Afroceltic peanut butter cup.This is my first experience with this act. Very thorough musicianship: ultimately blissful. Can't find a bad thing to say. I loved this from the first time I heard it on college radio and was in a frenzy to go out and buy it. Masterful programming, guitar playing, drumming. I'm in heaven!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightfully Disappointing","review":"Let me start by saying I really love Afro Celt Sound System. My father introduced me to their first CD and now I'm more rapid about getting their new stuff than he is... Or anyway, I was.The first two CD's were nothing short of relevatory for me, and the third seems to go in a different direction, but is still quite good.Sadly, I feel like unlike Paul Mounsey (Nahoo, et al) Afro Celt doesn't seem to be aging well. I couldn't help but feel that Seed was very, very derivative and washed out compared to their other offerings. The same sort of over-produced sensation I get from Vanilla Pop rubbish on the radio.I realize this is pretty harsh criticism of a group whose first 3 CDs retain an honored position in my CD case, but I just feel Seed isn't up to snuff. They can and have done much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, NO, WORSE THAN HORRIBLE","review":"There is no point to this disc. The songs have no substance. I am still waiting for the song to get to the end. Every song leaves you waiting for more; for the place of satisfaction. The singing is unbelievably bad. Soaring voice place over the music, totally ruining it. The voice is grating. The lyrics are inane. The beats are so common they are embarrassing. If some of these songs had no singer, they might be good. The ten minute song, which ends strong, is ruined with the singing that is so off key, I can't deal with it. There are two songs with good rhythms, but maybe those moments of clarity is why I gave this two stars. This should have no stars, because there is nothing to this. I can't communicate this strongly enough. If you know anything about music, you are going to hate this. It leaves you wanting for more, and never delivers it. Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best way to use mighty beanz","review":"Well, I had hoped we could do more with Mighty Beanz, to be honest. I will spend the money for things that my boys will use often and have fun with. But...we bought a couple sets of Mighty Beanz, and two of these tracks. I think we spent about $75 total (2 tracks and 12 beanz) and all the kids do is toss the beans around and play catch. We can't figure out the big deal is. yes they are cute rolling down the track, but after 3 minutes they put it down. And my boys are very creative, they can make a fun game out of just about anything. If we had only spent $10 then whatever, but I wish we had gotten something else instead. To watch beanz just flip over down a short track...the fun wears off quick. the commercials had made it look much more fun. maybe we are missing something...but I have to say this is one of the few toy purchases I have made that was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good place to hide beanz from little sister!","review":"I'm not so sure about this thing actually doing tricks and whatnot, but as a parent trying to keep little things out of the toddlers mouth, I love this toy because it closes up on both ends so that the beanz can't get out and baby girl can't get to them! Of course she could if she knew how, but for now, she just enjoys shaking the thing and hearing them rattle inside. Works for me! Now, if we could just figure out how to actually use it for its purpose and do some cool tricks, that would be even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the money","review":"This is your basic bowling ball bag.

It's clear to me that she influenced both C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. She is smart, funny, and her stories are endlessly inventive. I actually like this book better than her others (although I like them too). Another really good one is The Book of Dragons, which has great short stories, each one a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"E.

Aimed for kids about 10 and up, including me. Written in 1905 or 6, set in London, but escaping to ancient Tyre, Egypt, England, Babylon, through the magic of the Amulet. It actually tells quite a lot about 1905 London, most of it rather unpleasant. A Good Read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice","review":"Bought in April '09. In less than a year, I noticed yesterday that the top is dry rotted and ripped. It has been in the NJ elements for 10 months, but I would have expected a longer life than this. Also, it is water repellent, not water proof. I often found my chair pillows very wet after rain. My next cover will be more of a plastic type than this cloth material.

But what makes the album such a success is the strong writing from start to finish. Do yourself a favor and check this out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Hornsby's Southern Gem","review":"That Bruce Hornsby can play the hell out of a piano became obvious in his first two releases. Cascades of mannered appeggios and polished grace notes marked his radio-friendly adult contemporary style. This is the album where he lets his band The Range add a grittier rock sound. They're not wailing and pounding like Led Zeppellin or anything, but the scruffier sound is a big plus. Bruce's virtuouso keyboard playing can still be heard loud and clear.And just as Bruce and the Range make an nice sonic adjustment, it seems like the songwriting steps up a notch too. The lush longing of \\"Across the River\\" stands as the primary example. The album makes a southern sound and an American sound, varying its tempos and styles enough to keep things interesting. Go back and listen to a forgotten gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better with repeated listening!","review":"I came across this CD at my local library and checked it out. I don't think it got out of my player for two weeks! Incredibly interesting and powerful arrangements are throughout. I especially like the strong and dramatic \\"Stander on the Mountain\\" and \\"Across the River\\" Shaun Colvin's duet with Bruce on \\"Lost Soul\\" is very touching and melacholy without being a dirge. And Jerry Garcia's incandescent guitar sparkles on \\"Good Seed\\" and \\"Across the River\\" in his typically original yet totally fitting way. Though I don't own any other of Bruce's work, this album is one of my favorites that I go back to time and again. I recorded it onto my hard drive so I will have it nearby at all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Hornsby cd","review":"This is without a doubt the worst cd of Hornsby's career. He tries to rock out here but it just doesn't work. Except for the single \\"Across the River\\" the whole effort falls flat. You can't go wrong with any other Hornsby cd, just stay clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hornsby night on the town","review":"I didn't seem to care to much for this CD, it seemed like he didn't have his heart and soul into it. I have always enjoyed a few of his other CD's such as, The way it is, and Scenes from the Southside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for company game rooms","review":"Where I work we try to de-stress by playing card & board games when we can. My boss bought Werewolves Of Millers Hollow and we tried it one day. It's now \\"THE\\" game to play before a holiday or long weekend. It's the type of game that causes my coworkers to stop dead in their tracks and say \\"Werewolves????... did someone say Werewolves???\\" and all pile into the conference room where we play and chow on pizza and Buffalo Wings.We love this game! The best part is that it created an environment where my coworkers, that wouldn't normally associate with each other, laughed and had fun with each other. I highly recommend playing this at company parties! I like it so much, I'm going to get it for playing at home with my friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game for Middle School Age","review":"Everyone I've played this with has loved the game. It's best with groups of ten or larger, but is fun regardless. The narrator controls the atmosphere of the game, so it is different every time. By far one of the best games to pass time. Best played in larger areas for plenty of seating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game for groups","review":"This game is great for camping or just a fun night with a group of 8 or more. It's really more about human psychology than anything else. You have to be very observant of other people and their reactions in the game to try to see if they are lying (a required part of some characters). It's fairly simple to run the game, and everyone has a great time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, simple party game","review":"We have played with groups up to 19, and with kids as young as 3 years old.

It is such a freaking blast. The music rocks, and you cannot help but be sucked into the game. It is hard, but it is way more involved than your typical rhythem game because your \\"playing\\" actually affects the sound. Huge thumb's up!! Instead of dropping $600 bucks on a PS3, go get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guitar Hero II","review":"I bought this game for my boyfriend, and now his friend bought an extra guitar so they can jam together!

If you liked Dance Dance Revolution, this is the same idea with a guitar. You play the colored fret bars along with ever more complex and cool songs. Style matters! Great to develop eye hand coordination and fun at the same time. WARNING: Adults usually lose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This game is one of the funnest ive ever played. If you've never played this game before then starting off may be a little difficult, but after that you get addicted really easily. The game starts off with songs like Shout At The Devil by Motely Crue and Mother by Danzig and ends with songs like Beast and The Harlot by Avenged Sevenfold and Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd.

However, it is not suitable for children under 8-10, depending on the child. The product states that it is for 12yo. I would recommend this to those who are looking for something unique.

I bought a PS2 just so I could play Guitar Hero, so I was really anticipating the release of GH2. On the positive side, the game play itself is much improved. I like the fact that the songs are broken down into sections so you can see how many notes you got right and where the problems are. BUT. The song list is too obscure. The whole POINT of GH is that you can play the songs you've loved and known. I only knew about 8 of the songs on the whole list. The songs I don't know are pretty hard core and I'm not very motivated to learn them. VERY disappointed. Next time please - less metal, more favourites PLEASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"best review ever","review":"How could I possibly review a game I have not received??!!!! I have tried to contact anyone who may have info, to no avail. It has been over 40 days since the order was placed, is there no follow up anywhere? Or is it take the money and run?! Furthermore, wouldn't it make sense for amazon to check on the status of an order before contacting me - for - of all things - A REVIEW? Insulting. I did quite a bit of shopping with amazon this year, and it will be my last.

Well worth the money and the music selection is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun I can hardly stand it","review":"It's already been said a million times, but Guitar Hero 2 is an exceptional gaming experience. The game does a remarkable job of transporting you into the shoes of a guitar-strumming maniac, and provides various levels of challenge for players.The game definitely requires some dexterity, so I would recommend this for the 6-99 age range... little kids under this age won't be able to use the frets well enough to play.The songs are great, featuring a solid mix of 80's, classic rock, newer bands, and unlockable tracks with less-known artists.All in all, a fantastic game. Buy it if you have any interest whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new songs","review":"I bought this for my 14 year old son and he loves it. He is into the music and said this has so much more then the original Guitar Hero. Also good for dexterity and not as frustrating and addictive as some of the adventure games on PS2. He can walk away from the game and pick right back up when he is ready. Not as obsessed with finishing a level...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On!","review":"This game is so much better than the first one. So many more songs. I like the 2 player pro faceoff the best. Not only do you have the 40 songs in the career screen but you also have an extra 30 to buy from the store. It would have been even better if you could create your own character but the characters there are cool. The guitar colors are also better. Stickers are cool. This games is fun and will keep you playing for hours unless you start getting tired but you would still want to keep playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"rock on with your socks on","review":"Addictive and amazingly fun for what it is. Although if you start out with bad eye hand coordination expect to suck until you get the hang of where the fret keys are and how fast you need to strum.

It is without a doubt the BEST videogame I have ever played. Basically, you have a guitar with 5 frets on them. When the color note passes a target, you hold down that fret and strum. There are also chords, 2 or 3 frets played at once, which make the game even harder. If you struggle with this game, get the first one. It is much easier, but this game has better music and is a better overall game. If you are thinking about getting the game, and maybe are worried about the price, GET IT! This is the ONLY videogame worth its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game but lacks great songs","review":"I have been a big fan of Guitar Hero ever since I first played it as a demo at Circuit City. After that I would play wherever I could, but because I didn't have a PS2 I couldn't buy it. However, yesterday I saw an ad for the PS2 at an INCREDIBLE price. I couldn't resist and finally purchased it along with GH2. I got home and played it. I had some real fun rocking out to tunes like Strutter. Gameplay is great and all, but my only dissapointment was the song list. I mean, who's heard of 'John the Fisherman' or 'Pyscobilly Freakout'? Hopefully on GH3 RedOctane will put less hardcore metal and more classic favourites. I still recommend this game though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and addictive - good product","review":"This game is VERY addictive. First the quality of the product when it showed up was good.

Amazing Grace played on the Great Highland Bagpipe is a beautiful and haunting thing. When brass comes crashing in, it ruins it. The same with Scotland the Brave. I use this one to pick up the tune when I'm learning something new on the pipes (and it's the only cd I own that has that tune). If you want a pipe band cd, steer clear of this.

I was not totally disappointed, but I already had a version that I think I like better which is on a CD entitled \\"The Music of Scotland: The Scottish National Pipe & Drum Corps and Military Band\\". The sound quality is better and the transition from the first stanza of solo piper to massed pipes in the second stanza is smoother in terms of the introduction of the drones. The arrangement is basically the same except that it doesn't have the extra flourish at the end of the third stanza before returning to the solo piper. The \\"National Pipe and Drum\\" CD also has more emphasis on pipes & drums and less on military band than does the \\"Dragoon Guards\\" CD. Unfortunately I cannot find the former CD listed on Amazon. There is, however, nothing more stirring than \\"Amazing Grace\\" played with massed pipes--no matter which one you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Grace","review":"Ijust want to say that I think Amazing Grace played on Bagpipes is probably the most beautiful song that I've ever heard.

This is magnificant; like a thousand horse cavalry charge. The only problem is that, at 45 seconds, it is too short.It would have been far better if it had been played once on pipes alone and then again with the brass dropped in behind the pipes.

I put this gel in my hair when it is pretty wet to set the curl and let it dry. It dries a bit crispy but then you use Ouidad's pomade to open up your hair to amazing soft, frizz free curls.

I have had many problems trying to tame my coarse, thick, frizzy hair. (It's like Julia Roberts hair when she first appeared on the scene) My solution has always been to flat iron it. I really wanted to love this product. At first I thought it would work, but when my hair dried, it had less frizzies but it doubled in size. It turned into that 80s hair. I tried this a total of three times and the same thing happened. I decided to toss it. I wish it ended there. The first time flat ironing my hair after using the product my hair looked like straw. I had no idea what that stuff did to my hair. My hair has been extremely dry and even more frizzy since. It may work for people with thinner, softer hair but for me it didn't work. It made my hair worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Buy mousse!","review":"Just got the TV products the other day. I washed my hair as directed. Dried my hair as directed. Followed the instructions for the Botanical Boost and Climate Control and was NOT impressed with the outcome.I was expecting to have my curls more defined and less frizzy, but they weren't. My hair looked the same as if I didn't put anything in it at all, with the exception of it feeling like it needed to be washed again.I've had more definition from a $4 can of mousse. When I got up the next morning, my hair was a wreck. There is NO way I could just spray some Botanical Boost and look good. Maybe this works at a salon with a stylist, but it's not practical for at-home use.In my opinion, it's just another niche-marketing sales gimmick.

It's light weight, not sticky, and gives your hair shine and hold all day whether you air dry it or style with hot tools. Pricey but an 8.5 oz. bottles lasts for months. Use a bit more on dry hair; just a pea size drop, combed through for wet hair. If you comb it through and want your hair to dry curly, just wrap your head in a terry hair turban after combing product through. Leave on for 5-10 minute, gently scrunch with fingers and don't touch your hair till it's dry. You can use a diffuser dryer on low if you want it to dry more quickly. Just hold and lift carefully to keep you curls."},{"rating":"1","title":"My $2.00 hair gel works better!","review":"I was so excited to see this product on t.v. because I can't find something that'll not make my curls hard. Well this product definitely doesn't make your curls hard because it doesn't even work! After I applied the gel and the spray it was as if I hadn't even put anything in my hair and it was so frizzy. I thought my hair might be too curly so I tried in on my little sister in law that has wavy hair and it didn't do anything for her either. I don't understand how anyone likes this product because it does nothing to your hair! Biggest waste of money!

Always frizzy, course and just plain unruly. Well I recently had my haircut by a Ouidad Stylist and she suggested this gel. I will tell you it is VERY expensive. But, so far worth it. This by far beats everything that I have underneath my bathroom sink. I normally would not spend this much on a hair product, but this is the first time in a long time that I don't feel the need to straighten my hair to make it look presentable. Apply this gel to soaking wet hair. Do not towel dry. Make sure to section your hair and coat every strand for perfect, frizz free curls. Your hair needs to be very wet when applying. What I really like about this gel is even if you over apply, your hair does not feel crunchy like most gels. Dry your hair with a diffuser if you do not have time to air dry.

This album was released in 1976 and MOODY BLUE in 1977, but all the studio tracks on both are from 1976. As with most of his 1970s studio work, the emphasis here is on country music. Considering his shaky health in 1976, Elvis sings with surprising conviction and vigor in the mostly-sad lyrics of these songs. My personal favorite is the epic \\"The Last Farewell,\\" a wistful Roger Whittaker song about a man headed to war in England. Arrangements of the instrumentals and background vocalists are good, too - I disagree with those who find the arrangements on his mid-70s albums too lush and intrusive, though on some specific songs I do agree. Though overall this album and MOODY BLUE are quite good, be forewarned that Elvis's declining health usually shows through clearly in his voice on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 2 tracks","review":"Great track however the single only provides the hex hector radio version and the original version."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pure slice of POP!!","review":"this cd single is the is't to be released in the us, although Da Buzz has been promoting a full cd to other parts of the world.

If you've never heard of Music Machine before, and you are simply looking to entertain a young child, it might be worth buying although I think you could do better.

Whitcomb, apparently suffering from BushDerangement Syndrome (BDS) also can't resist the temptation to take a few gratuitous shots at the current president and those other favorite liberal targets: Christians and corporate types. If Al Franken were to write an Armageddon thriller, it would probably look like this. I quit reading about two-thirds through the book.

It's a surprisingly wild read; race riots, deformities, violence, sex, drinking, cop-bashing, election-fixing, and corruption erupt throughout.

What's most interesting about this book is the fact it's been out of print for decades and this publisher (Nabat) has spent time researching the archives of the Library of Congress to find books of this nature and republish them (i.e. You Can't Win by Jack Black - highly recommended). A publisher myself, and very interested in American history-culture-society, this strategy appeals to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"came as promised","review":"Bought as a gift, special request and was glad to be able to find it at Amazon.

But Elvis, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were -- and this was the first time Elvis met Jerry Lee, who was at the time just the pianist on Carl's session. At this point in time, Elvis was already recording for RCA -- so it was quite a treat to have him drop by the Sun Studios.One of the highlights of the tape is Elvis telling the others about seeing one of Wards Dominoes (in fact it was Jackie Wilson) imitating him in Las Vegas. Elvis then imitates Jackie Wilson imitating him! Elvis also sings a version of Paralized (a song he had already recorded) in the style of Wilson -- and it is much better than the real recording!How great to hear young Elvis with his contemporaries, just singing for the sake of jamming.You can't ask for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELvis leads ,the other two follow.","review":"Elvis is tremendous on this CD...he leads,he suggests songs,he pumps the piano throughout except for the last 10 minutes or so.The respect from Carl and Jerry for the King is apparent in spades.It was a TRIO not a quartet...Johnny Cash agreed only to take part in a group pic...end off story.His thunder was stolen when Elvis arrived unannounced at the studio...and he sulked off,taking no part whatsoever...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every Elvis Presley Fan or gospel music lover.","review":"This is an unrehearsed impromptu jam session of gospel and country classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not finish it","review":"I started this book but I could not finish it due to the foul language.

She must now take on the task of figuring out who did it without getting in trouble for doing detective work without a license. The irreverent sexy Casey uses all her charm, her sex appeal, and her street smarts to investigate the case and get information the police just can't seem to get right. In the end, you get a smart commentary on politics, society in the old south, lust, and love. Don't let the sexy legs on the cover fool you, this is not a romance or sex novel.

The Order of Things is a necessary counterweight to the post-modern take of Foucault's middle works (Discipline & punish, History of Sexuality), and can catapult the reader through an anemic post-modernism back towards the joys of a supercharged linguistic structuralism.

If you intend to use this book for anything more than casual reading, avoid this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, awkward translation","review":"I love this book, even when I hate it. Foucault's archaeological method really blows a hole in the die-hard myth of historical \\"progress\\" by focusing on the epistemological bases of change, steering (or rather veering) away from the teleological narrative that usually passes for history. Mind-bending, really.But what an awful translation. I wish I was a more fluent reader of French; parts of this book read like something I might have translated on a low energy day: idiomatic French rendered literally in English. No wonder people have such a tough time getting through the book. It took me a while before I got the hang of the awkward sentence structures, and by then I felt I had to go back and start reading from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super funky jammin jazz!","review":"I heard one of these songs on an internet radio station, loved it so I bought the cd and was very satisfied. These guys are so funky, jazzy, cool, hip, and last but most important, tight! The cd is a blend of 70's movie soundtrack funk, spy jazz, smooth jazz (not too cheesy though!), a tad of reggae, and some r&b, all rolled into a super talented group of musicians who blend very well together and keep the groove going! No singing, which I happen to really enjoy.

It will be interesting to compare this to the autobiography that was released in November 2010, timed to coincide with the 100 year anniversary of his death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is NOT the official autobiography!","review":"Be VERY careful to be sure this is actually what you want: I bought it when Amazon recommended it in response to my search for the official autobiography. Since the seller did not have a disclaimer that it is not the official autobiography, I didn't know until it arrived and I was able to see the publish date that it was an unauthorized printing.For everyone searching for the full autobiography, which was printed WITH permission (this book and all others were printed previous to 2010 and thus unauthorized), you want the one edited by Smith, Griffin, Fischer, Frank, Goetz and Myrick. Volume 1 was released in November 2010. If your book is not volume 1 of a 3 volume set, it, like the above book, was printed in violation of Mark Twain's explicit instructions not to print his memoirs until 100 years after his death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melancholic and humorous...","review":"I recommend reading this autobiography, although I do think it is too long and certain sections could have been eliminated.There are some extremely funny episodes, but for me the most powerful writing was the last chapter about the death of his daughter Jean. It is an extremely moving glimpse into Twain's heartfelt pain. Reading this life story has made me want to revisit the high school classics of Huck Finn and Mark Twain.4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Letdown","review":"I don't have any idea what April Derleth was thinking when printing this volume under her fathers imprint. The editor puts down all the major writers to the point that I have to write this review. I'd like to see some of this editors own fiction if he thinks so low of Robert E Howard and Clark Ashton Smith. The sad fact is that their style of writing is virtually non-existant. Originality like theirs nearly died out with Moorcock and Leiber in the 70's (though William King is a new notable worth reading). With the plethora of 800 page \\"I wanna be JRR Tolkien\\" poser's currently permeating the publishing industry it leads me to see this book as more of the wide spread jealousy held against these great writers.

More recent studies have dealt with the topic in a more evenhanded manner, as Deak's work neglects several key factors to the Corps' success. Parts of the work were even a bit condescending towards minorities and women, but overall the work was acceptable for the time in which it was published. Sadly, the better texts have yet to be translated. They are worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I expected much more from Dr. Deak, who has quite a reputation in the area of Hapsburg studies. Sadly, his research wasn't thorough enough and he makes several mistakes in his assertions. Perhaps he was over-anxious to crank out this book to satisfy some deadline. I hope, in light of new information available, Deak or another (younger) scholar will do the subject justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Boring Book About A Fascinating Topic","review":"Hapsburg military history is usually quite interesting,but in Deak's hands it is reduced to bland statistics anddry analysis. Hopefully, a better book will come along so interested readers will not feel compelled to suffer the boredom of Deak's style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining???","review":"I was surprised by the sharp diversity of opinion regarding this work. I'd have to side with those who found this book dull and unreadable. One of the positive reviews called the book \\"entertaining\\". That is one word I would NOT use to describe Deak's writing. Certainly, the subject matter is interesting and a capable writer and thoughtful historian could write a stunning and exciting treatment. This is not it. This book was written before Deak became an apologist for Pope Pius in the recent controversy over his role in the Holocaust (see _Hitler's Pope_). Undoubtedly, the notoriety will bring people to his earlier works such as this one, but they will find no fire here."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Second Thought...","review":"Upon reading this book a second time, in light of the persuasive comments left by the other reviewers, I must agree that Deak's work leaves an awful lot to be desired. I recently read other books on the same subject, notably Wendell Gibson's _Hapsburg Diary_, which makes Deak's work seem amateurish to say the least. I recant my earlier review, which was a product of my own ignorance. I hope I didn't lead anyone to actually purchasing Mr. Deak's infantile ramblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the dullest books ever!","review":"Frankly, I do not understand why Mr. Deak continues to torture us with his inane blatherings on the subject of the Habsburg family. When was the last time a Habsburg accomplished anything of any import, like leading the NBA in rebounds or producing a really cool MTV video? I'm sure that the only people interested in the subject are more boring than Deak's book, if that is possible. Two thumbs down"},{"rating":"1","title":"No big deal","review":"No big deal.

If there are ZERO hidden Mickeys on it, then say that so we know you didn't just forget that attraction.We tried using this book. We were excited when we bought the book. But I've never seen a \\"field guide\\" so lacking in proper organization and formatting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs much work","review":"Yes, there are hidden Mickeys at WDW but this book is by no means a road map to them. There is no flow to the book with items jumping about the park instead of being laid out where you can resource information quickly. The author also stretches the truth on many of what is \\"claimed\\" to be hidden Mickeys when in fact it is not even in the right dimensions nor listed in Disney records. There is better information on web sites than to waste your money on this book. How would I know? Would happen to be a Cast Member and this book is not official by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Kindle Version) User Unfriendly","review":"Because there is no table of contents and no hyperlinked index, it is cumbersome to flip through this book and find the section you need, making it a hindrance to using while at the park. I was hoping for the convenience of having this on my iPhone instead of carrying around a book while at Disneyland. But, because of the format, now I'll have to read each page and mark the info in my notes to reference later. What a hassle to have to flip through every page to try to find the section we need! The one good spot is that each \\"clue\\" is hyperlinked to its corresponding \\"hint\\" although it doesn't quite solve the organizational problem of using this ebook while in the park.Kindle versions of reference books should always have an easy-to-access, hyperlinked index and table of contents. When they don't, it not only makes the hard copy a much better value, it makes the kindle version almost useless.I wish I didn't purchase this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Expectations","review":"The book is a good idea but there really is way too much filler used to try and create a book. First you have the clue which tells you there is a hidden mickey in the area. Most people will not be able to find the HM with just this clue. The next part is a hint which tells you exactly where to look. I suggest you go straight for the hint. Many of the HM are, as the author called them, \\"wishful thinking\\". For example, hint 38, \\"you are looking for an abstract Donald Duck....\\" Also many are in a dark, fast ride that you would have to ride many times to find the \\"tiny classic Mickey.\\" Having said all this the book is good start to giving you visit a little extra fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really hidden Mickeys","review":"Cute format. Cute Book. Now, if only half of them where actual Hidden Mickeys it would be a good book. Ex. The 3 in Spaceship Earth is not a hidden Mickey it is a 3.

How do I know this is incorrect? I am a cast member who teaches programs all over the parks. I know what is real and what isn't.

Both were invaluable to maximizing our enjoyment during our trip. I don't know who had more fun spotting the hidden Mickeys...me, my husband, or our two sons, ages 9 and 11. The competition was on with our 9 year old beating out the rest of us.

Nothing of no consequence, and at least three works of great merit. George Rochberg's 1979 sonata, written after he'd renounced serialism for neoromanticism, is a tour de force of sweep and muscular energy. Alan Shulman's deservedly popular Theme and Variations from l940 is a veritable kaleidoscope of attractive effects. The latest work on the program, Lowell Liebermann's 1984 Sonata, contains a subtle interplay of varying emotions. And neither Frederck Jacobi's brief Fantasy nor Quincy Porter's speedy Speed Etude, let your interest flag.Young Cathy Basrak plays this dissimilar program with consummate skill, and is most ably assisted by two fine pianists, Robert Koenig in the Rochberg, Shulman and Porter, and William Koehler in the Liebermann and Jacobi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horse whispers (saddle club, no 74)","review":"I really hated this book.

They were delivered in a big box with absolutely no packing material other than a single small sheet of plastic, so UPS did a fanastic job of keeping them in one piece. I don't see how it was possible with so little protection. Especially after my mom received so many broken. What a waste of a beautiful glass.

But to have the two of them mistreat an animal (of whatever sort it is) seems to promote such treatment of animals as fun, or cool, somehow.

The novel works when it keeps us on the edge of being drawn into a technofetishist's fantasy... but suddenly, we're there, the robots are here, beep beep. The effect is stupid.

Many good areas in the southwest portion of the state were not even mentioned, which is sad because some of these areas are the best in the state. It is obvious that there was not a great deal of research done in the creation of this guide and its diagrams of the individual areas published leaves much to be desired. Line drawings can create confusion for the reader which is not a good thing for a guide, however topographical diagrams in conjunction with the line drawings could have made this situation better. Yet the best alternative would to be to combine the drawings with actual photos of the cliff line.

Jeff Watson clearly states that the purpose of the book is to provide a listing of areas and routes for climbing in Virginia. I found the overall map on pages 6 and 7, as well as the opening paragraph in each section to be very informative. This book is only a guide and does not have all the information for each area because it covers many sites in Virginia. Climbing is an adventure and many of the answers are discovered along the way.

The analogy for me is great cuisine - it takes a passionate chef, and a recipe. What's different from meal to meal is the ingredients.Carol Franco and Kent Lineback's book is a terrific tool for transforming the archivist into a historian.

After several months, it loosens and begins to rotate along with the impeller. This gouges out the bearing seat and causes the impeller to rub against the sides of the base and finally breaks the ceramic shaft of the impellor.

I have only had the book for a few months, but it does not seem as though the binding will last very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it had to happen....","review":"Twenty years ago I bought this book (7th edition) when I arrived as a foreign exchange student to study in the US.I vividly remember the joy of finding a bounty of precise and clear definitions in thisfantastic book.

This stinker of a dictionary is now fullof trivialities and consciously low-brow wordings. The new entry for \\"concise\\"?

Beldon's arrangements are rich and bring out elements in Lennon and McCartney's music that will remind you why they are two of the greatest songwriters in history.

True, most of the jazz up through the 50's was based on preexisting songs, that is indisputable. But those songs lived on their own without lyrics, so instrumentalists could play them and make them live. Most of the musical part of pop music today, let's face it, is a life support system for the lyrics. Without them, the music is one-dimensional and uninteresting. Belden has skill, to be sure, but his well-worn formula of parading out current stars' music so that he can try to popularize himself is just another example of me-ism of the 60's and 70's culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short","review":"When you activate the chirp/song it only last 5 seconds!

I also agree with one of the reviewers: There are a lot of typos in the textbook.I would not recommend Amazon readers buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly organized, poorly edited","review":"The text certainly has very comprehensive coverage of signal analysis for an introductory course, it certainly lacks the depth needed for an advanced course. And unfortunately the writing is so poor and the typos so numerous that the book cannot help but confuse and discourage those first learning a pretty complex field such as signal analysis. There were several mistakes in the Fourier and Laplace transform tables in the rear of the book which is simply abominable. The emphasis on computer examples and solutions is a nice feature and is implemented better than most other comparable texts. But I don't think that it's enough to redeem the numerous other flaws of this text. If I was to recommend an introductory text, a good one would be DSP First by McClellan which has lots of good computer examples and some nice exercises with real signals such as images and voice. A nice intermediate text is Digital Signal Processing by Proakis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference","review":"I used this book for an undergrad text and found it very wordy and hard to understand, although some of the examples are good.

Joe Davis knows how to write a song, with proper bridges and key-changes here and there to keep your interest. (Apart from the synth solo in \\"All I Know\\" , which is uncharacteristically lame.)

William Dalrymple paints a picture full of humor and fascinating detail, mixed with love and frustration. Which is what Delhi is: fascinating, frustrating, fun, and full of incredible people. Delhi is multi-layered and not easily explained. Delhi has to be experienced. Yet, Dalrymple brings to life a lot of the feeling of this magnificent city. More importantly for me, he brings to life part of its history, details history books leave out, alley ways that deserve to be explored. As a traveler blessed to return to Delhi fairly often, I have found the details of Dalrymple's book adding value to my visits - by knowing which alley ways might just be explored."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best travelogues in a long time.","review":"dalrymple is simply one of the best travelogue writers today as he lives, breathes, imbibes the culture & history of the places he travels to. in this book, he takes you to the delhi (india) of old, a once beautiful and cultured city and revisits the historical, political and cultural forces that shaped it. dalrymple does all this with a keen eye and a sympathetic ear for the inhabitants of the new delhi. he shows an unusual understanding for the people who once lived there and who live there now, their aspirations & fears. even more remarkable is the fact that, the empathy dalrymple feels comes through while he successfully avoids sounding patronizing in his depiction of old & new delhi. all in all a fabulous and very enjoyable travelogue, historical account and sympathetic tale from a man who truly belongs without having been born or raised there....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical book about India","review":"Fascinating vivid historical descriptions of India......

Dalrymple is a great tour guide. He took me places that I wouldn't have been able to visit even if I flew to Delhi today.The people he met and described were as fascinating as the places he explored. This book is a combination of history, tourism, mini-biography, human interest, archeology and anthropology. The mix was well balanced and Dalrymple's writing ability made the entire book entertaining as well as educational.Please do not let the age of this book dissuade you from reading it. Dalrymple's take on Delhi will still be worth the read for as long as people read.My only gripe (worth a tenth of a star) was with the only map. Though nicely drawn by his wife, it was nearly useless. A more inclusive map would have added a tremendous amount to my enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"This book was published in 1993 and I got the chance to read it in 2005 and I must say no other book,author or historian has portrayed Delhi as Dalrymple did!.I cant believe how much I'm in love with this wonderful city more so after reading this book!.Author's sense of humour ably supports his apt and lucid sense of history.His passion for Delhi absolutely shines through and that illuminates every page.Though 'm young and not intelligent enough to commment on greats works and authors but Dalrymple is definitely on the greats!.He sure would make his generation proud.It is a must read whether you like Delhi,history or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading!","review":"A truly marvelous book for anyone who loves India, whether they have been there in the flesh or in spirit.

It helped me to laugh at my own western mindset and be more appreciate & respectful of the ways of the Indians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience the hidden Delhi","review":"This is an excellently written story of the Delhi that few of us know about. Dalrymple has delved deep into the historical facts to find out the true provenance of many of archeological and architectural remains to be found all over Delhi. His love for the city is evident in the pains he took in his sojourn.

When a hitchhiking girl killed herself, Mildred takes her identity to live a completely new life.It is crazy to replace oneself with a complete stranger. It would be an artificial story if Mildred's despair were not convincingly described. And it would be tiresome if her misery were tediously described. Gardner describes her hopeless feeling concisely but convincingly. He is an excellent writer. No more explanation will be needed.

It is interesting how times has changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book on a difficult subject","review":"This is a wonderful book dealing with what is without doubt an extremely difficult subject. The whole package is very appealing to kids with the language and illustrations produced in a style they can easily relate to.

A very helpful tool to find out what your children are really feeling during a terrible time for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book for anyone who is interested in Bible studies","review":"Sure, Ken Smith has a decidedly Christian bias, sure he likes the 'New Testament' better than the old when by his own admission all the fun stuff is in the \\"old\\" but he's reading from Christian translations that purposely make the \\"old\\" dull and boring. Sure he doesn't know that the Philistines are making statues of Hemmerhoids in 1 Samual 6 but that's fine too. This is the most hilarious companion to the Bible ever written. Perfect whether you are an atheist, Jewish, agnostic or a Christian with a sense of humor. The only people who will hate this book are the people who read those moron Christian confessionals and don't see anything weird about Jack T. Chick comics"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and entertaining.","review":"As others have said, this provides insights to weird and contradictory things in the Bible. However, as someone who still considers the Bible important, I found this as an even better tool to allow me to question, reason and debate, instead of getting all huffy and offended. This book provided opportunity to find appreciation in how some things were obviously written for their time, some have shifted through revision and interpretation and how the spirit of what we get from any text matters more than every jot and tittle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurray for Honesty!","review":"When I read this book I felt Al Franken looking over my shoulder. And that is good. Seems that all these fundamentalist (and somewhat fanatical) Christians want you to take every single word out of both the Old and New Testaments literally and without question. The thing is they select chapters and verses they want to preach, interpret them for the proper amount of fire and brimstone, and conveniently ignore how the whole Bible makes no sense nor has any applicaton today. Then again, evangelicalism is big buck business. Thank you, Ken, you gave me a lot of chuckles sticking pins in this ballon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great handbook!","review":"For a bible critic, thise is an excellent and terse compendium of all the awkward parts of the bible.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely a worthwhile purchase","review":"Could easily be entitled \\"The Bible in a Nutshell.\\" I have found this guide to be invaluable.

But that's really your problem. The rest of us will be trying to suppress intense laughter as Ken's text points out what the Bible actually *does* say in plain English. This book is also a definitive study in the use of iconography to point out the best parts of the Bible. Buy copies for all your Christian friends, but only if you want them to go to Hell."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air!","review":"How rare and wonderful to finally see an intelligent, well-researched piece of CRITICAL writing on the actual *content* of the Bible. Biblical scholars have argued about authorship and other topics for years, but this is the first book I've seen that concerns itself with the actual contents AND is directed to the general reader.I was amazed and disappointed by some of the negative comments I've seen -- comments that suggest to me that those people never gave the book more than a casual glance. Smith used not one but FOUR different translations of the Bible in his research, and his commentary does not give any indication that he's a demon-worshipping subversive, or that anyone else should be either. Rather, he indicates only that it's important to read the Bible with your brain, rather than uncritically accepting all the spoon-fed platitudes that most of us are brainwashed with throughout our childhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"The proof is in the reviews!","review":"Are you tired of \\"bible beaters\\"? Do you wish you could pull references from the bible to contradict what crap they spout out? If so, \\"Ken's Guide to the Bible\\" is perfect for you! He purposely puts the versus next to all of his comments which makes it perfect for all of you bible fanatics out there (so you can have fun comparing the \\"real\\" thing with his interpretations). So if you enjoy getting a few laughs in the name of the \\"lord\\", buy this book and enjoy. (Just watch out for those unfortunate lightning strikes.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good example of \\"different point of view\\"","review":"The author gives a thorough guidance through some of the less known passages of The Book as well as those widely known but often misused when taken out of context. Although experienced Bible students may easily dismiss maybe about fifty percent of Ken's conclusions but there is still a good portion of those, which are really difficult to fight with. Good book for all those who can only see one side of the coin. It doesn't ruin your faith if you are a *CONSCIOUS* believer. It mostly exposes many of the misinterpretations being heard all around. Good work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but...","review":"While this book reads with a great deal of hilarity and many seemingly convincing arguments, it seems irresponsible to draw these arguments from any other source but the original language (Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic, etc., depending on the section of the Bible). The Bible is simply not meant to be taken literally word-for-word, especially in a language so far-removed from the original. Even the most fundamental of fundamentals must refer to the original texts to acheive a greater understanding of what the Bible contains. So, before you go out and inform the world of what a hoax the Good Book is (if you are a non-believer) and before you go run out of the house screaming (if you are a believer), think twice before reading this book and realize that not only has the Bible been proven even by the hardest atheist to be a valuable archeological resourse, any descriptive literature--especially translated literature--will breed shocking results when taken word-for-word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually I meant ZERO stars","review":"I have only read over it briefly, but it was enough. Ken Smith has written, without a doubt, the most ill-informed, simplistic, overview of the Bible I have ever seen, and that's not blowing smoke. He seems to use 1990's American cultural standards and imposes them on Ancient Jewish society. Do you think anyone pursuing a masters in ancient history who tries to interpret Ancient Roman or Greek culture through 1990's American eyes would even come CLOSE to being awarded their degree? I think not. The same must apply to the Bible. A gypsy with a ouija board and scrabble set could do a better job than Ken!!!! The only real use I can think of for \\"Ken's Guide to the Bible\\" is to supply the paper recyclers (helps save trees, you know). Then I can only hope the re-used paper from this book finds its way to some cigarette manufacturing plant instead of Ken's publisher (in these times that ought to mean something). The long and short? If you want REAL SCHOLARSHIP, LOOK ELSEWHERE"},{"rating":"1","title":"P.T. Barnum was right.","review":"I've read many so-called refutations of the Bible, and this is yet another. Most are based on the author's lack of understanding of the time period of the particular biblical book they attack, ignorance of Jewish and early Christian history, and a general bias designed to rationalize their chosen sinful lifestyle. Such a pity that people would waste all their time reading such sophomoric nonsense as this and not spend any time reading the Bible itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book sits on my desk for easy reference and inspiration","review":"The entry right before mine is a perfect example of why right-wing, born-again whackos get so much respect. \\" Of course I didn't actually read the book, but I'm sure it is terrible - and just in case it is good, then all those who like it will be on their way to hell!\\" Jesus! These brainless morons always pull out that trump card, don't they? Fear is all they have going for them. Anyway, this book is funny and all that, but it is accurate as well.

I've never been able to make any sense of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad, but could have been better","review":"Considering the actual number of inconsistencies, vugarities, atrocities and sheer absurdities actually found in the bible, this book is way too short................................However, some of the points he makes are nice, and finally somebody decided to summerise the apocolypse in Revelations. This exercise reveals this vision of the apocolypse to be disconnected nonsense written by someone with a backrupt imagination.And he does give credit where it is due - like the wonderful humanitistic teachings of Jesus, which are truely devine.Perhaps the most useful thing about this books is that Ken tries to show how the simple and kind teachings of Jesus was turned into metaphysical, and thological nonsense by those who saw that it was far more profitable to turn Jesus into a deity and build a religion around him, rather than actually follow what He tought.\\"... that it is far easier to worship Jesus, than to follow His teachings.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"bwahahahahahahah!","review":"This book is hilarious and is a MUST-HAVE for Bible bashers, especially at the low price!

I had no idea that something as accessible as the music we so often take for granted can be consciously used to help us to literally transform our lives. In particular, I have found the chapters on using music and sound to help us get to sleep, to design a complete exercise program, and as an aid for meditation and creativity extremely helpful as well as fun. However, Dr. Ortiz's chapter on using music to add spice to \\"Romantic Intimacy\\" tops them all! This book has everything! I recommend it 100%!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"right\\" effect","review":"Having been lured by the ubiquitous hype of \\"The Mozart Effect\\" I bought that book a while back and was sorely disappointed. The Tao of Music, however, is a completely different story. This is a book that is obviously exhaustively researched and that does not make any other wordly claims. In plain, simple language it lists hundreds of realistic exercises that can be appreciated and done by anyone. The stories that Dr. Ortiz, a licensed, clinical psychologist, uses to introduce his concepts and techniques are poignant, relevant and believable, and as good as the best ones found throughout the \\"Chicken Soup for the Soul\\" series. On top of that, the hundreds of short little \\"zen parables\\" that are found throughout are alone worth the price of this fascinating book. Buy it, you'll like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible","review":"As a music therapist, I found this book insulting. The music choices sited are simplistic and unresearched, and could hurt (in some cases) more than help. Just listening to \\"The Sunny Side of the Street\\" when you are depressed is not enough and can alienate and compound a problem. Music is an extremely powerful medium, and without understanding elements besides just tempo and lyrics it is impossible and irresponsible to give informed advice on ways to use it therapeutically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless pop psychology","review":"Nothing in this book has any basis in psychology, neurology, musicology, or taoism. It's anecdotally-based self-help fluff, and the doctor who wrote it is either incompetent or is going for a cash-grab. Useless for anyone seeking real, meaningful change in their life; worse than useless for people who actually need help. For the former: when you're stressed, listen to relaxing music. When you're sad, listen to happy music. I just saved you $20. You're welcome. The latter will only be further alienated when they don't feel what they're \\"supposed\\" to feel listening to the author's minimally-considered \\"music menus\\". And for the emotionally-shallow people to whom this book is targeted, I'm sure there are cheaper placebos available."},{"rating":"1","title":"how sad","review":"w a lh - ea - ttor, in rebus speak, what a let downI have dipped in and out of Jakes web site for a couple of years now, and have always found teasers that are both challenging and funny. Regulars such as Mad_Ade, dumbell, mogmatt16, MrIxolite, Tissue, Datra16 (the list goes on), all have become almost real to me over time from reading their banter and reparte. The humour carried over into the tasers, although not all those who contribute do so with teasers.When I picked up this book I expected wit and humour in the brain teasers. Instead I found badly copied and poorly reconstructed immitations of what is found on line.I feel Jake has done those who have trusted him a great discredit.This one is going stright to the second hand shop.

And while *some* of it is, most of it is stuff that a system administrator would already be familiar with.Much of what's in this book is the same stuff aimed at beginning to intermediate Linux desktop users. It's not for real \\"geeks\\" or sysadmins by any means.If only the truly useful stuff for sysadmins/geeks were included, the book would be 1/3 it's size.It's not that it's a bad book; it's just not marketed well at all and has a very misleading title.I found it a complete waste of money.

There are a lot of options when it comes to mounting your TV to the brackets as well as options with mounting the plate to your wall. Provided your TV is compatable with this mount, I think it's a good choice. The chrome bars allow a fair amount of room in either direction to center the TV where you want it, and the brackets bolted to the back of the TV offer a wide range of heighth choice.Make sure to get the lag bolts in the studs' center. You don't want the bolt wandering out of the wood and risking your brand new TV falling to to the floor. (Or your loved ones!)As long as you take your time installing the lag bolts in the studs and the proper screws are securely tightened into your TV, you're good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"season 6 part 1 is exactly the same as season 5 totally a waste of moneynothing new happened all episodes were repeated. big disppointment. and feel like i was ripped off by HBO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sopranos Season 6 Part 1","review":"We were very disappointed with this product.

Sonnon also does a fine job of explaining the theory behind each skill set as well as it's execution.

Cisco has feet of clay in the internet telephony, voice-video-data over IP and fiber optic internet connection spaces. They are especially out of it in internet telephony and fiber optics. Further, valuation in \\"Cisco dollars\\" is a problem soon to be shared by many \\"New Age\\"companies; specifically, extreme valuation supported more by hopes and wishes than anything truly tangible.

In particular, the early cisco sales management drove the company to listen to customer needs. Many competitors feared the day the customer said no to cisco, as that is when the selling really began....... Next book should really tell the whole story....

Many omissions, factual errors, incorrect attributions are present in this book. Very few of the mistakes cisco made along the way are documented and discussed. Mistakes that lead to the formation of companies that now successfully compete against cisco like Juniper Networks. Or near misses like almost giving our source code to Microsoft. Cisco has an amazing story to tell, I am sadden to see this puff piece instead. I look fondly on most of my association with cisco, but this book does not accurately document the company and its inter-workings, it only demonstrates that cisco has one of the best image control infrastructures around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive coverage of Cisco","review":"I found this book about Cisco relatively short but comprehensive in the key elements of what makes the company a success. These elements consist of modern management, modern leadership, cutting edge business strategy and the pioneering use of electronic commerce. The most interesting parts of the book are the business strategy of Cisco buying other startups that could challenge the company with innovative technology. Also, interesting is the Cisco attitude of not buying the mythical company but a group of individual people and trying to integrate them into the Cisco culture. Of interest is the fact that most other company purchases fail. However, at Cisco they succeed and have allowed the company to remain on top. The second interesting area the book deals with is Cisco's pioneering use of electronic commerce. The book goes into detail about the Cisco electronic commerce schemes. Overall the book is well written and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voivod - 'Nothingface' (MCA)","review":"The band's fifth CD,and probably one of their best.Top rate progressive thrash(is there actually SUCH a genre?)Okay,how about maybe 'technical thrash'?That may be more like it.I haven't heard this disc in ages.It's GREAT!Best two tracks are \\"The Unknown Knows\\" and their Pink Floyd cover \\"Astronomy Domine\\".Unreal!Also about every other tune here rips,like \\"X-Ray Mirror\\",\\"Inner Combustion\\",\\"Pre-Ignition\\" and the wailing \\"Into My Hypercube\\".Good thing this is on CD,otherwise,I would've worn out like maybe two vinyl copies by now.Line-up:Denis Belanger-vocals,Denis D'Amour-guitar,Michel Langevin-drums and Jean-Yves Theriault-bass.I saw Voivod on this very tour with Soundgarden.One of the BEST club gigs I have ever encountered.Highly recommended.Might appeal to fans of Soundgarden,Coroner,Death Angel,Celtic Frost and Venom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars are not enough!","review":"Years ago one of my students loaned me a cassette copy of this thinking I'd be shocked or offended.

That \\"dark and smoky\\" mix was simply part and parcel of Tejas' personality. And being in Texas, there's nothing like listening to the original Tejas and running across mesa country in the Colorado and Concho Valleys (depicted so well by the cover art). I DO NOT want the 80's dance remix of this music. I've tried really hard to accept this CD, but the sterile electronic vibe is so obtrusive, so counter to the tone established by the original, I just can't.

But three seconds into \\"It's only love\\" on the remix and I'm sick to death.I bought the vinyl album from Ebay. It's wonderful.

I am literally going out of my way to get these albums on vinyl so I can turn them to MP3's so I can get the sound of these albums as they were originally intended to sound. I'm usually not too anal about remixes but these are downright un-listenable. The songs are great but this needs fixed. Who else is with me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the original sound of album, but still so good!","review":"This is very good album. The other reviews are accurate in that they have changed the sound, i.e. overdubbing the sound, such as the drums. It is still a great album, it just does not sound like it would have in 1976. It sounds like instead, 1988. Which is fine when you hear the rock and roll that comes out today. The first two songs on the album, \\"It Only Love\\" and Arrested While Driving Blind\\" are the two real standouts on this album. I hail from Amarillo, Texas, so this album is required listening for those from the Lonestar State. Again, very good album, I just wish they had not messed with the original sound of album. I hope they remaster this album in its original sound like they have done with other ZZ Tops albums such as \\"Tres Hombres\\" and \\"Fandango.\\" I still recommend this for any classic rock fan and ZZ Top fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars original album.0 stars for original cd","review":"this album is my fav zztop album of all time.i love every song and this is going by the original mix.beware cd buyers of the remixed one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GEEEEEZ!","review":"WHEN IS THIS GETTING REISSUED IN IT'S ORIGINAL MIX?!!

HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO GET THIS REISSUED? IT SEEMS TO BE LONG AFTER WE'RE ALL DEAD. WHAT A CRYIN' SHAME. KILLER ANALOG ALBUM DESTROYED BY DIGITAL NITWITS."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS CD","review":"If you want to hear ZZ Top, find their original LPs. The CDs that are available are an insult to the quality inspired musicianship the band once had. They are essentially re-recordings, and it's a shame that anyone who buys a CD is not going to hear the true ZZ, and why they were one of the best bands of the 70s. BUY THE LP or CASSETTE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drums are different than the record","review":"I bought this to replace my very worn out record. If you loved the vinyl as much as I did, you will probably not like the CD version. It sounds like they used some triggered drum sounds or re-recorded the drum track with triggers... no bueno. (Though it does sound kind of cool on \\"Ten Dollar Man\\") I'm going to the used record store to buy a new vinyl version of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 STARS REDUCED TO 1 FOR AN AWFUL REMIX","review":"This is ZZ Tops best album.I loved this on vinyl for over 20 years.When I finally got rid of my record collection I bought this on CD and the remix,particularly the drum parts make me ill.Another problem on my copy which I haven't heard anyone else mention is that the first two words of\\"arrested for driving while blind\\"are missing as if they were omitted.It has been so unpleasant not being able to listen to one of my all time favorite albums as much as I would like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drum Tracks Ruin Previously Great Album","review":"When this album was remastered, the original drum tracks were altered to coincide with the band's more recent sound on albums like Eliminator, etc. What a tragedy! This was a great album and should be reissued in its original form. I am only grateful I still have a turntable and can play the original. I threw the cd out. I could not get past the altered drum tracks. I cannot believe the band chose to \\"revise\\" the album. I hope that it is eventually put out on cd as it was originally meant to be heard. Nothing on the packaging even warns you that it is not in the original form. Dishonest and disappointing is all I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"When will the real version of this be available???","review":"Even though this is advertised as the \\"2011 edition from Japan\\", it's still the crappy revisionist mix from the 1980's. I had high hopes that this album was FINALLY available on CD in it's original mix. Maybe I should burn and sell CD copies of my 1976 vinyl copy of this great album. Even with the surface noise, the record sounds much better than this garbage CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creating Character Emotions","review":"I found this book not to be all that great. I expected a lot more from this book. It elaborates too much on the authors personal feelings. She catagorizes all readers as the same. And we ARE NOT! The book is more for people who use big and fancy words to describe what he/she thinks and/or feels. She does give a lot of great examples of all the emotions but some of them are very hard to understand as well as hard to identify with the emotion. It tells you how to express emotions in a more extravagant way. Which is nice, but it's nothing that most every writer or ispiring writer does not already know. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a 'brush-up' on descibing emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"too simplistic / bad method to grasp character feelings","review":"I threw this book away. I could not stoop to give it away. It falls far short of understanding charater emotions let alone as an aid to help writing any. I wondered that anyone could write a book on this subject. Examples in context might help if they were elaborated to get a feel for the way they work. Perhaps a contrast with the difficulties of life and facing heartrending needs of our being. I think we must seek to understand our humanity. Step out of your security and comfort zone. Emotions hang on the unknown and fear and passions. After all the purpose is to create feelings. I don't think you learn something from reading bad examples. I can contrast anything I write or citations I use as good when compared with bad. It is called using a straw dog. You must know the true and study it in order to grasp emotions. A little pain and compassion helps too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quick reference","review":"This is a nice, quick reference to depicting several emotional states without getting bogged down in deep psychological discussion. Though the \\"bad\\" examples seem obvious (as they should to those who enjoy good reading), the good examples are excellent. The exercises at the end of each chapter are also a nice touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"This book is a helpful tool for the serious writer.

After hearing all this, i heard his debut single \\" Tear it Up\\". the song was crazy! When i saw the album was finally droppin, i HAD to buy it. I did right after school. So i put the album into cd player and expected fire. SUCKS! hardly any swizz producing, only 4 bangers, at most.

In fact my introduction to Delius came via Beecham's disc in EMI's \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\" series. This Sony import title captures TB in mono performances from 1950-55 of Delius works not included in that aforementioned EMI CD. Here he leads his Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in the fantasy overture \\"Over the Hills and Far Away,\\" \\"Sea Drift\\" for baritone, chorus and orchestra, featuring text by Walt Whitman, and \\"Paris (The Song of a Great City).\\" Many classical music devotees dismiss Delius as a lightweight, but I find this music to be compelling if not absolutely essential.

Instead, the early revolutionaries murdered more than 1000 priests and religious for refusing to abandon their vows and accept the newly formed state-run religion, an act which also gave the revolutionaries access to lands owned by the Catholic church.The author relays some very unsettling accounts of mob rule where innocents were murdered in a great wave of bloodlust. Yet there are also stories of courage, like the little group of nuns who stood quietly against the terror of the guillotine as they willingly sacrificed their lives to bring sanity and stability back to France. This view of revolutionary France and it's real impact on society and religion is well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is the fifth volume in Mr. Caroll's series on the history of Christendom; and I have read them all. It really saddens me to not recommend this book after enjoying the first three volumes, but I should have realized something was up when I was reading the fourth and began to wonder if I was reading an original text or just a collection of quotes. The unfortunate stroke suffered by Mr. Caroll apparently played a large part in the sudden downturn in the quality of his manuscripts. I would attribute no more than 25% of this book as original literature, with the remainder being extensive quotes from other authors and direct lifts (entire chapters) from his previous work, \\"The Guillotine and the Cross.\\" As it is this final volume, which should have been the crowning achievement of Mr. Caroll's life long work, in no way serves as a viable history of Christendom during this period. I regret that it would have been better if it had gone unwritten."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS FIRST CD IS GOOD ONE.

And I was slightly disappointed when I opened the booklet inside and found he doesn't look like Prince so much... But I think he is influenced by Prince's music and he tries to sing in a falsetto voice like P in some songs on this cd. His voice is sexy,emotional,but not wet one. And songs are funky, stylish,sometimes moody. If you hear 'Careless Whisper' which coverd a famous hit, you want to hear more songs of this talented young sexy guy who produces himself.

The entire contents of this book could have been written on a double sided sheet of paper. It is patronising, drawn out and overly politically correct. Very disappointing read. This might be relevant for someone who works in a very junior role in the public service but is of no value for middle or senior management in any kind of modern organisation.

The historical research is shotty and the biblical exegesis is horrible, even offensive in places. As a Christian Bible student and an African-American, I can confidently and credibly say the Bible speaks nothing, I repeat, nothing of the return to glory of African-Americans. It speaks clearly and overwhelming of the Return of Christ in Glory. I don't advocate the burning of books. Just return this one to the shelf and see if it might spontaneously combust. Hopefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"no real stirring here","review":"A bit disappointed, maybe because I'm a grown up...The first half of the book is a bit informative and interesting, but I waited for more historical facts, and not an analysis of the holy scriptures. I live in Europe where people don't read the Bible as if it was history. We consider it more metaphorical. So if the authors are really heading towards glory, this is not the way for our black youth here in France. The second half of the book appears useless. I think it's just there to show that some white folks care. It doesn't really help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Countdown to the Shakedown","review":"I truly disagreed with the negative reviews. It is obvious that it was not of a african-american but rather that of another race. The authors have captured the beauty of God through the essence of the black people of ancient. History has been told over and over but this was His story and now it is our story. Racism will end just as this world will. I applaud the two brothers in spirit for touching and agreeing in the mighty movement and plan of God for mankind and his Glory.

(She's got HIS biological child, due to a mix-up in the IVF clinic.) I could have accepted the marriage of convenience, so that they can each be close to their biological child (and there's the convenient fact that they are both madly attracted to each other). But the spineless and helpless heroine who dumps everything to do what the hero tells her, really annoyed me. The hero is not much to write home about either - he's a stiff, and too controlling, taking over the heroine too much (but then, she allows it.)If the author had only written stronger, more attractive characters, and given the reader a more reasonable give-n-take between them, this would have been a good quick romantic read. As it is, it's pretty poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correction - Lisbon IS NOT IN SPAIN","review":"As a portuguese I would like to make a correction for those (few I hope) that still think Portugal is a spanish province.

I use this book in my classroom not only for the international aspect, but also because it deals with people believing differently from eachother. Accepting and understanding the diversity among people is a difficult concept for early learners to understand. The 5-8 year old age group especially need to hear the message of tolerance, for they will be encountering a more diverse population as they enter into their elementary classrooms. When we read this story we have lots of discussions about how the holidays are celebrated throughout the world and in our own homes. We all have different traditions and beliefs, which is wonderful. It's important for children to understand that everyone does not have to agree. We can all respect eachothers differences while maintaining our own beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best or not the best?","review":"I see a lot of reviews declaring each book the best one yet read. I can't say that about any of the in Death series. They all hav their own best traits.

But when suddenly the actors are not moving after the final scene it is quickly figured out that the lead actor is dead and not acting. So it is a murder with thousands of witnesses. This leads to some interesting characters etc..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Just another exmaple of how good a writer Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb is. The idea in this book is wonderful. It was funny and clever. The ending is a real twist, and when you finally learn who the killer is you'll be stunned. We learn some more about Eve's feelings about her past. We also learn something about Roarke. Read the book, it's another winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great story","review":"As I make my way through the in death series I can't help but be amazed at Robb's writing style. I love Lt.

Look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good - but not my favorite","review":"Let me start by saying that I love the \\"In Death\\" series and Nora Roberts is the best.

Peabody and McNab are in a relationship and Trueheart becomes part of Eve's team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I like this series for what it is... A nice little popcorn mystery with some sex thrown in for good measure. I will grant you the sex is a bit bland, the mystery if a bit predictable, but I find these In Death titles to be great palate cleansers in between some of the bigger more sweeping epics I read, so its all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing I've read other books in the series","review":"I've read most of J.D. Rob's \\"Death\\" series. If I had started with this one I would never have bothered with a second book.Eve Dallas is a hard edged, self centered snot in this book. Because she suffered as a child she hates everyone else -- it seems. The way she informs a couple of suspects about their connections to the dead guy -- should have been grounds for dismissal from the police force -- because she was unable to separate her ongoing belly aching. Dallas needs to grow up -- too much of the Eve Dallas angst.I doubt that I'll even finish this book -- yes it is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I knew what the rest of you see in this!","review":"My husband read about 200 pages and quit and I'm at about 100 pages and that's it. Maybe we shouldn't have started so late in the series but I can't imagine wanting to read any others. There's nothing attractive about Eve Dallas and I can't imagine what her gorgeous, billionaire, great in bed husband sees in her (isn't he just what ALL women want?). Their romance is as realistic as a Danielle Steele novel. The mystery is not compelling. Who cares if this jerk was murdered? And it is truly poorly written! I'd give it 0 stars if I could!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witness in Death: Back on Top!","review":"I've read all of the \\"In Death\\" books and I've got to say this is one of the very best in the series. Frankly, I had started to get a little bit bored with the last couple of titles. But I think NoraRoberts/J.D. Robb is simply back in top form with \\"Witness\\" bringing the kind of depth to her characterizations and storytelling that I had begun to miss. All of the regular cast of characters is back, stronger than ever. Familiar, but with a few surprises. As for Eve and Roarke, what can I say? I have never been so hooked into a fictional couple as I am these two. They are just so vivid and sexy and smart. I just love them. This is a really, really good, relaxing read. And I can hardly wait for October for the next installment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling and must have read!","review":"Great spot to start and then start from the beginning to know the characters and just an amazin storyline to get hooked on, I've read and read them over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm intrigued!","review":"Witness in Death is my introduction to Eve Dallas. What a great character, so complex and well developed. The relationship between Eve and Roarke is enviable. Their love and respect for each other is evident in every thought and deed. I really believe that Eve is not impressed with all his money, and that's refreshing. It's great to read about a strong woman. I have to read the whole series from the beginning to find out how they met and fell in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"For High School Musical lovers only!","review":"We played this last night and had a lot of fun.

I don't know yet if the questions will become repetitive over time rendering the game too easy but for now it is a boat load of fun.My only complaint (and it is a small one), is that the game is narrated by the Mrs. Darbus character.

They were so excited to get it, and couldn't wait to play the game. Unfortunately, after we played the game for about 15 minutes, they got bored and wanted to stop.

Save your money for the \\"Jump In\\" CD - the next hot Disney TV musical out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Game!","review":"My daughter, 9, and I play this game all the time. They have many different questions and the directions are easy to follow. I am even learning the dance steps!

I have had it for over a year now and it still works just fine. I only use it once a month or so, but when I need it, I am very happy to have it.I have two problems with this device that drag it down to two stars;1) The case is starting to split a bit along the edge. It has been that way for a while, and not getting worse, but it does detract from the product.

The story focuses on a mysterious lightning storm that somehow converts electrical energy into a self-serving, intelligent killer. A little boy (Joey Lawrence) is visiting his father and new bride in California and he is convinced there are voices in the electricity. Cliff DeYoung is lifeless in his role as dad; Roxanne Hart brings some conviction to her role as the new wife. We're never really sure just what is going on and how electrical energy can also manage to lock doors, including a shower door and all the terror elements are so underplayed, they're never really all that threatening."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good 80's Sci-Fi/Horror!\\"","review":"Joey Lawrence and Cliff De Young star in this 1988sci-fi/horror film.

I look forward to hearing of other people who placed their orders and did receive a pack of 6 boxes of tea for this order. Amazon refunded my purchase price and let me keep the two boxes of tea by the way. The only reason I gave this one star was because of the order fulfillmet problems.

However, the thing that made the album of interest to Elvis collectors was the fact that two of the songs are different versions than had previously been released. \\"Make the World Go Away\\" is alternate take 2 and \\"I Can't Stop Loving You\\" is from the matinee Madison Square Garden Show (which is now available asAn Afternoon in the Garden).

The songs, with the exception of two were previously released and the haphazard compiling of tracks was typical of RCA's Camden, later Pickwick, series. Who in their right minds puts one track recorded in 1958 a few live tracks from the early 70's including one from the massive seller Aloha from Hawaii, and some others from studio recordings done in 1970? Seriously. I bought a used a copy for $3.00 at the local record store just to have a copy of a record I didn't have. Even in it's time it was a ridiculous compilation and now it's even more ridiculous. It just shows the lack of concern Elvis himself had over how his music was being distributed.

Although the first solo's by Ace and Peter were great (Ace) and good (Peter).So what can I make of the Catmans newest piece . I could not even get through it. His voice cannot , I repeat handle a full album of slow numbers. It just is not that strong and the songwriting is at best , weak. There are two decent numbers here but that is it.

This album sounds as if it was thrown together over a weekend, I understand trying to capture that organic, genuine ambiance, but you risk coming off sounding amateurish, and unfortunately with this effort it's the latter.

Probably Ace won't ever talk to him after this one!!!I have given it a second (and a 3rd, and a 4th...) try and, well, there's something here, and there, some hooks, some melodies... but the problem is that not very many people will be as patient as me giving it so many chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Producer required","review":"A producer is an important though invisible member of any band.

As far as his drumming goes I was fooled like the rest of you. The stuff he did while he was in Kiss sounded great didn't it. Until we all grew up and realized how many special effects went into his soloing. His drumming is mediocre at best and as he has gotten older it's gotten worse. When he came back for that reunion tour his drumming was terrible. His timing was way off and there is no way he played drums on the \\"Psycho Circus\\" album. That was all Eric Singer.

A real cruel joke.I mean it's so bad that it is real interesting.May be this album is made by the homeless guy who claimed to be Peter Criss in the late 80s(or there about).It's really weird to think that this guy is a millionair because of music.

It will cure insomnia!! This is a very disappointing album. I am a huge Kiss fan and I really like Peter's first solo album very much. Now in purchasing this I knew not to expect anything sounding like Kiss at all. Not even expecting anything hard rock oriented. But I at least expected something with some sort of groove, like his first solo album. There is absolutley no rhythm or groove anywhere on the record. The album is so slow and dragged out and there seems to be no style to it. This is beyond soft rock, it's sleep music. Not one upbeat song here.

Good to see Peter being true to himself. Dont expect a Kiss sound here but expect something alot deeper and heartfelt. Good to see Peter finnaly producing. Ive heard Pauls and Genes latest solo albums and Petes is much more enjoyable to me it's more of a grown up album then theirs. Best songs are \\"Doesn't Get Better Than This\\" , \\"Last Night\\" (love the acoustic guitar) and \\"Send In The Clowns\\". ...Peter should have been taking control of his music like this all along. ***** Stars.*****After listening to this cd some more There is one track that really stands out and I believe if released as a single on adult contemporary or even country the track \\"Falling All Over Again\\" with the right airplay could be a minor hit for Peter. It's also penned by him as are 9 of the 12 tracks.******"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Pete, but this one sucks.","review":"Love this guy & everything he has done besides this.

What really got to me was the voice. Margo Timmons is a Goddess. Her voice is sultry and chilling.

During this period, drugs were in control, and he was not able to play as he could before. He is weak, out of energy, quiet and dull. He has also lost his looks since the fifties. This is not Elvis at all, and don't be fooled. This CD looks like it has a lot of good songs on it. Elvis is two verses short on \\"Johnny B. Goode,\\" two verses short on \\"What I'd Say,\\" and two verses short on \\"Jailhouse Rock.\\" How can you like music that's only half of the music? I feel bad for Elvis; I really do.Still, there are a couple good songs in here, such as \\"Hound Dog,\\" and \\"That's All Right Mama,\\" and for those two songs I give it two stars. Other than that, I really didn't think this album was very good.If you want to hear Elvis, and not this weak old guy, I'd recomend The '68 Comeback Special, or Live at Madison Square Gardens."},{"rating":"2","title":"27 Years On, We Still Love Him","review":"Recorded in June, 1977, \\"Elvis In Concert\\" was the last cd Elvis ever recorded. It was the soundtrack to a tv special (which to this day, hardened wife Priscilla will not allow shown) and it proves that even eight weeks before he left us, he still had the flare in him. We're just lucky to have this magic recording.Like fine wine, Elvis's voice sparkles on this collection. From \\"Hurt\\" to \\"You Gave A Mountain\\" to the stunning \\"How Great Thou Art\\", everything here hits the spot. Another thing prominent here is Elvis's genuine sense of humor, most prevalent on the spoken interlude in \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight\\".When you listen to this collection, you'll surely feel a ray of happiness shine through. But the ultimate emotion is sadness when one considers the fact that this was the last recorded work of a man who devoted his life to making others' lives much, much happier lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfortunate ending to a landmark life","review":"As doped as Elvis was, he still pulls off some miracles on this record. But unfortunately, RCA seemed to be cashing in on his death with the release of this double album. \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight\\" is truly sad, as he forgets the words and laughs his way through the \\"Act one\\" part. On \\"My Way,\\" he says, \\"I don't know the words, so I'm reading off a piece of paper.\\" Sad, sad, sad. Plus, RCA put on fan responses to his death in another cheap ploy to milk his death to the bone. For Elvis enthusiasts only."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"This album is awesome. There are so many great tracks on thisalbum I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start at See SeeRider. This is the best version RCA ever recorded. Its really upbeat. The Teddy Bear/Don't Be Cruel melody is also very good. Hurt was never better. I really don't want to know sounds very lonley which makes it sound awesome. My favorite version of You gave me a mountain is on this album. The I Got A Women/Amen melody is awesome because of its raw energy. If you love me let me know is also very good. There is a ok version of Jailhouse Rock on this album. Overall a really good buy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to him slip away","review":"One of his last concerts is difficult to listen to. Elvis forgets his lyrics and is obviously barely going through the motions. At this point in time, he is incapable of performing. A mere shadow of the man who stunned the world a few years earlier with his NBC special. The glorious pictures on the cover are not indicative of the contents of this CD. A sad finale to one of the greatest performers of all time as he would be gone a few months after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad ending","review":"As a historical document I suppose the album has merit, but was what a shame this was released. It serves more to show the decline of Elvis more than anything. He should have been in the hospital rather than on stage. It is still enjoyable on some level- I mean this is Elvis we're talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the way to remember Elvis","review":"Like every other Elvis album I ran to buy it on release, but in the cold light of day the performances are generally average, and many sub standard. His ill health is showing and his voice is lacking on some songs, most notably \\"FairyTale\\", \\"Little Sister\\" and \\"Hawaiian Wedding Song\\". When Elvis speaks he sounds laboured and it hurts to hear. It is not all down, the version of \\"I Really Don't Want to Know\\" and \\"My Way\\" stand up well, and Elvis still hows his enjoyment of being before a live audience. However in light of many other live recordings released before and after his death, this collection simply is poor. It may have been the last concert tour, last TV special, and for that it is memorable, more than it is for the performance. If you want to remember Elvis at his live best, try the \\"On Stage\\", \\"Thats The Way it Is box set, or some of the tracks from \\"Burning Love\\" or \\"Walk a Mile in My Shoes\\" masters and remember the king the best way."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Dissapointments here!","review":"Elvis' voice was terrific and his delivery will be yours to enjoy for many years.

It would be his last birthday. This CD is the soundtrack to a TV special filmed in June of 1977, on Elvis' last concert tour. He was bloated, weak and ill, but that didn't stop him from putting on a good show. He put all the strength he had left into this show. He takes the stage and gives an energetic performance of \\"See See Rider\\"; this is followed by a mix of old and new hits. Occasionally he sound bored or tired, but his powerful renditions of gospel songs make up for that.

I can only assume that this was the author's first attempt at writing poetry, as it needs much improvement to be considered \`top class'.The poems conveyed messages that portray Christianity as a violent religion setting out to convert and subjugate followers of other faiths. Whilst it is true to say that in mediaeval times Christians took part in the crusades, which involved a certain amount of violence etc., it is a fallacy to suggest this is still the case.As a Christian I've always alluded to the view that Christianity is a tolerant faith preaching goodwill to all mankind.I would recommend giving this one a miss because it gives an inaccurate impression of Christianity and may cause offence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor and presents an ante diluvian view of christianity","review":"The quality of this piece of literature is amongst the poorest I have ever read. The standard of English used was very poor indeed. The langauage used in some of the poems did not flow well and this made it particularly annoying to read.e.g. What led this leader of a violent mobPersecuting ChristiansTo this stage?To pen a letterTo churches in GalatiaIn encouragementAnd supportA masterpiece of the didactic epistleA part of the christian canonNeed I say more?The messages conveyed within some of the poems portray Christianity as religion that tolerates and uses violence to achieve its aims. I can only assume that the author holds rather ante diluvian views when it comes to the Christian religion.If you enjoy reading good poetry, this book is best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incites religious hatred","review":"I found Kim's poems very frustrating to read. The quality of the poetry is of the lowest order, I've seen better from 6 year olds in a primary school. The messages conveyed by the poems are inciteful as they preach the dominance of Christianity over other religions such as Islam. As a Muslim I find this particularly distasteful. This book is certainly worth buying since it highly condescending and preachy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money!","review":"I was unpleasantly surprised at the atrocious standard of poetry in this book.I would describe these poems as a series of rants rather than poetry. The author, Kim, tries to put forward the idea that Christians must stand up to supposed oppression from Jews (non existent) with violence; using the worst poetry imaginable. The material presented in these rants would be disagreeable to most readers, especially those of the Christian faith, who would be shocked to find that a so called expert in Christianity is encouraging violence on a false pretext. Most Christians will concur with me that Christianity preaches tolerance and peace e.g. love thy enemy etc.This book is certainly not a good read and a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poor poetry conveying violence and intolerance!","review":"When I started to read through these poems, I found the messages being conveyed somewhat disconcerting.It seems as though Kim is trying to portray Christianity as a violent, intolerant and uncompromising religion. This impression of Christianity couldn't be farther from the truth. As a regular church-going Christian, I've always been taught that we must tolerate people of other faiths and beliefs rather than subjugate them to our way of thinking. Kim singles out the Jews for his worst vitriolic attacks and this is likely to cause offence to Jewish readers.It appears to me, from reading these poems that Kim is a rather inexperienced poet. The standard was disappointing low and if I didn't know better I would question as to whether these literary works constitute poetry.These poems should be avoided since they put Christianity in a very bad light and are not representative of the religion as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mormon and Pyschic based program","review":"I was shocked to find out that this program is filled with Mormon theology.

Nothing.I know well and own recordings of these amazing harpsichord sonatas by Landowska, Kirkpatrick, Valenti, Pinnock, Kipnis, Belder and others. All have their virtues. But Ross's mastering of these 500 plus sonatas in a year or so, to produce non-mechanical, far from routine run-throughs, is sui generis. Ross seems influenced by Valenti, particularly, but retains an expressiveness and vitality that even Valenti began to lose as his old Westminster LPs were being spewed out.Even to \\"recommend\\" this set seems a bit ridiculous, like \\"recommending\\" the Grand Canyon.Harold Fromm"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This is one of the greatest recordings ever made. The music is of course endlessly inventive, and Ross's technically perfect execution and almost metronomically steady rhythm, while never losing the Iberian, flamenco-like fireworks of these sonatas, also makes clear that they are Baroque compositions, carefully structured and intellectually interesting at almost every moment.

Fantastic DTS sound, great songs, and a great performance by the Mark III lineup. I've always been a huge fan of DP, especially Mark II and III of course. I had seen clips from the CalJam Vid, but it is amazing in its entirety.I prefer Mark III sticking with Mark III songs, and the picture is a little jerky due to the digital transfer, but those are minor complaints. Glenn Hughes whooping is a little over the top, but all in all this is a must-have for DP fans who appreciate what each lineup has to offer.I'm not going to analyze song by song, I'll just summarize by saying it's a great show capturing DP in fine form performing in front of an overwhelmingly large crowd on a California Spring evening in 1974. Blackmore is great, vocals are wonderful, and the demolition at the end was pretty spectacular. VERY entertaining.

Both vocally and your in between song banter. Those are my 2 main gripes, but they are big, and really ruin the experiencing watching this.

Wish I could find her and tell her thanks for such a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can having lice really have a humorous side?","review":"The authors seem to think so, and you might also after reading this. There is a lot of controversy surrounding head lice today. This book is a great reference to the variety of techniques as well as a delightfully entertaining guide to their own chosen style of eliminating the determined pests. The book treats the readers with respect. The straight forward honesty of the writers is refreshing and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very smooth bright tea without any bite","review":"This is a fantastic alternative when you need a little pick me up to start the day. The lemon myrtle adds a refreshing bright lemon essence without the bitterness of real lemon. I like both green tea and yerba mate tea but love this blend the most. The combination brings out the best in all the flavors. There is a mild stimulant effect from caffeine from the green tea and/or mateine from the yerba mate, but it isn't like the jolt and eventual crash you get from coffee. If you forget to take out the bag after the recommended steep time, it's okay because the tea does not get bitter! It's a very smooth tea all the way around. Though it's becoming easier to find Numi teas, this variety has been difficult to find so I am happy that Amazon carries it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"numi tea has the best taste","review":"i let other people try my tea...they loved it...but, they expect me to order for them....thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUXS DONT BUY IT!!!!!","review":"this cd really suxs beacuse when i went to go but it and i listened to it it is an interview. there is no music on this cd at all! it is a biography on how they made it big and it was boring so dont cheat yourself out of 10 dollas people"},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, indeed","review":"this is a great dvd from start to finish. the way the solos were done at the begining and brufords drumming as far as i'm concerned was beyond great, i know some don't like the electric drums but this works for me, the sound is great and so is the video. i have 2 other yes videos, as of right now i would put this one in front of the others as my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adequate for the price","review":"With the price below $30 for a Noise-cancellation headphone, it does what it supposes to do. For my information, Noise-reduction is a more appropriate word describing this headphone, since I don't think there is one headphone that can eliminate outside noise totally, even those with price over hundreds of bucks. So why not giving a try to this nice and light one at first and having some impression of what on earth Noise-reduction feature can bring you. Although there is kind of humming sound while the Noise-reduction feature is on, it's not so loud that I can barely live with it. it's comfortable wearing over head since it's light. It's easy to carry around since it's collapsible and comes with a travel bag. I am going to love it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"Reading Erik Mann's review above was just like living my own experience. I bought these headphones for their noise canceling ability, attractive price, small package and easy folding capability. All these features definitely get a big thumbs up from me.The sound, however, is very disappointing. I used these with my 5G Ipod and took a good lot of time to try and adjust the sound various ways so I can enjoy it, but to no avail. The Ipod stock earphones sound a LOT better, even on a plane if you lock them into your ear by twisting them so the pieces of wire shooting out of the ear buds points up towards your temples.I guess I will just keep looking for better cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I used the Bose once before and these seem to do a comparable job for a fraction of the price. I think those who say that there is no noise cancellation, just white noise are wrong. I thought the same thing as well when I first put them on. I was in a quiet room without any ambient noise. However once I got into a room with a lot of ambient noise (like a server room), the difference was easy to hear.Dunno how long they are going to last or how they compare to the Bose, but for about $20, I'm not complaining yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Quality","review":"When powered on a noticable hiss is present in the background. While the noise cancelling part does an adequate job, it's not great. Headphones are very comfortable to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noice Cancelling ? You gotta be kidding","review":"These headphones are just plain horrible. Looks are very deceptive, they look great out of the box but peformance is horrible. When there is no audio and the switch is on, it creates humming and is really unfcomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It","review":"I got it thrown in for free when I purchased my MP3 player. Without the noise cancellation turned on, I needed to increase the volume to almost double. But I could still listen to songs just fine after that. The noise cancellation feature is of course awesome. With it turned on, I'm like completely zoned out from the rest of the world - free from any distracting noises.I also find the soft cushionny 'ear muffs' very comfortable and even after using it for hours, my ears were a-ok and not at all sore.To think I got it for free. It's a steal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, Almost no hiss when on.","review":"Inexpensive, great sound, reasonably portable, diminishes ambient noise considerably, comfortable to use on extended periods of time, great value.Decent battery life, just remember to turn it off when you are not using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Pond block does not work at all.

Five stars for this cd and for Drunk in Public"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pop Punk","review":"This is a nice pop punk album that rolls along with a nice consistancy.

It's kind of hard to describe what they sound like, but in any case they're awesome. I definitely recomend this cd.If you like Lagwagon, Good Riddance, or Millencolin I think you'll end up liking this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scene-It, Music edition","review":"Not extremely extension on the music trivia (wish there were more pre-1970's trivia), but it is a fun game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This is a great game if you're a music buff. It seems to concentrate more on the 70s and newer music. There are a lot of good questions, things you have a good chance of knowing. The only problem I see is once you stop playing then go back to it some questions get repeated even though you can do a \\"preset\\" game play to choose up to 20 different plays. I don't know if that's because of the DVD player or not. Overall, it's a very fun game."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Chicana Lit","review":"Sofía's Saints, López's first novel, is a strong contribution to Chicano Literature. This Tejana crafts an engaging narrative around the life and experiences of a Chicana who bridges her faith in her Art with the strength of friends in the absence of familia. Once a \\"milagro\\" occurs, the life of Sofía is cast in an equal amount of mystery and discovery. López is a talented young writer who will surely create more blessings in the years ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying read","review":"This is a wonderfully written book especially considering it is her first. Sofia is looking for magic and the answers to her life while trying to make a living as a waitress and selling her art. She burns the images of saints into wood. The book immerses the reader in the Corpus Christi Tejano culture. I couldn't wait to see how the story would end. I felt satisfied with the whole story. It is like a circle that is complete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fantastic!!!","review":"One word can describe this book......AMAZING!.....This book has great art work of american, british, german, and japanese bomber planes, and some fighters. Most of the illustrations were based on actual events which took place in the air, and the illustrations make those events come alive. This book was definitely worth the price, and i would recomend it to any war buff, plane buff, or artist........either way, its a great book to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psychophantic","review":"This book spoilt by being too psychophantic.

If you read only one lesbian nun book, let it be that one. You'll probably want to check out this one after reading that one, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"good account of a very bad period","review":"For anybody interested in Argentina's Dirty War, this book is a must have. Verbitsky was in the midst of it and he uses his journalist pen well to show the reader what went on in this dark episode. For the families of the victims, the recent convictions of some of the men in charge, must have come as a great victory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"Not very good, had to send the first one back because it was shipped with a broken screen. a bit complicated to figure out and you cant really choose what you want to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not open the box","review":"I received delivery late and did not even open the box.I return the merchandize and want to make sure I got credit back to my name or email addressAny questions please call or email meThanksPrakash Shah"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first!","review":"John Denver's Greatest Hits, Volume II, delivers one of the rarest situations in musical compilations: a second GH collection that is better than the first.This disk contains 12 tracks which represent the full range of Denver's tremendous talents. There are wonderful, heart-tugging ballads like Annie's Song and Fly Away; tongue-in-cheek good-natured ditties like Thank God I'm a Country Boy; and the beautiful, multi-tiered tribute to Jacques Cousteau, Calypso.The only reason this collection is rated at 5-stars is that 6-stars isn't available.

Editors and Publishers expect our work to be 10 or 12 font size, and double spaced. This book, I am not being sarcastic, but I can barely read the writing!!!

Thanks for Nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is a waste of money","review":"I paid 9.99 for the Kindle edition of this book, and the thing that infuriates me more than anything about e-books is that I can't return them for a refund. This edition is the most poorly formatted piece of garbage I've ever had the displeasure of shelling out my hard earned money for. I have read self-published books by teenagers that showed more attention to quality than this. I read the print version of this book, and there was no problem. The Kindle version? Rife with spelling errors, missing passages, and completely nonsensical phrases that look like the formatter skipped over a line or 10. For example, page 46: \\"Besides, by the time backwards into my unconscious thought.\\" That is not even a complete sentence! \\"x\\" is substituted for apostrophes and entire pages are left blank when there should be text. When I set down money for something, I expect quality, and this is not a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one should be pulled from the shelves!","review":"I can't believe this version of this album still exists because Capital has released this same album from the master recordings. The ONLY difference is this one has 2 extra tracks (12\\" extended versions.) For $45, I can locate the two 12 inches and Capital's version, plus buy another used CD! PTG played themselves on this one, but still one of the best when it comes to recording CD's from vinyl. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike BB&Q at all or this album.

But it's downfall is the winning rule. Whom ever gets the larges fenced in area wins the game. But I like the game it plays well with 2-4 players.

However, the updated sections are frankly a bit skimpy.The heart of the book still remains a highly detailed description of the core x86 architecture, which is invaluable.Mueller has retained all of this material since he probably exerted a great deal of effort in writing them for the 1st edition. However, the newer material, which is equally important, lacks the same kind of depth. So the \\"Indispensible PC hardware book\\" is no longer enough on it's own. Something like Scott Mueller's \\"Upgrading and Repairing PCs\\" is needed to complement Messmer's otherwise excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on Hardware I have ever read","review":"I have been working on and with computers for them for 15 years now and this is the only book that I have ever bought every single edition of. If you want to understand how your computer components really work and how all of the pieces come together then get this book and set aside a couple of weeks to read it. It is without a doubt the best and most accessable book I have read on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good update, though Mr McGreary is blaming the wrong folk","review":"A useful book for getting to grips with the basics of, especially older, PCs.I think Mr. McGreary is being unfair. I looked at this and earlier editions and noted that the clunky language I suppose he is complaining about is there in the older editions, not translated by Transcript Alba.I know that in these situations that publishers often are only willing to pay for translation of the actual updates and the updated bits look fine to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Graceland Sessions are among Elvis' best work ever!","review":"Moody Blue in its new form captures all the musical beauty and feeling of Elvis' 1976 Graceland Sessions (recorded in the Jungle Room). There is not a bad song in this set. Hurt, For the Heart, Moody Blue, She Thinks I still Care, It's Easy For You, and all of these display Elvis' ability to get in a song and sing it from the inside out. He truly feels what he sings. This set is a must have that stands up against the Sun Sessions, The 1969 Memphis Sessions, and any of the Nashville Sessions. The live tracts add flavor and feel. Elvis was far from being washed up in the late 1970s. The RCA Jungle Room Sessions CD (Elvis Collector's Label) is a great companion to this CD. You'll play both over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"WE REMEMBER THE SADNESS AND WASTE","review":"The only reason to listen to Moody Blue is to remember how ill Elvis Presley was from suffering from the debilitating effects of prolonged drug abuse when he recorded the songs that are found on this last recording of his life. Moody Blue helps us remember the sadness and sense of waste that surrounded the last stages of Elvis' life.John"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although this is a great way to get two albums in one CD, the song LET ME BE THERE is not included on this CD.

Divided between studio pieces and live recordings, MOODY BLUE displays a singer who continued to care deeply about the material he recorded and put everything he had into it. Perhaps the finest track is the eerily presicent \\"Way Down,\\" in which Elvis almost seems to predict his own demise. You'll hear a commited vocal performance. Other tracks spotlight the tight playing of Elvis's band in concert. The first 100,000 copies of this album were originally produced on blue vinyl, and I was lucky enough to have bought one at the age of 12. I've since lost it to time, but will always treasure having a record of Elvis's final performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 5 Stars+","review":"I don't understand why Moody Blue has been rated only 4 stars.

I of course have the blue vinyl original, but that's because I'm a cool kid. But this is overall an awesome album.

His introduction says it clearly: \\"Like onion, chronic illness is the result of many layers, each building on the one before. To get to the center of your healing, we must peel back these layers, one by one, together\\" (p. 9).It is not only informative by providing resourceful links, but quite relevant for serious seekers.

I assumed it would be a sweet little story, about a family dealing with a flood; and it is. But it is so much more than that. It is about neighbors, and the bonds we share with them. It is about bravery, strength of character, and love. It is based on a real-life event, The Vermont Flood of 1927. It snuck right up on me, and at the end of the story, my 6 year old looked up and said, \\"Mommy, you're crying.\\" The watercolor illustrations by Emily Arnold McCully are very nice too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling story, historically accurate","review":"This compelling story was hard to put down.

She felt it would have been an excellent non-fiction title (based on the true story of Carrie McGavock).As fiction though, she dismisses it as \\"an overwrought, overwritten novel that misses conveying the war's terrible reality and the courage of one woman.\\" Somehow the author failed to \\"perform that literary alchemy that transforms information into a believable plot and compelling characters.\\" The reviewer points out the author's failure in keeping the language true to the time.Personally I think it sounds worth a read, as long as the reader doesn't expect the heart-touching prose of Gone With the Wind or Cold Mountain.

I found it to be a very good book.Whether the reader is a Civil War buff or just into enjoying a good story, I think he/she will enjoy the book. There is enough of the usual Civil War horror to satisfy those into battles, but there is also a lot of unusual writing about the interactions between the wounded soldiers and the family. The family has their house turned into a hospital which provides the stage for much of the action.I was sufficiently moved by the book to plan a trip to Franklin to see the house and the cemetary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish this travesty","review":"I stopped reading this book when Carrie McGavock, a character based on a real person, beat a wounded soldier with a crutch.

I love books about the Civil War and have read many. But the characters, oh dear, the characters. Was Carrie McGavock just downright nuts? She comes across that way. Some elements are confusing, such the early-on confiscation of Carnton Plantation by the Union; I didn't expect to see John McGavock again after his encounter with Union troops, and the miserable, pointless execution of a wounded mule. I don't find the characters sympathetic, just odd. The true story of this place in Franklin is probably very interesting.Fictitious or real, I couldn't stick with it.

I know that it is an accounting of an actual battle and that part of the story was mildlly interesting but the accounting of the nutty female who falls in love with a broken soldier and constantly cleans up blood; the wise slave who isn't quite in this world, the detached husband who knows his wife is involved with the soldier but doesn't care, and the children who are dead but constantly present make for a depressing and sad book.

It is a poignant story of the horrors of the Civil War, but also reflects the human condition from the standpoint of observers who were helpless to change the conditions except on a personal level with each of the wounded and dying. The author is able to make the reader feel as if they are observing the same scenes. It is also the story of a mother who, faced with the worst tragedy that life can deliver, redeemed herself by making a difference for so many whose last encounter would be with her. I expected this to be a rather sentimental account, but it was heartfelt and made me want to know more about the characters and Carton Plantation.

Carrie McGavock has a story to tell and records exist to tell it. Whether Hicks needed lessons in the methodology and raw source materials for researching historical lives or whether he simply ignored the realities of Carrie's personal world is a story that remains to be told. E. Jones's 2003 KNOWN WORLD, set in Virginia, successfully avoided this hazard by using purely fictional characters to explore a long-ignored side of Southern slaveholding. Elsewhere (Louisiana), last year's ISLE OF CANES by E. Mills sets the bar for using real lives to probe the many layers of Southern racial strife. Fiction is fiction, but when writers use a real person to portray the past, they owe it to that person to be true to his or her real self."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1!

They updated the text to say that Brother Bear was on a CELL PHONE and yet they left the picture as this antiquated phone that I could relate to but my little ones couldn't. They didn't understand what the large antenna was on the phone. This is an old book. If you took the time to update the text, spend the extra ten minutes to photoshop the phone in the picture. Not a big deal but definitely IRKSOME! Other than that, I'd say that I wasn't particularly keen on the way that they had Brother Bear speak to his parents about his 'privacy' or the way he pouts and goes off. Children are impressionable and learn the bad behaviors as well as the good ones. Not my favorite in the series but a decent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterfowl Id.","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best waterfowl identification publication available.

I blame the publisher and not the author of course. The pages are very thin and tear easily. The pages also tear away from the cheap plastic binding really easily as well. The information inside is great for beginner duck hunters and is a great way to accurately identify your daily bag. I recommend taking off the spiral binding and laminating the pages that you will use most. Then use a hole punch and a small key ring to keep them together. Again, the consumer should never have to do that, but the book itself if very useful for a waterfowler just starting out and definatley worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waterfowl Identification Methods","review":"This publication is the best in-hand device I have seen, for determining species of ducks.

Written just three years after the Cuban Missile Crisis, it is surprising to find an author unfazed by the idiotic governments around him.The book is also a shock and a joy as it includes scenes of S&M;, clear references to homosexuality and covers some of the brutal methods that information was gathered from prisoners.

He also ignored many of the obviously collectible bikes that are out there now-- H2 Kawasakis, Sand-cast 750 Hondas, the Italian lightweights of the 50s and 60s, etc. I was not all that impressed with the author's knowledge of bikes or their values whatsoever.

Almost all wear crumpled hats and most wear ties with their greasy rags. These photo's were taken at the turn of the last century. These were tough hardscrabble people who founded our state. It took people like these tame California back then. These definitely are not sissys or wussies. Their stories are interesting a spurned lover a homesick boy.

While the subject may be noteworthy (or maybe not - that's arguable), the author's approach is entirely immoral and self-centered.

Between his Yoko Ono impressions and his blaring bass clarinet solos Arrington De Dionyso is no ordinary musician.

It was also stupid. From the acting to the story line, it was horrific! You don't care at all about the characters, to the point that you actually want to see them get devoured by a giant serpent. I know that I was screaming, \\"Just eat her and end this movie!\\". Do not waste your time to watch this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars if possible","review":"Don't waste the 90 minutes of your life. I gave up at the 30 minute mark, when they still weren't out of the first flashback. I assume somewhere in the movie there were going to be dragons in modern times, but I wasn't going to stick around for them.P.S. Any movie which refers to Dragons as \\"Imoogies\\" should be shunned out of principle."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"a horrible movie, the plot & acting sucks, there's only 1 dragon in it & he's only in it for 4 of the last 10 minutes, there's just to mcuh wrong with, lets just say it was like a sci-fi channel original movie with a slightly higher budget, I even recognized 1 of the locations from a sci-fi channel dragon movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Falling asleep","review":"I keep trying to watch this movie but each time I fall asleep. There is very little I can tell you about the movie so no spoiler alerts here. I can tell you it is the best medicine if you are having sleepimg problems. The cover art makes the movie look really good. I fall asleep so quickly I never get to see the Dragon is there a dragon or dragons in this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon Wars Dragon Snores","review":"I can only compare watching this movie to watching a train wreck you want to look away but can't; you have to stay to the end just to see how bad it can get. The computer generated special effects were impressive...but just because you can do special effects with a computer doesn't mean you should...and you don't need to jam them all into one movie. If I could rate this movie lower than I hate it..I would. The only redeeming part of this movie was the poor guy from the zoo who saw the dragon eat the elephants. The plot seemed to be the hero had to protect the young woman from the bad dragon so she could be eaten by the good dragon. And where did that army come from? Who was the blonde shape shifter guy? Just thinking about it is making my head hurt. (And no I have never actually seen a train wreck)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"I have never attended a movie with such a bad story line or so many inconsistencies. The previews looked fabulous, but the movie reeked of incredibly bad dialogue, embarrassing acting and an incredulous plot. Scenes jump around unpredictably, making the whole thing not only boring, but confusing. Unexplained characters and strange religious/mythological twists also frustrate any intellectual stimulation or emotional involvement in the story.The special effects were only average when compared with the film's peers, and they ease the experience only about as much as salt can improve bad food. They just don't make a movie worth watching.The only thing that redeems this film is that its memory still gives my friends and me a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and not funny","review":"This movie is just plain bad. It is not supposed to be funny -- it is a very serious attempt to bring to life a Korean legend. I actually give this movie 1.5 stars because it's not a bad time killer while getting ready for bed -- maybe watch 15 minutes here and there.But if you think this is going to be some kind of satirical film because of the reviewer that gave it 5 stars, then you will be sorely disappointed. There are a few interesting scenes, especially at the end, but that's about it. The plot is a let down, and the movie is just too disjointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Ok, imagine that you have been given a whole of video scenes - good ones at that - and your mission is to put them together to make a movie out of them. You may add some cheap video showing dialogue between the major actors, but you are not allowed to spend money on anyone who has acting experience.That's Dragon Wars. It's a fun ride with loads of special effects, but no actual storyline that makes sense, nor any professional actors, but who cares - it's enjoyably watchable, and I've seen a lot worse acting coming out of Hollywood and a worse plots too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm...LMAO!","review":"If it wasn't for the horrible special effects, the horrible script, the horrible acting, and the horrible directing, this just might have been a good movie. I couldn't help but notice that the previews for this movie gave NO hint of what the actual story was. Anybody viewing this movie is only in it for the dragon war action which doesn't come until the last half of the movie. Before that, you're stuck with the zero-personality hero who is trying to save the zero-personality girl from the old white guy dressed in Japanese clothes and speaks in a Japanese demonic voice that doesn't match his lips at all.If you're trying to find the worst movie ever made, you must watch Dragon Wars because it's certainly in the running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have seen in at least Ten years","review":"This movie is so bad i dont know where to start special effects are terrible acting is subpar I dont think you can call it writing and directing is shameful jumping from one scene to another you feel like you skiped past seven chapters of the story in short i dont know what person felt this would make a good movie this is by far the worst bluray movie on the market that i have seen dont waste your time or money"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MOVIE -- BUT COOL POSTER","review":"I dare you to make sense of this movie.

The computer graphics is good, story line and acting both terrible. Good first big budget film from S.Korea but still a bit to go. Better than many other dragon flicks I've seen. The only problem is that the \\"real\\" dragon doesn't appear till the very end of the movie (last 5 minutes). And what's up with the Korean national folk music at the end of the movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!?!?!","review":"This was the most confusing movie I have ever seen. The acting sucked. The storyline sucked. And the battle scenes sucked. I'm pretty sure that I could have made a better movie. How do these idiot directors get the money to write these blow-hard movies? I still don't know where the heck they were at the final dragon battle, or why the heck there weren't any dragons, or why the heck those rocket launcher wielding stegosaurus things had ninjas riding on thier backs.

Total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Film","review":"This was the worst film I have ever sat through. Very bad storyline and it was just a waste of time. Do not watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"I am still amazed that I actually spent 1 hours watching this movie. The story is nothing but a collage of badly pasted flashbacks that make no sense at all. The characters are lame and the poor acting worsens the situation. CGI is not anything special at all. In summary, some films are so bad they actually make you laugh - this one is just pathetic. Spend your $20 on some teletubby DVD... it has to be more entertaining than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad","review":"While some of the visual effects were compelling towards the end, the story was just so so bad that it made it next to impossible to watch. It felt like several random video game plot lines all mashed into one. Half the time I couldn't even figure out where the characters WERE! Especially towards the end. Was it a giant cave or something? The final dragon was very well done visually but it is NOT worth sitting through it. Funnily enough it felt a lot like Transformers which I also hated. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Bad, But Mostly Good","review":"Picked this movie up at a very reasonable price. The Blu-Ray transfer was perfect. Didn't notice any grain or snow throughout. The acting was bad and it sort of reminded me of a cheesy SyFy channel made for TV movie in spots. However, the special effects were excellent in my opinion. Fun to watch, but no where near a sci-fi classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Ok, I LOVE dragons. My all time favorite dragon movie is, of course, Dragonslayer. SO, naturally I saw this and thought \\"Oh neat-o a new dragon movie!\\" What a monumentally ridiculous waste of time. The only thing that redeemed the hour and half that i wasted watching this was the appearance of the classic Asian dragon in the last few frames.The story was interesting and had SO much potential....but fell totally flat. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe next time","review":"In short, CGI sequences are great, acting bad, plot worse, dialogs are lauhgable, scenes are disjointed. If you still want to buy it be my guest but don't say I didn't warn you.Oh, one more thing, don't be fooled, this is not a comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"the previews didn't lie.","review":"Dragon Wars - D-Warthis is an excellent film! Our main characters try to escape from a beast that will never stop. There is so much action and destruction that you just cannot take it all in, even in slow motion. If you don't have a blue-ray player, buy one now and blow your friends away with this movie. I should've given it five stars -- I know you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed like it could have been good, but...","review":"once again, I find myself exceptionally disappointed with a dragon movie (past disappointments being \\"Dragonheart\\" and \\"Reign of Fire\\"). From the previews, it looked, at first glance, that D-Wars got it right. You had a battle royal betweem dragons and their allies against tanks and attack choppers within the steets of a crowded city (and this sequence is why this movie get the second star from me).Unfortunately, that is a small portion of this movie. The rest is about flashbacks and \\"destiny\\" and prophesy and \\"mystical only way to win\\" scenerios. No, the military can't defeat the dragons, only the \\"good snake\\", whatever it was called, can by eating the heroine's essence.The final battle was also far too dark and hard to view. Overall, major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I bought this movie thinking it would be worthwhile. Instead, I was very disappointed in this movie. The only positive thing going for this movie is a couple of good action scenes. The plot is lacking and hard to follow in spots as it tends to jump around. Almost any movie would be a better buy than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is Terrible","review":"I own a ton of movies, and love any sort of CG movie, but this one is the dumbest movie I that I have ever watched. I'm disappointed that I bought it.

The previews I saw on TV made this movie look like fun. I ended up skipping the chapters in the movie to skip the horrible acting and horrible story line to try and find the \\"Dragon War\\".

I like to give movies a chance and try to watch the whole thing, but this movie was just boring. The acting and script was so bad that I had to turn it off, after 30-minutes. The last hour that this movie would of taken if I finished, I used to wash dishes and play with my kids. Wow I feel sorry who would even thinking about buying this movie at full price. If I found it at Walmart for under $5, I would think long and hard before even buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for good special effects. Besides that, there's nothing worth watching in this movie.","review":"I give this movie 2 stars for good special effects. The dragon looks very real and scary. Besides that, there's nothing worth watching in this movie. The plot is about a dragon chasing down the two main characters. The acting is so bad that I felt asleep at least two times.The Host is much better. It's also made in Korea but it's more touching and suspenseful.If you like special effects, you should watch Transformers released on DVD in 2007. You'll find out what good special effects mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE","review":"ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER!!don't buy this movie the acting and plot is stupid retarded.

However, I quickly found myself fast-forwarding through the movie to avoid having to just shut down the movie completely. I am a fan of good story-telling and acting, but I'm drawn to action and to special effects. This movie had plenty of action and special effects, but it was hard to put the story together and to take it seriously with shoddy acting and directing. The plot is intriguing, but could have done without the steretypical Chinese connections to dragons and instead been about a new idea in monster movie-making. I would recommend this movie for it's great battle sequences, but you will find yourself uninterested in the back story and somewhat confused when it's all said and done....and happy too that it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragon Wars Blu-ray","review":"Dragon Wars - D-War [Blu-ray] Though not one of the best movies on dragons I collected this movie for entertainment value and the fact that it originated in the Orient."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW","review":"Not wow in a good way...

THEY ARE ABLE TO SURVIVE. The romance in this movie is just as obvious and terrible. \\"I bought you some new clothes\\" *make-out-sesion*... Oh my god... save your money and get a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever!","review":"Alright so everything's corny. The story seemed rushed and very predictable. Typical conflicts and quotes you see from so many movies. You have computer animations mixed with power ranger effects. This movie is not worth the time. Somehow the main female character is so easy she'd kiss any guy within a day and the department of defense keeps shotguns in their drawers."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can this be called a movie?","review":"This is the first time I have writen a review, because this is by far the worst movie I have seen. The effects was like watching some power rangers garbage, and the acting was also horible too. This movie made no sense and was the biggest waste of time I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the worst movie since Plan 9 from outerspace!","review":"I wanted to hang myself in the theater watching this waste of time, effort and cash. The dragons looked great.. the effects were awesome, the dialog and story was so bad I expected Ed Wood to rise from his grave in protest ofsuch an awful mockery of entertainment being allowed to sully the medium that he so beloved. I give this movie one star under protest! as there is no zero star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expected disappointment","review":"I actually bought this movie knowing it had gotten no word of mouth endorsements this previous year, but the promo's of special effects and my love of sci fi flicks made it so I couldn't resist. I was hoping for something maybe close along the lines of \\"Reign of Fire\\" at best, instead I get something more along the lines of the mighty morphing power rangers... It also had a feel of Mortal Kombat, not the first one, the second one, Annihilation, but even that is giving this movie too much credit. Perhaps it is the seemingly disregard for a plotline. Perhaps the movie is just intended for 12 year olds. It is indeed similar to Transformers, (though that movie as well was better) in that it is slow, slow, a little action, slow , slow some more, and two big fight scenes at the end which are pretty cool. So pretty much do like I did and watch it at double speed till the last thirty minutes...The CG at the end is good, but the rest is just unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best bands ever!","review":"There are not too many bands or artists in the music industry that can say they have had THREE #1 hits, yet Starship is one of those bands. From beginning to end, this CD is filled with amazing songs that I have grown to love. Starship as a band are very underrated and overlooked, but their songs such as \\"We Built This City\\" and \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" have become 80's classics. And of all the songs I have ever heard, \\"Sara\\" is probably my favorite, and definately the best power ballad I have ever heard. \\"Good Heart\\" is also an awesome song. True, none of the members of Starship wrote their #1 hits, but no one could have performed them better. The only problem with this CD is that some songs are missing, such as \\"Desperate Heart\\" and \\"I Didn't Mean To Stay All Night\\". Nevertheless, this CD is awesome, and it is only fitting that Starship came during the best era of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The CD is great","review":"I liek this cd because I like one of the songs on it (Sara) because I know that song from beginning to end. and I like it since I was 4 years old and I'm 16 now"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll Want More Than Just Your Change Back With This","review":"I love the song We Built This City on Rock n' Roll. Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now and Sara are also pretty good. I anticipated the other songs being at least all right as I do not remember any other Starship songs however I was pretty young then so I thought I might have missed some gems. I was wrong, apart from those three songs the rest are very average and it is hard to imagine these were actually hits let alone their greatest. You will find the three big songs on many an 80's compilation album so just buy those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"very unhappy","review":"I got this CD because I wanted a nice representation of their music from this time period. The songs are mostly obscure, not the greatest hits, the quality is poor, they all sound tin like.

In 1985 Paul Kantner won the right to claim the name Jefferson so the remaining members just named Starship.I was just skeptical when I heard the band name Starship when We Built This City started to move up the charts. But I found myself loving their new name because I really liked that song which became #1 in 1986. It is too bad the DJ part of the song was deleted because I really love that part. Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now is often heard in Wedding Ceremony in Japan. (Sounding a bit strange because the title reminds me of Dustin Hoffman's The Graduate). Key To The City was originally for VU's previously unreleased debut album Phoenix Rising. Sara, It's Not Enough, Jane are my favorite hits during that era.Recommended for 80's pop rock fans. And their earlier efforts such as Red Octopus should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the best in one album!!!!","review":"\\"Starship\\" is a great collection of all their hits. I, however don't think I have the song \\"Key To The City\\" on my disc. What's up with that??

I saw these (before they were marked down) as a reasonable replacement- something which might make him happy. Well, he's delerious: claims they're so light he had to run instead of walk. It was really something to see my little guy so lit up over a pair of shoes!So we ordered another (I'm even thinking about a third).

There is no warm up, Leah just immediately jumps into exercises that require a back round in dance training to hold your balance/ body right and a good knowledge of yoga. I have been dancing for 4 years and found her jumping into working out right away dangerous. Her moves are also advanced so if you are advanced you will probably like this alot. A knowledge of yoga is a must for some of these moves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST there is...","review":"Leah work is definitely the best out there. She begins with standing work that required balance and concentration moves into some killer side plank work then moves you into mat work, finishing with work on all fours. Nothing is neglected in this workout! It's solid, effective and you'll feel great after you are through. You'll abs will be pulled in and you'll be standing up straighter. Nothing on dvd compares to typical \\"barre\\" classes but this workout certainly does! Try this and I bet you'll be so thrilled with your results that you'll be begging for more... Thankfully Leah has downloads available. I've been using them and love them all. Her dvds are a great mix of what she has for downloads but the downloads offer so much more. Try it!

My lower back and neck were hurting the next day so I'm not sure if it's the combination of moves or the lack of form cuing that was the culprit. As an avid barre and Pilates enthusiast, I always aim for perfect form and this video did little to discuss proper pelvic alignment or how to decrease tension in your neck by keeping your shoulders wide and down, etc. So if you are new to Pilates or barre, be careful with this series. I would say I'm in decent shape and the workout was semi challenging, but I didn't feel much soreness in the abs the next day, which I usually look forward too after a new workout. I would say Leah's Lower Body DVD and the Whole Body workout are the best out of the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging but fun!","review":"Fun workout, but the transitions are QUICK because the narrator instructs you instead of the person doing the workout.

Love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"So this is a great workout...I am in good shape from other types of fitness however running, etc. doesnt really prepare me for core work apparently. I feel like my abs got the workout of their life today. The moves are a little hard...keep in mind that you may not be able to do them all like she does, and there isnt anyone showing modifications. I do have terrible joints and it didnt effect them which is good and she does say things like bend your knees here if you need to, etc. I think if I do this every other day I will FINALLY have the abs I want! She is awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not really happy with this...sorry","review":"I've tried this 3 times, and the last 2 times I found really dreadful. I had a hard time with the standing abs because the camera angles were weird so I had a hard time execute the moves with proper form. And I felt like a lot of my hip flexors were working instead of the abs. I like some of the floor work, but I also had an insanely hard time because I am super inflexible and I can't straighten my legs. I'm sorry, I tried to like it.I really like the upper and the lower body DVDs though. They are really intense but more doable for me.

Any money you spend will go to the label that basically destroyed Chomsky's career. Labels aren't supposed to do that. It's amazing that a label with so much money could have so little foresight and common sense. Aezra continuously backed up tour dates, the album recording dates, and then blacklisted this record when they realised that Idol records could release songs on itunes that Aezra had foolishly elected to put on the record even though idol still had the rights to them. It's a testament to how not to run a label; Chomsky sold almost 4,000 records on little Idol Records in Dallas but big bad Aezra couldn't even hit 400. Don't do it--buy the first two records but let this one die in peace. Aezra should get 5 to 15 in the state penn for what they did to Chomsky."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST book I have found for teaching basic sign language to your baby!","review":"This book is amazing.

I didn't even get past page 75. Totally unrealistic. Characters are no better than comic book characters. The premise of the plot was wildly unrealistic. I understand that this is supposed to be a dark comedy book, and that the reader should just go along with the zaniness but there's gotta be some connection with reality. For instance, there are two deaths early in the book and the reaction of the other characters is totally unrealistic. Goodbye Gischler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many, Many Narratives","review":"This book would have been good had the writer let the characters speak for themselves. There was very little dialogue for a 550 page novel. Chapter and chapter filled with nothing but narratives which makes it a slow and drawn out read. I, too, had to read into the first 200 pages before the story started to connect. It would be good for the author to practice backdrop into storylines to get to matter of the story swifter.

Ado Annie does use a character voice that, to someone unfamiliar with the show, might be deemed annoying. However, if you're a fan of the show and the character, this Ado Annie will please. The other characters also provide decent musical performances. All listeners will be satisfied by Curly's melodic voice. Laurie is the same for the most part, however, whether it be her voice or the recording, the vocals in \\"Out of My Dreams\\" seem to grate on your ears. The only other compaint I have is that \\"Kansas City\\" is cut down to a two minute song since the dance break is stripped away completely.

He like pushing the buttons more than actually learning from it. I think it would be ideal for a 4-5 year old. I bought it thinking that he would play with it while I was working on my own laptop. Yeah, didn't work out like that cuz it does not look like mine!

It goes everywhere he goes. He absolutely loves it and can spend hours on it. Even though now he's had it for four (4) months, he still enjoys it. He especially loves the numbers and alphabet. He's dropped it numerous times, but it still keeps ticking. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"VTech does it again!","review":"VTech's Tote 'N Go Laptop is a wonder! I purchased it for my 3-year old grandson for Christmas. It turned out to be his favorite gift even beating out Santa's gifts! The educational value is superior. Although 3-year boys may be a little too hyper to sit patiently through each activity. However, the little laptop also seems durable enough to hold up while my grandson grows up and into it further.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best toy for the kids","review":"This is the best.

Our expectation was she would love to paly with its keys and different sounds, however in reality she spent just a few mins with it on the first day and never touched it again. We are hoping she would start liking it when she grows older and if she does, I may have to change this review :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this toy more than any other she's had","review":"I hate this laptop. I got it for my 3 yo and it is way too complicated for her. Everytime I give it her she gets frustrated. The process of selecting activities took ME ages to figure out and I have a PhD.

He liked it even though he had some trouble understanding how to use it. His 4 1/2 year old brother liked it better because he could figure out how to play the games. Unfortunately, the sound broke after a couple of days, and their mom is going to try to return it to the store for a refund. I saw that another reviewer had the sound go out as well, and other reviewers had problems with the mouse not working.

It's nice to have a lap top toy for children to learn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Gift for the Passive Aggressive Shopper","review":"Like many, I had high hopes for this toy. Electronic and musical toys generally don't bother me, but this one has the most horrible noises when the child misses the question. The games are difficult to figure out how to use, so my child would just push buttons (which resulted in more horrible noise). This toy also has a Spanish option at a push of a button. While this may be a great option for many children, my child has autism and it became a huge power struggle to help him play the game appropriately. Not only do I not understand what is being said, the missed questions result in more of the horrible noise! I wish that the feature was set up so that it wasn't so accessible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny screen, little to interest a 3 year old","review":"I really had high hopes for this little toy. The words learning and laptop caught my eye and I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the infinitesimally tiny screen. Combined with a tiny screen are large pixels, so there is very little to see on the screen. My daughter understood most of the basic games, but lost interest in about five minutes and has touched it only twice since. Both times she was bored by it and set it down quickly.All the pretty colors and fancy little attached mouse can't make this entertaining to kids. It's certainly very showy and a draw for adults, but it simply does not deliver once its in my kiddo's hands. Maybe if it were $5-$10 I wouldn't be so negative, but $30-$40 for this? No way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Since my daughter got this for Christmas is a toy that she has been using every single day! She is only 29 months toand it can be a little bit hard for her to understand that she needs to move the little mouse in order to select an activity but with mommy help she has been playing and reviewing her ABCS, numbers, shapes and playing some logic games. It is a great toy I know we can use for a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.... Not a hit","review":"My 2.5 Year Old daughter got this last xmas. we figured that punching the buttons would entertain her on a LONG car trip for Christmas. She could still care less. She is obsessed with our laptop, but doesn't like this one. The mouse is very annoying, its too easy to switch games and modes so when she does play with it, its just annoying. We are going to try getting her the leap frog one this year. I even tried putting it away for 6 months, and still she could care less. But she's not really into electronic toys in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised at the high rating","review":"We've had this product for a few years now. It's been passed down from one daughter to the next and neither has shown more than a passing interest in the dull low res grey and black graphics this 'laptop' offers. There are a variety of games to play on it and things to learn, but even as a computer savvy adult it's not obvious how to navigate through this thing. I'm writing this review because I saw this toy had such a high average rating. I honestly believe it deserves nothing better than a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good as a pretend laptop","review":"My 16 month son uses it as a pretend laptop.

We pulled it out recently as she is getting more familiar with the use of a computer and mouse. The volume didn't work so I called the vtech customer support no. and they walked me through several steps to reset the laptop. The display works but the volume still did not work. They said they couldn't replace it without the receipt but they offered to sell me another one at a discounted price. I considered their offer until I learned that the discounted price was more than the online prices offered by major retailers. NO THANKS! The junk is going in the trash. I have heard good things about the Leapfrog brand so I am going to look for a similar product by another manufacturer. I wouldn't recommend this product for the quality or the customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for kids until it breaks...","review":"This is not a durable toy. My daughter loved her's, but it broke after two months. The mouse was never very accurate, and then it stopped working altogether. Without the mouse, you cannot choose the activity you want. My daughter was never rough with this toy. She just sat in front of it pushing the buttons. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Despite my daughter being only 19 months, she enjoys using this product and this is most important to me.

My daughter likes to pretend she's on a laptop like mommy or daddy. But the graphics are horrible. She's mastered many games on the iPod touch though.Any activity on this would involve the game of guessing what those black and white dots are supposed to represent.For the parents, the music is loud, annoying and doesn't shut off for several minutes after the child has walked away from the toy.The durability is good, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor screen graphics","review":"I purchased this toy for my 3 year old son becuase he loves to play CD games on our laptop at home. I wanted something portable and thought the \\"keyboard\\" , flip up monitor and working mouse was a great idea. i purchased this w/o seeing or testing the actual toy in a store first. had i done that, i would have realized the graphics were poor (very poor). sometimes it was difficult making out the animal that was being depicted. the screen is small and in black and white. OK for the price, but with the current graphics of the Leapster and Mobi-Go products, i'll put the rest of the $ toward something that won't strain my son's eyes trying to play. cute concept, but they really need to update the graphics in this day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"For the price, this is a good buy. However, I wish the screen was bigger and that it illuminated. It is very hard for my little one to see the screen and it is kind of difficult for him to get to the various games and options. Overall the toy is sturdy and has many options."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable enough for children. Poor quality.","review":"We bought the Vtech tote and go laptop plus for our son for his 3rd birthday October 27th from Kohls.This weekend, March 5th, the button on the mouse came off and we can't get it to stay on. It doesn't look like any pieces broke, so I'm not sure why it came off.Today I exchanged it for another one at Kohls and when we got it home, the new one doesn't play sounds. I turned the volume all the way up, but still no sound. This is really disappointing because it is a fun learning tool and my kid loves having his own laptop just like mommy and daddy. He will be very disappointed to no longer have one.This was my first and last Vtech toy that I will purchase. Their product durability and quality is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learns at his own pace","review":"My three-year old son plays with this more and more each week. He is becoming accustomed to the games, and can choose them according to his wishes to do shapes, numbers, or letters. I am excited that he can use this for several more years as some of the games are more advanced (spelling words), and for that reason alone this game is well worth its purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good only for child with patience","review":"My 3 year old son had child laptop which got misplaced. I researched and this looked like a good option specifically based on reviews. My biggest problem is that response time of this laptop is high for most activities. For example, press A , and it would respond to key press with animation ignoring other key presses for next 3 seconds till it finishes the animation on screen. This is problem in most of activities not all, so it is software issue.Otherwise it would be very good child laptop."},{"rating":"2","title":"laptop review (Vtech)","review":"This was an interesting toy even for a very young boy.

The \\"n\\" word was used often so for those that are a bit sensitive to the usage...just a warning. It didn't take anything from the book or the author and I suggest that you still read the book.

The characters are wonderful and lovable and they literally come alive for you; one cannot help but care for and about them. A wonderful tale of family, love, death, life, war, racism, and every other aspect that you can imagine. It will appeal to all different ages and types.RECOMMENDATIONS:The race aspect of the book is very interesting and eye-opening. Due to the fact that it starts in the 1920s and spans until present day (or around there) it can really appeal to everyone and can also be very educational. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to read a book which will make them laugh, cry, and most of all, love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typographical errors in edition for iPad","review":"Surely the printed editions of this book would not contain the many typographical errors that the version for an iPad has!

I was so young I never knew what the name of the movie was, but I had strong memories of the German tank and Jack Palance ever since. For all the years after, I only knew I had great admiration for Jack Palance and didn't really care for Eddie Albert. After I stumbled into the name of the movie, bought it and watched it, I realized those opinions of these two great actors were created from watching this movie so long ago in a drive-in. Remarkable plot and good characterization. These fine actors made you live the movie. We'll forever miss them, except in the great work they left behind like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"rudimentary storytelling","review":"The spine of this movie is the cowardice of a commanding officer, and the politics that put him and keeps him in that position.

It is a good reference book to get a glimpse of information on many different topics. The illustrations are beautiful.The downside to this book is that it treats evolution as a fact. Evolution is a theory that has yet to be proven. That is why I gave it only 2 stars. So if the text treats something unproven as a fact, it causes me to wonder if everything else in the book is really proven to be true.I have no problem with evolutionary content.

The 1GB does NOT work in most of the readers! The built-in card reader of my computer wouldn't recognize the card (whereas it has no problems with a regular 128Mb XD). The new multi-card reader I bought especially for reading XD cards has the same problem (and again no problem with regular XD cards).The only reader that seems to read the new Type M OK is the Lexar USB multi-cards reader.

I love the cover bu the book, well. I think these books reley to heavely on snobs for the plots. Seesh, I mean, how many Veronicas can you have? The fact that Lisa, being a \\"great\\" horsewoman would do something as stupid as not paying atention to where she was going is just, humph. I hate how Mrs.Bryant adds charcters and then never talks about them again, like the new boy in this book, whats-his-name. If Max is so strict why does he let the Saddle CLub around on such a lose rein? Oh well, at least Mrs.Bryant did another horse/rider bond in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good show","review":"This was such a good series.

Factory has a long history of treating hard of hearing and deaf customers like crap, and it has reached a new low. After providing closed captions for Seasons 1-5 of Adam-12, for some reason they abruptly *dropped* captioning from the last two seasons.Since for almost all DVD publishers subtitles and/or closed captions are included as a matter of course, the absence of those words on an Amazon product description is no longer much of a clue to their absence in the product.

If you are a fan of Adam 12, I definately recommend adding season six to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blast from the past....","review":"I loved this series when I was young and I finally have the entire collection. Pete Malloy and Jim Reed have always been my favorite characters,but even then I understood what they were supposed to represent, the man on the beat,the person behind the badge. While some of what they encountered was sometimes either funny or downright serious,it was a day in the life of the police officer. It is also a bit of historical review as in some of the commentaries they explain what has changed procedurally since the time the series was made and it is interesting to hear what has changed since Adam-12 took to the road.Still, it is a great series, and one I'm glad to be seeing time and again, at least, on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"I was so excited when I found out that there really would be a book the fans could read! But I was disappointed because the book was so flippant. It was even too \\"in my own little world with NO idea what reality is\\" even for Erica. It caused me to resent the fact that my life could not be depicted as Erica expected her life to be. I think this book could have been written from a much more enjoyable and entertaining aspect. The thoughts weren't even consistent throughout the book. When will we get to read Mike Roy's book he wrote 13 years ago about Erica? Hopefully, it will be better. --Susan Westfall, a fan from the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"2GB MicroSD Memory Card","review":"This is a great little card, and I really appreciate the size of it the most.

It sure didn't go towards the quality of this product because the base of the unit doesn't sit flush so the unit wobbles and when you grab a dish towel, the towel holder almost falls over...you have to be careful. The other thing is the height of the unit, it's not tall enough so your dish towels lay on the counter top. It's also made in China, need I say more?

Re-reading it recently, I found that I liked it even better. I was mildly surprised at how many passages were exactly as I remembered them. They were so well written that they burned themselves into my memory quite naturally. Dodson is quite a graphic writer and as a result all his characters effortlessly come to life. His story is dramatic without being overplayed. What was best from my point of view is that his descriptions of naval equipment and procedures seemed to be taken directly off the reality. This book is an unrecognized gem. If you have any interest in World War II naval combat, don't pass up a chance to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"...May I have this dance, madame..what are YOU doin' here..","review":"\\"Ain't Misbehavin'\\" is a crowd pleasing, good times rollin' winner. This recording of the original cast (Nell Carter, Andre Desheilds, Ken Page, Charmaine Woodard and Armelia McQueen) is great in that the cast chemistry seeps through very well...you MUST see this cast in the 80's-ish performance video--I think it may be out there. The show is a no-holds barred, non-stop entertainment, neo-vaudevillian romp thru the tunes of Fats Waller... each song tells a story and assumes a scene...There are moments in \\"The Viper's Drag/Reefer Song\\", and \\"Lounging at the Waldorf\\" which are best enjoyed \\"seen\\", but this CD captures these moments well. \\"Black and Blue\\" is simply sublime, the harmonies just melts ya....this is one of the better cast recordings of a Broadway play, period.

The music is warm, full bodied, comical, intoxicating, sobering and sexy. The Jitterbug Waltz makes you want to sway cheek to cheek and the Viper's Drag reeks with the pungent smell of reefer. I own several Waller CDs and this performance captures the personality and sparkle he lends to the music.I had the pleasure of seeing Nell Carter and company perform live in Atlanta circa 1980 and a couple of years later, I was able to record a televised broadcast of the original cast performance on VHS. Wow! What a great show and what great talent. I've seen revivals of the show including the Ruben Studdard/Frenchie Davis 30th anniversary tour.

Looking beyond those, however, the book is chock ful of the most adorable pictures of miniature pigs (called by the pros 'Potbellied Pigs', and you can see why). Anybody on the look-out for a cuddly, intelligent pet need look no further! Puppy, eat your heart out - these micro swines will send you all rushing to the nearest pet shop. The text includes many sensible facts about keeping them (apeasing neighbours and municipalities, among other things), feeding them (preferably at the family table, it seems), and even breeding them.

While some would argue that he'd become a self-parody, his innate gifts compromised by relentless commercialization, you cannot take away his lasting gift to our culture. He was an original, and he captured an essence of our collective experience.He's here in this collection, waiting round the bend, could be my Huckleberry friend.

When they are on their game, they rock harder than any band around. Tight arrangements, loud guitars, excellent vocals, and lyrics that cut to the bone (as we have come to expect from this bunch of Welsh Rockers) makes this a must CD for fans and newcomers alike. Awesome production by Dave Eringa and tracking knobs by Guy Massey. My favorites are the title cut, \\"Underdogs\\", \\"Your Love Alone Is Not Enough\\", \\"Indian Summer\\", \\"I'm Not A Patsy\\", and \\"Imperial Bodybags.\\" James Dean Bradfield continues to astound on vocals and guitars and Nicky Wire's lyrics and Sean Moore's Moon-esque drumming deliver satisfaction throughout. The secret Bonus Track of Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\" is a nice touch. If you have never heard the Manics, this could be a great introduction.

The high one is best for heating pots of water and is hard to get low enough for pan cooking. I do a lot of wok cooking and am forced to use the high burner because the low one is too wide and the flame does not concentrate enough heat in the center.

As for the other posts about it being plastic- my dogs don't seem to mind and its holding up to both of them playing with it. As for it being annoying- well it does say that.

However, there is a huge problem with the batteries: they die quickly and are next to impossible to replace. It's difficult to get the batteries out since the screws are so small, and once I got the batteries out, I couldn't find replacement batteries. What do they expect you to do, go to a Jeweler? No, they expect you to replace the ball. Well, my bigger JRT will play sometimes with the dead ball expecting it to come alive again. But the other JRT ignores the dead ball. One is on the shelf since I messed it up trying to get the batteries out. What a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My JR mix loves it","review":"We are snow birding and I didn't bring the \\"original\\" toy along, so I ordered one to be sent here.

Although they recommend against letting your dog grind away on the babble, my dog does. We cover it in a sock. She is through the sock in a minute and is grinding on the ball. It has held up.

The only problem with this ball is that even the large size is small enough to get rolled or pushed underneath furniture.Anyway, I decided to head that problem off by putting it inside the \\"Tug-a-jug\\" toy that neither dog was particularly impressed with. Inside, with little treats, it's double the fun and doesn't get lost beneath the furniture and both dogs like the combination of Babble Ball and Tug-a-Jug toy.Like someone else said, the ball is hard plastic and looks like it can stand up to some very hard play for a long time.Lots of fun for dogs and humans!!!PS...Actually, it's pretty funny when the ball is inside the jug and the little voice says, \\"Let me out of here!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A loser","review":"My little pom a poo was not at all interested in this toy.

Would buy it again.UPDATE 11-19-2012 - We got another dog so I bought one for him. As he played with it, I could hear it knocking on his teeth when he would chase it and pick it up.

I do not recommend this ball for really any dog. No matter if the dog is high or low energy or chews/not chews. In my experience the ball made her more 'spastic' and crazy. I believe it was overstimulating her in a negative way. Also, the ball started to break apart in little pieces after only a few hours. I do not recommend this product.

Don't know how sturdy it is or how long it will last as I have only given it to her a few times. Seems if she really tossed it against the wall or was a hard chewer it might crack.

Now I don't know about your dogs, but none of my dogs like playing with rocks, therefore this toy is very unappealing to them (not to mention me) because I can't throw it and play with them and have it bounce. Truthfully, this \\"ball\\" is really stupid because it's not rubber and will not bounce and since it's so hard, I can't throw it at the risk of hitting one of the other dogs with a rock like object."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last","review":"I bought this for my Yorkie pup and she loved it.

He's young so is into playing. He's also a 'chewer'. This toy works great with him. Keeping him interested - it is SO funny, as he 'talks' to it, and nudges it around with his nose to make it talk. So far he hasn't chewed into it. Though we watch him. It doesn't bounce, so keeping his attention with it that way doesn't work too well. But he certainly prefers it over other 'toys' and certainly better than toys he can chew through in the first 15 minutes. Certainly a toy to consider if you need a way to keep your dog alert and play by himself.

She wants to take it to her bed, but that wouldn't be a good idea she would keep us up all night. Our larger dogs have put the ball in their mouths, and at first we thought they would bite through the ball as it is a hard plastic, but so far it hasn't been injured with all the play it has gotten.

It would be a better book if Littlest changed even a little bit in the book. She was not so dull, but not really that exciting in the book, because of that reason only. If it hadn't been for that reason, I think that Gossamer would be one of my most favorite books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Story","review":"My 11 year old son finished this book in tears the other day, so I decided to give it a try.

I thought it was the weirdest show I had ever seen, what with all the slashing and cannibalism, but I loved it and walked away with it permanetly emmbedded in my mind. When I saw it offered for sale I promtly purchased it and have fallen in love with it all over again. George Hearn is probably the finest actor on Broadway. His execution (no pun intended) of Sweeney is flawless. Hearn does not overact, but delivers his lines naturally, deviating only during his fits of maddness. His rich baritone voice only adds to the cleverness of Sondheim's musical score. Angela Landsbury is the only actress who can play the crazed Mrs. Lovett and creates very big shoes for other actresses to fill when they take their turn at this role. Though this production was shot with 1985 technology, the sound is rich and the color exceptional. GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Evil Little Cacophony that Turned Out Brilliantly","review":"Certainly not for every taste (in the same way that Rent can be a little off-putting for the blue hairs) but taken on its own merits, this is spectacular theatre. Sondheim has written better songs, but nothing on the sheer scale and operatic complexity as this dark, twisted tale. Cariou and Lansbury are wonderful, the supporting cast and chorus are very strong and the orchestra is simply outstanding. Pay close attention to Pretty Women and Not While I'm Around -- they're two of Sondheim's best! Overall, one of my favorite musicals and a superior original cast recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"This is one of the greates pieces of musical theater ever recorded. Angela Lansbury and Len Cariou both give the performences of their carears. Stephen Sondhime, a true genuis, has created a real gem!!! The ballads range from touching, comedy and frightening. This is a masterpice. I recomend it to anyone who loves musical theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Music Sampler","review":"Has anyone noticed the music sampler on this page is not for the Lansbury/Cariou production, but rather, the recent Lupone/Ceveris production. Both are lovely, however, those unfamiliar with the two productions may be mislead because they are quite different in style and scale. Can an Amazon Administrator please correct this error? Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeney Todd- Done by Will Kellogg","review":"To all the idiots out there who think Sweeney Todd is a disgusting, horrible musical those people are who this review is directed to. Sweeney Todd is , in my opinion, one of the greatest musicals ever made. It has an outstanding score, perfect performers, and an amazing set. Sure it may be a little cannibalistic, but there is also romance and comedy (dark as it may be it is still funny). So to anyone who is looking into purchasing this soundtrack believe when I say IT IS ONE OF BROADWAY'S GREATEST WORKS!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark & Delightful Sweeney Todd","review":"If you know nothing about Sweeney Todd, you'll be pleased that this musical is like an opera - most of what happens on stage is sung. You'll be able to follow most of the story's twists and turns just from the music. The original cast can't be beat. Angela Lansbury is a hoot. This story is a tragedy, but there is so much humor. The more gruesome the lyrics, the more rollicking the the music. This 2-disk version has some super bonus tracks with \\"Joanna\\" receiving especially beautiful treatment. There was a surprise, unlisted bonus at the very end from... I believe.. Julie Andrews. Very cute. Dig in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of wonderful darkness","review":"This is the original musical that got me addicted to Dark Musicals like Urinetown and such. The music will not let you down. Dont let this slightly gothic front fool you.This musical is dark, full of death, anger, and of course they burst into song.Not at all dissapointing, Angela Lansbury gives a heartstopping performance with others. This is not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is one of the greatest musicals ever!!!!!!!","review":"This cast recording was the first Sondheim recording I have ever heard. I rate this as one as my favorite musicals (others are Les Miserables and The Wiz). Len Cariou is a great as Sweeney Todd and Angela Lansbury makes the perfect partner for \\"A Little Priest\\". Ken Jennings is great in \\"Not while I'm Around\\" and works beautifully with Pirelli in 'The Contest\\". I loved Garber and Rice combining with Williams and Lyndeck in \\"Ladies in their Sensitivities/ Kiss Me\\". And of course Merle Louise does a great \\"City on Fire\\"Sure this musical is a little dark, but it is a great piece of theatrical music. I recomend anyone to buy this CD. IT IS GREAT(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity, Revenge & Meat Pies","review":"Whenever I find myself trying to explain to friends why I enjoy Sondheim's musicals so much, I invariably say, \\"Well, for instance, one of his shows is about a barber, out for revenge, who kills his customers, and his downstairs neighbor who grinds up the corpses and bakes them into meat pies. Sondheim is wonderfully twisted, I tell you.\\"Add to the mix a crazy beggar woman, a long lost daughter, a perverted judge, a corrupt beadle, a rape, a poisoning, an insane asylum and you have Sweeney Todd.And the music--you won't hear your typical Broadway love ballads or dance numbers in this CD. Sondheim's music is rich and disturbing, not necessarily melodic, but I can promise you that you'll be humming at least one of the tunes after hearing the show. (Just don't go around singing Todd's signature lyric of \\"...They all deserve to die...\\" or you might get locked up yourself.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"run!","review":"this Book is not for the newbies of shakespare.

With a background as a magazine journalist, perhaps he had not the experience in organizing a work as inherently massive as this. Also, as a journalist, he has an unfortunate tendency to rely a tad too much on interviews for his sources. I'm not sure that relying on the oral histories of the Mellons themselves, who certaintly would have to be reckoned to have a vested interest in what is not exactly ancient history, is the wisest course of action.Additionally, his writing often slips into an annoying first-person stream-of-consciousness style, and he tends to gloss over large chunks of history in order to get to the next juicy tidbit. It's supposed to be history, not a gossip column. Unfortunately, the historical value is virtually minimal. Skip this one & read Cannadine's new volume on AW Mellon instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Diversion","review":"The comical relationship of Bertie and Jeeves, is brought to life with the ever changing voices of Charlton Griffin.

John C Ewers was the first curator of the Museum of the Plains Indian near Browning, Montana, and many of the items in the museum collection were given to him at the time by elder members of the tribe at the time. He used primary sources for much of his information for this book, and corroborated details with these tribal elders as much as possible.

The quality is just not there. The melodies are way too simple and basic; there is no tension at all and the rhythmic components are weak. This is not bad for something some aspiring musician might compose but as a commercial release this just gives a bad name to the high quality trance that is out there.

Two different $10 Wal-Mart \\"Universal remotes\\" (in 2008/2009) did NOT offer COBY codes. I failed to notice the fine print. So I wasted $20 that way. I finally telephoned COBY. They finally took my order for a new remote. I sent them $6. TWELVE WEEKS LATER it arrives! THREE MONTHS to ship a remote?!? (I had to call them THREE times. I was often put on hold for a long time - always given excuses about the slow shipping.) Finally, it eventually arrived. It was the WRONG remote. I called to inform them. They said they'd send a replacement. They never have. So, for poor design (putting \\"ALL\\" the functions into the remote) and for terrible customer service and shipping service, I give them ONE star.

The plastic piece that covers up the hole where the DVD tray comes out has broken off and is gone. The player doesn't recognize a lot of discs as well. Most times it just says \\"wrong disc\\". I have also had problems with the colour and audio cord that connects to the TV. It has to be in the perfect spot for it to not make annoying buzzing noises or blurr the TV with black and white fuzz.

Eventually, it never got past \\"Loading...\\".So, if your appetite for risk allows you to gamble just under thirty clams for a box that may, or may not, work, go for it.

We bought it to watch movies from Europe, and we thought that the DVD player had a reasonable price. But, after having got two, and having to buy a third one now, it turns out that it will become more expensive than having bought a more expensive one from the beginning.

I used to have a inexpensive Cyberhome DVD player that could handle both but unfortunately this one won't. I've tried to find out how to unlock it for multi region use but none of the methods I've found work. I think they are out of date. Also it seems very noisy when it's spinning.

But even when I was using it, I have to say it has the worst remote control ever! You have to get it pointed at exactly the right angle, then push the buttons really hard. There is no button to just fastforward or rewind - the buttons skip by chapter. Now, if you hold down the skip chapter buttons, it will turn to ff, but choosing your speed of ff is hit or miss - a nanosecond too long, and you're back to playing.

Yes, its super cheap, but it should have certainly lasted longer. And, since the player died two months after the purchase, I couldn't get a refund from Amazon, as they have a 30-day return policy.

The replacement DVD was also defective (a very loud humming affecting hearing the dialogue). For this 2nd defective DVD, Coby told me I was responsible for the $10 cost of shipping it back again! Besides the initial purchase price of the product, I'd be out of pocket an additional $30.

It plays most media formats, including DVD-R's, MP3's and JPG's. It has a small size, which makes for easy placement. However, as for most products at this price point, I don't expect it to last as long as higher priced models.

It was great in the beginning and so easy to use, but the quality must be bad, since other reviewers also mentioned that their unit broke quickly too.

We're not talking just recorded DVD+R or DVD-R disks, but clean, unscratched, store bought DVDs. Needless to say it is very annoying to rent or buy a DVD, only to not be able to view it.

It was also marked at a cheap price, which was the selling point for me. However, purchasing the product has become an nuisance. Every single disc that I have played in this player has been a disaster even though all of the discs are in mint condition. During normal playback the DVD player has skipped several DVD chapters, completely stalled during playback with frozen video along with an annoying audio buzz, or it would constantly display video glitches as if there was a smudge of some kind on the disc. After ejecting each disc I would inspect the disc to see if there was any form of warping, scratches, or smudges as a result of fingerprints or anything similar, but they always appear clean and void of any blemishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed out of Box","review":"This is the first purchase that I ever did over the internet failed out of box.

That problem became more and more frequent, and now it will read no disks.I didn't mind the unit while it worked, though I had some quibbles. The remote layout is confusing, and switching menus can be excrutiatingly slow. But such things can be put up with for $28.However, I think I'll step up to a mid-range model now.

After a few days it seemed to have gotten better for a while, but then a few weeks later it started skipping again. I did some research online, and a lot of people suggested cleaning the laser lens with alcohol. When I did that it worked fine for a few more weeks, but now it's skipping again!

Then after about a week of use the player's power went out and I couldn't get it to turn back on. I picked it up and tapped on it repeatedly and finally not so gently put it back down and the power came back on. Now the power goes off and back on durring the movie. Sometimes I still have to hit it to get the power to come back on. Also durring play it stops,and skips. The price may be cheap but it still isn't worth the money. Don't be suckered by the low price. Hold out for a decent machine. I plan to look into Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"coby dvd-224ss compact dvd player","review":"I've had three of theses players, first and last were not worth even the cheap price.

I noticed it is easy to connect (uses the standard RCA connectors for video, R and L audio), and easy to use. It is very small and portable; therefore, it would be great for travel. It seems to be a fine player for the price. It is a player that if the kids knock it off and break it, wouldn't be hard to replace.

After only a few months of owning it, the disc tray began to malfunction. When it pulls the disc in, it does not go far enough, you have to open the door and push it just a little further in or it will spit the disc back out at you. I dealt with this for about a month, figuring it wasn't too big a deal, but now it needs assistance ejecting discs too (which requires a screw driver). Time to buy a new one. I consider this a waste of money now, and will never buy a Coby product again. In Coby's defense, I did get what I paid for. Another issue is the subtitles are always on by default. Each time I put a disc in I have to use the remote to turn them off. I have searched the manual and the menus for a way to disable this \\"feature?\\", and have not found a way. Another reason I will not buy another Coby product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Fat Let Down","review":"I bought this Coby dvd player because it was listed as being NTSC/PAL compatible. I loved this because I buy a lot of dvds from the U.K., dvds from some of my favourite shows like The Catherine Tate Show, Footballers' Wives, Keeping Up Appearances, etc. This alleged compatibility was totally deceptive. It should have been clarified that it would be compatible with tvs that are NTSC or PAL. It is NOT compatible with dvds that are Region 2 (PAL) coded. The only way this dvd will work with a foreign dvd is if it is listed as Region O. To say I was let down or miffed by this experience, would be a bit of an understatement. I will NEVER waste my money on a Coby product ever again! I would sooner set my money aflame.If you are wanting a dvd player to play Region 2 dvds, like those from the U.K., don't waste your money on this product.

It was tiny, easy to setup and cheap - those are all the good points. It died in under 2 months which was greatly disappointing since my previous tiny cheap Coby had lasted 2+ years. And by died I mean it played DVDs for about 3 weeks beautifully and I was in love. Then around week 4 it decided some DVDs were unplayable by no particular means. I'd put in a DVD that would just hang on \\"scanning\\", the following DVD would play. The next day I wasn't surprised to see the one I'd played the night before wasn't playing and it was left in the DVD player while it was off so it wasn't the disc. And one that hadn't played previously suddenly would play. After a few weeks of that it just stopped playing all DVDs.I guess it's time to find another tiny cheap DVD player manufacturer because this was much more of a disappointment than $25 is woth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I read all the positive and negative reviews for this and thought \\"$25 a great deal.\\" However, I have had it less than 6 months and although the DVD player is working great, the remote broke. I called up COBY and they said there are two options: send them a money order for $6 and wait 4-6 weeks for a new one, or buy a new remote on another site for $16! - more than half the cost for the whole unit! They also told me that universal remotes don't work with this brand. So, now I have to go out and buy a whole new player and wish I hadn't wasted the $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this junk.","review":"This DVD player is of the worst quality that I've ever seen.

Of course nothing said it would recognize +R so it is not a complaint. I have rated it 5, however it's picky about media and I should give it 4-1/2. If you watch pressed (DVD-ROM) or branded -R media go for it, it does good job with nice futures for the price. Owerall I'm happy with the purchase, have it for a month now and its compact size is just what I needed.

I emailed customer servise to explain my situation only to find the company does not want to stand behind there product.

I can't get the buttons on the front to work without mashing them hard enough to make the player scoot back so I have to do everything with the remote. It has been switching between playback modes of its own accord with no explaination (audio language, subtitles randomly turning on, getting stuck on pause if I pause it longer than a minute, etc.). For the price, it's good enough. I only bought it as a temp while I look for a good DVD player/recorder unit. I'd advise you to buy this only as a backup for a bedroom or kid's room. Don't make this your primary unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Brand","review":"Don't be fooled by bargain price. It will typically work well for only so long and suddenly quit.

I kept getting \\"wrong disc\\" announcements. I even sent some discs back to Netflix thinking they were bad, even though they looked fine. Then it wouldn't read the replacement discs. I can trick it into reading now by \\"jamming\\" it with repeated forward or play commands. There are often glitches in the video transmission where you see a jumble of pixels for a nanosecond, then it resumes.I'm disappointed in this lack of reliability from a new machine. But I don't want to be without a DVD player while you repair it and send it back or having to wait after shipping it back to get another one. So I'll probably just use it until it fails completely and buy another one ... but not from you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable","review":"Admittedly, I am no sort of an electronics expert, but I expect the products I purchase to work reasonably well. Well, this DVD player failed in that expectation. After about four months of operation, the player suddenly started giving me an error message of \\"Wrong Disk.\\" I had no idea what that meant, until I realized that it could not read any disk, disks that my other DVD player had no problem with.I have owned several DVD players through the years, but have never had one break down so very quickly.

These were two different coby models, but both were crap.Besides the early death of the players, another down side is that no universal remote seems to know who coby is, and so you are stuck with the initial remote (learning remotes also fail to control cobys).In the end, dvd players are all cheap now.

For the money I really don't see how you could expect more. The 110 volt/220 volt option is fantastic for people who live in really remote locations and the code to change the unit into a multi-region unit is just priceless. The only complaint is, that unlike other DVD players, the multi-region playback of a PAL disc on an NTSC TV produces picture distortion. Mildly annoying to watch foreign DVDs on an American set, but how many people does that actually inconvenience? If the unit lasts one year it'll have more than paid for itself. If the price drops again I'm going to buy half a dozen as disposable electronics seem to be the norm now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoom icon won't go away","review":"Warning: Do not by the Coby Mode. 224 DVD player if you want to watch anything in the Zoom mode.

It worked fine for about 2 months, but we started to notice more and more pixelization on DVD's. Some played better than others, some didn't play at all. At first we thought it was scratched/dirty/worn DVDs but it seemed to becoming more frequent over time.We ended up buying a new DVD player (Philips DVP5140) that was only a bit more expensive, and ALL of the DVDs that failed in the Coby worked perfectly in the Philips player.If money is really tight, the Coby is a short term fix for a nice low price.

I thought since the item was defective we would be reimbursed 100% of the purchase price -- wrong. We had to pay shipping to return the item and only received a partial refund. I will never purchase a Coby product again. This is not the first time that I have purchased inferior products from this manufacturer.

I really don't need a dvd player in my kitchen, but given the price of this unit, I felt that the convenience was worth it.Basically - don't expect much. It's a lightweight unit with mediocre playback quality and functionality. And I think that's fair, given the budget pricing. If what you want is a basic functional player - as a backup or for a rarely-used location, then this model will do just fine. I've probably used this about a dozen times, with no problems. If I had been planning on racking up hundreds of hours on it, I would have bought a better model.For casual use in a non-primary setting, this is fine. That's pretty much what my review is: This is ok. Nothing special, but functionally fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stopped working after a week","review":"I bought this one and it worked for a week and stopped working after a week.

It made a horrible noise whenever it played a disk, but once it got going, it was okay. Then right after the manufacturer's warranty was up, the door stopped opening.

He does this not by coddling writers as if they were pre-school children palying at finger paints, but by making them work hard to attain their goal. Although not all of the 200+ exercises interested me, I found most of them to be interesting enough and several to be quite engaging. Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wanted to write fiction but wasn't sure where to begin. Also, it's a good text for more advanced writers who have encountered that dreaded ailment: writer's block."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really Instruction--More a String of Exercises","review":"This book is less a book of instruction and more a series of exercises for a would-be writer to perform.I was kind of disappointed. I mean, going in, I knew that, say plot and character and dialogue were all important. I was hoping for some sort of discussion on what makes a good plot, or a compelling character, etc. Instead, Josip merely says (roughly) that \\"Having good characters is important. Here are some exercises for you to write characters: 1) Take a person you know, and describe him. 2) Imagine that person's total opposite, and describe him. (Etc.)\\"I've enjoyed other books more when they've discussed what makes a good character versus a bad one, or a good plot, or good dialogue, or what have you.

If so, recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah.","review":"There are sadly so many willing teachers of creative writing out there who, for one reason or another, cannot and should not be teaching the craft.

I have liked all of their albums with a little bit of an exeption on Music @ Work which didn't really hit me as hard as the others. But this CD to me is their pinnacle. It has a trashy almost punkish alternative style. It sounds very raw and tarnished which just adds to the overall effect. The lyrics are completely genious and Bobbie's voice has seemed to have deepend a little bit which makes it that much better. Lyrics wise the best song is \\"As Makeshift as we are\\" and musically I would have to say \\"Goodnight Josephine\\" for the amazing alteration throughout the song. All in all I'd say their best CD and probably my favourite of 2004 thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"The HIP are back!!!","review":"Just got the album today, and with just a couple listens under my belt, it is a good album. As a huge HIP fan I have been very disappointed with their last several efforts. This album is far better than Music at Work, In violet Light and Phantom Power. Hard driving riffs with good melodies combined with Gord's trademark lyrics. The production value is way better than recent albums and with more focus on Downie's voice (which is how it should be, dammit)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of patience","review":"I still listen to everything the HIP put out hoping that one day they will rock again. You shouldn't have to work to like a CD. It should just be good and this one isn't. I wonder what happened to the HIP, who I considered at one time to be the best rock band on the planet. Is it drug abuse or did they just get old? Did Gordon lose his voice or just become lazy? I miss the old HIP \\"fully and completely\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as melodic or memorable as past achievments","review":"I was rather disappointed by this album as I thought it was rather weak compared to their previous album and other albums of the past. Musically, In Between Evolution is very similar to Music@work sounding very raw and the music is not melodic enough to remember and enjoy like we did on past albums like DAy for Night or Fully Completely. I have been a hip fan since 1994 and have given this CD more than enough spins to come to this conclusion. For a new hip fan, start out with older albums like Phantom Power, Trouble at the Henhouse, Day for Night and Fully Completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canada's finest deliver once again","review":"In a day and age where quality straight forward guitar based \\"alternative\\" rock and roll is few and far between, The Hip arise to give us another gem.From top to bottom the songs are classic Hip and even though they haven't changed the formula, the results are top shelf. Gord Downie continues to be a one of a kind talent as a vocalist and lyricist in his best performance since 98's \\"Phantom Power\\". The band follows suit and the result is one of the best records of the year.Highlights include the leadoff track \\"Heaven Is A Better Place Today\\", \\"Gus The Polar Bear\\", \\"Vaccination Scar\\" & \\"The Heart Of The Melt\\". Not one weak track and the Hip have their best record in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"An evolution, sure - at least not too much of a degeneration","review":"I saw the Hip grow big from their beginnings in my Ontario home town, a bunch of school pals from Kingston.I know they are not Led Zeppelin, in terms of sheer musical gift.But despite themselves, The Hip deliver endearing albums, and sometimes the songs can move you. For who they are and what they do, the music's really good. You forget the slightly rickety rhythm section and awkward stabs of guitar, much as if you had the Velvet Underground on the stereo. This is a band with something to say, unlike say, the irony-dependent Sloan (another Canuck band with marginal instrument skills.) The Hip are therefore real.Case in point: \\"Josephine\\", the closing song on this CD is just as sublime as it gets. If you can hear it. Otherwise, you might as well go buy some shiny perfect Dave Matthews stuff. It's rare to encounter a band that means anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of their best","review":"\\"Evolution\\" is the key here. This is a creative band that doesn't stagnate - for good and bad; I think Music@Work is a terrible album, but at that time the change alone from the stale rhythms did them good as the albums since have been strong, vibrant and progressive. This album is one of their strongest.This album certainly has faults, that have been pointed out in other reviews, but the album as a whole is in keeping with their creative drive and direction to evolve their sound, rhythm and lyrics without sacrificing coherence and accessibility - a very difficult thing to do and has been done well on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"vocally - too distracting, BUT musically - very satisfying","review":"I very much agree with previous reviewer, Hal Johnson. This could have been a great Hip disc, but the vocals -- go way beyond the once beautifully idiosyncratic typical Hip stuff -- to be distractingly out of tune with a lack of the usual presence and depth... moreover, the production is messy and spotty (vs. In Violet Light).YET (and infuriatingly so), the songs are mostly wonderful, hence my 4-star rating... upon repeated listenings these shine through, and the faults are (mostly) overlooked... sort of like love in a long-term relationship...lol.Long live the Hip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Years and Dead","review":"This T.V. is one of the heaviest TV's I have ever owned.

The vaudeville numbers are unremarkable and the rainbow song gets oh-so-tedious with repetition.

My hopes were not only thwarted, they were dashed. Return to the Chateau portrayed a dark heavy scenario... O's desertion by her Master, discarded and unwanted, forced into a life little better than that of a common prostitute. It is incomprehensible to me that the two books were written by the same author. Obviously when this was written, the author was sadly disillusioned by the Lifestyle she once so warmly and passionately embraced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Story of O had me fascinated but the sequel just left me feeling disappointed. If you have read O, then I would advise you to stick with its endings rather than the one offered by Return to the Chateau, as it is simply a let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"There is not one weak song on this CD. This CD is amazing! The samples of the songs that you can listen to do not do justice to the full version. I think they are the best band in the business. So many groups sound much better on the CD than live, that's certainly not true for the BoDeans. It is just too bad that they aren't played on the radio so more people could appreciate them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resolution of a long wait","review":"Is this their finest album? Maybe... maybe not. But each song hooks the listener, and doesn't let go. Resolution does not have the grit of their earlier albums but will remind all fans of the band why they initially fell in love with them. BoDeans continue to be one of best rock bands in the country, buy the album, see them live, then you will share the obsession"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Bodeans album with the classic Bodeans sound.","review":"This Album manages to have the classic Bodans sound while still sounding new. Nothing here that Bodeans fans haven't heard before, but in this case that's a good thing. The Bodeans have a unique sound and they write songs that are a perfect fit to that sound and to eachother. This is definitely an album worth owning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Early BoDeans wouldn't have put their name on this","review":"At least twice as slick and glossy as it should have been and at most half as creative and interesting as hoped for. The BoDeans have sadly gone from an interesting rock band to just another over-produced wimp-rock outfit. It actually hurts to say this but it's 100% true: if while listening to this album for the first time someone told you it was Bon Jovi, you'd believe them. You'd believe them. There's nothing more to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Bad -- You should have spent the $10!","review":"This is for the person who wrote the previous review -- Sorry you missed the answers. They're outlined very clearly in \\"Breaking Free from Compulsive Eating,\\" the next book. Personally, I found reading the first book helpful in using the next one. For $10 you're not willing to try? How about if you checked it out of the library? Be nice to yourself -- don't give up yet. This book and the two that she wrote afterwards were the best thing to ever happen to my weight life. I eat better, am happier, and no longer feel like I can't control my food habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop punishing yourself! Learn to love yourself","review":"It has been said frequently that this is not a diet book. It is in a healing book. It takes the die out of diets. Many people as children or in some part of their lives have experienced having food deprivation as some part of a punishment system. Others have been deprived because of selfish parents. Others have been deprived of food when they are hungry due to some other emotional assault on their sense of self. This is an empowering book. It teaches us to listen to our inner being. We learn to approach food and eating differently. We learn why we want to eat. And we learn to nourish our inner and outer self so we can eat to truly care for ourselves in a healthy way, not a way that simply damages our emotional and physical selves. This book can help heal our emotional damage and lead to a more healthy self inside and outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the answers?","review":"During a difficult recovery from bulimia, I sought out emotional advice from those who had been through similar perils and had recovered to an admiral degree. I bought Feeding the hungry heart and read through it as fast and deperately as I would a quart of ice cream. The book is really a culmination of women's stories who had been compulsive eaters and had recovered by taking seminars from the author. While I could certainly relate to much of what was said, I found the stories to be depressing; leaving me with a bit of hopelessness. Never was it thoroughly explained exactly what these women did to lead to a recovery. I felt cheated; as if this was just the prequel to the book with the answers. I wasn't about to pay another $10.00 to find them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"This book isn't worth the paper it is written on. The author is merely trying to \\"cash in\\" on the market for informative material about weight loss. I found no useful information, plans, diets, or insights in this book. The book appears to be simply a narcissistic whine by the author, a place in which to complete assassinate the character of her mother and tell supposedly shocking stories about herself, to what purpose I know not. A truly stupid book--and I like 99% of everything I read, so that says a lot. Don't waste a nickel buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"earth shaking","review":"I bought this book three or four years ago now, in the heat of my battle with bulimia. I learned that COE had a lot of the same aspects as my disorder, and I really wanted to see how other people felt before, during, and after our shared binges.This book made me smile, think, and even cry. I've read it four times through, and I am constantly flipping back to read my favorite stories even to this day. It gives me strength both by knowing that others have felt the same as I do, and that they have pressed through and moved on to better days. It also gave me a different perspective on why I eat emotionally sometimes, and how I can cope with some feelings I don't cherish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeding the Hungry Heart Left Me Empty","review":"This book,first written in 1982, is a far cry from Roth's \\"Women Food and God.\\" It's a depressing, intense sharing of prose and poetry (much fictional) from a host of women who were coping with compulsive overeating. Instead of helping me with my eating issues, it dragged me down to a level of melancholy I had not yet experienced over my problem. I found that this book focused me more than ever on food, while Women Food and God focused me on the way out. Disappointing yet predictable for a first book while Roth herself was still struggling with food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opener- cheaper than therapy!","review":"Excellent book! Make me buy all of Ms. Roth's other books. Great insight and a real eye opener to why people overeat and use food for everything except for what its made for: hunger!

I agree that you must learn to love yourself, but this woman gives no concrete information on how to do that. I read most of her books about 3 years ago, and even went to one of her seminars. The only thing I learned is that she is rude in person, and the seminar was like one big infomercial pushing her other books. I saw a lot of others there who were struggling with compulsive eating, which was helpful, but we all left feeling like, \\"now what?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, empty recital of binges, wrongs.","review":"The book goes into a lot of binge and shame stories by Geneen and others in her workshops, with no hint of what brought her out of binge eating.This is a real waste of time, very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, lies, lies","review":"The following four quotes are all ascribed to Hitler by Rauschning.

Kix does pretty good on this cd with GO WEST, WHEN SHES GONE SHES GONE, DENY DENY DENY, I FALL AND SEE JANE DANCE. With ronnie singing songs: ONLY IN AMERICA, THE LAST THING I DO, THE LONG GOODBYE, MY HEART IS LOST TO YOU, GOOD GIRLS GO TO HEAVEN, AINT NOTHING ABOUT YOU, UNLOVED, LUCKY ME LONELY YOU, EVERY RIVER. Considering there last album tightrope didnt really do to good with this cd they are making up for it! tracks 1,2,4,8,14 are good songs to turn up on the stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Brooks & Dunn CD Yet!","review":"Like many fans, I was somewhat disappointed with this duo's previous album, Tight Rope. Steers and Stripes, however, is a complete turnaround for Brooks & Dunn. It is their best album to date (except maybe the Greatest Hits Collection). Tracks 10 and 11 are so-so, but the other 12 are country music at its finest. 1, 2, 6, 8, and 14 are some of the best up-tempo numbers I have ever listened to, and tracks 3 and 9 are power ballads that I want to play over and over. Track 5 is a great mix of Spanish and country that doesn't sound like any cliche. Any country fan will enjoy this album, and it is a must-buy for B & D fans. Also, their live show is fantastic. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review on Steers and Stripes, Brooks and Dunn","review":"I think that this is one of the best albums that Brooks and Dunn had ever put out.

With each passing cd, I liked their music less and less. Now, Ronnie Dunn's voice seems to wail and screech and be out of key on almost every song. I laugh at all the people who think their music is great artistry. It isn't!! Everyone praises them so much for ONLY IN AMERICA. I don't! If you want a real ode to America and it's strength, buy Dolly Parton's HALOS AND HORNS! Brooks and Dunn, you have lost a fan for life just as Toby Keith has with his horrid and insulting COURTESY OF THE RED, WHITE AND BLUE....the last time I looked hatred was not the way to go but it seems many people in the U.S. feel it is. SHAME ON US! There is not a winner on this entire cd......let's hope Brooks and Dunn return to their roots next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Returning Fan Is Glad To Be Back","review":"I bought \\"Brand New Man\\" not long after it came out and kinda lost track of this duo until deciding to purchase \\"Steers & Stripes\\". I'm very glad I made the buy. It's amazing how far Brooks & Dunn have come artistically then-til-now and the range of tracks on this album reflect it: From the satirical side of the lead track \\"Only In America\\", to the just plain fun \\"Deny, Deny, Deny\\" and \\"Good Girls Go To Heaven\\", to the love songs like \\"My Heart Is Lost To You\\" and \\"Ain't Nothing 'Bout You\\", to the absolute ache of \\"The Long Goodbye\\". I dare you to find a track that doesn't work. Great album. Great job, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No. 1 AGAIN!!!!","review":"Though this album is not as good as their Maria album (my favorite), it does proves Brooks and Dunn's come back to the greatness that this country duo has proven time and time again.Through their tunes, they go back to the style of singing only they know how to do (can you say perfection), but this time they go one step further and produce an even greater CD. The song, Only in America, was considered at first to be a minor song on the CD, but after 9/11 it is now a song to be reckoned with and a great signature song to start their concert.Having heard the CD and see them perform it in person, Brooks and Dunn are now back on top and will stay there.I am glad to Brooks and Dunn are no. 1 again. Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"This is the first of Brooks & Dunn purchased. I had no idea I could become a fan so late in the game! This is a great CD.

But even more so on this recording. His tone, phrasing, all marvelous. Alice Coltrane's part in this as harpist, composer / arranger, and keyboardist is the work of a master musician by any standards.

I can understand how people with no taste still have preferences. But I honestly cannot understand how ANYONE could like this.The music is like that of William Shatner, while the spoken word vocals reminded me of the narration that led into commercial breaks on the old Dukes of Hazzard TV show. This guy is a redneck in full self-parody mode, trying to be a beatnik.As I listened, my first instinct was to eject it from my car stereo and throw it out the window. Then I thought about giving it away, but I was afraid of insulting anyone I'd give it too.

John is a fine writer of rock, a commendable bassist and a solid member of the MBs but as a solo act, especially trying to write ballads or love songs, a complete wash. SAVE YOUR MONEY. he and Justin should do another Blue Jays album. Its songs have worn quite well over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like John wasn't really into it.","review":"This CD was not as good as I expected from one who wrote songs like Candle of Life, Just A Singer, etc. It sounded like John really wasn't into it and could care less what it sounded like. It also sounded like he was having problems with his voice. The only two good songs on this CD are Summer Breeze and Carry Me and even those are questionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"NATURAL AVENUE HAS SOME POT-HOLES","review":"This first and only solo effort from John Lodge is far from the quality of his work with the Moody Blues.A prime problem is Lodge's vocal performance. He sounds strained and occasionally off-key. While the orchestral arrangements echo the Blues early albums, other instrumentation seems superfluous and obtrusive. The most enjoyable tracks are CARRY ME, SUMMER BREEZE, NATURAL AVENUE and SUMMER BREEZE.Lodge seems to work better with co-Moody songwriter Justin Hayward, both in composing and performing.Ultimately, NATURAL AVENUE is mainly an album for Moody Blues collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esquisite!","review":"Awesome. Great cd. Don't believe the dissidents on this, don't compare to other MB releases or past material. Take this one on its own merits. When you do that, you'll realize this is really great, and an awesome effort by John Lodge. Stellar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for diehard MB fans","review":"For the most part, John's Moody Blues songs work best with the full harmonies of the group to the fore (\\"Ride My See-Saw\\", \\"I'm Just a Singer\\", etc.). His rather thin, high voice is not strong enough to carry an entire album and gets really annoying after awhile. And the overdubbed orchestration tends to be quite overbearing (although not nearly as bad as on Ray Thomas' albums). However, this CD does contain one real classic in the powerful ballad \\"Say You Love Me\\", worth the price for hardcore fans, even if John kept rewriting it endlessly on subsequent Moodies releases (\\"Survival\\", \\"Nervous\\", \\"It May be a Fire\\", etc.)Another problem with the new CD release is that it doesn't have the wonderfully surrealistic cover art and beautiful photography of the lyric sheet from the original LP, provided by Roger Dean of Yes fame.

If you do UI work at your job or just want to learn more about the different UI choices that are out there, this is a great book to pick up. If you have an existing application that users are not happy with, and you want to learn more about what can be done to improve things next time you get the opportunity to go back and update the interface, this is recommended reading before you begin the massive amounts of work that no doubt are staring you in the face.***** HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great catalog of user interface elements","review":"A thorough and well-written catalog of common user interface elements, illustrated with screenshots from popular applications.

There are many other books that do a much better job at explaining the fine details and standards of interface design. My other problem with this book, is that it reads like a boring text book. I had to fight to keep from falling asleep! Unlike, \\"Information Architecture for the world wide web\\", a GREAT book from O'reilly that presents real world design problems & solutions, \\"Designing Interfaces\\" seemed like it was written by a non-designer, or \\"text book\\" designer, with very little \\"real world\\" experience in visual user interface design. At the end of the day, the most important information to be gained from instructional design books is the shared experience of the designer that wrote it. This is far more helpful than a book of design patterns.Two thumbs down :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful UX Book","review":"If you're interested in UX at all, this is a great book to have. It's wonderful in two senses: You can read all of it briefly in a couple of hours to get the lay of the land, and then come back to really absorb the areas that particularly apply to what you're doing.If you're going to have to work with clients on interface design, or have done so, you know that it can often turn into a holy war over where to put buttons and what colors to use. Everyone knows best in that situation, and no one knows why they do. This book presents a pattern language for describing why a button should be where it is or a color should be what it is, which allows you to use theory and logic against managers and customers who have no real idea why they like things they way that they do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential book for UI design patterns","review":"Still one of the best books on UI design patterns out there. Well-written with clear examples, this book works whether you read it cover-to-cover, or retain it as a reference book.

Tidwell does an excellent job of identifying the patterns that are out there and familiar to all of us, breaks down why they work so well, and explains when and how to use them. The updated version, which was just released in December 2010, includes additional patterns, including mobile applications and social media.

Comfort level seems okay, should handle shopping trips okay. I will however attach heel cushion adhesives to prevent painful rubbing/friction. My main gripe is the boot shaft. For one, the shaft construction looks a bit cheap and sloppy in person. It slouches a lot and does not hold snug to my calf (i have an average slender calf.)The height barely passes mid-calf so if you are looking for a knee-length or tall boot this one may disappoint you as well.

People often criticize the Hollywood (soundtrack) material from the '60s, and rightly so, but the songs here are well chosen and entertaining. They are alternate takes which are sometimes better than the takes that actually got used way back when. A lot of good material was recorded in Nashville in the '60s, so it's no surprise that this collection of alternate takes is very good. The Live in Las Vegas disc features songs recorded in August of 1969 at the International. Very good material, including the infamous \\"laughing\\" version of \\"Are You Lonesome Tonight\\".

One of them ended up on top of the TV trying to catch the birds while another one got in his window perch by the TV to attack the birds. The other three stayed on the ground and I sat back and laughed at the whole bizare fiasco.

But more importantly, you will view the performers moving around and forming different small groups and larger ensembles for each number, from solos, duos and trios to the full choir & orchestra (tutti). Even the placement of the groups within the space is important, and the video helped me understand the structure of the work more fully.

The ringer however, is very loud and I can hear it ring and the light is helpful. There is no caller ID if your looking to have that.

(P.S. you know when they have tape worms b/c you find small white to whitetish brown sesame seed shaped things in their beds or wherever they frequent. These are the tapeworm segments breaking off inside the animal to be eaten by fleas and continue living. There are usually no other signs and they are not harmful, just gross people out-so we pay whaterver the price to get rid of them! You usually stop seeing them after a day or so.

Even though the story is sad from beginning to end, I found myself not being able to put the book down. As you read, the story clarifies itself in a way that makes you realize that the book is not only about the death of a child, but about how people use the tragedy of others to serve their own purposes.

I wanted to continue reading to find out if Kelithe allowed her son to drown. This book is very sad just reading about Kelithe's mother did not stand by her or feel like she was her daughter. Her mother Sonya is a hypocrite because she attempted an abortion when she was pregnant with Kelithe. It made me wonder, why couldn't Sonya show her daughter any love? And the reaction of the town was just aweful but this book made me think.

If I could go lower, I would. This was one of the worst books I have ever read. I am appalled by this \\"novel\\".This piece of literature is the sequel to Warriors Woman. I do not understand how Ms. Lindsey can go from writing such a beautiful novel as Warriors Woman, to write one such as this. All the characters of her earlier novel are also in this one, but their roles have changed. They are not the same characters we loved.This story is about Challen and Tedra's daughter, Shanelle. She meets a visiting warrior, Falon Van'Yer. They are supposedly drawn to one another upon their first meeting. Love at first sight. We are then taken through almost 400 pages of extremely boring text, until they reach \\"Happily Ever After\\".The story line is very poor. The story itself does not make much sense. The main characters are very unlikable.

Let metell you, Warrior's Woman is EXCELLENT! I've read it more than 50times and I still love it. It's very funny, crazy and sexy. You'll roll around laughing, believe me. I LOVE the book. So that's why I look forward to reading 'Keeper of the Heart', to see what happened to the offsprings of the characters in 'Warrior's Woman'. Boy, was I VERY disappointed! 'Keeper of The heart' is a very poor imitation of the parent book. There is no strength in plot, in fact, there's no serious plot at all! To me, Shanelle is weak, empty and airheaded. I skip the first few pages because it's boring. Then I started skipping more pages. Then I ended up throwing the book under the bed without even bothering to read the end.So my advice? Read 'Warrior's woman' first. THEN read 'Keeper of The Heart' and you'll find yourself agreeing with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful","review":"This foolish book is nothing more than a justification, in fictional form, for hitting women and keeping them subservient to men. And for the indoctrination of women into this abusive practice, for they all accept it as being for their own good. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"INSULTING TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE","review":"I found this book to be disturbing. The author is obviously obsessed with the punishment of women because the subject was discussed constantly throughout the book. In fact, it seemed to be the book's main focus. And for those of you who say \\"It's just a book!\\" remember that it is still justifying spousal abuse and is having an effect on impressionable young minds. One reviewer actually said that the spanking scene was no big deal because children are spanked all the time. I guess that person naturally equates women with children. Great to hear that kind of forward thinking! Read it only if you get a cheap thrill out of the heroine's getting roughly spanked while screaming in pain, because the story itself is quite weak. And the sad part is that I'm sure many people will buy this book based on this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite keeper!","review":"I LOVED this book.

I had picked up this book at least 3 times,skimmed through it, and threw it aside, because I don't like anything but historical usually. But, because I like Johanna Lindsey, I HAD to read it, and I loved it! Matter of fact now I've read it 3 times and would read it again! Johanna has a way of leaving you wanting more after a read and I too wonder about the other characters in the book and hope,hope,hope she writes a sequel to this book. I found the spanking scenes to be most erotic, I am tired of the heros always wimping out on us! Don't have to worry about that with Ms. Lindsey's books! I love them and will continue to read everything she writes. More spankings Lindsey! Yeah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double blech!","review":"This sequel to \\"Warrior's Woman\\" is even worse than the first one.

What happened? The hero is kind, but I didn't like the heroine at all. She had absolutely no redeeming qualities; in fact she refused to be sorry for any of the problems she caused for other characters. I look forward to another sequel in the story, but I hope Lindsey takes a little more time with it than she did with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment!","review":"Maybe I expect too much from this genre of book. There was essentially no story, characters were seemingly added at random, many contributing nothing to the story line but rather just to lengthen the book. The heroine did not inspire any positive emotions and there weren't even any stimulating romantic intervals! Maybe the author should concentrate on quality instead of quantity (she is quite prolific) but this book has soured me on reading any others."},{"rating":"2","title":"How does she do it?","review":"I have read and re-read every book that Johanna Lindsey has published...and I will probably continue to do so. This book, as well as Warrior's Woman, has pride of place on my bookshelf (and let me tell you my bookshelf is vast). Falon, to my mind is the man of most womens dreams...I just have to keep asking myself how Johanna keeps coming up with heros you really wish were real and heroines (who, although too gorgeous for words) you actually find yourself liking. I know some people might be a bit put off to know that there are scenes in which a woman gets spanked, but hey, it doesn't say it's right and it's an entirely different world."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was pretty good.","review":"This is better than Warrior's Woman. It has a cool plot and the characters are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to move to this world!","review":"This is my all-time favorite romance book. Johanna Lindsey creates an imaginary world that is NOT politically correct. Although the women are intelligent, well-educated, and extraordinarily independent, they live in a physically primitive world ruled by the sword. The sword-weilders are handsome, giant warriors who defend their women with their own lives. Fallon risks his life fighting for Shanelle's hand in marriage. She shows her gratitude by jumping into a spaceship to tour the universe, leaving him standing at the altar with her parents! Of course, he has to go after her to convince her that they are truly soul-mates. There are parallel romantic stories about Shanelle's parents and even the 'android' computers that guide the chase through the universe. Far from being intimidated by the warriors they love, these women outsmart their men at every turn. What fun!!

Which ever (or both) is the case, I just can't seem to get decent coverage without really squeezing, which can become difficult after a long period of climbing.I did get the refillable version, so when it runs empty I'm going to try filling some BD chalk or something else really fine ground and see if that helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotta grip pretty hard for Chalk","review":"The chalk bag comes filled - however I found that out of the packaging it's pretty worthless. I have to take it and basically throw it into my hand (like a baseball player trying to break in a glove) to get chalk on my hands. Gripping it I could get a light layer, but not really any significant amount.I did empty the bag, crushed up the chalk even more and did find it worked a little better. But the results aren't particularly pleasing. It takes either tight gripping of the bag or to get better results: some sort of impact against my hand (ie throwing it) to get chalk up. Throwing it is less than ideal since I don't particularly enjoy breathing chalk.It does work it just doesn't work particularly well. I don't think I could recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfoms poorly","review":"The material used for this sock is too thick and not porous enough. I can not get an adequate amount of chalk on my hands without really having to force it around in my hand, even then the amount of chalk is minimal.

Needless to say I will be buying a new BD sock soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and refillable!","review":"This is a great thing to have in the climbing gym so you and everyone else around you doesn't eat dust all night! Takes a little bit of time to crush up all the large pieces so you get the proper amount of chalk on your hands but after that it works great. It also helps so you don't over chalk your hands.

It worked for what I needed it to -- trying to hide a cable run along the baseboard from one side of the room to the other for a set of USB audio speakers. I had no worries about kinking or breaking it as I worked it around corners and through cracks. The best thing is, I didn't have to make trips to various stores around town trying to find a cable the right length. I ordered the cable from Amazon and had it three or four days later.

You might expect something different with Steve Carell but he shows an ability in this film to be funny AND tender.

It's a beautiful story about families, love, and loss.I bought the DVD \\"Used, like new\\" on Amazon for $5.99. It came relatively quickly and like new, as advertised.

I chuckled maybe twice throughout the whole thing and spent about forty-five minutes of the movie trying not to fall asleep. Being a fan of Steve Carell, I was expecting this movie to be hilarious. If it weren't for the mislabeling, I certainly would have enjoyed it more, because I'd have realized it was a Drama and stopped watching it after fifteen minutes, thus saving myself about an hour and a half of boredom.If you're expecting a comedy, don't get this. The only thing that kept me watching it through to the end was the promise of \\"Laugh-out-loud\\" hilarity that I figured would come soon enough, and never did. Watching this is only disappointing--not to mention that the storyline is downright depressing if anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it hurts.","review":"Another title for this movie could be, 'A Fist Full Of Cliches'.

I think he's a fantastic actor and I usually love his work, but boy did he make a mistake in taking on this piece of garbage. I'm guessing the movie was going for the whole artistic depth thing but frankly, I just don't understand it. The humor was forced and the plot was boring and ridiculous at the same time.

The movie meant to represent a real human being's foibles, sorrows and feelings.

However, even their considerable skills can't breathe life into the turgid, melodramatic, derivative and predictable script that burdens this film. \\"Dan in Real Life\\" is a poster child for the proposition that you can't have a good movie without a good script - a proposition that much of Hollywood has never quite gotten through its head. You've seen all this before, particularly if you've ever seen a made-for-television Lifetime-style melodrama.

Juliette Binoche is out of place and unconvincing, and there really isn't a single character in the whole movie who is sufficiently developed. Instead the film relies on one worn out cliché after another as it falls all over itself trying to be cute and endearing and taking every possible shortcut along the way.

The film is woefully miscast in its lead characters with Juliette Binoche looking and acting a full 20 years older than her supposed initial love interest, Dane Cook. The plot is so formulaeic that you know exactly what will happen and who will end up with who in the first 5 minutes and nothing that happens along the way comes as a surprise. The film works on almost no levels and is completely pedestrian in every way.

Right now I'm a teenager and I'll be the first to say that this bugs me...why can't the child ever be the one that needs to learn the lesson?This movie is like that, but with one hitch...the parent never actually does anything wrong. When he apologizes to his children in the end I'm left going \\"Why are you apologizing? You didn't DO anything!\\" Just another case of bratty kids sending their parent on a guilt trip.

Look, even if this was done well, the material is SO tired, SO predictable that it would have been unbearable. But, no, it was not done well.

It was like THE OFFICE in a family setting. Dane Cook didn't really add much to the casting. And Juliette Binoche (Marie), unlike Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Colin Farrell has yet to master an American accent to be believable, much less intelligible, with her natural accent fading in and out.Pretty sappy premise and very predictable circumstances.

Their music was fitting at the end but was overdone during the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"New role for Steve","review":"This was a very enjoyable film, and especially if you have only seen Steve on \\"The Office.\\" He's great in this enlarged role.

The relationships were unbelievable, the romantic interludes were cringe-worthy, and I'd like to have the two hours of my life back spent watching this movie.I also agree with the comments a few reviews down about the large family. I think that was the worst part of the movie, Dan's extended family is overwhelming, and corny. Half the characters should have been cut out of the movie.I'm sorry if this offends anyone, but this was not a good effort in the Romantic Comedy genre.

It's not the best book I've ever read, but it is entertaining. In fact, as an aspiring author, I found myself picking at phrases and words where I would have changed things. But the plot is romantic and suspenseful, so that doesn't take away too much from the story. Another problem I'm having with the book is the change of perspective. There's not a ---- or a **** or a pretty little symbol to let the reader know that we're going into someone else's thoughts. Many times I've had to go back and re-read a few paragraphs to figure out what's going on. Other than that, I am thoroughly enjoying the book, and I can't wait to read the rest in the series.

Why not just had a simple one-function mute key?The most significant problem is that it picks up a lot of background noise and callers tell me they can hear my keyboard as if its right in front of them.I've been pretty disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"This headset has an extremely sensitive mouth piece and picks up all background noise. When I am on the phone, the person can hear someone 3 cubes over typing. Also, I can go only about 20 feet and it starts beeping in my ear that I am going too far. I am extremely disappointed in this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...much better than the CS50/55","review":"Excellent headset...go for this over the C50 / C55. Much lighter than the C50/C55 and better sound...incoming and outgoing. This can really be worn over the ear. Ths C50/C55 series is too heavy to comfortably wear ovet the ear. One has to use the headband to be comfortable with those models. I purchase the C55H and returned it for this one. And I am glad I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb product, works perfectly!","review":"This is such a great headset. The headset lifter is a must (which is included in this listing). The headset is very comfortable (I've left the building with it on a few times), and people can hear me well and I can hear them great. Answering the phone and hanging up are fantastic, just a push of the button on the side and the handset lifts or drops.The range isn't the longest, but it is good, and it beeps in your ear as you get out of range.This is as good as it gets, don't consider any other!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but with a big caveat.","review":"Overall this is a good wireless headset; long range and good reception. What astounds me is the mute function. There is no mute button on the base although there is a cut-out housing the status light that seems designed for such a button. The \\"press for 3 seconds to mute and the same to un-mute\\" is a royal pain. The \\"press\\" requires a LOT of force, sufficient to knock your earpiece askew requiring a re-fit every time you mute or un-mute.My phone has a mute and does not work for some unknown reason when plugged into the Plantronics CS70 base.Be aware: if you NEED mute, and can make-do with your phone mute, make sure you have an iron-clad return guarantee as your phone may NOT mute. The headset mute is not practical.If you do not NEED mute, then this is a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase for my office!","review":"My staff said they really like the feel and performance of this headset.

I am pleased with the sound and the transmission distance from my phone. I can work around the office, multi task and take care of business on the phone. The product was confusing to purchase. You have the system picture and you call it bundle purchase. Below this you have the lifter. I clicked on the lifter also because I think that is how the bundle works if you purchase it also. When I receive the shipment, the lifter is a separte purchase (this is not clear) from the bundle offer. Now it is a hastle to send it back and get my refund. Money is taken out of the original price for shipping (I paid my own shipping and used my sources). So what I originally purchase is credited less money. All because the store is not marketed so it is easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"harsh and ever aggressive","review":"Testify emerges again, this time armed with 5 newtracks and 4 remixed by the likes of Die Krupps, DieWarzau, and Plastic Noise Experience.

A little tap is ok, but not this much. I also like to have a couple ballads in the show, but this one was balladless. Jerry Orbach sounds great, when you get to hear him, but even that isnt very often. Why not get The Fantastics instead? This show just wasnt for me.

I liked them because they're compact. The sound quality is very nice for something so small. The noise cancelling works great too.So why two stars?For starters, the noise cancelling unit is very sensitive to interference. If I put the stick next to my cellphone in my pocket, it creates a very loud, constant popping noise.Worse though is my headphone is broken already. I only use this around the house, but the plug is very weakly designed. Most headphone jacks are curved or made out of hard plastic.This one is long, narrow, and wrapped in rubber. So it took about two weeks of casual use for the headphone jack to completely come off.I'm sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent travel headphones","review":"These headphones sound good, do a decent job at noise canceling, are light weight, and very comfortable.

So for absolute quiet, get the bose. But for great performance for a lower price, these are a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must hear it to believe it","review":"I was some what skeptical about the effectiveness of noise cancelling headphones, until I turned these on in the airplane.

Fit: A bit to tight on the ears, but comfortable enough for an hour or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"Used these on a 10-hour flight to/from South America. They do not block out all ambient noise, but did make movies and music much clearer and easier to understand. Battery life excellent--never replaced them either direction. Work well just as earphones (switched off) also. Other noise cancelling earphones may work better at blocking noise, but they are several hundred dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"I purchased this unit based on owning a prior Sennheiser headset. This unit is nothing like the old one. It is quite a bit flimsier, less comfortable, not loud enough, and the noise cancelling unit is large and unwieldy. In addition, the power button is easy to turn on by accident and thereby drain the battery.

However, the ear cups on these are NOT circumaural, therefore they don't block sound the same way. The cups are smaller than your ear. It's too bad, because if the cups were a little bigger, they'd be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noticed a difference the second I switched them on!","review":"I got these headphones to use while watching videos as I worked out at the gym.

As the undesired noise is not unlike that of an airplane's deep humming, this particular model seemed to be the best choice based on other reviews. Wrong! The headphones actually magnified the sound! Also, even when tested in a fairly quiet environment, the headphones magnify other random noises. Besides being ineffective in canceling noise, they created a very uncomfortable vacuum sensation in my ears, resulting in dizziness and head discomfort. Others who sampled the headphones experienced the same effects. I haven't tried another brand as of yet, but I can say that this particular model of Sennheiser headphones is vastly overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Headphones","review":"These headphones are terrible, the sound is not good,and they hiss. Not worth the money. I have real cheap ones that sound alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Set your expectations low with the PXC 250","review":"Yikes. I had high expectations for a (...) pair of headphones, and the Sennheiser PXC250's really let me down. First of all, the audio quality of these stink. Very tinny highs and non-existent lows. Not to mention, the noise cancellation technology really is nothing more than a hiss generator and volume booster that drown out the ambient sounds. The headphone cord is too short, and the power/control unit for the noise reduction is heavy, big, and always gets in the way.If you want noise cancellation, spring for the Bose. Otherwise buy a better sounding headphone (my cruddy Labtec that I was replacing sounds better) and cranky the volume yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser PXC-250 Very Disappointing","review":"I had very high hopes for these headphones for my 20 hour trip to Brazil, but after they failed to lower the whine of the vacuum in the house, or the chatter of TV, I became suspicious of their performance. I then tested them head to head for sound performance against my standard Walkman headphones, and they sounded tinny and cheap verus the rich sound of the OEM Sony Walkman headphones. I now have them wrapped up for a product return. They aren't worth carrying on the trip to Brazil."},{"rating":"1","title":"50 cent ear plugs would work much better...","review":"I bought this item for my husband to use while studying.

I've tried multiple NC headphones except BOSE, and this surely tops them all. You can't go wrong choosing this. The only features that get a little irritating at times include, 1. the external unit for housing batteries and noise canceling circuitry and, 2. having individual wires connected to each headphone, they get tangled at times; instead having a single cable connected to one side of the headphone would be much nicer.I bought it for $100 shipped through the Amazon marketplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and performance","review":"I decided to get a set of noise canceling headphones as I take long haul flights regularly. I looked briefly at the Bose products but decided they were not so superior to these Sennheisers as to justify the triple price. I've used the PXC250 now on seven or eight long flights and find them great. I had an interesting in flight comparison opportunity recently on British Air Club class as they provide their own unnamed brand of noise canceling headphones. The audio performance was better with the PXC250 as was the comfort. The noise canceling was about equal. Overall, I have zero complaints and think these are a great bang for the buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first and last Noise-Canceling HP for me","review":"I bought these headphones after reading a few online reviews for this product, but without trying them first.The sound quality was not impressive (considering the price), they sound very weak when the noise canceling was off, and when it is on you could hear a very load hiss.This means that in a quiet environment you must suffer the hiss if you want to hear the bass load and clear.I had a personal problem with them which was a painful pressure on the drum-skin similar to scuba-diving( before equalizing ) after using them for a few hours.I ask friends to try them and they experience only a mild pressure so it must be me( and I guess you will experience the some pressure with every noise-canceling headphones )I also didn't like the noise canceling device in the middle of the headphone cable - very heavy and cumbersome, but again this is probably the case with every noise canceling HP.I'm sending them back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome product!","review":"This product is really awesome with respect to design, appearance & performance.

I'd rather get a larger pair for flying, in retrospect.But the worst issue I've had, which I've never anticipated, is electric shocks in one ear every few hours! They come without warning and are completely sporadic. I've sent the headphones back to Sennheiser so I hope this gets sorted - they claim not to have heard of the issue before. But if the problem isn't fixed, it will completely put me off the brand. Not a problem you expect or want - it's a horrible sensation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These headphones do not age well","review":"I've had these headphones for about 18 months. I purchased them for my frequent plane travel and have been happy with their performance. I hadn't used them for awhile, so they've been in their carrying case in my climate controlled home. A couple of weeks ago, I got them out to find that the plastic or whatever coating on the earphones had disintegrated - this is the layer that covers the foam of the part of the headphones that sits over your ears. If you put them on, you would get a coating of little black pieces of the coating all over your ears and neck. Very disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short in the connection","review":"Sometimes they work, most times I'm listening to the short in the cord.

I haven't been disappointed, they're comfortable and pretty efficient at killing sound. I bought them for long distance travel but have actually started wearing them for general non-flying use, so that is a decent endorsement of sound quality (normally use a pair of Grado 80's at home).One thing I really don't like - the separate 'wand' really is a pain, it would so much nicer if they could have found a better solution. Still a good product though and a very decent price on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"It is nice to be able to work in a quite office now that the canceling headphones cancel out most all of the noise. They are are recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Headphones for Air Travel","review":"I had a chance to use the Sennheiser PXC 250 headphones for a holiday airline flight. They really cut down the amibient roar of the jet engines when you are flying. They come with a handy carrying case which easily holds spare batteries and the ipod Nano I was using. In fact, I was able to fit my compact digital camera in the case, as well. They have excellent bass response, much better than the earbuds that came with the Nano. My only complaint is that you can't use the headphones without the noise cancelling \\"stick\\" which is a little bulky. If they plugged into that module, rather than being hardwired, it would provide more flexibility. Even so, I'd definitely recommend them based on the excellent sound quality and portability provided by the folding design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser PXC 250 Headphones","review":"Great for travel or any situation where there is constant background noise.The included adaptors work on various players, aircraft plug in systems, DVD players etc.Lightweight, small and portable.After I bought mine, I purchased several more for Christmas gifts.They aren't cheap, but less than most and a good compromise.Look around and find em for about $100"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"The PXC 250 headphones made a recent flight to Europe much more enjoyable. The noise reduction is quite good, especially in flight (eliminates most of the low rumble of the jet engines).

I believe their reasonable price makes them a great value compared to Bose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would NOT recommend","review":"I bought this after I cut the wire on my bose headphones by accident.I don't like them, at all.. they are too tight on my ears and there are so many wires they easily get tangled.

The PXC-250 are very comfortable. But the PXC-250 do not compare at all to the quality of the HD-600 for quiet listening. The HD-600 are much more dynamic and refined. Also, I find that the PXC-250 introduce a bit of white noise in order to mask the background noise. That's OK for noisy environments like trains and planes, but it is silly for regular listening. On the other hand, the HD-600 are large and impractical for travel. So I am glad that I own both the Sennheiser PXC-250 for travel and the Sennheiser HD-600 for home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones: Sound Pricing, Great Sound!","review":"I tried both the Bose QC2 and the cheaper Aiwa NC-6. I would say that in a spectrum with these 2 headphones occupying each end, the Sennheiser would be just next to the Bose. The reasonable pricing and the compact size compared to the Bose make these headphones very competitive. I tried them next to a washer/dryer to simulate a plane engine roar as much as possible and they do a fantastic job eliminating the rumble. The sound quality is great and clear. The only negative is the somewhat involved folding mechanism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound","review":"Got these for our son for his travels to and from college. He said he really liked these.

I am a software developer and listen to music all day while I write code. Talking, phones ringing, doors closing, hearing the keys on the keyboards all distract me, whereas music is a constant sound that doesn't break my concentration.I have never had noise reduction headphones before and expected to put them on and hear nothing. I still could hear the faint sound of people talking, but when I took them off, to my surprise there was much more noise in the office i.e. keys from other keyboards and people talking in the distant. They really help and the music sounds better than when using my old headphones. I am really curious how the Bose compare, but not enough to spend the extra $200.00 to find out. My only complaint is that they fit really tight on my ears, but hopefully it's only because they are new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling Headphones","review":"They are okay, not too comfortable for wearing for a long time but good value for money.

It has good audio quality and is not as large as the over the ear type and not too small as in-ear models. The battery life is decent and the noise cancelling feature works reasonably well.

It make it harder to be portable and user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headset for the money","review":"Quality product from Sennheiser. I purchased these primarily for air travel, and it is amazing to hear the difference when noise cancelation is off versus on.

If you have never used noise-canceling phones before, you will be amazed at the difference, especially if you are on a plane frequently. I would not want to travel without mine, and have purchased a pair for my wife as well. That being said, since these are \\"ON the ear\\" type headphones as opposed to \\"OVER the ear\\" models, be warned that they do NOT block out ALL of the ambient sound around you. I knew this prior to purchasing, but (sometimes) find myself wishing that I had a pair that completely covered my ears.. Nothing bad against these Sennheiser's, I think they are a great buy at the price, and I would recommend them to others seeking a reasonably-priced pair of noise cancelers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it","review":"I wanted to buy Bose NC Cans but they are quite expensive and I can't afford that.

There is literally no bass if you turn off the noise cancelling. My 20$ Sony headphones sound EXACTLY the same if you turn on the noise cancellation4 - Cancels only about 50 % of the ambient noise (can hear people talking)5 - Cheap case6 - Folding the headphones is a little trickyDont buy them. I am probably going to return them."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing design","review":"While the noise reduction circuitry works fine, it is of little use considering the flawed design. The ear pads fit ON instead of over and around the ears. This not only lets in background noise but also gets pretty uncomfortable after awhile since you have to have them as tight as possible to get any noise reduction at all. Until Sennheiser has the sense to use a more sensible design, stick with the cushioned sets that go over the ear for comfort and keeping out more noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch & Top Quality","review":"Great set of headphones. Only problem is that some airlines (United) has a 2-pin headphone plug is a combination of small & large and the adapter does not fit. To be honest, I've seen this only on United, no other airlines, so I can't really fault Sennheiser. The other thing I've discovered is that I can't use these with my iPhone -- again, not Sennheiser but Apple's design. Headphones really work nice with the noise cancelling feature. and much cheaper here at Amazon as compared to the in-flight shopping catalog!The high quality of these headphones means you need to be careful that you don't hurt your ears on the plane.

That said, it is downhill from there. The design is pitiful. Halfway on the cord between the headphones and the plug is an extremely awkward clunky bar about 4\\"x1\\" that controls the noise canceling function and holds 2 AAA batteries. This is constantly falling off the belt, twisting, jerking the headphones when it falls. I fully expect that this alone will shorten the life of the wires by at least half. This also creates a long loop of wire dangling by you side when you have your disk player also on your belt. This catches on everything and jerks you back physically. Most noise canceling headphones have this on the headphone itself and uses 1 AA battery. While that adds a small amount of weight to the head phone, it is a negligible amount. The Sennhiser is a royal pain is the posterior portion of the anatomy. Had I realized that this design flaw was much trouble, I would have purchased another brand and will certainly do so in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pair of Headphones","review":"The sound is surprising, But the Noise canceling rattled a bit when the plane took off.

They are comfortable. The sound is good, & these really do help keep some sound out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major drawback","review":"These seemed like such a good deal for the price that I purchased a pair for my wife also. I used them for trips in my Miata and also for flying. However, after a year the foam earcups started disintegrating, which I didn't notice until my neck and shirt were covered in black flakes on a flight. While it seemed like it would be easy enough to replace the earcups, the manufacturer no longer carries the replacements, so these are now trash. If you are only going to use these once or twice a year, they are probably fine for you. If you will use them more, go with a better quality like the Bose. The Bose seem expensive initially, but not if you only have to purchase one pair instead of two like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"These were intended for Airplane use and they have been great. They limit noise such as babies crying etc that can be irritating on flights. I have also found them useful relaxing in the yard. I can't hear neighbors lawnmowers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I was really disappointed by these headphones. Due to the small size of the earpieces they don't really provide much isolation. While using them on a flight (which is why I got them in the first place), I had to turn up the volume just to hear the music, and these headphones had no bass at all, just high-end. I ended up getting a pair of JVC HANC250 noise cancelling headphones which work much better and don't have the ridiculous power pack that come with these Sennheisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine","review":"Works well, as described. The only effect I noticed was that higher frequencies seem to be boosted when the cancelling is turned on. Might be my imagination, or maybe its because they can cancel low-frequency noise only. There is definitely some kind of amplifier in it, since it sounds so much louder when enabled. Our issue is street noise, and interestingly you still hear it, just hear what you want as well very clearly. This is a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at any price","review":"I bought these headphones based on a good review at Tom's Hardware, but I am sorely disappointed in them. The noise cancellation feature does work (15dB only), but the sound quality is really bad. The biggest complaint is that the bass is severely attenuated, but the mid-range and highs also sound uneven -- as though the frequency response is not very flat. My 16-year old son thinks the inexpensive Panasonic headphones that came with his $49 CD player \\"sound a lot better\\". Maybe these just need to get broken in, but if they sound this bad when new, I'm not going to wait -- I'm returning them. I would not buy these at $20, and certainly not at $100+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent back","review":"These headphones were nothing like I expected, I couldn't turn the volume up loud enough, and they weren't comfortable.

The sound level is too low, there's no bass (especially with the noise cancellation off, only a bit better with it on), etc. Instead, I'm switching back to my Koss PortaPro headphones... they're AMAZING, a lot less money, don't require batteries... and believe me, no matter how ugly they look, they're almost as great as $400 over the ear giant audiophile headphones.... I'm super happy with the Koss PortaPro, but not all that happy with these.... actually, I'm quite disappointed in them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these","review":"I've had a pair of these for about 3 years with almost no use (only use on long flights). They barely muffle exterior sound. My biggest complaint is that the earpieces have literally disintegrated. This started when they were 6 months old. The leather cover disconnected as did the foam padding. So each earpiece is a ball us mush, and that is with them being stored and transported in their own case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to my expectations","review":"I bought these headphones to provide a reduction in distracting noise when I was trying to listen to audio in a public environment. The reduction was not really satisfactory, so I returned the headphones to Amazon (I must say that the return process was smooth and easy, with refund also on my return postage).In retrospect: It may be that I expected too much from headphones that do not enclose the ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Christmas Gift","review":"Five members of my family tested this and none of them found it at all helpful.

Based on reviews here and elsewhere I was not expecting complete noise cancellation, but I would estimate these phones only reduced the jet engine noise by less than fifty percent. Pressing the phones closer to my ears improved the performance somewhat, but I have to wonder if it is worth the effort to haul these phones onto the plane if they only reduce the noise by half or less. On the other hand, I have used the phones with a new Phillips portable DVD player and find them to work well with this device, though you do need to have the noise cancellation turned on to get better, full sound. The phones are very comfortable to wear and fold up easily for compact storage in the provided case."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good travel headphone.","review":"PXC-250 is a lifesaver if you listen to music on trains, busses, and airplanes. However, the noise cancelling does not do much against other types of noise (such as street / traffic noise) or low-level noise such as an air conditioner. The sound quality is good, but what you're really paying for here is its active reduction. If you're looking for an outdoor / indoor headphone, try the Sennheiser PX-200 or PX-100, or something from the Grado Labs line of 'phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin C","review":"When I first purchased these headphones I was impressed with their comfort and the noise cancelling capabilities. They are comfortable and they do cancel noise. The design reliability however, does not keep pace with the sonic qualities of the headphones.

Great ride while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy, good value","review":"If you travel, especially by air, YOU NEED THESE. Period. Sennheiser's stuff is generally considered to be second only to the much more expensive Bose, and for my money these do the job. I've worn these on the T in Boston, the El in Chicago and on flights and all I could hear was my music. My only complaint is figuring out how to keep the wires untangled was tough at first, but once you get the hang of it it works fine. It's also a bonus that they work without the noise-cancelling feature; when I travel I hook these up to my laptop and get great sound quality.

When they broke right before a holiday trip I decided to try these. Sennheiser usually makes very good products and this pair of headphones seemed perfect for travel and was almost half the price of the Sony pair I had been using.While they were light and easily folded into a nice storage pouch, the noise reduction unit was large and inconvenient. The sound quality was extremely disappointing. Even setting the bass on my ipod or video player at max it made little difference. The 'noise cancellation' slightly muted the sound of the plane engines, but did nothing to help with the voices and crying babies nearby. After 6 hours the pressure of the earphones on my ears started to hurt quite a bit.I returned them immediately and will gladly pay the extra money for the Sony pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser PXC 250 Noise Canceling Headphones","review":"Great product.

HOwever, they are much better than any \\"in-ear\\" noise canceling headphones I've tried.Conclusion: I'm still looking for the \\"perfect\\" combination of small size,confort and noise cancelation, but it's getting expensive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For The Price","review":"I got these on sale and find them to be pretty good for the price. They cut down on airplane engine sound allowing for more pleasant listening in fight. I use the Sennheiser PX 200 at home, which deliver a little better sound. Both are compact, easy to carry, and comfortable to wear. The PXC 250 come with a soft carrying case with a zippered compartment that my MP3 fits into perfectly and all goes neatly into my handbag.

I'm happy I got them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Design","review":"The noise cancelling unit is bulky and gets in the way of doing things. I had this for a day, and the noise cancelling unit, which hangs from the wire, hit something. The case broke on the noise cancelling unit. I had to keep batteries in the noise cancelling unit with tape, which looks awful, and makes it difficult to change batteries. Other noise cancelling headphones, like the Bose or Sony, have the battery insertion on the headphones themselves, not knocking around from the wire. I got this because the reviews and the price were good. The sound is good, the design is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the active","review":"I didn't like these for the following reason.

I thought it was the trailer so I switched to a pair of $5 earbuds and could hear the voices fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good noise canceling. Wires a pain.","review":"The noise canceling is very good. I bought the headphonesfor commuting on the Long Island Railroad (a New York Citycommuter railroad) and was wanted to reduce ambient noise.The mechanical train noise is reduced considerably.People's voices less so, but someone's words arow or two away from me, are reduced to unintelligiblemumbling; a good thing! The headphones however do littleto help block off someone sitting right next to me or veryclose by. But that's OK since Sennheiser doesn't claim thatthese headphones will block voices at all.My only gripe is that the wires become easily tangled. There'sno way to physically unhook the external noise-cancelingcylinder. Since I continually keep my AM/FM radio attached,the wires seem perpetually to need a difficult untangling session.My guess is that it's only a matter of time before the wires break,or they get stressed to the point of shorting.Still overall, I'm happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"Sound quality isn't too bad, although the bass is a little muddy.

Not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, atrocious design","review":"Sennheiser PXC 250 Active Noise Canceling HeadphonesOther reviewers have mentioned the spaghetti-like wiring on these. The inferior phone plug connection is less immediately evident but more troubling over time.If you use yours daily, as I do on my NYC subway commute, the connection between headphone wire and phone plug will begin to fray in very short order. Soon you'll be left with one channel of sound, and a bit later, no sound at all. Not a good product for those who don't like a tangle of wires that will become useless scrap before long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than advertised","review":"I have tried out Bose, Sony and Sennheiser. They are all good, but have subtle differences. I prefer the program Sennheiser uses as it reduces almost all lower frequency background and high frequency \\"hiss\\" noise. I ride the Portland OR area MAX light rail, and that's where these Sennheisers shine. I can watch my iPod video, or listen to tunes at a lower volume setting and still filter out way more than 3/4 of the noise in the compartment. But I can still hear someone speaking to me. Great.The kit includes an airline adapter, a mini-to-standard headphone adapter, and really nice carrying pouch. The pouch is generous in size: I carry the unit, the mic/power unit, my classic iPod and Ipod Nano in it easily.If you are looking for reasonably priced noise cancelling headphones that filter high and low and has a nice accessory kit, this may be the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good noise cancelling","review":"I've never used noise cancelling headphones before and am quite impressed with these. I used them on a recent flight and the difference is dramatic. They do make an audible hiss when the noise cancellation is turned on, but you would only use it when the environment is noisy enough that you don't notice the hiss.They fold up nicely and are very comfortable. The external battery pack is awkward, but does have a clip that you can attach to your shirt or belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound - poor design","review":"While these headphones sound good, they're poorly designed and will eventually fall apart. To use the noise cancelling feature, there is a switch which you must remember to turn off or your batteries will die.

It's all being held together with glue and rubber bands now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seem durable, work well","review":"Have had a set for about one month. After seven trips (5 jet, 2 turboprop) - engine noise is easily cut 50%. Noise reduction is biased toward lower frequencies, but makes sleeping MUCH easier. Since the noise reduction electronics are integrating, passenger comments, conversations, announcements, etc. are actually clearer (better S/N). When the aux. input jack is used for MP3 (Palm, Rio) results are superb. Also works very well on output from an IBM laptop.

What is 70% noise reduction? Which 30% remain? Noise reduction works well with lower, deeper frequencies. If there is no lower frequencies the effect is difficult to detect. But the technical means to reduce noise seem to be multiple. Inversion of sound signals is one, selective amplification - it seems - another, and as an add-on you get some white noise. If you use it for listening to music the impression of noise reduction is strong. It certainly may be 70% or even more. But if you just use the phones without an mp3 player or another source of sound - it rather feels like 30%-40%.

With these on and not connected to any other audio source, low tones (engine noise) were muffled (even at the rear of the plane - behind the wings and engines), but you can still hear high tone voices and conversations. They sound like someone talking down the hallway from where you are. With music playing, I can't hear anything else.I don't have experience with other units to compare, but hopefully this helps you.

Mission accomplished. On the train, they're great for blocking out noise, ditto on a plane. Battery life has been excellent so far. And I'm perfectly happy with the sound quality.They're not perfect. Outside, they're very susceptible to wind noise. The battery pack is not convenient for daily commuting. And while they're comfortable enough for me to wear an hour or two at a time, I wouldn't want to have them on all day.

Season and the first l-hour b/w shows of 34 from 1961-1962 which were also great, except they were starting to cut some action scenes with more dialogue supposed to flesh-out the characters.l And yes...This is another great GUNSMOKE classic early TV collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"purchased this for my father for christmas and i think he has watched it everyday since! couldnt ask for a better gift for the old fashioned at heart :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic Mexican Rancheras!","review":"If you love the ever popular words of Jose Alfredo Jimenez, than this CD and the accompanying volume 2 are a must-have! His compositions are timeless and it's easy to understand why mainstream pop artists of Latin America continue to record his songs. Simple, honest and powerful words backed by the best Mariachi band in Mexico! Gracias y que siempre Viva Jose Alfredo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariachi Mania","review":"Fabulous Mariachi music. Makes you wanna put the top down on your car and sing at the top of your lungs. Makes you wanna be a singer in a Mariachi Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low-cost Citrus Juicer","review":"I was looking for a lemon and lime juicer, something easy to use and cheap. This item fits the bill wonderfully.It's three pieces. The bottom cup has a little spout on it. It also has a non-skid ring on the bottom to help prevent splippage. The top and bottom cups are graduated with Tbls, ml, and Cups measurements. All three pieces fit very well together and disassemble easily. Also, the manufacturer states that this is dishwasher safe, though I hand-wash mine.My mother in law has already made lots and lots of bottles of her \\"healthy\\" style lemonade with this contraption. When you're done, it fits easily into a tall drawer/cubbard.It is made entirely out of plastic, so we'll see how long this thing lasts, though I personally only plan to use it infrequently.All in all, I feel like I got a really good value at ~$5, especially compared to all these other more expensive juicers that may or may not juice all that well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Breed (not a lemon)","review":"It's so simple, even I could have thought of it. No modern gadgetry--just a traditional juicer that's been designed to provide the most juice for the least amount of effort. The arch and grooves are shaped just right, the base is secure, and the dome--while not especially useful as a \\"measuring cup\\"--assures things don't get sprayed all over the place (and person) after the juice has been secured in the base. This takes the sting, some of the mess, and most of the work out of putting the squeeze on 5-6 lemons.Wish all the gadgets I ordered were this inexpensive and efficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, easy to use","review":"I've used the juicer to make lemonade and orange juice. It's simple and sturdy. You can add the pulp to your drink or keep it separate. The top and bottom pieces are both measuring cups. I like this juicer a lot, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressive Citrus Juicer","review":"It is a nice size but I too plan to return this item. The white plastic juicer part won't remain in the clear base. The least amount of pressure makes it pop-up and off of the base. This is a very messy problem for a product of this type. The plastic is thinner and lighter than I expected too. It isn't worth the money or the aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I bought this and it is of the poorest quality. The juicer part will not snap on the base. It just pops off. This is going straight back to Amazon.Also, mine was orange and not white as shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly manufactured...","review":"I love the design of this juicer but I plan to return it because the base does not fit together with the juicer and lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective juicer","review":"This little guy does the job on citrus. We bought it as a supplement for Lemonade Stand days when we have several people juicing. The reservoir is very small - two lemons can cause an overflow. Because of the markings, I thought the top could also be used as a reservoir, but it is not currently designed to work that way. It's perfect for small quantities."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"it is not strong to squize lemon and too small than i expected. i cannot recommend this. you'd better to buy others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not arrive as advertised","review":"The picture is a nice sleek white colored citrus juicer. The actual product that will arrive in the mail is puke orange. If this shade of orange happens to match your other kitchen supplies or utensils, you have worse problems than having a different colored juicer arriving at your doorstep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works much better than expected","review":"This juicer is the most efficient one I've ever owned. It may not look impressive, but it squeezed out more juice than either of my other two, and with fewer fruits. It also measures the amount of juice for me so I don't have to dirty an extra measuring utensil or transfer the juice. I am completely happy with the product and if it ever breaks I would certainly replace it with one exactly the same. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Juices Citrus Fruits.","review":"I needed a hand citrus fruit juicer. This one has sharp edges, the right profile and ample/nifty reservoirs.its also affordable.so five stars for being inexpensive and effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Non-skid bottom and works great. Has small capacity to keep it stable. Has a spout to pour the juice into the larger top after each piece of fruit. This thing works really well."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't hold much","review":"this juicer only can be used with the small bottom part. i thought the larger dome side could be used interchangeably, but i think it is really just a cover for the reamer portion of the juicer. there is no lip on it to fit with the dome. the base of the juicer holds up to 1/4 cup. it has a spout, but if you are making something like pitchers of lemonade this is not sufficient for it unless you have a lot of time on your hands. The reamer part is also ver wide and tall and the skimmer holes are narrow and clog up with pulp whil the juice squirts all over the place. for the money, it does a fair job, but i am disappointed. it has tipped over a few times too because the base is so shallow. i do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I thought it was.","review":"When I opened up the box I couldn't stop laughing. It looked like something you would find in a child's play kitchen. However once I tried to juice with it, it performed pretty good. I do not think it will hold up for any length of time and be careful not to press to hard on the orange when you are squeezing the juice out as I am sure it would break. It looks like something that should be sold in the Dollar Store but it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Citrus Juicer","review":"Good value for the price, effectively juices limes, lemons and small oranges, which is what I purchased it for. Would not fit large oranges or grapefruit on it though. I used to make lime meringue pie one day, unfortunately for this many limes it was exhausting to use. Great for the price though, and good if you don't need to squeeze much, saves you cleaning a bigger machine. I use the measuring cup for other things too. One thing I will say is that the cup/lid on top doesn't stay on very well which can get annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent juicer","review":"This juicer is great for juicing lemons and limes. Oranges are a bit harder when you're doing more than one or two because the pulp really builds up meaning you have to clean it often. I love that it has two cups with different sizes. It's great for measuring and getting the exact amount of juice you need. I've bought this for a few family members as gifts since I was so happy with mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cute","review":"This is a great little juicer. I just hope I don't break it while pressing down on a lemon. It's especially handy for a person with arthritis..just be careful as it's light plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transfer this to under \\"Toys\\"","review":"This juicer (turns out to be a toy) is poor quality. The initial pulp blocks the strain holes and lets the juice simply overflow the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"This product is probably meant for use with lime/lemon but not orange... its very small, not sturdy, theres always the feeling that its gonna fall down ... i dont think its meant for daily use... its probably more for show/display on the kitchen shelf sort of use and one in a while actual squeezing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture and product received are different","review":"Cannot get in touch with a person through Amazon. First time I am truly disappointed with a product. The item I was sent is 'ORANGE' and it seems miniature. This juicer might work well for lemons and limes and very small clementimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for lime/lemon NOT for oranges","review":"This cute,cheap and compact device is awesome for juising lime/lemon but not too good for oranges. Mainly, bc the container is too small and you can only juice half an orange at the time, then u have to empty /clean all the pulps and seeds afterwards, it is ready to juice the rest of orange!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little dynamo!","review":"This is the first juicer I have ever had that is accurate, handy and easy too use. Clean up is two seconds of my time. The measuring top is such a luxury when making recipes that call for specific amounts. Every kitchen should have one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Edging Shreds","review":"After two washings, the edging shredded, making the washcloth unusable for guests and making it an early candidate for washing the car. The problem is a duplicate of the problem I saw with the edging of a PEM America bath towel, which also shredded after only a few uses. These products are lightly used and their failure to stand up in light use speaks against a recommendation. Conclusion: find another manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice towels, not a bad price","review":"I bought a set comprising a facecloth, a bath towel and a hand towel. They are a nice weight and absorbent, reasonably soft, but not plush. The color I got is a greyish/slate blue, which is a little dull, but accurately represented on the webpage. The quality of the fabric is good, and they came through the first washing without puckering on the edges (which I have seen in some cheaper towels)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightnin' at his primal best","review":"Sure, Lightnin' tends to recycle his grooves and licks, but each recording has its own feel depending on the musicians he was playing with, electric vs. acoustic, etc. This CD is one of the grittiest, gut-bucket Lightnin's I've heard. Mostly slow blues on electric, accompanied only by a base and metronome-like drummer, this recording was obviously created in the same foggy, pitch black place in the human subconcious as John Lee Hooker's Chess sides. If you have a taste for good blues, this will raise the hair on your neck and have you wondering why no one really plays this style of blues anymore. Do people really prefer the recent studio-slick alligator recordings to THIS?!?!? Buy it. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pox On All Their Houses","review":"Mostly the producer for even conceiving of the session, the rhythm section for taking the gig and Po' Lightnin' for seemingly not even being aware there were a bassist and drummer present. Kinda cool to hear him play the electric guitar, though. Don't get me wrong, Lightnin' is one of my faves, but not this date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toys for small mouths, but not for strong chewers","review":"I'm always looking for small fetch balls for my 15 pound dogs. They love to play fetch, but their mouths are so small that normal sized balls (like a tennis ball) just don't work well. These balls are great -- they're soft and very small, but my terrier was able to chew right through one in less than an hour. I removed the squeaker so they wouldn't swallow it, and they still enjoy playing with the ball, but I'd definitely keep an eye on your chewer while playing with this ball.Also, just a word of advice, I wouldn't let any dog over 20 pounds play with these. They are so small that bigger dogs could easily swallow them whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocal Mix Stands Alone","review":"Wow, I would have expected more from the pumpkins on this one. Well, Billy's not the one who does all the remixes, so I've still got full faith in him. Track #1 (Vocal Mix) is even better than the original 1979. The last three, however, don't even sound like the song. They don't have the lyrics or remotely sound like anything familiar... you can't even dance to it! So, if you like paying 10+ bucks for one song, go for it. If not, get some other Pumpkins stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"If you're a huge SP fan like myself and you feel you should buy this to include in your SP collection, then go for it. If you get it, then you'll be subjected to third-rate, disposable, dance garbage. Buy the 1979 import single with the six songs on them. Every song on that single rules. This cd is just awful. The Pumpkins themselves said that these remixes were so bad that they had to release them."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and sweet","review":"When I bought 'Calling all Stations' I didn't know what to expect.But I found myself listening to 'Calling all Stations' even more than any other Genesis album.Now I'll admit that 'shipwrecked' isn't my favourite on the album.But after you listen to it for a while,it grows on you.But anyways,I basically bought the cd to hear the new versions of 'no son of mine','lovers leap',and 'turn it on again' with Ray Wilson on vocals.Now I don't have anything against acoustic sets,being a guitar player and all I love them.And these reign superb.EXCEPT for the fact that they're all shortened.You only get about half of 'no son of mine' and they skip a total verse in 'turn it on again'.But if your looking for a new sound of Genesis,this cd is for you.But if you wanna hear the whole versions of the songs,then I wouldn't waste my time......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this CD! Buy Sam Cooke-Greatest Hits instead.","review":"Sam Cooke recorded wonderful music but these recordings are not given justice on this CD. This is almost the same track listing as the LP of the same name and layout. This CD was put out when CD's first hit. Consequently, it is not really mastered for CD (although it says it is remastered). The volume on this CD is very, very, very low. There are no dynamics. There are only 13 songs (one is an alternate recording). Clearly, this disc does not take advatage of the sonic possibilities of the the CD, nor does it take advantage of the amount of music CD's can accomodate. The 1998 release, Sam Cooke-Greatest Hits, has 20 songs and is really mastered for CD."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(B,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-782e9023"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/54.md","filePath":"quotes/54.md"}'),j={name:"quotes/54.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
