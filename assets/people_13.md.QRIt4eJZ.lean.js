True, it is often a bit cheesy and sentimental, but come on, it all fits. Great music, great acting, great writing, and one of the best premises in all of television. The show is especially good seen on dvd if you were lucky enough to latch onto the show during its run but don't remember many specifics. The first season is particularly daring and heartfelt because the showwas apparently in a constant state of limbo- the cast and crew were supposedly constantly told that the show would be cancelled.

Too much of the music is over-produced and has not aged well since it's late 60s release. However, there is some very bright light at the end of the tunnel. \\"Long Haired Soulful\\" is an amazing artifact from the pschedelic years. It is pretty well written and absolutely performed with incredible virtuosity. The big surprise is that the players on this track, as well as backing on a couple of others, are the pre-Joe Walsh James Gang. Lead vocals by Phil Giallombardo, drums by Jimmy Fox, Bass by Tom Kriss, and Lead Guitar by the then miraculous Glenn Schwartz.None of the credits are provided on the album, but those who were present in the Cleveland music scene at that time will remember this awesome track.Too bad the rest of the album is so, how shall I say this, awful.Well worth the price for this track alone, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Embarrassed to Play for Second Graders","review":"I ordered this CD with the intention of using it in an art lesson on Paul Klee.

It is absolutely AWFUL! I will not dare play this for a class of second graders, lest they think I am a crazy hippie and never ever take me seriously again. This is not good music by any standards today. However, maybe VERY young children might enjoy it. . .

She finally gets her comeuppance and winds up dead after sampling a bit of poisoned quiche at a class pot luck supper.Everyone in the class has a motive for killing, and it is up to Jane to find out who did it.Like Jill Churchill's other books, I figured out who the murderer was before the end of the book, but it was pleasant cozy mystery.Recommend reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quiche before Dying","review":"I must be missing something because this author's books get 5 stars. However, I felt the characters were never fully developed, that they lacked depth. Also some of the events seemed forced. I couldn't accept that they really would have happened so I was unable to be drawn into the story. An example of this is Mrs. Pryce inviting her classmates to her home for dinner. The book didn't so much bore as disappoint because the elements of a good mystery were there and the characters had the potential of growing on you. I'd consider this a light weight mystery. Unlike an Elizabeth George or even a Faye Kellerman mystery that pulls you into the story and keeps you thinking about it long after it's finished and whose characters you hate to say goodbye to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was absolutly great.

The boys loved the game aspect, the fighting, and the amazing characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tour de Force","review":"What a book! Vivian Vande Velde does an amazing job of capturing both the virtual world of an interactive game--the Heir Apparent of the title--and the emotional world of a lively 14 year-old girl who is trapped playing it. Vande Velde balances both worlds masterfully and never slows down the action or humor as Giannine faces one challenge after the next. I would recommend this book to everyone--teenagers, parents, teachers, fantasy-lovers, and non-fantasy lovers alike. It is a delight to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groundhog day meets Tough Guide to Fantasyland","review":"Giannine is pretty much your typical Vande Velde heroine - a young teen girl whose life isn't going very well in general and suddenly gets magically worse. Like the others, she is sort of bitchy, but a little less bitchy than most of them. (I'm not complaining. The bitchiness is always cute.)I agree that the many start overs got sort of tiresome. But the story held my interest well. The many computer-generated characters are amusing, satirical takes on fantasy stereotypes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book but I want a sequel!","review":"Spoiler Alert!This book was really good and really suspenseful! I read it in one night because I had to know what happens. The character development was good and it moved at a quick but smooth pace. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does get a little repetetive with the game having to start over several times and it kind of ends on a cliffhanger. Does she get a better relationship with her dad? Does she date the designer of the game? Please Vivian, write a sequel to this book and A Well-Timed Enchantment. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing band","review":"In a musical world full of junk, its refreshing to find a band that have made music their craft. And they take a craftsman's approach to their songs. Autovein (now known as Revolution One)sounds like a three way musical love child of Tom DeLonge (Blink 182, Angels and Airwaves), Toad the Wet Sprocket and Tonic.

Y. Agnon was (another Israeli author). However, I'm having a very hard time getting through this because of how badly -- truly amateurishly -- written this is. The first dictum of writing is \\"show, don't tell.\\" That means use dialogue and exposition effectively, don't endlessly narrate. Guess what, this is endless narration. Worse, the author uses the \\"omniscient\\" approach. She is in everybody's head at once, narrating how they feel, what they're thinking, etc., etc. I personally am stopped in my tracks whenever I confront that level of bad writing. I don't think the author has had any training as a writer whatsoever. A very great disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frazz is a winner!","review":"If you are not already familiar with the Frazz comic strip, you are missing out on one of the more thoughtful and well written comics that are currently in syndication. Jef Mallett displays keen observational insight concerning people and life experiences through the eyes of an elementary school janitor and it's students and faculty, and usually leaves you thinking and laughing at the end of each strip. Live at Bryson Elementary is a collection of comics from the beginning of the strip's history, and you will see a little bit of subtle difference in the appearance of the characters as the series progresses. This book would make a great introduction to the world of Frazz for the uninitiated, or a great trip down memory lane for those who have been in the know for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frazz: Live from Bryson Elementary","review":"It's a great book.

Perhaps this was a little too \\"authorized\\". Too many dubious-sounding and self-serving \\"facts\\" are given by the Brothers Krofft. The author seems to have done little research on his own, and depends completely on interviews with a few people. Far too many times in the book, someone would say \\"I don't know whatever happened to so-and-so\\" - and the book just leaves it that way instead of doing a little legwork and looking. How about a few more pictures? If the author really had access to the Krofft archives, he should have included a few more photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough sledding","review":"Missed opportunity. Filled with restatements, self-serving quotes, warm and fuzzy verbiage, etc. Could have been condensed down to a 75 page book by a sharp editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed opportunity","review":"Yes, when you read this book, you see all the missed opportunities. The behind-the-scenes photos which aren't in the book. The author's research skills are lacking. Where are all the great images from the Krofft archives (like the interesting costume sketches and artwork auctioned off recently by Kroffts)? The color photo insert is cute, at best. This book leaves you crying, because it'll probably be the only book on the Krofft shows and it is a waste of time. Granted, it's cute and it's all that's out there, but what a book with unrealized potential. We fans wanted so much more and the author does not deliver here, folks. Pass it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trippy television ... a trippy book","review":"What I enjoyed most about this book: It was a fun and breezy -- yet informative -- read about a genre of television I had kind of forgotten about, yet the book vividly brought the shows all back to me. Then there were some great behind-the-scenes things, like the Kroffts' positions today on whether the apparent drug-culture references in the shows (even in pun titles like \\"H.R. Pufnstuf\\" and \\"Lidsville\\") were really intended to be interpreted that way. I recommend it to any Saturday morning/Krofft fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else, please...","review":"Much as I love Goldsmith, this is a soundtrack well worth not buying. It is highly repetitive. Like in, repeatedly. As in, the same melody over and over and over again.All soundtracks have repetative elements, but this one goes way beyond the norm.

But please, not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Jerry Goldsmith is an absolute geinus. In fact, I do believe he and John Williams often have tea with Zeus on Mount Olympus beacuse they are GODS. But, the fact that CONGO's score works well in the film does not excuse the fact that the soundtrack release is an abomination. Don't get me wrong, I love the music Goldsmith has provided for this flop. It is bold and grand, including some of my favorite Goldsmith melodies. I have many times watched this film in order to bathe in Goldsmith's magestic African themes, but I will never allow this soundtrack to infect my CD player. The tax on my soul would be much too high. The cues are terrible, the recording is a joke, and to top it all off, the tracks are intentionally listed in random order on the CD's jacket. Why? If you buy this soundtrack, you need to see a psychologist because you obviously enjoy inflicting pain upon yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Goldsmith Winner","review":"Goldsmith does a marvelous job, once again! The only complaint I have (and it's certainly not with the music, thus the 5-star rating), is that on my copy of the CD the tracks aren't listed in order anywhere except the disk itself. It's as if the studio didn't bother with a final edit on the disk's packaging materials - a real shame given the quality of Goldsmith's writing and of the performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love dinosaurs?

There are also a couple of games on this CD that I enjoyed playing when my son was not around!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We bought this for our 3 year old based on the reviews found here. We were surprised at the poor quality of the software. The sound kicks in and out which means you can't hear all of the instructions.

I just think they need to work out some of the bugs within the software."},{"rating":"2","title":"The #1 Xmas present","review":"My son loves the activities in this software. Although some of them are skill building, the fact that its all presented in a dinosaur context makes it extra interestsing for a 4.5 year old.

I also have a 5 1/2 year old daugther in kidergarten who just loves the games. They could both use the software with no directions from us.

It is not violent (except for the opening scene of a T-Rex knocking down rocks). The games are cute and enjoyable.Unfortunately, the software is not compatible with newer operating systems such as Windows Me, 2000, or XP. The sound cuts in and out or stops completely and there is no way to fix it. (Technical support will tell you that the operating systems are unsupported.) Be aware that unless you are still running Windows 95 or 98, you are going to have this problem.

A datasheet and a few app notes would trump this joke","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn how to develop C for an 8051 (shocking given the title of the book). This book gives zero theory, terrible examples, and is tied to specific hardware (meaning - again - that it's not general enough to provide theory or practice of writing embedded C). I have a heavy EE background and am a reasonable assembler programmer. I wanted to learn embedded C because I thought I needed it for a particular application. Turns out that a) I didn't need C (assembly worked fine/better), and b) if you want to learn embedded C (and already know some PC C and programming), you DON'T want this book. It stinks, it's over priced, and certainly isn't for anyone who is serious about doing anything beyond the prescribed projects in this book.

It isn't as great as Gasoline Alley, but pretty close. This is a fun, loud, last fling record for the Stewart/Wood/ partnership. That is why it is valuable.

Highly recommended to all who love Pope's verse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Kindle","review":"The kindle version is very poorly done. In particular, the notes - essential for following Pope's allusions, many of which were pretty obscure even when they were first published two and a half centuries ago - are jumbled together en mass at the end of the book, without any links to the text. They are essentially unusable, and so is the book. It's not that the publisher didn't know how to link, as there are hyperlinks for the indexes of titles and first lines.

They also were taken from what most agree to be his two worst albums (Ultimate Sin and No rest for the Wicked) if you are intrested buy those two albums. not a combination with 2-3 songs from each."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE SAYING THIS!","review":"First I want to apologize to OZZY and everyone else like me who loves OZZY more than life itself, when I say that this is the worst thing he's ever done. I've seen him in concert 13 times in 7 different states, and this is a poor excuse for a live recording. Miracle Man; Bloodbath In Paradise; and Tattoo Dancer, although good songs, just aren't the kind of songs that sound that great live. Shot in the dark is just too MTV pop for me anyway. Sweet Leaf and War Pigs; undoubtedly 2 of the all time greatest songs he ever did, sounded better on Speak Of The Devil. Maybe it's the band, or the amount of time it took to record this album,(It's definitely not OZZY's fault)or maybe OZZY just needed some quick cash. I don't know, but OZZY's 1000 times better live than this. For a die-hard OZZY fan like me, it's a must-have; but for someone hungry for live OZZY, I recommend \\"Speak Of The Devil\\" \\"Tribute\\" & \\"Reunion\\"Sincerely, NITEMARE"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ozzman has came but will never leave!","review":"the ozz helped us rock through the years and never stopped so I am going to show my appreciaion by wtiting this column. He rocked with good times and bad times with Sabbath then he gave all he could with rock idol Randy Rhoads and blistered with Zaak. So really he can build up a great hit with any one and that song woulg go straight to the rock charts. He has been blessed with a gift (a talent) to give us the rock that we want. but going to this album I think that it is awesome to do Sabbath songs and Ozzy songs all on one album. Which is why I like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure why this was released.","review":"I'm not sure why this was released. Ozzy has alot of live albums out. Anyway, this album isn't bad. Ozzy's voice is excellent on this CD. If you want my opinion get this album for 'Shot In The Dark'. The best live version. Plus the awesome guitar solo at the end of the song spices it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best version of War Pigs of all time!","review":"This live ep is very good.Ozzy Osbourne,Geezer Butler,Zakk Wylde and Randy Castillo made a very good lineup.The bass on this record is exeptionnal.All songs are very well recorded;Miracle Man is very good (the intro at the beginning made a great ambiance),Bloodbath In Paradise,Shot In The Dark,Tatooed Dancer are very well played.For the classics Sabbath songs;Sweet Leaf is pretty cool but,the song is shorter than the original).And for War Pigs;THIS IS THE BEST VERSION OF WAR PIGS I HAVE HEARD IN MY LIFE! I suggest this live ep for all Ozzy and Sabbath fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too firm for baby!","review":"I bought this mattress because I like the Simmons name. They generally have great mattresses and I liked how firm it was because the birthing classes and everything I'd read said to make sure that the mattress was firm. I thought, the firmer the better right? Wrong--this mattress is way too firm for my now 6-month old son, even with a super thick mattress pad. I always noticed that when we went on play dates and he would nap in a different crib he would sleep twice as long as he did at home and I thought that was weird. We were also having trouble getting him to sleep through the night. He always seem to toss from side to side and then on his back and finally to his belly. Yesterday I borrowed a friend's mattress to \\"try out\\", and guess what--he slept through the night (8pm - 6:30am!!). Maybe a fluke, but I think the mattress is too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"My son loves this mattress, and has always slept well. It meets all the safety requirements, which was our primary consideration when buying it. However, my son is 10 months old, and has slept on the mattress for only 9 months, and it is already coming apart! There are wear holes in one of the corners--right through the vinyl! Let me just state that the mattress doesn't receive any rough treatment; our son just sleeps on it. We were planning on him sleeping on it until he outgrew his toddler bed. There is no reason why a company such as Simmons should have a mattress that is so flimsy. I currently have a claim in to Simmons' warranty department, so hopefully they do something about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad delivery","review":"We received 2 seperate mattresses that were both damaged.We finally gave up and went to the store to buy 1.Very bad service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly well done","review":"You'd think an independent film would be lacking in some ways, but to be honest with you, I was blown away by the production value and content(it looks like a 5 million dollar movie at least). And to listen to the soundtrack, you'd be hard pressed to find an independent movie with as stellar of a soundtrack. As for the acting, I think some of the performances were the best by unknowns that I've seen in a long time. (the two leads and the blond-dreadlocked girl were great)Whatever the case, I highly recomend this film because it carries the heart and soul of the filmmakers to the audience with great writing, solid performances and magnificent music (the score is apparently composed by a Foo Fighter, Nate Mendel?)

LL Cool J lights a lighter, and throws it, when he throws it the flame doesnt go out, and it hits the WATER and explodes in a huge explosion? WTF?

Then moves on to the story line and never stops. I think each actor brings a special mix of their character that's a step above most 2D characters In horror films today.But alas one of the real tests was the Blu Ray copy and I didn't think It anything exceptional at all for a Blu Ray transfer. My regular DVD looks every so slightly as good as the Blu Ray when upconverted In the Blu Ray player. I had wonder If the Blu Ray was worth It. So my advice If you love the movie get In Blu Ray, If you just want own to watch the DVD should be fine even on widescreen. Hence 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video and Audio Quality","review":"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.

It has a few exciting moment's but that's about it. To be honest I was glad it was a present and I didn't pay for it. It has some mindless shark attack excitiment which can be ok, but it's not the best film in the world, at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if Jaws went to college","review":"When I saw the trailer for this movie I first thought, not forme. Then one day in the video store there was nothing in except forDeep Blue Sea. So I said what the hell. To my suprise the movie was pretty darn good. The story is completely different from Jaws, special effects were tight, sound FX smooth. Best of all the people who survive the calacalysmic night are the ones who deserved it. The DVD is complete with a documentary, deleted scenes and great sound and picture. A good addition to horror collections.

COntrary to what I've been hearing, the performances delivered in this masterpiece of a movie (notably by Jackson) were wonderful. I believe Jackson gave his very best performance in it.

It's depressing because the only good actor in the movie gets killed off...I guess sharks are attracted to good actors...they have good taste.Everyone in this movie is so stupid that its attempts at being serious makes your stomach turn. The girl gets killed because she jumps into the ocean with blood on her hands, and can't get out. How dumb can you possibly get? The sharks weren't smart at all; the people were too stupid to outwit a shark. The sharks didn't follow the people; they just followed the water.It's kind of ironic because they're looking for a cure of Alzheimer's, but it seems they have forgotten about their common sense. God, how awful.I don't know if you noticed, but a movie isn't terrifying if the people in the movie do stupid stuff to get into a \\"scary\\" situation. The Exorcist is a scary movie, not this. This is like Jaws and The Real World put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.","review":"I was kind of disappointed in the film. It was Ok, but it needed more better graphic shark attacks and better acting if you ask me. Spilberg's JAWS was way better that Deep Blue Sea. Why bothing going through the trouble making another horrible film? All it's about is these three sharks that these scientist reseachers are studying on to make them get \\"smarter.\\" Suddenly, the sharks escape and start terrorizing the people.

The effects - breathtaking, terrorizing, just great! The actors - nothing special, besides the cook ... and his bird! The ethics issues - yeah, well, there are these somewhat ruthless but not very evil scientist, but this is not what this movie is about. The sharks - you won't dare to take a dip into your pool for several days after this movie ... The blood factor - nothing for those delicate flowers out there, but not as brutal as one might expect.

Yes the sharks are incredibly, but the story was thin and the acting was dull. Yes there were some gory parts, and yes the sharks were a wonder to behold, but that doesn't make up for this dull movie. Scary? No. What made JAWS scary is that they didn't show much of the shark.

From all the reviews, i thought it would be interesting, and a halfway decent action movie. umm...no. the computer effects of the sharks are halfway decent, but the computer-generated people look more like bad video game character characters than people. the characters had almost no depth to them, making me not care whether they lived or died. we watched the deleted scenes at the end of the dvd, and if they had been left in, the characters might have actually had an impact, rather than just be shark food. the director, in his commentary, kept saying that they took things out to keep the pace up. i would rather have learned a little more about the characters. however, i did think ll cool j was very good, and he made it funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sink or swim? Swim....fast!","review":"\\"Deep Blue Sea\\" is a fast-paced, sleek action thriller with interesting characters and ferocious sharks. The special effects are very good, and the acting is superb, especially newcomer Saffron Burrows and the great Samuel L. Jackson. The unpredictability level is high, and that's probably the reason it's so good. Just when you think one person will die, it's another one instead. Watch this movie. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is for people who want to criticize stupid movies","review":"Don't even bother watching this ssslllooowww movie. It seems like the movie goes on forever but never gets to the good part! The special effects WERE very good but you only get to see them in action about twice. Was there a plot?

My closing statement. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now i really don't wanna go in the water!","review":"Deep Blue Sea is WAY different than Jaws.For one Jaws built up suspense and kept you waiting till the end of the movie to see the shark.In Deep Blue Sea,the sharks are in almost every scene!In Jaws 4:The Revenge,the shark was so smart that it went after the Brody family!COME ON!In Deep Blue Sea,it shows how the sharks become smart.Jaws 2 was good (3 and a half stars),while Jaws 3 is almost as good as Deep Blue Sea!Not nearly as well known as the Jaws movies but still good.That'd be SWEET if they come out with Deep Blue Sea 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep Blue Sea","review":"As one of the biggest Jaws fans around, I had hoped for another interesting movie about sharks.

But instead of a claustrophobic Alien type movie, we're given a non-sensical, hackneyed plot, overly familiar characters and digitally computer enhanced mayhem. Sharks are a personal terror of mine, and like a car wreck you can't help but glance at, I have to see all of the shark movies that come out. So when I can almost fall asleep during a film about one of my worst nightmares you know that the picture is a real snore. Even one of my top 10 favorite actors, Samuel Jackson, can't help this movie from becoming chum(look it up).Avoid this film like you would...well, shark infested waters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a shark movie","review":"I hear lots of people talking about how Jaws was a tremendous movie full of suspense, and Deep Blue Sea was a movie focused mainly on people being torn to bloody chunks with no surprises. The latter is fairly true, but it was still better than Jaws. The first time I saw Jaws, I didn't flinch, and when I finally saw the shark, I almost scoffed out loud at how incredibly fake it looked! You could practically see the gears working inside its mouth. Then I saw Deep Blue Sea, which at least made me grip my armrests a bit tighter. There were at least two scenes in there, punctuated by scary high-pitched music and screams, a la The Shining, in which everyone in the theater gasped sharply. I have seen it twice more after that, and plan to see it again. Jaws, however, wasn't quite good enough for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.

But as a side affect [ lets face you gotta have a side affect these days ] the sharks get smarter and before you can say ''Dead in the water'' the crew begin to get bumped off by the sharks one-by-one...''Deep Blue Sea'' in my opinion is ''Jaws'' for the 21st centuary.Renny Harlin took a fantastic job as director and LlcoolJ,Thomas Jane and Samuel.

Watching it on DVD though made up for it. The sound to this movie was incredible. At times we felt we were really there in Aquatica. The scenes were suspenseful and unpredictable. One scene though was taken right out of the opening of Cliffhanger, but still seemed to work. Until the very end I did not know who was gonna make it out alive. For the most part the sharks seemed pretty realistic, but there were a few scenes where they looked mechanical. I have seen better quality deleted scenes on DVD before, but the documentaries and commentaries were very good. A great film to watch with friends who get on edge very quickly.

Him and LL Cool J are the only characters you really care for and oh , that guy with the brown hair. He goes udner water and sees a head floating about or something and rises andshouts \\" what the f**k \\" in a weird voice. I think it is really funny.

If it was going to be a rip off, at least it could have chosen a classic like Jaws to model itself after. Instead, it's a poor version of Jaws 3, which was itself one of the worst movies ever made. Everything is wrong with this movie- awful script, dreadful acting, pathetic special effects, dislikable characters and absolutely no coherence or sensibility in the action. It's almost fascinating in its awfulness- the movie would be a good choice for a film study on how to flub every single element of movie making...oh, and there's no reason why Jaws' 25 year old shark model is much better than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was pretty cool","review":"Deep Blue Sea was a very good film...personally I felt kinna upset to see some of the better character die, but still, it was damn cool. I recomend it to anyone who loves shark movies, or just loves movies. For those of you who thought the special effects were bad, I happen to disagree...the effects in this movie were probably the best effects I've seen in a movie along with the Matrix of course....anywho.........I'd see it again and again....enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst of 1999","review":"I absolutely loathed \\"Deep Blue Sea\\", a cheap, CGI-bloated, and haphazardly written \\"Jaws\\" derivative! This piece of cinematic dross ranks up there with \\"The Matrix\\", \\"The Haunting\\", \\"Blair Witch Project\\", and \\"Phantom Menace\\" as one of the most overhyped duds of 1999. Samuel L. Jackson should know better than to squander his talent as he most certainly did in this outing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A typical action movie.","review":"Deep Blue Sea was a disappointing movie on the whole. It must have had a substantial budget, but that didn't completely help in my opinion. The cinematography was very good but that's really the only positive thing I can say about this film. There didn't seem to be much character development either and the movie just turned into a typical action flick that was too long and should have ended earlier. The acting by all wasn't a problem though and was okay. The shark action didn't look natural of course and their movements were too choppy and not very believable. Deep Blue Sea seemed to come off as very glossy, but still lacking in substance. The concept at the beginning dealing with using the sharks to cure a disease was interesting, but that was all forgotten when the movie shifted into action mode. Deep Blue Sea wasn't completely poor, but it's a movie that could have been better. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action movie!!!","review":"This movie is great. It centers around genetically engineered sharks. When the sharks rebel, all hell breaks loose. The shark gets free, causing the gruesome death of crew member after crew member. It will keep you interested the whole time, and hey, Samuel L. Jackson's in it, so it can't be all bad, right? Just an excellent action-packed thrillride."},{"rating":"2","title":"More genetically-modified monsters swimming amok...","review":"While this movie had the same old storyline as every other creature feature, it had quite a bit going for it. First of all, the animatronic sharks looked so real it was incredible (I wish I could say the same for the CGI sharks...). Secondly, it was very well-acted. I especially liked L.L. Cool J in this film. Third, the main theme score was just down right creepy! There were a lot of creepy scenes that were enhanced by the music, one of which being the shaft scene. This movie was good, but it did have some drawbacks: Samuel L. Jackson and the ending. I won't give away the latter, but trust me, it sucked. As for Mr. Jackson, I never liked him much, and I think he's a horrible actor altogether. Overall, the film was an entertaining, and thrilling adventure film - you can't go wrong with \\"Deep Blue Sea\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Blue Sea","review":"Renny Harlin, the director has really out done himself on this movie production. Thomas Jane staring as Carter Blake is a control guard on this gigantic version of \`Alcatraz' but set in the middle of the ocean. Saffron Burrows, Dr. Susan McCallister has been assigned to enlarge 3 Great White sharks' brains to make their brain capacity much larger. This all goes shockingly wrong when the sharks start to think for themselves. The sharks can't break down the fence because it is made out of re-enforced titanium.The acting is was truly magnificent because if you understand the movie then you start to care for the actors. I thought the best actor was Carter Blake (Thomas Jane), his expression was dead on time to make the movie feel like it was a real event happening at that exact second.This film is a very good but if you liked the movie \`Jaws' then you will like this even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake, cheap, and just pain pathetic. Watch Jaws instead!","review":"I remember when this flick was released in theaters and how I wanted to go see it so bad and never got to go. But I did rent it when it came out on home video and I'm glad I didn't go see it at the theaters. Why? Because it stunk! It was a huge disappointment. The sharks in the movie look so fake, infact, faker than the Great White shark in the movie Jaws, which was a heck of a better movie than this one. Jaws was a much better movie than this! However, gore hounds might get a kick out of it. It is definetly bloody but I could really care less. A movie needs more than just blood & guts to make it a winner. And this was not a winner. The sharks in this movie look a lot like a cartoon or something. The acting is poor. The plot is stupid. And this movie is a dud! If you want a good shark movie, then watch Jaws or something. But avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The biggest and most a**-kicking sharkmovie of the decade","review":"This movie made me jump in my seat.

It was rapidly deleted.As an action/horror film attempting to go against the likes of Jurrasic Park, Jaws etc. this fails miserably. I will credit it with some sense of suspense, however the effects and storyline are - as always - at odds. For every dollar spent in the 'lab' creating the sharks and blood, a dollar was lost from the realitly and story.How the magnificent Samuel L.

You can only watch people getting ripped to shreads by mechanical looking sharks for so long before it becomes repetitive. So much for restraint. Watching this, I found myself rooting for the sharks, because even though mechanical, they had much more personality than the human characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check your brain at the door.","review":"Apparently the nay-sayers spents hours watching and studying the Undersea World of Jaques Cousteau, thereby having complete understanding on the subject of sharks. You all \\"missed the boat\\" big time. Good effects, and okay acting considering Samuel Jackson's the only experienced cast member. You gotta love the jump-out-of-the screen surprises that jolted the audience in the theater I was in.

This DVD looks good, sounds great and comes with some cool extras. The DVD is flawed in one area....the movie it comes with.The movie is an utter bore fest. Nothing to look foward to besides CGI sharks, if that tickles your fancy then your in for a treat, but if you enjoy good acting, sespence, action, horror, directing, and script you should most look eleswhere. I didn't care for one single person in this movie. They deserved it. The surprise death in the movie didn't fool me....I saw it coming, like I said Boring.The direction has been done better else where. The tension is just lost when I see an lame and crappy CGI shark coming at someone....eat them, who cares. I will give this to them the death animation when the shark rip apart someone are perrty cool, but that is all to look forward to in this otherwise borring movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is bad","review":"the only good thing about this movie was the title and the credits otherwise it was a waste of film"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to anyone with any intelligence","review":"Shame on Samuel Jackson for acting in such a cheese festival. I thought that he had more class. Enough with the digital special effects-these were not even in the slightest bit realistic. The acting was so poor that it often became hilarious. The fake looking sharks took the cake though. Don't waste your time. Get Jaws. I wish I could have given this utter piece of trash NO STARS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Fun, loaded with digital effects.","review":"This silly movie resembles a spoof of Spielberg's classic JAWS. There is also a touch of POSIDON ADVENTURE and LEVITHAN included in the plot.It's mindless fun if you have 100 minutes to waste and don't expect too much. Fans of cool new digetal effects(sometimes obvious) will also enjoy this film. The DVD edition looks great. With fine, sharp colors on a wide screen image. A very listenable commentary by Samuel Jackson(often humerous) and director Renney Harlin, also short making of featurettes, trailer and still photo file are included. Quite a lot of extras for a dumb flick. DEEP BLUE SEA may be worth a rental, but only true fans will want the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyously bad B-Movie!","review":"I have ordered this DVD and can't wait for it to arrive. Finally that arch-hack and mogul-flunky Renny Harlin has inadvertantly managed to entertain us by producing the very worst science-fiction/horror movie since the days of Ed Wood whilst delivering an engaging scenario and superb production design (I won't say these were wasted; far from it!).I can't wait to wince again as Samuel L. Jackson (HOW THE HELL did they manage to convince him to co-comment this with Harlan?), an actor who I revere, struggles with unquestionably the very worst dialogue and direction of his career, while pretty Saffron Burrows lolls about in her underwear giving wood a bad name.This is a jewel of a movie, that rare concoction that happens only accasionally, where a bad movie becomes so bad that it is an essential DVD item. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely mindless, but","review":"fun if you're after a film you can goof on while you're watching it.

Trying to pack three killer sharks with a lot of non-stop action in a confined setting isn't the way to make this sort of film. Steven Spielberg did it almost flawlessly in Jaws, a brilliant film that featured incredible acting, exciting action, and fine special effects. Deep Blue Sea has serviceable acting at best, yawn-inducing action, and CGI effects that are so fake I thought I was watching a video game. To see how to get this sort of film done right, check out Jaws and its first sequel. Oh, and Thomas Jane, you're no Roy Scheider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad the shark hadn't eaten the writer!","review":"Is it possible to make a movie with helicopter crashes, massive explosions and SUV sized sharks chomping people into snausages and have it be boring? \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" answers that question with a resounding \\"YES!\\" Harlin does his best to inject some oomph into the movie but I found myself not being too concerned with the fates of the characters with the exception of LL Cool J. Several times during this DVD I found myself saying out loud: \\"If you kill LL I will turn this DVD off\\" as there would be no other reason left to watch. Don't get me wrong: this movie looks good, the effects are good and the acting is competent.

The movie doesn't have much of a plot, but if it keeps you on the edge of your seat for two hours... forget about the plot, it's non-stop fun what matters. You don't have to be an action fan to enjoy this non-stop rollercoaster (if you're not at least you'll get to see a very, and I mean very, beautiful woman strip down to her bikini).

(shout out to ll cool j, his acting was awsome!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool movie!","review":"Ok comng into this movie i will half to admit that i had high expectations for it. For example i had expected the sharks that they portrayed to be enormous enormous. They were fairly big but not as big as you would think. One thing that stirrs up the plot is how smart the sharks are. Alright im getting ahead of myself the story takes place in the middle of the Atlantic ocean at a great white shark testing lab, where they are testing chemicals that will make sharks smarter. To make a long story short something goes wrong, the sharks get out, and eat alot of people, and there is LL cool J the cook to help save the day. I enjoyed this movie a bunch and it was very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"some really mean sharks","review":"I thought that this movie was great to see evne though they didn't use the great white sharks for this movie just like in JAWS, I own this movie along with lake placid, and other shark movies, so I watch this movie so on, and forth.

The story is ridiculous, the acting phoned in by actors who have done better and can do better, the dialogue inane, filmed with a color palette that does not deviate from the cliched teal/orange designed to pop and look cool. But, it's so ridiculous that it's just plain fun. You can't take it seriously, so you just go along with it.

(1 Star foooey)","review":"There was a scene in which Samuel Jackson was getting angry & I couldn't help but wonder if his motivation was directed towards his Agent of Director Renny Harlin for trying to destroy his career with this movie. Obviously a hollowed, pointless marketing scheme to try to appeal to as large an audience as possible (sharks, rappers, Samuel L. for clout, yada yada )and they made the rest up as they went along. Watch Samuel L. try to fake his enthusiasm during the director's take option on the DVD. Actually pretty funny.

BITES!","review":"Deep Blue Sea was a very disappointing film to watch, and came way short of being entertaining. First of all and most importantly, the sharks in this movie look way too computer animated, just like Anaconda's reptile, to be thought of as real. The sharks may try to be smart, but they sure looked dumb. The characters are not all that interesting either, except for Samuel Jackson small time on screen. LL Cool J needs to start taking more acting lessons and less beauty pagent, wannabee lessons. At times I thought I was watching one of those cheesy B-films on Showtime.

Mind-boggling! Scientists have come up with the cure to Alzheimer's Disease with the sharks' fluids? Genius. Thomas Jane is a shark hunter and LL Cool J is a cook! YES! Samuel L. Jackson makes fun of the midget from \\"Fantasy Island\\" (a moment of uproarious laughter). A pretty English lady who started the whole experiment made inferior decisions by letting the sharks stay alive. The sharks bit off a guy's arm, flooded the research center, made a helicopter crash into a tower and explode which started the fiasco. Superb! It was marvelous when Jackson tried to lead the group of scientists and the shark popped out of the water and ate [him].

The FX were among the worst I've ever seen, my Playstation could animate those sharks more accuratly. People get ripped to shreds, things blow up ho-hum. The acting is bad even Samuel L. Jackson whom I admire very much. LL Cool J is in it too, and of course he has a rap song on the end that is totally out of place. Do yourself a favor and watch Jaws, not this steaming chunk of feces!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Much","review":"The director's commentary on the DVD goes great leaps toward explaining what was intended in this movie. I do not feel that the characters were well developed. I did not feel sorry for them when attacked by the shark. Some of the deleted scens would have helped to understand the relationships between characters. The Computer Graphics were OK, but nothing stunning compared to movies of late. Basically, I feel that they should have tried harder. It could have been much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH GOD HELP US ALL!","review":"What is Hollywood coming to when this is the best they can do? I have seen some exceptionally bad movies, but this tops them all. I mean, goodness, with all the money they have, you would at least think that they would have decent special effects. It looked like they bought a cheap rubber toy from Sea World and flailed it around for two miserable hours. And that doesn't even begin to describe the horrible acting, and the total unlikelihood of the whole situation. I would have given it two stars if they had just killed everyone out of mercy in the first 10 minutes, but no, we had to watch them run around like caged, drunken rats for what seemed like eternity. The only character I even remotely liked was the cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is fun....","review":"and really really low on intelligence. Hey, what do you expect?

To call it bad is to single out a film that Ed Wood would have been embarrased to make.Every movie requires a certain suspension of disbelief. I have accepted warp travel, pyrokinesis, and time travel more easily than the hokum of this film. The sharks are ridiculous, the plot preposterous beyond belief, the setting asinine, and I found myself cheering, actually cheering, when Samuel L. Jackson, a world-class actor, was eaten by the shark JUST SO HIS CHARACTER WOULD SHUT UP! The dialog is beyond painful to nauseating. The special effects are laughable.I have never been so upset spending money on a film in my life. If you value your pocket book, your latest meal, and your belief that movies can tell a decent story, do NOT buy this film.You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Budget Wasted on Effects - That are not all that Special","review":"The acting so poor, to enjoy this piece of cheese one ought to be given a bottle of wine with it. The one-liners are not all that funny, and it appears as if the money was spent on some visual effects and a lead actor. Do yourself a favor and purchase Jaws instead. If one is prone to very simple things, like watching paint dry, or grass grow, this will be the perfect movie for them. If, on the other hand, you are interested in plot development, and seeing some actual effort put into the dialog and acting, then this movie is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful movie","review":"feeling like getting robbed? wanna lose time and money? by renting or buying this flick of a film, you would truly understand the foregone value of your last 2 hours watching this waste of magnetic recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"YOU ATE MY BIRD!\\"","review":"I saw this movie a few years ago and I really enjoyed it.Aquatica is trying to find a cure for some desease from gentically altered Mako sharks.

It was a great idea for an escapist B-movie, and the build-up to each attack was serviceable - but the absolutely laughably ludicrous CGI effects made the sharks as non-scary as humanly imaginable. They killed the \\"mood\\" each time. Director Harlin erred when he decided to show full-length shark acrobatics and attacks. They came off as cheapo 3D cartoons with cheapo cartoon legs flailing in their mouths. Learn from the horror masters, Renny - Less is more! A few scale shark models, foaming red water, split-second closeups, and ominous music would have been better.Spotting the 'Jaws' and 'Alien' series homages ... was the only entertaining factor after a while.

I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"If you are looking for a book that tells you anything about orangutans, this is not it. The information about Dayak culture is interesting, however, I was too distracted by the author's inadequate preparation for being outdoors, to really enjoy any of the information. The book claims to be about \\"following\\" Birute Galdikas, however, the author actually meets the woman only two times, both very brief, if memory serves me correctly. Check it out from a library, but it's not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Serious Alternative to Sodium Pentathol","review":"I agree with many of the negative comments in other reviews (poorly researched / author has no expertise or background in the area, etc.) I don't, however, fault her for writing negatively about Birute Galdikas; I don't much like what Galdikas has become, either. My main and simplest complaint about this book is that it is mind-bogglingly, blindingly BORING. That's difficult to achieve in a work that has orangutans in it, but, by God, the author achieved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited and poorly researched","review":"Trust me, I love a good \\"Tell All\\" book. I've just finished reading some juicy little numbers about Truman Copote and Nancy Reagan...MEOW!But \\"Dark Place\\" is neither compelling nor believable. It describes the researcher Birute Galdikas, who has spent years following orangutans in the jungle and is now considered the foremost researcher on these delightful hairy beasts. I was hoping for some really salacious details, but this book was more or less a yawn. I hear that Birute is now in the process of suing the author and has dozens of witnesses to discredit Spalding.So do yourself a favor. If you want a great book about Orangutans and the research about them, buy \\"Reflections of Eden.\\" If you want some well-written, brilliantly-researched cattiness, read \\"The Women of Camelot.\\" But if you're looking for a combination of the two, well, the story has yet to be written."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This was not as funny as some of his other dvds.

It is not nearly as well organized as the other book I purchased by other authors. I will probably donate it to Goodwill because it has little to offer the person who is trying to find a specific plant, not knowing the name of it. The drawings are excellent, but the organization is really poor, comparatively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"As a teacher in the Oracle Internet Academy, I can attest to the fact that this book is NOT for beginners. The publishers would have you believe that a complete novice can learn Java with this course, yet the book makes regular references to other programming languages. A colleague of mine has supplemented his course with the \\"Dummies\\" book, and he says that it covers the material in a more \\"beginner oriented\\" way. I came into the class with no programming experience, and after reading the book 4 times I am looking for more help.

When I picked up this book at the library I thought, \\"If this is done well, it'll be great; if not, it'll be a big disappointment\\" -- and happily, it's done very, very well. The author obviously knows and loves the entire Nancy canon, as well as the related series about other teen sleuths, and her love and knowledge shine out on every page: her parody is also a wonderful homage. I especially love the illustrations: the style is _exactly_ like the pictures in my old Nancy books, though the subject matter is often very different -- they really made me smile. The cameos by teen sleuths from other series are wonderful too: it's so much fun seeing Nancy interact with Frank and Joe Hardy, Cherry Ames, and others. Delightful book -- my hat is off to Chelsea Cain, she really did this right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nancy Drew a blank","review":"As a childhood fan of teen detective series, I was really looking forward to this one. But clever as she is, the author runs into the same problem that has thwarted every other writer (and there have been several) who's attempted a book-length spoof of this genre: Namely, a little of this stuff goes a long, long way. Years ago the National Lampoon set the benchmark for this type of thing with a hilarious parody that ran just one short chapter. Mystery solved: Brevity is the soul of wit."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR OLDER READERS!","review":"I myself am a Nancy Drew fan and this book portrays Nancy in a crude way,in this book deception is on every page(Deception in the story,not what is written)! I view the excitment as part of the problem,it had too much going on in one page and is boring and drab on the next! It is not a book I would recemend for younger readers(I'm a young person myself and I found it HORRIBLE!),and if you're a Nancy fan then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! Some other problems I saw were that Nancy seems less of a figure for young people-expecily girl-and the prospect of Nancy doing anything shady is VERY disterbing. The writing was good and some of the plots were awsome,but besides that I can't say that the book was any good. The book also seems to highlight Nancy's mistakes in life,it doesn't really mention anything good that she did. Once gain I say that the book is for OLDER readers and not for the young ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessions of a Teen Sleuth","review":"This book is silly and formulaic.

I liked the incorporation of the other teen sleuths but the overall tone of the book was depressing. Nancy lost her pluck and seems lost in life. This book is not going on the shelf with my grandparent's, my and my children's HB/ND books. It's joining the other reviewer's in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book","review":"The word \\"parody\\" is not lost on me but I felt this book was in poor taste. If you are looking for a \\"nice\\" book that fills in some gaps in the Nancy Drew series in a fun way this is not the book for you. My copy is now in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"C-","review":"The joke grows old and the writing wearisome about forty pages into the tongue-in-cheek prose of Chelsea Cain's Nancy Drew parody. It's a bit of a struggle getting through the sparse narration and even sparser descriptions. While the content and style of the book is a reflection on the original source material of Carolyn Keene's popular teen novels, Cain could have done much, much more. There are so many different ways this could have been handled, but Cain chose the easy way out and played up the dumb aspects while leaving the reader short on depth and substance. Aspects of Confessions of a Teen Sleuth are funny, but most of it is a dry bore. The character twists - George becoming a lesbian, Bess developing an eating disorder - are more amusing in thought than in actual delivery. Let's hope someone new takes the reigns of this parody and flushes it out more thoroughly sometime in the future, because Cain left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I had to keep myself from laughing out loud in the library. I got such a kick out of Nancy growing older, and still \\"sleuthing\\" like a teenager. I loved when she tried to get into the secret society at the college, and they asked if she was someone's grandmother, and she said she couldn't understand how her cover was blown! LOLThen, her poor old father on oxygen, and her son is not Ned's, and I always knew George was a lesbian, although Nancy doesn't seem to know it.Definitely a very fun read for us older Nancy Drew fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teen Slut?","review":"So this book turns Nancy Drew into a slut and I really hate that.

I did enjoy the reference to Encyclopedia Brown. Fun for a quick read and perhaps for those who are more enmeshed in the ND world than I."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Flashback","review":"The cover of this novel let's you know right off the bat that this is not a piece of literature that should be analyzed or seriously critiqued. The young girl laying suggestively and the words \\"parody\\" are important hints. Chelsea Cain provides a \\"new\\" perspective on several classic mysteries, but this time through Nancy's first person voice, instead of Carolyn Keen's third person narrative. Readers learn the \\"truths\\" behind her relationships with Ned Nickerson and Frank Hardy, discover Keen's supposed motive to publish falsities and even learn what happens to Nancy during middle age and later years.This book is a fun read that is even a bit shocking at times- Nancy wasn't as naive as we thought she was! I recommend it for more mature readers who are familiar with the original stories and want to take a quick, entertaining trip down memory lane."},{"rating":"1","title":"former Nancy Drew fan","review":"I was excited when I heard about this book on NPR.

The way the brush attaches to the body of the dryer is poorly designed and not study, so the brush is now loose and at an angle (instead of being in a straight line), which makes the dryer practically impossible to use. I like the idea of the high wattage, but it gets so hot that the hand you use to help put your hair on the brush will get burned. Also, the handle part that you hold is so wide as to be clumsy to hold (and my hands are not small). All in all, completely unsatisfactory. I have requested return and refund information from both the e-tailer and the manufacturer, and neither has responded yet.

I think it is the best representation of Smith, who has other more polished cd's that seem to have somehow missed his essence. This one seems to have been recorded early on, low-fi in a basement or bedroom, and lets you get up close to him without studio intervention. There are many tracks that don't even have bass or drums, just guitars and voice. The tunes are haunting and insecure, but will soon get right under your skin. This is no high-gloss commercial venture, but more like a glimpse inside somebody's audio diary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smith's Genius","review":"Elliot Smith has never written anything but beautiful, listenable music and this first release is no exception.

I hate to do it but 2 out of 5 stars for that, but the rest of the musicianship more than make up for a cd's imperfections in mixing and recording. This album is mostly just an acoustic guitar and the soft ghostly voice of a heart broken man. Highlight songs are ROMAN CANDLE, CONDOR AVE, NO NAME #1, and LAST CALL. The final song KIWI MADDOG 20/20 shows Smith could plug in and play a sweeping rhythm, carrying you in and out of reality; or into his."},{"rating":"2","title":"elliott's best?","review":"As someone who owns all of Elliott Smith's albums, this album has become easily my favourite. I love all his albums, including his dreamworks albums, but this album still stands out to me as the best. I find it hard not to draw comparisons with Nick Drake's Pink Moon, which achieved a sense of intimacy and melancholy that did not exist to such a degree on his earlier more produced albums. When people say the production on this album is poor, do not expect a grainy sound or inaudible vocals. The production creates an extremely sparse sound that complements Smith's haunting, fragile voice perfectly. As you listen to this album, the amazing interplay between the vocals and unique guitar melodies on each track emerges. This, combined with the albums short (30 minute) length, results in an album without filler that never loses your attention. I think this will remembered in a similar way to Nick Drake's Pink Moon - as the masterpiece of his tragically short career."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give 4.5 if I could - Raw, Brilliant Elliott Smith","review":"A wonderful record, not quite composed as well as later E.S., but that's not necessarily a bad thing. \\"Last Call\\" is brilliant, \\"No Name #3\\" as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Sea of Bliss was the first Space Music I'd ever heard.

For those looking for more out of your training, I would suggest The Life Giving Sword, The Demon's Sermon on Martial Arts and The Book of Five Rings; as far as a modern classic, I would say look into \\"Living the Martial Way\\"- although it is rather small in comparison, the book \\"Dojo Wisdom\\" is filled with quite a bit of positive things too.I do have to say though, training is the begining and the end result.

This is on top of the $1500 that they already charged to my credit card and refuse to remove the charge. I never even seen or touched the exercise machine. The Customer Service management team is very unresponsive and rude. I am still trying to get my money back but they are putting up a fight. My advice is to NEVER purchase from Smooth Fitness! They provide very poor service and are not customer friendly.

Great voice, wonderful music, very lyrical , touching heart songs - so unusual in our cruel , cold, calculating world. It is a real pleasure to listen to this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not complete...but still great!","review":"First of all, this is a great soundtrack to purchase for anyone who enjoys just driving around Vice City and listening to the radio. This is the reason why I bought it. However, there were a few disappointments. When I purchased the Grand Theft Auto Vice City Soundtrack Box Set, I expected every song from every music station to be included. Although most of the songs are included, a few were not. I feel that this is made up for, though, by the inclusion of DJ banter and various commercials from the game.One thing that I feel would have improved this soundtrack set would be to include the K-Chat and VCPR stations. These were both favorites of mine (along with Wave 103).Overall, I have to say that the GTA Vice City Soundtrack Box Set is a great buy if you enjoy the multiple radio stations, or if you simply want to add to your Grand Theft Auto collection! I was certainly satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"One very important thing to understand about this box set is that it lacks much of the radio content from the game. Entire radio stations are missing! VCPR, a hilarious public-radio talk station, is conspicuously absent, and KCHAT, another funny chat station, is also gone. Also, one of my favorite songs from the game, \\"Japanese Boy\\" by Aneka, is not included! Similarly, \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" by The Buggles is not included! There are other examples...Well, at least they have \\"I Ran\\" by A Flock of Seagulls and \\"99 Luftballoons\\" by Nena."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish iTunes had the song I was looking for could have saved a lot of money","review":"Here's the deal. I wanted to buy the song Kid's in America by Kim Wilde but I couldn't find it on iTunes. I play GTA Vice City a lot and figured there are some cool songs on there. What I didn't realize was how many songs that I didn't like would be on the CD's. Overall there are CD's that I really haven't even listened to. I would say save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Soundtrack","review":"I bought this soundtrack expecting to find hits from the eighties whose performers were unknown for me.

It has an amazing collection of just about every type of music from the 80s, pop, funk, new wave and heavy metal. It's a great 80s box set just as it is, not to mention it also includes a really great CD with alot of classic Cuban music on it, with essential stuff by Beny More and Tito Puente. A great sampler, really! Perfect for an 80s party or cocktail party or even a drive to the beach with the top down and the windows open and \\"the Outfield\\" or \\"Ozzy\\" blaring out the stereo. And of course, if your a Grand Theft Auto fanatic this is a must have just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best collection of 80's music you can buy!","review":"If you're looking for a group of CD's that sums up 80's music then this collection is for you. Theres new wave, pop, rap, hard rock, soft rock, r&b, and some great latin music thrown in.My favorite is definitely the new wave CD, which is all hits. The dj's and commercials also are very funny and peformed well. Make sure you listed at the end of the last song on each CD for the bonus part with the DJ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Vercetti","review":"This is a great collection I loved playing the Grand Theft Auto series. The music in the games adds a life to the games. I didn't grow up in that time period but good music is still good music.

Honestly all the cds in the set are good some better than others, but in all good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the music is more preferable","review":"I was once tempted to buy this box set, however, considering I bought the game 'GTA Vice City' for nearly half the price, it didnt seem worthwhile to fork out even more to get only 70% of the audio content. - I found it faster, more cost effective, and not to mention satisfying to simply get the music from the game CDs. - And wow, it all fits on one CD. I give this box set 2 stars (as opposed to 1) because it does contain an aweful lot of wonderful music found in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best starter module ever written","review":"It's playability is slow, not overly challenging.

This anthology of short excerpts should be read in a meditational manner - he gives one much to think about - to not think about it is to miss the point of the book.An example: \\"Life passes on in proximity to the sacred, and it is this proximity that endows existence with ultimate significance. In our relation to the immediate we touch upon the most distant. Even the satisfaction of physical needs can be a sacred act. Perhaps the essential message of Judaism is that in doing the finite we may perceive the infinite.\\"This perception of the infinite in the finite is what is called \\"sacramental imagination\\" in the Christian tradition ... which is to say while Heschel is fully within the Judaic tradition, one need not be of his tradition to learn from him.Add this to your must read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetry of Judiasm","review":"This is a composite of the most poetic, sparkling bits of Heschel.

This was the 1st Roy album I heard and I was enthralled by it. Roy takes \\"Hey Joe\\" to places Jimi Hendrix never dreamed.

I thought maybe it was just me but several other adults have ridden in the car when songs from this CD have come on and have quickly asked to change the music. The kicker is that even the kids (currently 1.5 years old) don't like it (thankfully) so this will probably go into the donation pile shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"I liked the older versions better.

The CD has enough in it for adults to enjoy, and my 19-month old son thinks it's the greatest. He actually climbs into his carseat willingly when I tell him that he can only hear the cd if he is seated and strapped in. I have to get more cd's like this eventually.

Mike Inez is an awesome bass player. The bass line in No More Tears is simply genius. Randy Castillo was and awesome drummer. I think that this album is Zakk Wylde's best acheivement as far as his guitar playing. Zakk's solos on this album seem to be some of his best written. Zakk's solos sound much better and well written when compared to his more recent work where he just shreds for the entire solo. Ozzy sounds as good as ever on this album. I would not consider any of the songs on this album as fillers. The bonus tracks are both EXCELLENT making this release a better buy. I HIGHLY recomend this to fans of Zakk Wylde. The songs on this album are very complete and well put together and all in all this is just one truly outstanding album. If you like just one song off this album a lot then buy it, there is plenty more good material on this album.Highlights: everythingThrow-aways: Nothing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ozzy's line up","review":"Just for the record: Zakk Wylde is Ozzy's fourth guitarist. 1) Randy Rhoads, 2) Brad Gillis of Night Ranger (Speak Of The Devil) and 3) Jake E. Lee.I've been a fan of Ozzy since Blizzard, but NMT is truly his finest effort. The over-the-top goofy showmanship is blissfully absent on this one, and we get a look into the soul of an icon of our age. I can't watch his silly TV show, being that his money-and-fame-obsessed family have turned him into a marketing product, and parody of himself.

The result is higly satisfying albuns, even when they are slyly \\"pop metal\\" oriented... NO MORE TEARS is better than NO REST FOR THE WICKED, no doubt about this.

As I noted in my review of No Rest For The Wicked, it's a wonder that Ozzy would redo drums and bass on his first recording, yet leave Wicked and Tears unscathed. Both are desperatly in need of new drums, or at least an ADD remastering. The drums are a bit improved here, but still drenched in tinny echo.Mr. Wylde's collaborative chemistry with Ozzy fails to improve on this outing, laden with more mundane metal. I made a playlist of Ozzy/Wylde recordings, and it was a struggle to find four tunes from either Wicked or Tears to include.

Think of the opening electric guitar riff to Battery (Metallica), although the rest of the song (Mr Tinkertrain still) should sound meatier (the guitar part. If you don't knwop what I mean by Meaty, listen to Twisted Sister's Still Hungry).The headphones there in the library may be better, but if I am not wrong, you can hear the sliding riff to the start of the second son (too long for mwe to type) quite clearly. Other than that, I cannot find any difference from the original version.The rest of the album I did not listen.

This is a solid metal album, some people say Ozzy is rock, not metal, but every Ozzy album is metal. No More Tears has everything u need in a metal album, insanly heavy songs and soft songs. I don't recomend new Ozzy fans to purchase this album first. The first album that u purchase should be Blizzard of Ozz. Zakk Wylde is an awesome guitarist and is up there with Randy Roads. R.I.P.

Not sure all the activities have much educational value."},{"rating":"2","title":"JumpStart 1st Grade","review":"I am a huge fan of these video games. They are wonderful tutorials for young children and they make it fun to learn. They are plug and play which means that you put the disc in the computer and you are ready to go. If your child needs tutoring, these games may be the answer for you. My grown children used them and now I have purchased them again for my granddaughter. I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires paid membership after a couple weeks of play","review":"This sounded like a great idea, software that was my computer rather than having my kids clicking through various websites. They love it, the games are fun and have a little academic value. We mostly got it so my son could work on his mouse and keyboard skills. It did that beautifully until he got into the second of I believe 5 worlds and required a membership. I was willing to pay nearly $20 for a complete world of games, but not one partial game that addicted my kids then wanted $8 per month. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Does not work on Mac unless it is a PowerPC. Waste of money!","review":"I bought this because it stated it works on Mac. Well technically it does, but you have to have a dinosaur Mac to run it. It will not run on a current Mac. This should be clearly stated so people don't waste their money. Only way to find out is to try to install it and by then you can't return it because it is now opened. Plus, the game that came is different from the one in the picture. I received the advanced version, not that it really matters at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong game","review":"I ordered this thinking this was the updated 2000 version(you know the one with interactive classroom/schoolhouse and the hippopotamus teacher?) but got the new 3D game which I don't really care for.

The writing is bland, and feels like one must trudge to the end of each story. I guess this book is innocuous enough, but lacks the imaginative language that would make a child want to read it for himself/herself. Can we endure it? Yes, we can. But, hey!

I decided to purchase a few of the other XTreme products manufactured by Kong, hoping they would be as long-lasting. This product, the \\"XTreme Goodie Ship\\" was a big disappointment as it was chewed up in a matter of minutes by my dog. I would definitely NOT recommend this \\"Goodie Ship\\" to any pet owner that has an aggressive chewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product is good, Amazon display is not.","review":"The picture/page shows 3 separate toys, and nothing I could see specified whether you got all 3 or just 1 (I had assumed all 3).Despite my disappointment at only receiving one in the mail, my dog likes this toy nonetheless. I have an odd mixed breed, who weighs 20 lbs but has the jaws of a 100 lb dog, and he loves to chew. This keeps him busy and stands up to powerful chewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable! Laid-back easy reading.","review":"I would reccommend this book to anyone who has ever wondered what it would be like to live on an Island. Hazel Heckman gives the reader a very enjoyable historical account of Anderson Island, in the Puget Sound. It's a taste of Northwest History along with charming stories of Islanders present and past. A must read for anyone who enjoys natural history and has a yearning to experience life on an Island."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly overlooked album","review":"I actually bought this CD in 2001 and keep going back to it. Sure not all the songs are fantastic, but some of the interpretations are really great. It has a good folkie feel to it throughout, and the piano lifts it when needed. Very well played. I prefer Renee's voice, but Andy's is OK. Love the Cover Art.It Takes A Lot to Laugh (I've always thought it hard to beat the original); Emotionally Yours; One More Cuppa ; & Shooting Star are fantastic; Simple Twist; When the Ship Comes In; Lonesome When you Go; Seven Curses ; are all good;If I ever get to Canada I'd go to their show.

If you want a deeper glimpse into the heart of the Bronte world, then definitely read this book, you will be inspired anew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grippando Serves another Great Summer Read","review":"Grippando does it again. Hear No Evil is a fast-moving, Jack Swytech thriller. Like the previous three novels in this series, the plot of this novel is intricate and moves at a staccato pace. Throw in a twist at the end of every chapter and you have a great summer read.Grippando is fast becoming one of my favorite thriller writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed listening to this while in the car","review":"Listened to this in unabridged audio CD while on a trip. Enjoyed the story, was interesting. One thing that was \\"ok\\" was how the author would leave out parts of some vital conversation, only to bring it out in the end. That was alright. One of the key central issues of this story was a sexual relationship, although not told graphically."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice plot and story-telling","review":"this book has a very interesting (if not improbable) plot. it does keep you guessing till the end. the story telling is fine, not too much useless details. i give it a 4 star because the story itself and the characters are a little bit lackluster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I bought this book (hardback) for $3. I paid too much. It is basically a good story that was grossly underdeveloped. It reads like a cheap, made for TV movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID WE READ THE SAME BOOK??","review":"I am surpised that this is the same author who wrote \\"Last to Die.\\" I am half-way through this book and am so bored with it that I will probably not finish it. It's all about this lady who is accused of killing her husband and it turns out this lady is the adoptive mother of Jack Swyteck's son. She threatens Jack if he doesn't represent her that he will never see his son. So, because her husband was in the military in Guantanamo, Cuba, Jack makes trips back and forth to Cuba to get some information about her husband and everyone keeps stonewalling him and not giving him information because everything is confidential. So, he has to go back and forth and back and forth to get tidbits of information. And, he makes some side trips to his mother's birthplace near Cuba. That's it. That's the story so far. No suspense. No character development. No trial (yet). So boring!! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe it!","review":"If you want a tour of Cuba or Miami including restaurants an hotels. Read this book.If you want to read a biography. Read this book.If you want to read the epilogue of the book \\"Beyond Suspicion\\" by the same writer (its prequel). Read this book.If you want to read how a paramount lawyer can be deceived once and again. Read this book.If you want to read a thriller read the last 50 pages of this book.So, if you want to waste your time. Read this book.The first book of the series \\"The Pardon\\" was very good.The second book was OK. But this one swoops like an eagle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun diversion","review":"Grippando delivers another far above average thriller in the Jack Swyteck mystery series. Hear No Evil is entertaining and a fun diversion made special with the narration of Campbell Scott. Scott is one of those actors whose voice is familiar and comforting, yet he's not so famous that the listener is distracted by an image of him in their head. His authoritative voice has the right balance of masculinity to perfectly portray Swyteck. He likewise does a perfunctory job with Cuban accents - making them believable without being over the top, cliché, or Mexican. Hear No Evil weaves Cuban-American politics into a fun, action packed thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The facts of justice","review":"This is another fine book done by Mr. Grippando. I have read all of his wriings and have yet to find a bad one. This was a interesting novel as it incorporated the life in Miami with the Cubans, the justice system with a minority influence and the usual banter between Jack and his best friend Theo. The plot followed well and the ending was somewhat of a surprise and it was a fine read. I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this guy!!","review":"Both this album and 'Just What Time It Is' are awesome. I confess that it wasn't love at first earfull with JLNichols, but it sure is now. He hits some magical combination of voice and lyric and rhythm and instrumental that is everything I want in my music: poetic without being sappy, beautifully understated, unpretentious - REAL. He hits me like no artist has for a long time. If Letter to an Angel doesn't make you sway and smile (in that bittersweet sort of way), just end it all now. 'Hold me Strong': amazing! And if 'Not the Only Man' doesn't move you... then I guess you have already ended it! If I knew where to send a letter to THIS angel (Jeb Loy), I would tell him myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the first album I bought by this band, though I've long been aware of them, having seen them perform at, for example, Glastonbury and the Euro Awards shows broadcast on MTV and VH1. They've had a number of #1 albums in th U.K. They've been voted Best Band on that side of the pond. Really glad I bought this album because it has a catchy selection of tunes spanning their career. If you enjoy this genre, then I think you'll find that this album is awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon mixed up the cd listings","review":"This cd doesn't contain the second cd. The limited edition does. The limited edition doesn't list the second cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gold shining through mud","review":"Detracting from this compilation because of what it 'fails' to contain based on one person's snobbiness concerning a favourite album is flat-out wrong. I said the same thing about the KISS box set, and I'll say it again here; \\"Forever Delayed\\" is a collection of chart hits, not a comprehensive anthology.Of course those of us with a true affection for the band will already own the original albums, but there are any number of prospective buyers who haven't a clue as to what to buy first; this is a better collection of tunes than most.The version with the remixes is interesting, and better overall value, but in the final analysis, completely unessential. Watch for a 'live' album next, and I can only hope it's as well-produced and performed as the Cardiff 2000 concert DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Storey's guide books...","review":"Storey's Guide to Raising Rabbits is one of the better written Storey guides. By that I mean it reads a bit less like a textbook. The author adds a bit of humor, which keeps it from getting boring.One of the best chapters was the one on Rabbit \\"Housing and Equipment\\" as there were several good illustrations of rabbit hutches for the small scale pet owner and the large scale operator in this chapter.If you're looking to pick a Rabbit breed you like and are looking for lots of photo's and information on each breed, this book doesn't have it. Also, many parts of this book are geared toward larger scaled rabbit breeders and sellers, than for the small-scale hobbyist wanting to raise a few rabbits as pets.Overall, this is a wonderful reference book on Rabbits and one I would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storeys Guide To Raising Rabbits","review":"Excellent book, would recomend to any body who is thinking about raising rabbits. I wish there was more in there about raising them for meat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"All Storey's books are the best. Look no further for rabbit books, this is the only one you'll ever need. I've used mine so many times. It is a great addition to the homesteaders library."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for rabbit lovers!","review":"The only things in this book to recommend it would be the ideas for building rabbit sheds and the black and white photos of various breeds.Some of these ideas are just so out of date! I can't understand how anyone could recommend keeping rabbits in all-wire cages with no bedding. 'Don't let them on grass because they will get parasites and don't let them in the house or you are asking for trouble'.The sections on slaughtering are probably good for those who are only interested in rabbits for meat, but if you care about rabbits at all, steer well clear of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: not for pet rabbit owners, for rabbit exploiters!","review":"This is a book designed for rabbit exploitation- meat and commercial breeding, etc. If you want to keep a healthy AND happy pet rabbit who will become part of the family, this book is not for you. Instead refer to Marnell Harrison's book or Kathy Smith's books on rabbit care and vitality. These books lean toward a stance that rabbits are creatures that should be treated like dogs or cats, and NOT like livestock, which they SHOULD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PETA member picks up book thinking it's about pet rabbits!","review":"I was at the library, wondering if rabbits made good pets, and I picked up this book. It was right beside dog training books, books about cats, etc. But, unfortunately, as I found out when I got home, this book is about raising rabbits to sell for meat. The last chapter is horrific- after going into detail about how to raise these beautiful creatures, the author goes about telling the reader how to destroy it, and which spices taste nice on its skin. No thanks. I just want a Mopsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource!","review":"I recently purchased this book as hopefully a better aid for commercial rabbit breeding and raising. This book is fabulous! It includes great information for housing, building hutches and a barn, and ideas for better sanitation. As a rabbit raiser myself, I found this to be informative! The chapter on how to market your rabbitry was great, and gave me many ideas to use for our rabbitry. There is also great information on how to successfully tattoo a rabbit & keep breeding/stock records. This is such a fabulous resource, and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I am glade the book shipped and arrived so soon. It contains a lot of valuable information i will need on my journey through raising rabbits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly perfect","review":"This set is exactly what I wanted. I did quite a bit of research for a versatile set which I could dress up or down - I'm very happy I chose this one. It has an almost tailored look to it but the edging adds some feminine softness. These are substantial without being clunky and delicate enough to be pretty with lace tablecloths. I chose Mikasa because I appreciate the high quality and affordable price of their products [I used a 45 pc set of \\"Country Cabin\\" for 30 years before replacing it]. The dinnerware arrived in perfect condition. I also bought a 12 piece set in order to get extra plates and the bowls from that set are welcome extra serving bowls. This set is exactly perfect for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"I purchase this itam for a Christmas gift for my Mother. I received it on 11-6-06.

I wrote an email and complained and I told them the reviews indicated Amazon worked with other customers to replace the broken pieces.

I removed the packaging from its original container and separated them in different pieces of hand luggage and only in bubble wrap. I was travelling in the peak christmas season so they said my carry ons were too large so they took them from me and checked them in. I was worried sick that the pieces would be all broken by the time they arrived at my final destination. To my surprise, not even a crack or chip on any of the pieces which were checked. I could not believe that after that rugged handling they were still intact. The packaging from Amazon was perfect and I love the classy elegant look that they brought to my table. My guests kept complimenting them too. Love this set. The only fault I find is that the mugs could have been made a bigger as they are a bit small, but thats no big deal. Love it, love it. I highly recommend this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plates don't fit in any standard upper cabinet!","review":"The set arrived in good condition as far as i can tell since i only took out the top dinner plate and tried to put it in my kitchen cabinet. All of my cabinets are standard kitchen cabinets and they clearly do not fit. WAY too big. Since all standard kitchen cabinets have outside depth of twelve inches I don't know who's cabinets they could fit in. They would only work in a corner cabinet or dish rack. I think this is a significant design flaw. I will be returning the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased with Replacement policy for shipping damage","review":"Although the dinnerware is lovely, I was very displeased with the replacement policy. I had two broken pieces when thebox arrived. I put away the dishes and threw away the box. When I called Amazon I was informed that I needed to return the entire set and they would replace the entire set. Since I no longer had the packing materials, it was simply too much trouble to buy an appropriate box and packing materials to protect the dishes for shipping, repack everything, and take it to be mailed. I am annoyed that I have to now replace the broken pieces at my expense through Mikasa and pay the shipping charges."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy they absorb water","review":"Do not buy these dishes the bowels are not sealed.

I did receive with one broken plate and would have had to send the whole set back to get a new plate. So I ended up having to pay for another one. I would also expect to buy some additional items to round out the set. If you buy the four cereal bowls they a large enough to use as side dish bowls.

Nearly eight years later, they are still as nice as the day we received them. We use them daily, and have found the quality to be very high. The only issue we've had is that the handle of one of the coffee mugs has a crack in it that has caused the handle to start to come loose from the mug. Only one of the mugs developed this problem, so I'd say it is an irregularity not a design issue.I can verify that this is a quality set of dinnerware. If you like the design, you can't go wrong with this set. We also own all of the mixing bowls, large coffee cups and saucers, and two serving trays. All are equally nice and have stood the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for understanding!","review":"Thanks for your prompt resonse to my order.

I will buy from them again.The dishes are beautiful, I couldn't be happier. Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit disappointed","review":"I thought this was a pretty good buy because it is after all a known brand and my previous set was also from Mikasa. However, when i received my package, one of the dinner plates had a brown stain - very obvious (a long line right on the middle of the plate). Unfortunately, I wasn't able to complain because I had this shipped to Manila and it would be quite difficult to have it returned.The set looks great, but I did not receive all the pieces in perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Dinnerware!! Broken pieces :(","review":"I LOVE this pattern! It is very simple and elegant. I fell in love with Lenox Butler's Pantry, but couldn't find it in a complete set, and the Italian Countryside came in a close second, so I ordered it. I'm very pleased with the quality. There are a few minor flaws in the glaze, but nothing I can't overlook.The only downside was that upon arrival, three pieces were totally shattered. Amazon sent a replacement set, I traded out the three broken pieces, and returned the rest at no cost (although a little inconvenience) to me. I also found several pieces in the replacement set were broken, so there is obviously an issue with packaging and/or shipping.Overall, I am very pleased with my new dinnerware! Beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"chips easily","review":"I have been using this dinnerware for over a year and am finding more and more chipped pieces.

Every one we have has hairline cracks in the glazed side. You can not heat soup or any other item, they will discolour and crack.

What a concept. this album along with \\"Bananas\\" are the only two serious blemishes in the studio Deep Purple catalogue. This album flatly sucks. Joe Lynn Turner is an average singer at best. Hard to believe that the band that turned down Rod Stewart early in his career would ever consider a singer like him. and the rest of the band is just going through the motions tring to recapture their glory years with subpar material at best. Avoid this at all costs. Not for diehards, not for anybody!! Go to The Battle Rages On.

This clearly has more of a POP ROCK vibe than a HARD ROCK vibe. There are some really good songs and great production to be found here. Songs like, King of Dreams, Fire In The Basement, The Cut Runs Deep, Truth Hurts, Love Conquers All and Wicked Ways are all very good, and would be considered \\"great\\" if they'd come from a Heavy Metal \\"hair\\" band from the late 80's and early 90\`s. If you liked your Whitesnake or Rainbow (with Joe Lynn Turner), then you'll enjoy Slaves & Masters.Quote of the month: \\"Look, there goes Jimmy Page, the greatest white thief of black music, ever!\\" - Homer Simpson"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Slaves and Masters","review":"Slaves and masters is the only cd with the name of Deep Purple and Jo Lynn Turner at vocals and it works out very well. Blackmore is at his usual best and the rest of the band compliment this effort. Every song on this cd is good, not one dud. King of Dreams is a catchy tune that starts this set. The production is good and the instrumentation is clear. I don't recall Ritchie Blackmore ever putting out bad music and this one is no exception. Some cd's never get they're due this is a good example, but take it from me, If you buy this, you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hard rock, but not the Gillan Deep Purple","review":"Well, Deep Purple had a noticably different (matching the times) sound post-reunion as it was, but this album sounds different even from the ones around it. It's the \\"Machine Head\\" lineup, but with Ian Gillan replaced on vocals with Joe Lynn Turner, who has a very different style - Turner has a smoother, crooner rock voice like David Coverdale (I've noticed Blackmore never tried to find another singer in the Gillan vein when he worked with different singers in Purple!). The band similarly seems toned down to match - this album doesn't seem to have the kick of \\"Perfect Strangers\\" or \\"Battle Rages On\\". So, if your looking for more like that you won't find it here! But, the songs are good hard rock more in the style of mid/early 80's Whitesnake, and I rather like this album now I've gotten used to it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"great piece","review":"I am 32 years old and just received the Series 1 for Christmas from my In-Laws.

I have read this book carefully, and I believe that the misleading \\"facts\\" portrayed regarding the history of the island effectively sponsor a non-recognized rogue \\"state\\" recognized globally by just Turkey which invaded the island in 1974. This invasion has resulted in more than 200,000 people becoming refugees in their country of origin, the equivalent of 120 million people being dislocated in the United States as a result of an invasion by a foreign nation.

It doesn't say that in 1974, after the invasion, all the names of ancient cities, villages, and sites where changed.

It is wrong, to say the least, to crate anything, including books, that would help in legitimizing a state whose basis is an invasion and illegal occupation.Thiis book draws a picture of the magnificence of the North parts of the island, but one must remember that those who live there are mostly people who inhabit homes that have been stolen away from others. This book helps in legitimizing this wrong. If Iraq was fought because of its behavior against kuwait, how can we, with a light conscience, try to legitimize the same behavior elsewhere? This book tells about the beatu of STOLEN treasures, and fails to address the corruption and illegality of the regime and the people.

I did enjoy \\"The Liar's Club\\" and fully expected to devour \\"Cherry\\" but it was not to be. This account of Mary Karr's adolescence seemed to drag on endlessly.The style of writing I found riveting in \\"Liar's Club\\" began wearing on me very early in \\"Cherry\\". At times it reminded me of an essay a kid writes in school with lots of big words to impress a teacher. There comes a time in this book when Karr's prose stops being lyrical and just becomes annoying.That's to say nothing of the storyline which was monotonous and repetative. When the teenaged Mary got stoned or starts tripping, I felt as though it was really happening. Her storytelling brain cells must have burned-up on re-entry. It was as if \\"Liar's Club\\" and \\"Cherry\\" were written by two different authors. I'll be looking forward to the next book by the woman who wrote \\"Liar's Club\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intially entertaining but pure drudgery by the end","review":"This book was very entertaining. light-hearted and fun, for the first half. Intially, I could relate to the stories and emotions. However, I couldn't relate at all in the second half and no longer found the stories or people interesting, just pathetic. By then I was also tired of the flip-flop writing style. Some stories are told in a narrative sense and some are told about Mary and her friends & family as if it is you and your friends and family. I found that quite irksome."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you didn't do drugs, it might be hard to get into","review":"I have never done drugs, so I couldn't relate or even understand a lot of this book, and it was incredibly depressing to boot.

To be honest, had I started with \\"Cherry\\" I probably would not have been interested enough to read anything else by her. But by the end of \\"The Liars' Club\\" you feel as if she's a close friend so you want to read \\"Cherry\\" to find out what happens in her life after that. She's also a poet, but I'm not a fan of poetry so I can't tell how if her poetry books are any good.

In fact, Dooney was one of my brother's best friends. A lot of us experienced the same adolescence as Mary, not much to do in that town,except get into trouble!!!However, not many could be as eloquent as Mary's words. I enjoyed the book, esp trying to figure out who some of the characters really were. Liar's Club was definitely a much better book, however, this one is funny, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting story written in such boring prose","review":"I am so disappointed with the way in which Karr chose to write this memoir. I was tempted to put it down more than once while I was reading it, but her subject matter kept me interested, and I did finish it. However, her style of writing is just not for me. There is hardly any use of dialog between any of the characters - the majority of the story is told as one long description of the things around her, which I found very dull. I feel that written in another way, this would have been much more interesting to read. Not sure if I will continue on to the Liar's Club, which I didn't realize was the prequel to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story-telling! I saw myself in her!","review":"If you have read Liar's Club, then you will love this book! I honestly felt that Cherry was better that the first book, but I know that I wouldn't have enjoyed it if I hadn't read Liar's Club first. Liar's club gave a deep background into her relationships with her family members which is necessary to understand the interactions between all of them during her teenage years. It plays on so many themes, like sister relationships, mother-daughter relationships, father-daughter relationships, and most importantly, relationships with other teenage girls and boys. I found myself rooting for her, crying for her, and feeling the pandora's box open as she begins to realize the truths about herself and all of those she loves. And the funny thing is that the story is told in a very casual yet hilarious manner. I was always anxious to find out what happened next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherry Not What I Hoped For","review":"I read Liar's Club for a book club and I loved it. It was funny, gripping, and gritty. I truly enjoyed the way she told her story, the good, the bad, and the ugly of her childhood. I was so thrilled to see that she had a second book published. But upon reading it I was highly disappointed. I was never able to get into it - it did not have the same powerful grasp of story that the first book did. I found that I had to keep working at reading it, rather than wanting to read it! I did not like the secodn person style she took in writing this book. It wasn't the content of the book that disappointed me, it was the way she told it to us that did. I will read what comes next from Mary Karr because I believe she has a great \\"eye\\" for the world she sees, this book will not deter me from reading more from her because I thought the Liar's Club was one of the best books I have read in years. It is just that Cherry is not...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memories in search of a story.","review":"I loved The Liar's Club, and anticipated an equally strong reaction to Mary Karr's second autobiography. However, this book never engaged me. Even though it was an autobiography, The Liar's Club had a clear plot and theme. This book does not. The first 70 pages read as a series of vignettes, with no coherent story emerging from the compilation. I finally gave up and didn't finish the book - a rarity for me. It's not that the writing was affirmatively bad. Karr's poetic prose is still very clever, and her ability to potently describe her characters is as strong as ever. I just never could get interested in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry Mary!","review":"I loved, loved, loved THE LIAR'S CLUB so I could hardly wait to read CHERRY. However, I felt it missed the mark in a big way. Karr's writing wasn't quite as good, but more than that, her story didn't hit the mark in the same fine, but funky, fashion as THE L. CLUB. In fact, this book was almost disjointed as it followed her lousy teenage choices through some terribly uninteresting scenes. I just couldn't care... But perhaps Ms. Karr will come back to lead us on to California (hinted to at the onset of CHERRY) and back to some of her cutting-edge writing and just-plain-cutting memories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over J.D.

I was wrong. Cherry is a powerhouse of a book. From the best first chapter I've ever read to the ending which left me praying for another 276 pages, Karr has ripped open her life in front of her public and has exposed her soul. Each and every sentence in Cherry is enticing, delicious prose and some halt you in your tracks.It's a must read, and one that I suspect will become the next required reading for some lucky student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherry How it really was!","review":"Cherry brings life back to the women who lost identity because of a patriarchal society (1950-1966). She composes the most intimates thoughts of a teenager fumbling through a time frame of true (distorted) sexual identity. A first kiss and the introduction of drugs was the begining and end of a world and that was what flavored the rest of our history through high school.

As others have stated, boring, dull,leaving me with a \\"So What? feeling\\" I thoroughly enjoyed The Liar's Club and was very anxious to read Cherry, but found myself either wanting it to end or at least take the story somewhere, anywhere! I ended up not finishing the book, opting for paying more attention to parts of life that truly matter. Very little focus and point to the anecdotes, almost as if this were a random and confused self serving stream of consciousness .... am now skeptical about Lit and doubt I will order it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherry flops","review":"One of the disturbing trends in today's world is the willingness of people to bare their souls to the public. Ms. Karr apparently feels obligated to add her sad-sap story to this annoying public discourse. While Liar's Club was acceptable in that childhood bears airing-out every once in awhile, Cherry is nothing more than a cheap attempt to score a couple of bucks.Many if not all American adults at one time in their lives go through a period of indiscretion, often sexually and with drugs and alcohol. We really don't need page after page of Mary Karr's sexual experiences and constant need to get high. The ego of this woman is almost unbelieveable. We all had our teenage years...Ms. Karr's experiences are of little interest to anyone, except perhaps a judge due to her rampant lawlessness in terms of substance use.The content of Cherry is better suited to form the content of a dialogue with a psychiatrist...the author is in obvious and immediate need of therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rotten Cherry","review":"I found this memoir to be dull, dull, dull. This is sad, as I purchased this book on CD to keep my daily commute interesting. It almost put me to sleep -- I nearly rolled the car! Rather typical \\"coming-of-age\\" story where the person in question feels misunderstood, takes a lot of drugs, and has sex only to discover that she is somehow different than the rest of her friends. Throw in some dysfunctional parents and fellow 'misfit' friends and viola! Your typical formulaic memoir. The pace of the book rambles and plods on and on, jumping from one topic to the next. It is hard to follow and determine exactly what she is talking about and/or rebelling from, but it seems to be life in general. Buy this book only if you need help falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"who cares??","review":"I cannot find enough words to properly express my disgust at the terrible quality of this book.

But in the end I was a bit disappointed by the book's prose, which is more Raymond Chandler than Raymond Carver. The book's characters and the things that happen to them are not very convincing, either.

All The Way From Memphis is a typical rock \`n roll road saga, Hymn For The Dudes is quite tender, almost spiritual, All The Young Dudes is their stunning interpretation of the Bowie composition and Roll Away The Stone is a slab of rollicking rock. The live track Ballad of Mott is a complex, soulful ballad with beautiful organ infusions, The Golden Age Of Rock \`n Roll something of a tour de force with its traditional rock riffs and energetic vocals, while while Foxy Foxy is an impressive power ballad.

While pruning small branches (1/8\\") these pruners work fine. Ask them to cut larger diameter branches up to 3/8\\" and the blade of the pruner misaligned with the anvil enough to cause the blade to pinch and grab the anvil as it attempts to cut. You end up with a blade that consistently wants to bend towards the left side of the anvil as you proceed to try and make a complete cut. I tried a second pair of these and they were just as bad. Needless to say, I don't recommend these based on the poor strength of the design.I purchased a pair of the Corona anvil clippers from Amazon (2 years ago) and they work perfect. They are well made and don't suffer from poor design.I still have them. They are keepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the small handed","review":"The compound action on this pruner makes it really effective when cutting. It's easy to use on rose bushes and small pine branches. Just because the tree branch may fit within it's jaws, doesn't mean that you're going to be able to cut it easily, despite it's compound action (so, don't get overly zealous). It is pretty hefty for a pruner, but that is due to its heavy duty construction and materials. It appears well made and I hope that it'll last for many many years. I would not recommend this pruner for people with small hands because the grips/spacing is rather large and this pruner would be a lot less comfortable to use.

People are so quick to jump on the \\"good cop/bad cop\\" band wagon. Maybe this woman was more out of control than is stated in the book. It looks to me that she really had some major problems.

The story highlights the issues surrounding the problems with the many layers of police departments in the city & county, & their inability to successfully share information. It is frightening how easy it was for this crazy officer to accomplish this murder. Considering the number of police officers in Houston & Harris County, it makes you wonder how many other Sociopaths are in the departments. Living in the area that this crime occurred, teaching in the school district McGowan's son attended, & having patronized the described businesses, made the book even more interesting.

Susan White had her issues but she didn't deserve to be harassed and then be killed by someone who is supposed to serve and protect.

I listen to CD's in my car, on boom boxes, and on other computer speakers, but am still amazed at the quality and extra sound reproduction that I get with these speakers on my home computer or laptop.

I understand there is a new generation of cartoon watchers and this is probably for that market. This cartoon really tries to introduce this new generation to this updated line of toys, vehicles, etc, but in the process they completely alienated those fans who grew up on the cartoon in the 80's. If you are looking for nostalgic GI Joe action, this is not it. If you want to show your children something that you watched when you were growing up, then this might be the ticket."},{"rating":"2","title":"New CGi-Joe","review":"CGI-Animation make this new form of the GI-Joe saga look great but the writing tends to be minimal.

However, the computer animation is not that good (Destro's face look like more moulded jello then a steel mask) and the storyline is out of this world (very unrealistic). In fact, it appears that Hasbro has taken GI Joe back into the unrealistic world that killed the original GI Joe back in the mid-80's: meaning introducing crazy storylines mixed with out of this world characters.If you are a huge fan of the old 80's Sunbow series and are a big believer (like me) that the GI Joe movie killed the original 80's series, then you will find this new computer animated movie to be a waste of money (like I did).If you are new to GI Joe, I would recommend you pass on this movie and get the two original mini-series available on DVD as those two original mini-series are true to what made GI Joe so popular back in the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth the shipping cost.","review":"This failed attempt to resurrect the classic G.I. Joe series comes across with animation, story, and dialogue that belong in cheap game cut scenes. It had the potential of genetically modified Cobra troops and old-school characters reborn, but falls miserably short of the (admittedly already cheesy) quality of the original cartoon. Now, I am rather easy to please, and really enjoyed the old cartoon, but this film is mostly a string of mediocre action, weak character development (or involvement for those who already know them), and terrible puns at every turn. All told, the target audience should be more the 10 and younger crowd who have likely had no experience with real G.I. Joe. Current fans from around 20 or older will be sorely disappointed and should avoid the expenditure and wasted 80 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animated CGI Films","review":"I am a big fan of the G.I.

My wife used it successfully going through it once, although I suppose she didn't apply as much pull as I was able to. Within 2 weeks of using it correctly, braced through a door (using a third-party door attachment, which was not the problem), the left handle plastic tube that feeds through the grip (which is hollow, and the nylon fabric passes through it) cracked. I was by no means pulling it so hard that it was equaling an actual pull-up, but it had a little tension at the bottom of the pull and I figured I'd use it for a few weeks and maybe get a heavier one later on or on a repeat of the program.Again, this wasn't a band-snap incident. This was the handle that cracked. By rotating that 1/2\\" crack away from the nylon fabric running through, my wife can still use it, but if I give it another go it'll probably crack completely and be useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but uncomfortable to use","review":"When I bought this product, I was really excited because the four braided bands made it look like it wouldn't snap, and it was a value for $20. It also came with a workout DVD. Unfortunately, when I actually used the cord, the big black plastic part connecting the cord to the handle was VERY uncomfortable and prevented me from using it as directed. It hits and rubs against your wrist and you can't avoid this without awkwardly holding it away from your body, which is also difficult and dangerous.

I have been using these since April 2012 for Power 90 sculpt dvds. I must say while they are perfect and do everything you would like them to do. The design of the handle is far from perfect. The connector piece on the band digs into your skin very much and has often times caused bruising. So much that i now wear gloves when using them. The braided effect gives it more resistance but when doing an exercise that requires the band to come in contact with the skin it can contract and pinch your skin. This results inn me using these bans with either long sleeves and/or gloves.That why it will not get 5 stars because in all honesty, it can hurt you. LOL.

That guy can really play."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of the Reich","review":"The strength of this book, in my view at least, is the personal accounts of both civilians and soldiers that the author has deftly woven into his sweeping account of the closing days of the Third Reich and the fall of Berlin. The reason for my four star rating is that I found the rather lengthy section of the book dealing with Operation Eclipse (the plan the Allies formulated for the partitioning of Germany into occupation zones at the close of the war)to be tedious. I suppose that the subject was more relevant and interesting at the time the book was first published during the sixties at the height of the cold war and with the Iron Curtain still in place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well deserving of being a classic","review":"Very well written. Flows extremely well, especially towards the end of the book. Really shows the agony of the decision on the part of the Anglo-American allies to stop at the Elbe and not push on to Berlin. I think much of the information contained was new when this book was released nearly fifty years ago. While that is no longer the case, it is still fascinating reading. Heartily recommend to all World War 2 enthusiasts. In some respects, it can be thought of as \\"required reading\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifyingly real","review":"This book is easily one of the best books on any subject I have EVER read. Ryan brings many different lives and stories together in one horrid account of the collapse of the Reich. It's almost like reading about your neighbors as you follow these people through to the end. Ryan does not hesitate to give us all the details as the citizens of Berlin came under the heel of the conquering Russians. The pictures in this 50th anniversary addition are stunning. As important as the best Hitler biographies and Shirer's RISE AND FALL OF THE THIRD REICH.Essential reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding history of last days of war in Europe","review":"Ryan's previous books, Longest Day and A Bridgetoo Far, along with The Final Battle, put theoverwhelming and sweeping events of WWII in ahuman perspective.

Best book of a remarkablyoverlooked period in the War."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for WWII fans","review":"A great read encompassing many angles or the war and the people invloved. I would have liked a few more maps, however. I came away with a much better understanding of the end of the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Masterpiece","review":"Cornelies Ryan ceases to amaze me with his meaningful and destinct historical details of some the 20th century's most important events. This book achieves what most histories fail to do. It gives great amounts of information without becoming dry and repititious.Ryan drags you through the last days of the third reich, through the good the bad and the ugly. This non-partisan view is an achievemewnt in itself. If you have any remote interest in history you will find Ryans books fasinating and the sources of his information astounding. Modern historians write books based mostly on second hand knowledge but all of what Ryan puts down on paper is straight from the horses mouth and is verified.The cliched phrase \\"The movie doesnt do the book justice\\" Applies in every sence. Read it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of the Battle for Berlin but nothing new on the topic","review":"Not for the experienced WWII reader but a nice overview to put in your library. This book is still light reading in comparison to books like \\"Hells Gate\\"about the Cherkassy Pocket, Not the definitive book on the topic as I say but still good reference material. In the light of new material available and better divisional and unit accounts keep reading what is coming out now and build your knowledge one book at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I took this book along on a recent vacation and was thoroughly absorbed in it. I love Cornelius Ryan's writing style. He keeps it moving and made me feel as if I was there. I can give no bigger compliment than that. I have read almost all of Stephen Ambrose's books and numerous other WWII books, I rate this book up there with them all. It is a must read for the serious WWII reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Book","review":"An excellent mixture of military history and personal accounts about both Allied fronts closing in on Berlin. His telling of the last days in the Fuhrerbunker are amazing with regard to the utter denial that was happening. The book is interspersed with some sets of relevant photos, as well as a layout of the bunker itself. I recommend this book without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The final word on the final battle","review":"You have to read all three of the Ryan books to get a better understanding of WWII. All three give a wonderful perspective of the war at turning points in the war. This book shows how relatively untouched Berlin was until the Russians began their assault. Interviews from top generals to milk men are conducted and insight like few historians could offer. The Russians extract their revenge with a program of rape on all German woman. Ike is cautious about invading the capital because of rumors of secret instillations in Southern Germany. The Germans want to surrender to the British and Americans, therefore leave the Western regions virtually undefended for a quick Allied invasion. It goes on from there, but why ruin the book. The best thing to do is begin with Ryan's \\"The Longest Day\\" then \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" and end with \\"The Last Battle.\\" Maybe the best thing about Ryan's books is that all three compliment each other and can be read separately without any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singles Alison Moyet","review":"Loved it and would recomend to everybody how likes the eighties, and look forward to the other recordings of hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saul Williams' Masterpiece","review":"This CD is incredible, the man's lyrics are the most interesting and spiritual known to hip hop music, Serj from system of a Down and Zach de la Rocha from Rage Against the Machine are on this CD providing different piano, drum, and guitiar lines.Check this CD out its 11 out of 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate hip hop, but...","review":"The problem with most hip hop is that you can see right through it (If you're semi-intelligent).

These are great. The heel is elegant, but not too high and the style makes my legs look good. The flesh tone matches with a lot of stuff. I did have to take them to a shoe repair shop to have the heels re-inforced, but it is worth it. Oh! I've also danced with them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable for street or dance","review":"Nice stable shoe. I did have to take them to have heel tips put on as they don't come with any, cost was $10 at my shoe repair. I wanted a pair of basic black shoes with leather soles without paying a fortune for them. I can't believe what we have to go through to find women's shoes with leather soles anymore. Ridiculous. But these worked out nice. I can wear them on the street and if an opportunity to dance comes up, I can dance in them as well. I did order them in a wide (I normally wear medium) since many reviewers stated they run tight. I'm glad I did, they fit perfectly and are very comfortable for walking or dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept, arm broke after 3 uses...","review":"Loved the concept, I paid $50 for mine and was ready to hit the beach, the concerts, etc. Unfortunately, the arm broke while trying to get out of the thing.

Lazlow, the DJ, also has neat stuff to say about his career and the songs and other things. He is very cool.

His whispery, lo-fi sound was vaguely familiar and yet completely original. Since his first release, Sam Beam has no problem churning up new music for us all to enjoy. With every release, Beam has shown growth, both musically and lyrically.Now, on In The Reins, Iron & Wine has gone somewhere they never have before; straight up rock infused with country and (yes, I'm serious) jazz. The sound is refreshing, completely catchy and most importantly, a new step for Sam Beam. His teaming up with Calexico has worked wonders. This CD is an absolute treat. I can't wait to see where Sam Beam decides to go next. And until then, I'll just continue rocking out to In The Reins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful - A Perfect Blend","review":"This album is absolutely beautiful. The full musical sound and talent of Calexico together with the soothing warm vocals of Iron & Wine make the perfect match.It's almost unheard of that I love EVERY song on an album, but this one makes the cut.

I really hope to see a these two bands getting together for more albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep surprise","review":"I'm pretty selective in my music purchases. I try to listen to samples.

Amazon....I don't trust you anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of 2005","review":"This EP is a very solid outing for both bands. Sam Beam is one of the best songwriters alive, and I always thought he would sound better with strong instrumentation behind him. Calexico makes for a perfect backing band. They are obviously adept at utilizing the right stuff at all the right times- the pedal steel, the accordion, operatic (Mexican, maybe?) vocalists, and not to mention a badass horn section. Although completely different stylistically, these guys (hope Sam stays with them!) and the Avett Brothers from NC are the two best bands alive right now- studio AND live."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I was looking forward to the possibility of a \\"walking sandal.\\" Unfortunately, these sandals did not do the trick for me.

I would like to read her books in order but I will probably have to wait...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really enjoyed Sharon Kay Penman's earlier books, and I was excited about this one.The beginning was fairly entertaining, although I knew too much about Henry and Eleanor for it to seem as fascinating as some of Penman's earlier books. Still, I enjoyed some of those bits.Unfortunately, about three quarters of the way through, I was starting to hope Becket would just die already! Each political move among Becket, Henry and the Pope seems to be described in minute but somehow uncompelling detail. I honestly found that rather than wanting to stay up late to read (which is usually the case with Penman's books), I'd drop off in mid-paragraph. It was really a struggle to finish.Overall, not one of the best books about this era and a real letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent 2nd book in three book series","review":"Time and Chance follows the rise of Henry the second and Eleanor of Aquitaine.

The characters were well-developed and quite interesting. Really good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Definite Let Down","review":"I absolutely agree with the reviewer of March 12, from Alexandria, Va. This sequel to \\"When Christ and His Saints Slept\\" was quite a disappointment. After waiting for five years for the sequel, \\"Time and Chance\\" was not at all what had been expected. The characters were two-dimensional; no depth whatsoever. Although the book was read from cover to cover, the anticipation was dissolved within the first chapter. All the other historical novels by Ms. Penman are such classics- this story of Henry II and Eleanor was 'blah'. Hate to say it, but chances are I won't read the third book in the triology. Too bad the generous writing of her Welsh series wasn't continued."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I loved Penman's other books but this one lacks Penman's usual magic. There are no interesting new characters, and the old ones have lost much of their luster.The most interesting subplot, the growing estrangement between Eleanor and Henry, is overshadowed by the tale of Thomas Becket, a story that never grabbed my interest because the character of Becket is not developed. It reads like a recitation of facts, not a historical fiction novel.Similarly, the subplot of Hywel, son of Owain Fawr, never pulls me in because Penman tells it through the eyes of her made-up character Ranulf, who is not directly involved in the action.Penman's other books kept me up half the night because I couldn't put them down. This one, by contrast, was a chore to read. I hope the next one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sunne in splendour","review":"This sequel to the saga of the early English kingdom is a disapointing effort to recreate the excellent and precise descriptions of people and country of previous novels.One can only assume that writing superficial, light mystery novels has not been productive for the authors narrative: the preference for short, swift dialogue has not done any good. We are deprived in this case of the rich insights into events and personal thoughts.Perlman has lost ground in the realm of historical novelists. I fear she will have to regain quite a few followers after this disapointing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic rather than Historical","review":"I picked up this book to read about intriguing English history. But I found the matter too sketchy. The thick book talks mainly about relationships using historical developments as a mere backdrop.It did build a few characters including that of King - Henry Fitz Empress - quite impressively, but the rest characters appeared more like fillers.It was sketchy and the episodes not tied well.All in all - not worth the time I put into it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Stars????","review":"Why anyone would give this work 4 stars is beyond me.

I got the set for my birthday, when my wife noticed that the grill tools I was using were a messy collection of mismatched pieces, and I think she did a great job picking these out. The spatula and tongs move things around well (and the spatula can be used for flipping well, if you're getting adventuresome at the grill), and the fork is great for testing doneness and keeping people from messing around with your grill (kidding). I like the size of these as well, as they have enough reach to keep you from having to hang all over the grill. Oh, and the handles are comfortable, with a bit of a soft grip on them. But it's good to remember that the handles are probably too big for those with smaller hands--these are overall good-sized tools, sturdy, and hefty without being too heavy. Now, I just can't wait for more good-grilling days to use them more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book as usual","review":"The first book in this series had me worried but this book was way better than the first. I can't help but think the rest of the series will be even better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Griffin Book I read","review":"This is the first Griffin book I ever read and it got me hooked. I have since read and completed 5 of his series. He does a good job of bringing you up to speed on past events so characters that are not that common can quickly be put into place and context. The only downside to that is if you read his series quickly back to back it's a lot more background information then you really need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner!","review":"W.E.B. comes through again with a hard hitting fast paced novel. While the entire Brotherhood of war series is a spectecular blend of military action, espionage, and drama The Captians is the pinnacle of the series. The life of Lowell sees so many ups and downs in this book it would make most men fall apart but Griffin portrays these situations so realistically that I couldn't help but feel I was right there and feeling the emotions running through me.

I thought for sure with a title like this that it would skip all the what is Notes junk (like how to create views and forms, etc.) that all Notes books seem obligated to include. It is just a bunch of a filler in an otherwise useless book. I was looking forward to seeing some good JavaScript examples as it is used in common Notes situations. Well, no such luck.

I am so grateful for this book, as it has aided me in understanding the nature of Christ. I am someone who has battled illness (mentally and physically) in my life and this book has given me the strength to stop thinking soooo much about myself and begin to focus on others, which I believe is leading to my own healing.

I paid almost 40 USD between tag price and shipping charges to Mexico because I wanted this classic CD from Mecano, as it is a collectors item. None of the available merchants probably knew the difference between CD's with artwork, and lame digital copies without artbook!!!! . The sole purpose of getting a CD, is the artbook, specially when it is collector's item, special limited edition.Without artbook, A digital CD is good for nothing.

The new songs are garbage at best. And even as a greatest hits collection, this fails. Buy all of the albums except this one. The best albums to buy for a new listener are \\"entre el cielo y suelo\\" and \\"descanso dominical\\". This features 7 new tracks, 1 remake, and 22 of the classics (but they left off several of their all time greatest like \\"cuervas de esa chica\\" y \\"laika\\" y \\" el cine\\").

From the first to the last song. #4 is personally my favourite. They do what not to many recent bands do. Their liner notes are amazing and worth the $25 I spent on the cd alone.

The rest of the songs are wonderful; they address different kinds of love. \\"How Come, How Long\\" is my favorite, but all of the songs are excellent; this is one album that I don't have to skip any songs. \\"The Day (That You Gave Me A Son)\\" is so beautiful.

With that being said, this botched attempt at boiling their career down to a single disc has a number of serious flaws:1. The Paul Dianno era, which includes some of Maiden's best-loved classics, is completely ignored.2. Several of the band's best songs are missing (most notably \\"Aces High\\" and \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\"), while fully half of the Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son album is included.3. The disc includes two of Maiden's worst songs, \\"Holy Smoke\\" and \\"Bring Your Daughter To The Slaughter\\".With two best-of compilations already out there, Edward The Great is completely unnecessary...with no new or unreleased material there's no reason for established fans to buy it, and for newcomers looking for a quick overview, Best Of The Beast and Ed Hunter are both much better choices.

While Jen's first novel--_TypicalAmerican_--also explored America's varied identities in termsof clashing cultures and the immigrant experience throughhumor, _Mona in the Promised Land_ is more lighthearted thoughstill a substantial book. _Mona_ is a book of the second-generationAsian-American. The only grouse I have is the sentimental way in whichJen tends to end her novels, and this a fault more evident in hersecond book. Nonetheless, I look forward to her future works. She'sa worthy successor of the older generation of writers like Maxine Hong Kingston"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe two-and-a-half stars","review":"Probably the biggest problem with this often charming novel is feeling. The Asian-American teen Mona rebels from her parents, and we see it, are told about it, rather than feeling it. It doesn't particularly make sense, and that stems from Jen not being whole-hearted about the characterization of the parents. This story is a sort of romp for Mona, a notebook purge, perhaps, wherein anything Jen can think of goes in, when the subject is the protagonist and her Jewish boyfriend. The parents are cliches, whipping posts. Occasionally the mother's harangues strike a true note and are thus stirring, but are usually placemarkers. A subplot that occupies a lot of space, concerning an available crash-space for a Black friend of Mona's, doesn't begin to carry the drama Jen seems to attempt. It seems a waste of effort. A lot of the book is like that, including another twisty set of events not to be given away here--not as interesting as the narrative voice would insist--not felt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, 2","review":"I, too, found the book tedious.

But, this book is just a total disappointment.Mona's character is funny, but she was just not interesting enough. I found that I really didn't care what happened to her as the book went on. The other characters aren't developed well-enough, and just seem to be caricatures. Her Jewish friend Barbara whose mom makes her get a nose job.

At the time I lived in Madrid. Upon returning to New York I dicovered that the CD had been left behind. I never grew tired of the music and would play it often. Semilla del Son is a clasic and testament to what the entire genre of Son is! The simplicity of \\"Quirino con su tres\\" sung by Mercedita Valdes, and the raw arrangement of \\"Mami me gusto\\" by Arsenio Rodriguez are strikingly sophisticated. All these years later I am still haunted by this loss. The sample cuts bring me to tears not so much by the memories the music envokes but by the life and vigor that these recordings appear to eternally represent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Scorpions CD","review":"Love at first sting makes a great argument for being the Scorpions best album. This album went in an more advanced direction musically and is my favorite. The sad thing was the follow up album featuring \\"winds of change\\" was a huge disappointment and brought the end of my days buying new Scorpions CDs. The best albums were Blackout, Love at First Sting and Savage Amusement. If you like the Scorpions its a must have; although its hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine album","review":"The person below me speaks the truth about the Scorpions. This album kicked so much ass. Mainstream?? They have always been mainstream right from the start so I dunno what people are talking about when they say this album is mainstream.The 1st 3 tracks are probably the best tracks on the album.Don't Stop at the top is the best song and very inspiring song that motivates you for more success.Rythm of love is another fantastic song so is passion rules the game.There are 1 track I didn't really like which was Media Overkill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gahhhhkk!!!!!","review":"The album isn't THAT horrible, but to me it is a shame that here is this great band that's been making all the deepest stuff over here and the rockinist stuff over there finally has everybody's attention and they turn out a platter that is such a blatent reflection of the commercial climate of the day. I like to watch the video for \\"When Passion Rules the Game\\" for yuks, but when it comes to the video \\"from Russia with Love and other Savage Amusements\\".... that's when I feel sad. Great band pushing these god awful hair metal ballads that have absolutely no artistic value. If you disagree with me consult exibit A. the videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a basic guide....","review":"I was very disappointed after reading this book. After reading several of the other reviews, I thought this book would cover the medium to advanced features of Outlook. Instead, there are chapters devoted to \\"receiving email\\", \\"how to enter in contacts\\", etc. This book is way to BASIC to be considered a complete guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book speaks to you!","review":"Thurman was not the most polished of writers, but he makes up that shortcoming by having a lot to say. I was enraptured with the number of ideas present in this book, and many times I paused to consider the weight of his words.Yes, the text is often clumsy, but the dialogue is sterling. So this is really what the Harlem Renaissance was about? I wish I could have been there. There are so many memorable characters in this book, and they all are real and possess unique personalities. Even the minor characters are fleshed out.Buy this book and read it. You won't regret it. After reading it, I have only one question: Why isn't Thurman's third novel, INTERNE, available? I can't think of any author to whom to compare Thurman. His dialogue reminds me a bit of Hemingway, but not really. Reading Thurman is a unique experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Homeschool Supplement","review":"Easy Game to pull out and play.

I particularly love \\"The Raven\\" and \\"The Tell Tale Heart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album! Not one song is worth skipping!","review":"This has a little bit of everything. Dream Within a Dream and the Fall of the House of Usher have a nice quiet, but relaxed feeling. The Raven, Doctor Tarr and Professer Fether, and The Tell Tale Heart have a hard rock sound. My two personal favorites, The Cask of Ammontillado and To One in Paridise, have a great ballody feel. All in all, this album is SUPER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of APP's recordings.","review":"An extraordinary album. Eerie at times, but spectacular and very, very emotional. Tracks like \\"The Raven\\" and \\"The Cask of Amontillado\\" are full of dark and moving sounds. But my personal favorite is the instrumental \\"Pavane\\" of \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". Parsons really captured the spirit of Poe's writings, in fact I got the stories he used as inspiration after I heard the album. APP never did something like this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the very best album by The Alan Parson's Project","review":"The Alan Parson's Project is my favorite band, and this just happens to be their best album ever. I prefer the artist's remix, which adds a little more style to the music, and adds more character by the use of some of Poe's narrative, read by Orson Welles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrific Masterpiece.","review":"I had never listened to an Alan Parsons record - so I will be the first to admit that I cannot make grandiose statements about his work. However, I found the record at a junk store for a dollar, and placed it on my turntable when I got home. I only bought it because I am a big Poe fan, and thought a musical interpretation would be amusing.From the opening notes of \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" I admit I was absolutely spellbound. The album: hypnotic, emotional and lush. For the time it was made, the sounds were so incredibly innovative. I found huge inspiration in writing my own music after listening to this album over and over! It is both tearfully sad, and delicately sinister. I was moved emotionally as I sat through it. Absolutely gorgeous album - I kid you not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the album but...","review":"What I got and what they said I would get are not the same thing. The product description said \\"here's the 1976 album and 1987 remix plus demos, unreleased \\"experiments\\" and more bonus material!\\". This is not true. It comes with the eleven tracks. That's it. I love the eleven, but where are the rest?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alan Parsons' original conception","review":"The first of many intriguing concept albums by the Alan Parsons Project, \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" is available as it was originally conceived on this Mercury/Mobile High Fidelity 'Ultradisc.' Featuring 24-carat gold plating and a deluxe jewel case, it's well worth the extra money (if, that is, you can find a copy for under ...). The sound is magnificent and matches the often grandiose instrumentation of, say, \\"The Fall of the House of Usher.\\" Although Parsons and Woolfson were still finding their way as a songwriting duo, this CD withstands the test of time and is highly rewarding overall. Listen especially to the final track, \\"To One in Paradise,\\" to get a taste of the almost surreal beauty which was cultivated on future releases (cf. the song \\"Time\\" from Turn of a Friendly Card)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some changes from the LP","review":"APP in making this CD made a few changes in some of the songs, adding Orson Wells' voice and a few minor things. I halfway prefer the LP version because I grew up with that version. The changes, though are minor and most of the stuff is from the original. Trivia: LP had two album covers, one shown here on CD and one with a human head halfway unwrapped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waaay too deep....","review":"This album is waaay too deep and self-indulgent for my taste.Being a huge Alan Parsons Fan, it pains me to have to say this, but this was almost a total waste of vinyl, energy and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for this for years!","review":"I was talking with friends about this album when I decided to check if it had ever been released on CD (I originally had it on tape). I was very pleased to find it on Amazon. It was just as good as I remembered, even though I hadn't heard it in nearly a decade. There are some songs which sound a bit dated, but I love the overblown nature of it ... perfectly fitting its grand intention of setting such classic literature to music. Surprisingly, my 10-year-old son really loves it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parsons' most unique \\"project\\" of all","review":"The 1987 CD re-release in no way diminished this work as a classic, but the changes made to the original were a mixed bag. Orson Welles' incredible voice (Why was it left off the original?!) would improve practically anything, but the new guitar solos by Ian Bairnson were unnecessary and somewhat distracting, with the synth additions by Parsons and Eric Woolfson making only a minor difference. All the tracks shine, but a special mention should be made of Andrew Powell's beautiful instrumentals for \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\", especially the Pavane. Incidentally, anyone who especially values this as a \\"theme\\" album should also check out Woolfson's amazing \\"Freudiana\\", which even more \\"mystery and imagination\\" than this did. It's an import, and somewhat pricey, but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterpiece","review":"Don't let anyone fool you, the Welles voice over is fantastic!!!!! Particularly at the beginning of side two, there is a key change that absolutely rattles your spine as Welles says \\"color becomes pallor\\". The CD rerelease also sounds better than the original vinyl. Plus, you get fantastic Ian Bairnson guitar additions on \\"Raven\\". Side 2 is a bit less accessible to non-fans and could take some getting used to. Nonetheless, the CD rerelease of this album is second only to the Project's I Robot in greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic prog rock","review":"I can't believe I waited this long to get the CD version of this album which I wore out in the late 70s. I've been listening to it almost non stop for two weeks and my teenage kids have really gotten into it.Brilliant concept basing an album on Edgar Allan Poe stories. But the concept will only be as good as the music which, thankfully, is fantastic.This comes from an era when the word \\"sophisticated\\" could be used with a straight face to describe a rock album. But, unlike a lot of other prog rock of the era, the material here is consistently catchy. The bass and drums are big, loud, and fat - a real classic rock feel.\\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher\\" is a 16 minute instrumental cycle that may be a matter of personal taste. I happen to love it and, if you're patient and give it multiple listens, you probably will too.\\"To One In Paradise\\" ends the CD on its only weak note. No matter. All of the rest of the CD really puts the \\"classic\\" in classic rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alan Parsons finest hour","review":"What can i add to the other glowing reviews here? This LP (as that is the format i first purchased it in) is simply a masterpiece. As a die-hard Poe fan this work manages to enscapulate the spirit of the works perfectly. It is an album I listen to at least once a month and I never tire of it. And, in fact, depending on my mood often discover new nuances in it.Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first time round!!","review":"I owned the vinyl LP, the CD,and have now downloaded the MP3.

It sounds like it was recorded at too high a level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I ordered this book becuase I thought it might be good, needless to say I was wrong! The author obviously didn't research for this book. When you read it you think that it is set for a modern time period, but it is supposed to be a in Queen Elizabeth's time. Bryce comes across as a whiner and the \\"heroine\\" is almost more masculine then the \\"Hero\\". The situations that they encounter aren't practical for the time period, i.e. double dating, a single woman and a single man roommating (the 'heroine and her friend), and their slang is modern, as in teenager in high school modern. I hate not finishing a book and I had to force my self to finish this one. By the end I was ready to tell the characters to get a life, and felt that they were so pathetic they deserved one another. This book was extremely disappointing. I will not ever read from Author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

Terrorism in the future, genetic time travel and secret political societies are just a few of the themes covered in this fascinating look into the technical future.

No problems at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long screensaver","review":"I got this as video wallpaper for a club. It seems out-of-date: it's basically like a late '90s colorful screensaver (this was made in about '93). You could probably make something better by just recording some RealPlayer or Windows Media Player visualizations on a tape. And it's only about 45 mins, so you have to keep rewinding it.It's 2-d animation instead of the state-of-the-art 3-d stuff in other computer animation videos such as the Mind's Eye series. The Mind's Eye type of animation looks cool with techno music, but if you're forced to play any hip-hop music (ick) then this video syncs better with slower music like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhhhhhh........... lovely...........","review":"Oh, my WORD!!! I loooooooooooooooooove this album... it is soooooo beautiful and soothing and relaxing and wonderful. Some of the selections are dreamy and calming, and there are also a few really upbeat and energizing pieces on it, too. And I'm a \\"tough customer\\" who is difficult to satisfy, so if I say that this recording is really nice, you can count on it that it is OUTSTANDING! Highly, HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Game","review":"Not worth the money, in my opinion. Not only do they start repeating items to bid on, showing the same thing over and over again, but the characters are creepy as all get out. I'm not pleased that I wasted money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"JUST LIKE THE REAL SHOW!\\"","review":"I'm a huge Price is Right fan and this game was not \\"just like the real show\\" as they advertise. The game play is slow and choppy. You really have to know what you're supposed to be doing next to keep it moving at all. Also, to know who goes on to the next round, you're supposed to add up the value of your prizes... but they don't always tell you the value of the prizes! Speaking of the prizes it seems like fifty percent of the time the prize is \\"A NEW CAR!!\\" It is exciting the first few times, but then you start to get them every other turn and it isn't so exciting.Overall, this game is really only fun if you make it so. After the first time few times playing I lost interest. We only bust it out when the right group of people is here to make it exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"My family and I range in age from 12-45 and are a huge fans of the show. The DVD game was very disappointing. The scenes were choppy. After only one time playing the game, we already had prizes repeating. There was no way to tell the winner. You had to keep track of your own winnings, but the prices were not always given. I would not recommend this game no matter the age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just tossed it in the trash","review":"We played this once in a while when we bought it several years ago. After it as on the shelf in the game closet collecting dust, we pulled it out to play again. Since it's a DVD game and not a video game, there are a lot of limitations to what you can do with it. The 4 rounds, contestants row, pricing games, showcase showdown, and showcase, are not connected in any way, and you need to manually decide who is winning, who belongs in the showcase showdown and showcase. The pricing games are OK. The Shocase Showdown doesn't keep track of who is the winner. You have to determine that yourself. It comes with dry erase boards and markers, but the markers down last very long. If you love the Price is Right and want to play it at home, you're better off with the PC or Wii version."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!...","review":"I purchased this game with the highest of hopes and expectations. It turned out to be fun for 15 to 30 minutes. Most of the audio just cuts off in many places, the movement is very choppy overall, and about the boards they give you to write down the amount of the prizes that you've won, yeah well, it would be nice if they gave you the amount! They give you nothing of the kind in the pricing games, so what are the boards for?!I could go on, but I won't. This game could have been so much better, I am not thrilled at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on down...","review":"I was very pleased with this DVD game. It combines all the favorites from my favorite gameshow. This is a game you can play with a small or large group, or even just wasting time by yourself.

Great fun for the entire family."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is DTS... down to suck","review":"this game is horrible, if I had a twelve year old son, he could make a better game than this. The gameplay is not smooth, the menus and options are not aesthetically pleasing. Like most of the other reviews on here, I was very excited to play this game and was COMPLETELY disappointed. There are not many prizes and they repeat within the first ten minutes of playing the game, this game might as well be called memory...

Why you are asking, just why is that? Is it because it is good, or bombastic? Why is this book considered a classic? Could it be it's marvelous jokes, or it's enjoyable little mischevious pokes, at the world around. Is it because it is so implausible, in fact applausible, in it's own right? Could it be that it is more fun to read at night? Why isn't it here or there? Why isn't it anywhere? The content of the book at charge, is amazingly hysterical, the enjoyment was large. If I had to choose one book by Seuss, this would be the only one to NOT say, vamous. It is philisophical, optical, practical, and factual. It can be enjoyable for 3-year-old Sally or 30-year-old Sam! After reading such a great book, I personally took a second look, at how lucky I really am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Suess' greatest work!","review":"Did I Ever Tell You... has inspired my children (and me) for 20 years.

I receved the message \\"no matter what happens you are always luckier than any one in this book\\". On a 1 to 10 scale I give this book a 7 because this book has a very simple message and some of the other books have a more meaningfull message. But if ever do have kids this is a book I would definitely read this book to them when they are feeling down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight Zone episodes for people with graduate degrees","review":"I love some of the other things I have read by this justly celebrated Argentine author, but these stories are just awful - a real disappointment. It shows what can happen when a writer settles into a sedate groove, and the questions he explores begin to become less interesting. The mystery and boldness of his other works are not present here. Instead we have descriptions of mundane little things - cats and bourgeois couples for example - that have little in the way of fire or brilliance, and seem instead like pretentious intellectual exercises, second rate Twilight Zone episodes for people with graduate degrees. I know that I am being a little harsh here, but I really did not like it. Check out some other things by Cortazar instead, like \\"Blow Up and Other Stories\\", for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album to have","review":"I've been a jazz lover for a while now and when I came across this album, I knew that it'll be a great one to get. Tony and K.Ds voice blend really well together and you can tell that they had fun cutting this album. Tony's ever classic voice coupled with K.d's smooth voice produce an album that I believe is a great showcase of each star's talents without overshadowing one another. My personal fav was the first song. Yes, Tony pays tribute to Mr. Armstrong and his attempt at doing \\"A Wonderful World\\" is a great effort but way short of the original. Then again, I don't think any artist can do it the way that Louis did.If you're looking for a great vocals album, pick this one up. Even if you decide you don't really fancy it, it makes great background music at parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS a Wonderful World!","review":"I've been a Tony Bennett fan since before he left his heart in San Francisco, and a kd lang fan since before she was \\"Crying Over You\\" with Roy Orbison, so, for me to buy this CD was a given! These 2 excellent performers sound s-o-o-o-o great together! Their voices blend so well.I already purchased both of the 2 Tony Bennett \\"Duets\\" cd/albums and enjoy them so very much, but, in my opinion, \\"It's a Wonderful World' tribute to Louis Armstrong is even better. On \\"It's a Wonderful World\\" there is no sense of either Tony or kd trying to \\"one-up\\" each other. The division of solo music seems to be shared fairly evenly between the two of them. The places where they harmonize give me goosebumps.I would love to have a new Tony & kd lang duet cd/album but would really love to have it on DVD with out-takes and warm fuzzy chats included! I can hardly wait!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have listened to Tony Bennett for over 50 years and have generally found him to be a great interpreter of this kind of music. This album left me very cold. No Nelson Riddle orchestration here, and Bennett seems to be going through the motions, despite the endearing photo on the cover. Not bad, but little that is moving in music that should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"strained","review":"I loved Tony Bennett's Duets II.....and the combination of voices betweenTony & K.D. Lang - was incredible. This CD however - A wonderful World,Tony sounds like he is straining to sing in several songs. K.D Lang's voicewas very minimal. IF her voice was more readily used, this could have beenincredible. It is NOT worth the money - but I will not return it. Not worth theprocess. Please - don't waste your money. When you listen to a portion providedhere - it is the smallest and best portion 0f the entire CD...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful World -Tony Bennett /k.d. Lang","review":"For anyone that loves listening to Tony Bennett's mellow style, this combination of his voice with k.d.Lang's sultry vocals is just wonderful. Their voices blend in beautiful harmony. I can't imagine two voices more suited for these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album, excellent stocking stuffer","review":"I thought albums like this one would not be made anymore!This is definately the best album Tony Bennett has ever made. k.d. lang is a more than equal partner for his singing talent, as her smooth and subtle renditions of popular classics all related to Louis Armstrong adds brilliance to hís still surprisingly dynamic voice.All the songs are outstanding and T-Bone-Burnett's production underlines that. k.d. lang amazes me, she is even better than Tony. The warmth and the love both of these artists have for their material and for each other is obvious and can be heard in every track.Not all of the tracks ae duetts - there are also solo songs on the CD. So there's no getting bored with this album. I am pleasantly siurprised. This is too good to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Odd Couple Making Perfect Music Together","review":"Tony Bennett and k.d. lang. Whooda thunk? Obviously they both knew they clicked when they sang together on Tony's earlier CD of duets. Thank the Lord for the follow up. This is probably one of the most beautiful duets CDs I've ever heard. Hell, it's probably the most beautiful CD I've ever heard. Period. There is a chemistry between these two that is magical, soulful, playful, loving and serious all at the same time. Two great singers. Two great interpreters. Not a bad song on the CD. Musical perfection! Ya also gotta love Tony for paying a heartfelt spoken tribute on the A Wonderful World cut to the muse behind this venture, Louis Armstrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a sexy, classy album","review":"I've loved k.d. lang's sultry, beautiful voice for some time now, but I have never heard it put to better use than here. She excels on these jazzy, sexy songs. So does Tony Bennett, with his strong smooth voice, so different than k.d.'s, yet so complimentary. This album is one I listen to over and over again, and am so glad to have in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony and k.d.sing the oldies","review":"I loved this c.d. Tony and k.d. have terrific voice control and they complimented each other on the duet tracts.I enjoy listening to the old standard tunes and this c.d. delivered some of the great tunes of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as expected","review":"This is not a CD I would have purchased, but received it as a gift. However, I do really like both performers and so was interested and fully expecting to enjoy their duets. Imagine my surpise when it turned out that they only sing together on one song ~ La Vie En Rose. All the others are not duets at all, but merely sung alternately. I found this very disappointing. They are shown singing together and in the studio together, but could really have done the whole thing from opposite sides of the country. Won't be listening to it often. I'd stronly suggest you spend the money on solo albums instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tony, it's over....","review":"Listening to Bennett on this CD is like listening to post-1965 Sinatra. They're both just faking it, but, due to their iconic status, they get away with it. On this CD, Lang just plain carries Tony, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars.Take a pass on this one and the 'Duets' album; age has caught up with Bennett. Instead, give a listen to 'Fifty Years: The Artistry of Tony Bennett'. Hearing his early material will make the deterioration in Bennett's voice quite obvious and make you wonder if it's really the same vocalist.Time marches on and it's cruel what it has done to Bennett's range, but, thankfully, the great work of his early and middle years is still around...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I liked this album","review":"I like both of their voices. I like most of the songs. I did not like the arrangements - no pep at all. Just so flat. I was very sad that this did not work out better. I was so looking forward to it. But it is like something on a mellow jazz station.

But someone has got to stop this easy listenin' moony-waily lushly lackadaisical sinuous syrupy \\"smooth jazz\\" exploitation of just one tiny, embarrassing aspect of the saxophone's otherwise terrific character.But I doubt the small-minded no-talents who produced this album would ever get the drift.Note to Word Lovers: \\"Treacle\\" originally meant \\"a medicinal compound formerly in wide use as a remedy against poison.\\" However, Tony and KD got suckered into singing on an album that's practically poisonous itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"k.d. lang could manage this one on her own!!","review":"I finally got the album today and I wasn't really in too big of a hurry to get it - unlike any other time k.d. lang puts out a solo album and I'm buying it the day it comes out. I have to say that this is also an album my mother will love as a Xmas present - since she loves BOTH Tony Bennett and k.d. and really enjoyed the show I took her to last year. All I can say about this album, is that it's torture to sit there and have to listen to Tony sing with kd - when I want so much for it to be ONLY kd singing these songs. I love these old standards and Ella Fitzgerald is also one of my favorite singers and she's done all of these songs on her various solo albums. k.d. would have done the songs a greater justice doing them all solo, rather than \\"helping\\" Tony out to sell yet another album for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Hate to say it, but I think this is one of the worst albums of all time.

The first pair broke rather easily after just a few weeks - one arm (or \\"temple\\" in eyeglasses terminology) snapped midway between the frame and the ear portion of the arm. Thinking it was a fluke, I bought a second pair of Solar Shields. This time an arm snapped while just holding them in two hands and raising them to my face. Since that pair was ruined too, I carefully applied light pressure to the other arm and it snapped at the same point - midway to the ear. This is indicative of very poor quality materials / workmanship. Too bad they break so easily, as they fit well and I had high hopes for them. At $19.99, they about 10 times as expensive as they should be.

The plastic is brittle and cheap, even by current standards for eyeglasses frames, which in general are incredibly over-priced and flimsy, and a major consumer rip-off.In my opinion they are engineered to fail. I picked up a pair of Solar Shields at a Fred's store that were discounted down to $2.99, which is about the price they should sell for, given their cheap quality and lack of durability. They were made to end up in the landfill, along with mountains of other throw-away products (junk) produced in China for international corporations who take pride in how efficiently they can rip off millions of customers, over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Temple\\" arm flimsy & breaks easily","review":"The sunglasses are comfortable and function well but break easily.

A simple email was all it took to get an exchange pair, no matter what the problem. Then the emails went unanswered -- maybe they changed ownership, or fired the \\"good\\" warranty lady. So I tried the new customer service contact info. Oh sure, no problem, just send them in prepaid -- with proof of purchase -- oh yeah and be sure to include $5 or so for \\"handling\\".

Third, the cables are a sloppy fit in the housing and you can't adjust them precisely - they are not compressionless and won't work very well with modern index shifting systems.

The Grundig doesn't have this feature but does have much better audio which makes listening more pleasant over the long haul.

The second is a very flimsy power socket that is soldered directly to the circuit board. Movement of the plug in the socket can cause the solder joints to weaken, effectively depriving the unit of external power.Having said that, the radio gives better performance on NiMH batteries and fully charged batteries will last quite a long time.

True, it is totally different style of music compared to Linkin Park....but with Chesters amazing voice, it makes the album just as good. I think everyone Linkin Park fan or not should own this cd. Congrats on hitting it big chester"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!","review":"I know that this is not Linkin Park and I did not expect it to sound like Linkin Park, but I expected a little more from Chester Bennington. I bought the CD expecting some great songs written by Chester Bennington, boy was I wrong. Now I know why Chester left the band. Not because of differences, it was probably because he couldn't stay awake. This has to be the most boring CD I have ever heard in my life. If you listen to it more than once you risk going into a coma. B12 is the only song that remotely has an upbeat tempo. The rest of the songs on the CD all sound the exact same and have absolutely zero energy. I recommend not wasting your money on this CD unless you need a good sleeping pill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Linkin but still great","review":"Well first off THIS IS NOT A LINKIN PARK CD !! This is Grey Daze Chester's original band. This Cd is great. because it is original.The sound on this Cd is more of STP.And the only part the sounds like Linkin Park is the vocals. It has very good musicianship but not as good as Chester's current band (LP) favorite songs are \\"Soul Song\\" & \\"Sickness\\" these are very good songs(But there's no bad song on here anyway).If you're a chester fan then this CD is also for you because Chester seriously shows of his vocals.Lryically it also differ from Linkin some of the songs are more upbeat and some are still a \\"Chester\\" song.I suggest that if you love linkin park and then get this Cd anyway you can download it buy it whatever just get it.And if you can catch Chester then do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey Daze","review":"i love this CD it is one of my faves.

But $500 for a piece of plastic with a picture on one side, you need to get your head examined. You can just download all the songs and burn them to a cd for free. All your buying is the picture on the one side. $50 would be a really high price for a compact disc. $500 is not even considerable. I wouldn't pay anymore then $25.By the way, I found this cd on another website for $12.75 so don't get ripped off."},{"rating":"2","title":"lphybrid182","review":"not as good as LP but still a kickass cd. i like every song cept just like heroin. my copie is extra special cuz its signed by chester. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Linkin Park Rules","review":"listen to me linkin park is the best group out in the world right now they mix rock with rap with electro they do it like no other band does they are truely the best buy their cd and do the right thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"You see the boys on the cover, you imagine the music...","review":"First place in the Psychobilly charts.

I'm really into perfumes and can be pretty picky about what kinds I like, but in my opinion this is my favorite one! I guess it really depends on your taste/smells you like.

Few periods in history are as fascinating as the conquest of the new world by the Spanish. The courage, cunning,lust for gold and sheer audacity of these men is really quite incredible. Innes is a good storyteller and his questioning of the details and the first person accounts are excellent. The only problem with this book is that it is 30 years old. There has been much in the way of study in the last 3 decades on the subject expanding our viewpoints. That being said, Innes' account of the conquest is a must read for the history buff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"A very good book. It moves along fast and gives you a solid overview of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs by Cortes and the Incas by Pizarro without getting into too much detail.

The story of the Incan conquest is particularly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly comfortable","review":"If you are one of those people who think the phrase \\"comfortable thong\\" is an oxymoron, think again-- this Hanky Panky thong is amazing.

It goes into detail on how large storms such as hurricanes and nor'easters can wreak havoc on coastal communities in New Jersey. It is chock-full-o'damage pictures; the use of corresponding art/drawings depicting a few of the disasters is a unique touch. It does lack corresponding satellite and radar pictures (Bob, S FL's 1948 hurricane, and the Halloween Storm exceptions to the rule); this is the book's only real flaw. The work even gives an example of how a hypothetical storm would impact the area; a nice touch. Historians and weather nuts alike will be in awe and admiration of the effort put forth researchwise to create this work. As they used to say, it would be a \\"bargain at twice the price\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping book with spectacular photographs","review":"This book is gripping, thanks to its well-written descriptions of coastal storms and the spectacular photographs of storm damage. Two of the most frightening and destructive of the many storms described in the book are the Great Atlantic Hurricane of September 1944, which \\"was so powerful it pushed World War II off the front page\\" and the three-day March 1962 storm, a northeaster \\"more furious than any hurricane\\" that ever hit the New Jersey shore, a storm that \\"battered and bludgeoned the shore until...almost every trace of a human presence had been washed away.\\" It happened to be raining heavily when I was reading the chapter about the latter storm; between the rain pounding on my window and the vivid descriptions by the authors (and the storm survivors) of the rising tide sweeping away houses and cutting Long Beach Island into five islands, I admit I was holding my breath in fear and excitement.

Human history (for the literally the entire planet) was changed thereby. The one small drawback of this work may be that the truly profound implications of submarine warfare are not given nearly enough emphasis. Instead the events of the Hunley are sometimes forced to take a back seat to run of the mill movie themes: Dixon's love of his \\"Queenie\\", the Politics of Military generals, etc. Be that as it may, I loved this movie and highly recommend it. Five out of five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You know a movie is good when you loan it out & don't get it back","review":"This is a movie which slipped under the radar when it was released. But since it's release thank God the hunley has at last been found and is on display. Somehow the makers of this movie was dead on about the fate of the Hunley and her brave crew. This was the best performance I have seen from Armand Assante with the possible exception of BLIND JUSTICE. Check that out also. Think about it. A blind clint eastwood type gunfighter. Anyway Donald Sutherland is OK as General Beauregard. But it is the feeling you get of the desperation of the residents of Charleston as the civil war is comming to a climax.

It's about the men who manned the first sub to sink an enemy vessel. Many people don't realize the origins of submarine warfare date back to the Civil War. Although most people that watch this movie will be history buffs, I think many more people would enjoy this movie solely on the strength of its wonderful characters and interesting story. Of all the characters, the Irishman really stood out, along with the eager Private who's determined to be a crew member. Those two will either have you on the verge of laughing or crying. The touches of humor are just in the right places. The best scenes are the ones in the sub, as well as those that feature the interaction between crew members.

I know this was recorded in the '60s and recording technology wasn't what it is now, but still, it seems like no attempt was made to remaster the sound for the CD.

For me, this felt like a total waste of money, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, Too Simplistic","review":"This low-budget, low-quality DVD was too simplistic to be useful for a serious runner who has any background in yoga whatsoever.Much of it was breathing exercises, cat-cow, and other very basic yoga poses. Little of it seemed tailored to runners.I was hoping for something that would discuss which muscles get overly tight from running and which are underdeveloped--and offer yoga poses to counteract these trends. That is, poses that stretch what gets tight and strengthen muscles that aren't used much in running, to restore balance and decrease risk of injury. But the DVD never quite got there.In addition, I was hoping the DVD would include some serious attention to the core, because strengthening the core can improve running and decrease injuries.

There are two categories of images, photographs of actual dissections and colored plates containing explicit detail. As someone who has taken a course in human anatomy that included the complete dissection of a cadaver, I can appreciate the necessity of both types of image.The color images give you the precision needed to identify things and the dissection photos show you what it will actually look like when it is made visible. I certainly would have appreciated having this work of art as I spent an entire semester trying to expose and identify all of the components of a human body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showcases Chris's playing and writing","review":"While Damned the machine is a great album, Metalopolis is the true showcase of Poland's versatility and indistinguishable soloing. This album still holds up to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mega-average","review":"I got Chris Poland's Return to Metroplois because I'm a huge Megadeth fan, and the first two albums with Poland are by far my favorites. This Poland CD is good- as a guitarist I love his playing... but the CD doesn't blow me away. It's kind of like instrumental Megadeth without the edge. Without Dave Mustaine as a partner Poland obviously loses the lyrical/vocal input, but Mustaine's guitar playing also gives Megadeth a sense of reckless abandon. Poland is very by-the-book. I have to respect this CD, but it's not something I listen to a lot. I like EVERY Megadeth album better than this Chris Poland album. Chris Poland is a great guitar player, but that doesn't always translate into a great songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU'V GOT TO BE KIDDING","review":"These revieweres must have their tongues firmly planted in their cheeks or this is the first and only instrumental guitar CD they own. This is heavy metal dross at it's most infuriating. Yes he is fast. BUT he has absolutely no taste or talent, his tone is akin to a chainsaw hitting concrete and not nearly as pleasent. This CD is like snippets of every heavy metal cliche grouped together to form about 4 - 5 mins of the most repetetive noise. The drumming is almost as boring as the guitar playing and even the middle bits ( solos ) would be (junk) on any metal CD.The obligatory accoustic guitar bit is also there and proves that he can't play that either. It sounds like someone practisingscales and shredd like chords, when a drummer walks in."},{"rating":"1","title":"my review","review":"Well we bought it thinking great we need it.

After viewing the show, I found the book and the little butane torch at Williams-Sonoma, and the same evening, I made my first batch. I was amazed at how easy it was. There is one flaw in the book however and that is that Ms. Puente doesn't adjust cooking times for deeper set ramekins. Where she said my custard should be set in \\"40 to 50 minutes\\" actually took more like 60 to 70 minutes, perhaps even longer. For this, I deduct a point in my rating of this book.

I turned it on and I expected the smell because the manual said that would be normal, but the mixer suddenly shut off and that made me very nervous.

The little plastic recorders for around $4 or $5 that the kids in elementary school use can at least make music. This can't. And the kazoo broke. The other parts were fine. Percussion is percussion.

They should take a lesson from Bud Greenspan's videos where some background information is given and there is a build up to the final outcome.

After that I was hooked. I made sure I read every Luanne Rice novel I could get my hands on at the library. All were written tenderly and straight from the heart. But after 'Cloud Nine', her stories and writing continues to go downhill. She churns out novels with a cookie-cutter. You sense that she just wants to get something out. I thought I stumbled upon an author who would give me many years of wonderful reading pleasure but now I don't think so. I'm still hoping Ms. Rice will wake-up and go back to writing the way she used to. 'Dream Country' was so boring, I gave it up after a couple of chapters. I'm now on Chapter 4 of 'Firefly Beach' and it's not much better - I'm pushing myself to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait to get this over with","review":"I found the characters so boring, one dimensional and typical that even they couldn't get me interested in this unbelieveably corny story. I almost finished reading it (I left about 10 pages of filler untouched) only because I was on a vacation and had lugged it with me all the way across the country. Every point and turn in this book seemed too perfectly timed, almost as if the author wanted to make sure that after the first third of the story you knew exactly how everything was going to turn out in the end. Even worse, each of the characters were so melodramatic that I couldn't stop myself from rolling my eyes from time to time.

There were too many coincidences in this book - especially the finding of the lost child. Everything was tied up very nicely in the end - too nicely.

Songs like \\"Lump\\" will keep ya' dancin' and singin' for hours - sort of like a Weird Al album.These guys got their humble start in grunge-heavy Seattle, but quickly proved they had much more to offer than sludgy riffs and depressing lyrics. No, P.O.T.U.S.A. had two talents that other Seattle bands in the early '90s could never grasp or get a hold of: a sense of humor and sheer talent.It's too bad these guys are no longer a working entity; the rock world is much poorer for it. However, \\"Entertainment Tonight\\" reported that these two has-beens from The Presidents of the United States of America are teaming up with a talented hardcore rapper, someone \\"to-be-named-later.\\" Stay tuned, folks.

Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't play it a lot, but it's still cool to have","review":"I'll be honest, I bought this album just because I thought the song \\"Lump\\" was cool(check out the Weird Al parody \\"Gump\\"). This is just a funny album though. I really don't play it very often(hardly ever actually), but I really don't think I wasted my money. As I said I like the song \\"Lump\\" and the song \\"Kitty\\" is pretty cool, but I just always seem to be listening to something else. Basically, this album is just funny because it sounds like a bunch of drunk guys just got together and made a cd that came out pretty good.

But they [need help] enough...yes they sink to that level...that this album is enjoyable.They go a little crazy with the animal imagery and can't decide if they would rather be kids or old men but this album will get you chuckling. They really should not have made it in the \\"music industry,\\" but isn't that perhaps a reason to get just one album like this?

You can call the lyrics, the singing, and even their name silly, but they did what really matters, and that's rock your socks off. Primus might be the better band, but they're in the same ballpark. The big hit here is the contageous \\"Lump\\", and really is the best track. But they also had good songs in \\"We're Not Going To Make It\\", \\"Boll Weevil\\", and the catchy \\"Peaches\\". I think these \\"Presidents\\" are out of office now (and out of print), but they had a good term. Pennies used."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the GREATEST albums...EVER!","review":"what a great album!

But what makes it so incredible is that its sense of humour is witty, tasteful, innocent yet ironic, childish and rebellious yet vain... it's quite an explosive mix!!! The lyrics are simple and so are the tunes, but one can't just help humming these songs all the time! They're so damn funny that whenever I am feeling a bit bored I just play them loud and sing along while jumping on my bed (like I did when I was a kid, a few years ago!)... that's the best of this album... it makes you smile and dance and sing, and feel like a happy little rebellious brat!!! This album is not only a celebration to music but also to all good things life has to offer!!! A true underestimated masterpiece!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hooray!","review":"thank god for a band that doesn't take themselves seriously at all. come on people, humans are just animals, we're not better than anything else on this earth! music doesn't need to be epic and depressing and arty to be good, in fact i prefer music that isn't any of these things. this is a band that knows that being sad won't get you anywhere, so you might as well have fun! buy this album if you know that you have to be a little bit crazy to be happy in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs","review":"A pretty good alternative album. The songs are catchy and melodic, and some songs have a habit of playing over and over in your brain. \\"Lump\\" for instance, also \\"Peaches\\", both radio hits for these guys. Using unusual 'guitars', the two-string basitar and the three-string guitbass (never heard of them before) plus drums, the music is not all-overpowering. I'm not one for swear words in songs, and could do without it in \\"Kitty\\", which is why I give the album 4 stars and not 5. But apart from that, it's really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE FUN!","review":"An album every music lover should own!Does Seattle have somthing in their water or what? It starts rockin' with \\"Kitty\\" and,though each song is unique,keeps the same energy throughout the whole cd. This is one of my favorite cds of all time.My top three of this album \\"Naked and Famous\\",\\"Candy\\" and \\"Back Porch\\"(which reminds me of the Darlings on The Andy Griffith Show...with a little grunge added of course). I wish the Presidents would come back because,like Stevie Ray,they left us wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage","review":"What is this weak, drivel? These chumps think that people should pay money to listen to them screw around? In my humble opinion, it is lyrics which drive rock and roll.

Hey guys, if you treat your music as a joke, it makes your band a joke as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, I have to spoil the party...","review":"Sorry to rain on the parade of 10-ratings here, but this is one of the WORST albums I have ever heard. These songs are so bad, so utterly talentless, and so IRRITATING...I just don't understand. Some of these songs are just plain offensive. Another really bad thing is that these songs are clearly meant to be funny, but where's the joke? If playing your instruments badly is meant to be funny, then I'm not laughing. If the mind-numbingly crap lyrics are meant to be funny, then I'm still not laughing. Whoever wrote the lyrics is obsessed with bugs and little animals, for some reason, which is why we get a bunch of terrible songs about insects driving buggies and fish playing guitars. Maybe I just don't understand what the Presidents are getting at. But you know what? - I really don't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"melodic and smart, celebratory rock","review":"This is one of the most solid, interesting rock albums of the nineties. The guitarist plays on three strings and boy, does he have hooks! Every song on here is tight and jolly rippin'. Put it on the stereo and it seems like a party right away. I like \\"Peaches\\" and \\"Dune Buggy\\" and \\"Naked and Famous\\". This three guys from Seattle are VERY good songwriters and very powerful players. I can't imagine anyone who would not love this album. Except maybe my grandfather, but he's kind of a stiff."},{"rating":"2","title":"In its own simple rocking awesome way, this is genius","review":"If you are looking for progressive rock run far away from this album, because most of these songs were written with only two strings and don't even NEED another. Here is \\"Kitty\\", the greatest song about a cat as far as I know, \\"Lump\\" and \\"Peaches\\" that make you need to get up and dance, while the main riff on \\"Naked And Famous\\" is headbanging worthy.There is a cover of \\"Kick Out The Jams\\" by the MC5 here, and honestly I think this album is more fun than the MC5. \\"We Are Not Going To Make It\\" is a song you have to disagree with, because even if they were only amazing for this album, they definitely \\"made it\\".Sure they're not as serious or heavy hitting as Nirvana, Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, and believe me as I've listened to those bands way too much, I know. But try to listen to this rock that doesn't try to be anything but fun and not be in a good mood, it's impossible. The perfect antidote for being bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful change of pace","review":"I haven't listened to any of the band's other albums; I can only hope they are just as good as this one.The President's style is relaxed and enjoyable. Every song on this CD is catchy and a lot of fun.

It was all in all worse than the first.The run-on sentences have been getting worse, but at least there were less times of Eragon fainting, being knocked out, and falling asleep than that mammoth number in book one.The plagiarism is still present, and I supose that's all I have to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"inheritance","review":"I loved this book.

Oh well - I don't have to let it affect me. I will not be purchasing the third book, although I probably will read the good and bad reviews so I can get a brief summary of the plot. That will probably tell me more than wandering through the banality of listening to it ever would and I will have an entire day of my life available to spend listening/doing something more worthwhile.

I was not disappointed. This is among the best of their work. Traditionally, there is usually at least one barouque piece and one Country piece on any given Dregs album, and \\"I'll Just Pick\\" is by far the best of the Country efforts on any of the other albums I've heard. T Lavitz's piano work is inspiring, and Morse's playing is as great as always. Other notable efforts include Steve's nylon-string on \\"Go For Baroque\\", Andy West's work on \\"Kat Food\\", and the way-cool syncopation on \\"Day 444\\". My only complaint was the price. It totally cheezes me off that they have to import Dregs' albums from Japan!

I continued to get new breakouts, so I wasn't extremely impressed. Although, any improvement is a good thing, and mine is pretty bad. Perhaps it will work better for other people.My other main issue with this product is the way that the capsules are packaged. They're just little clear capsules around Tumeric powder, and they don't appear to be very secure.

If you like teen romance stories, gobble this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master of all Existentialism.","review":"Emerson is one of the greats, there is no doubt about that. The reason that I only gave this book four stars is that this book includes some of the worst of Emerson. His essays on Self Reliance and on Faith in America are timeless classics; however his essay on for example, English traits, was very dry. I do recommend it, but keep in mind that unless you really, really dig Emmerson you may not like over half of this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock H-Bomb Rock!!!","review":"Great raw jump blues from a true original.

Estefan is in glorious voice and she chose songs from places beyond her native Cuba. It's fun to listen to and the variety is astounding. She includes a short description of the songs in the liner notes so for me, a Spanish teacher, it is great for use in the classroom and to broaden my own understanding of Latin American Music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I like this cd 'cause it is a perfect mix between cuban and other latin rythms. Also, the lyrics talk about love and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"a title for your review","review":"Fast paced, a little schizo, a lot of fun. You could kind of guess where the story was going, but there were some twists in the end that were real surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"There must have been a reason for being rejected by the publishers multiple times. Invisible Monsters tries to imitate post modernist literary technique of 'flash forward flash back' and attempts to stylize itself like a magazine about the lives of four charachters. The themes could have been contained in a much better written short readers digest story. Yes, it is about reinvention and liberation. You too can use lots of awkward grotesque imagery and descriptions, and cheap metaphors. Stream of consciousness is not for everybody. Sorry Chuck. Yes, even you fourteen year olds can write better than Chuck. Good luck. Disengage cranium from posterior."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"i really like this book, i also like the song based on the book, it is called time to dance by panic at the disco, it is a really good song, and has a lot of the same lines and words in the song as in the book, i recomend the book and the song. they are both great"},{"rating":"2","title":"| Invisible Monster |","review":"Again as i read these reviews i see more unhappy readers complaining on about Chuck palahniuk books. These people are the poeple that realize what chuck palahniuk is writing about and realize that hes writing about people like them.Invisible Monster is, in an outview, about the media. Its a insite on our lives as humans and it helps show us the falacy in us. Invisible Monster is a book that will open up your ideas and views on the world while at the same time keep you reading from page to page. Its immensly interesting and exciting to the last page..

I think Survivor is the best book of the lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked","review":"The first Chuck Palahniuk book I read was \\"Lullaby\\" which I thought was incredibly twisted and couldn't put down. I then read this one ... \\"Invisible Monsters\\". Once again I couldn't put it down. Suffice to say I am hooked on Chuck and will be reading all his other books. Although I saw the movie \\"Fight Club\\" and lived it I plan on that being my next read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chuck knows how to write","review":"Very exciting, twisting read. Has a certain quality found in Fight Club to it. Palahniuk exhibits his unique style throughout this piece"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing","review":"Palahniuk has an amazing way of opening our eyes to different aspects of life that many people like to shy away from because its not the pretty and pre-packaged serving of society that we are served everytime we turn on the TV or flip through magazines and news.Here he tells the story of a model that due to a deformity now has to live life behind a veil juxtaposing her life before the veil to that of living with the ability to cover herself up and see things in a new light. This is a great novel that will definitely have you looking at the drama of our lives in a new way.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head Trip","review":"One thing that I really like about Palahniuk is the small detail he throws in when he's bashing you over the head. I honestly believe that his charaterization is second to none. I really can't say much about the plot without revealing too much. I read it from start to finish, and it held my attention to the very last sentance. When you find out about the protagonist you'll wonder how he has pulled it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camus s@#ks!","review":"This book is a very quick read that for any flaws, makes up with slick narrative, good concepts and an ability to be amusing while touching despicable subjects.

I liked the whole transgender cover-up thing, and how most of the characters were not as they seemed. I thought this novel was the most nihilistic of Chuck's novels just because it deals with the subject so directly. I favor Chuck's satirical books more, especially his first \\"horror\\" novel- Lullaby. For first time readers, pick up Choke and then proceed to Survivor, Fight Club, and then this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"...though \\"invisible monsters\\" does contain its witty moments...","review":"...though \\"invisible monsters\\" does contain its witty moments, it strongly resembles the anti-corporate, chopped up style of \\"fight club\\" and \\"choke\\". in the end, i'd rather jump off a building than read this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"This book is a great trip. It takes a while to make senseof everyone in the boo, but once you do it is a awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Palahnuk too fast for me.","review":"I don't like criticizing Chuck because I reallyenjoyed a few of his novels (Fight Club beingone of them). But Invisible Monsters is justso... so out there! In a bad way, I mean. OK,his social commentary is excellent and his styleis unique(whatever that means), but the guy writeslike a foot soldier under heavy fire! Maybe...maybe I'm the guy who's a little slow. But likeI said, the guy's too fast for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best","review":"I loved both Fight Club and Survivor. Invisible Monsters, though, pales by comparison to both of those novels. It is very difficult for men to write convincingly from the standpoint of a woman. There were many points in the book when it was blatantly obvious that the author was a man and didn't quite understand what it's like to be a woman. (A woman would probably not think about her breasts being hard when she was holding a frozen turkey against them.) The plot was driven by bizarre turns of fate that, though interesting, seem forced. The only truly brilliant writing in the novel revolves around the protagonist's parents. I've read few other things that equal the genius of the Christmas chapter. Unfortunately, that chapter cannot make up for the rest of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me overdone. Flash. Give me my money back. Flash.","review":"invisible monsters tries to be the female counterpart to fight club and even follows the exact same form (which is really sad and uninspired). the book is full of terrible dialogue and completely unrealistic characters, and palahniuk proves he knows very little about women. I have no idea how this book got a four star average."},{"rating":"1","title":"All style and no substance","review":"Reading this book was mostly a bore. It was easy to read, but now that I've finished I wish I had read a more exciting story with more substance. The writing style is annoying because it jumps back and forth every page. Palahniuk has his own explanation as to why he wrote it this way, but it seems like it's just so he can throw whatever he wants to in there. Practically the whole book is you wondering what the frick is going on and then at the end Chuck just throws in a few *gasp* shockers. These shockers are nothing on par with Fight Club's. It's just like Chuck writing whatever came to his mind that day and then being like, \\"well, this is around 230 pages so I'd better wrap it up now\\". He just throws whatever he wants in there at that point. Such a pointless read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A personal favorite","review":"After I watched Fight Club, I read the book. After I read the book, I read Invisible Monsters. Both are favorites, but, perhaps, because I have a slight familiarity of Palahniuk's style, I found all of the plot twists in this story unsurprising, some even predictable. Because of that I gave this book four stars instead of five.The characters in the story are all vivid and believable. The setting work is pleasantly minimalistic unless the particular moment in the plot warrants otherwise. The plot itself is somehow meandering but also driven. If I were to give it one more adjective, it'd be \\"gritty\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Initial offering from the master","review":"When Kurt Vonnegut sadly passed away, there was a feeling that perhaps satire had died within the modern American lexicon. \\"Invisible Monsters\\" is here to prove doubters wrong and in a big way. Shannon McFarland is the girl everyone knows. The pretty (but not crazy pretty) girl in high school who has aspirations (but not huge aspirations) and an untapped sexual potency that is both highly attractive and innocent at the same time. She rebukes the world created by her model friends and (without spoiling the twist), creates her own Hell in which she thrives quite well. The book is without a plot, as most of Chuck's novels are, but when you dig this far into the character and you find how much you relate to them and how much they don't relate to the world around them, a plot is the last thing you need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Sweet","review":"This was the first C.P. book that I picked up and I was pleasantly surprised. Since reading this one, I have read most of his books and to this day, Invisible Monsters remains one of my favorite books. It is funny at times, but also a very interesting--if sardonic--look at our society and the price we place on beauty. Definitely pick this one up.The others in Chuck's library that I would recommend are Rant, Lullaby, and of course, Fight Club. He's kind of a hit or miss author these days, with Tell-All and Snuff falling way below the standard he set for himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After Fight Club, I was pretty damn excited to get my hands on this book. However, my joy was short-lived. Like other reviewers, I found the characters, and the plot to be formulaic. The only reason I stuck with it to the end, was because I refused to believe the book could be that dull throughout. I was wrong.Instead of allowing me to escape from the drudgery of my bar job, this book actually made me want to get back to work. My employer wishes to thank you, Mr Palahniuk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre journey through fashion and disfigurement","review":"Most readers will instantly either love or hate this novel. To best determine which group you fall into, realize that this book was written by the author of Fight Club. You will likely feel the same about this book as you did about the movie based upon that book.In my case, I liked it quite a bit. The characters are as extreme as the plot. It is meant that way. The plot jumps back and forth and around, often confusingly. Again, this is a device. These devices are effective and done well, but many readers will be turned off by it. More than anything, this is an examination of the nature of fame, beauty, self-esteem, and desensitization to all of it. This is a book that has a point and it makes it effectively.I will probably not become a huge reader of Chuck Palahniuk because I think he is somewhat fixed on style over substance, but I do recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emily - PR","review":"Kay McIsaac, fashion model, is both irritated (because her fashion model best friend Evie Cottrell stole her boyfriend) and anonymous (she wears veils because half of her face was shot away by a freak accident). She's an \\"invisible monster.\\" But her life takes an upswing when Brandy Alexander, a transsexual one last step of surgery away from becoming an entire woman, brings excitement and money back into Kay's life. They plan revenge on Evie, kidnap Kay's two-timing fiance Manus, and go from state to state, entering huge homes that are open for sale and rifling the bathrooms for drugs they can take in large quantities. This is a very odd and amusing book, with much witty and pointed commentary on the subjects of beauty and cosmetic surgery. It also has more plot twists than the average reader can follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Chuck's best","review":"As someone who really liked Fight Club, Rant, and Choke, I found Invisible Monsters to be a real disappointment. I'm sure there's some literary philosophical value to it udner the surface, but the surface of the story was just too boring for me to care. I was really tempted to quit about 1/2 way through but plodded through the rest just to get it over.I found the narrator \\"model\\" to be boring. Even with a face shot off and living a road trip with a transgendered circus, she didn't hold my interest. None of the characters made me care whether they lived or died and so after the opening scene with blood and a fire, I never really could care about the 200 pages of intervening flashbacks before we got back to the opening fire and death again.Maybe that's how Chuck wanted us to feel reading this. There's a lot of naval gazing by the characters and post-teen angst about their awful lives. But I just found it boring. Paint drying boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMFG.","review":"Read this book. Then read it again. THEN READ IT AGAIN. I read it cover to cover the first day I had it- unable to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invisible Monsters","review":"Book came in perfect condition. Very happy i bought it. Its a very different story i highly recommend it to anyone interested in becoming a model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tightly written and mostly entertaining","review":"Man, my wife is driving me nuts right now. Just absolutely n-u-t-s. What were we talking about... oh yeah, Invisible Monsters. I like to periodically roll the dice and pick up a book of which I know nothing substantial. Such was the case with this one; I was not aware that Mr. Palahniuk had written Fight Club (which I have not read, nor have I seen the movie). Invisible Monsters is a brisk read, and for the most part engaging. I thought it became a bit contrived at the end, with all the various story threads being pulled together for a fatalistic climax which seemed a bit too pat for my taste. But that can be forgiven for the fact that the rest of the work is quite satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless","review":"So I watched Fight Club, when I found out this was a book I thought: \\"How can someone be so imaginitive and genius like to write a book like that.\\" I read his book Lullaby and loved it.Invisible Monsters was amazing! I am speechless. I love his stuff so much. I don't see how this guy comes up with this stuff. The novel keeps you moving and you have read on and on to get the full story. I was in shock when I got to the end. My god this is well written.Beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be the detective with this one!","review":"This book for Chuck was drawn out. I read a review where it said the middle hundred pages can be dropped. Well I believe pages 150 - 200 could be thrown out. It is still a great novel but, there it some repetiveness with these pages.It is predictible but, he does have the natural twist at the end that no one would figure out. I recommend this book to any one who liked any of his other novel because of the way it is written. It has flashbacks and flash forwards. It keeps you focused on detail and you feel as though you are the detective trying to solve the case.Read it to solve the mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick = Good?","review":"Sick! This book was just twisted in my opinion. All the characters as well as the author need psychological help. I thought I might need some for the simple fact that I was able to get through the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"With each passing book, Palahniuk gets even stupider. He doesn't seem to be able to make his far-out premises work anymore, and this novel proves nothing but an embarassment to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jump way back to my regretting the purchase of this book","review":"I bought this book before i realized how much i despise Palahniuk, so forgive me.The premise seemed decent, but of course, being Captain Submediocrity, the potential was never met.The whole non-linear story telling is great, sometimes amazing, but not when he does it. It's choppy, forced, and overall monotonous.This book is basically for the ugly kids who want to see a beautiful woman torn to shreds, because that's, like, so ironic and stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"All about the ending","review":"I don't usually like reading about superficial things like fashion models and make-up but this book is so oddly attractive that it takes turns you would never expect. The opening scene got me interested and then it became slow, luckily I stuck with it because it really becomes a great story. I recommend this to everyone, especially if you like Chuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much was explained...","review":"When I found out this was the first book Palahniuk ever wrote (although it's the third to be published.) It certainly has the major Palahniuk theme; the two extremes, in this case of attention, either everybody loves you or no one will look at you. Duality also plays a role.When I first read this, I thought Palahniuk was slipping a bit; \\"Fight Club\\" is a classic and \\"Survivor\\" is pretty close. It's not quite as strong as those two, but since it's his first, that can easily be overlooked.If you go for darkly humorous fiction with a lot of potential shock value, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I read Fight Club which made me want to read more of Chuck Palahniuk's work. I was rather freaked out by Invisable Monsters but at the same time I was drawn to it. It took me two days to read the whole novel and that was a good two days spent. Mr. Palahniuk has a gift. He has a very unique writing style that I can't define and, quite honestly, am glad that I can't. Mr. Palahniuk writes like no other author that I've read and that makes his novel all the more original. This book jumps from past to present to past again. It definitely kept me on the edge of my seat wondering what could possible happen next. It does get pretty descriptive in parts, but everyone should read Invisable Monsters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Messed Up People","review":"The thing that I liked about this book was that it is very emotional. It will have you laughing one minute, only to find out the next that what you are laughing at is so tragic that it makes you want to cry. The problem I have with it is that it doen't have a plot so much as an idea. The narrator tells her tragically redemptive story in such a way that reveals vital information to the reader in surprising ways. There really aren't any \\"plot twists,\\" because the characters know everything when the book begins, it's simply the way that it's presented that makes it surprising to us. This way Palahniuk continually pulls the rug out from under us tends to get a little old. Other than that, it's a good read filled with vivid, off the wall characters as screwed up as you could want them to be. Ultimately it is a redemptive story, and that's what redeems the book itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"suckage","review":"First off this book is supposed to be represented by a female narrator. It however, seems in my opinion like a man. Perhaps because a man did write the book. The supposed twist at the end was lame and not even slightly worth it. It was painful to read the book through. I suppose this is the kinda book that has a strong cult fanbase in which I do not comprehend the wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"very talented writer but shallow subjects","review":"I found the book to be addictive, funny, and extrememly well written...but the characters in \\"Invisible Monsters\\" are shallow and read like campy cartoon characters...a very talented writer who should tackle deeper issues and develop more sophisticated characters..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitting bottom","review":"A popular them in all of Chuck Palahniuk's book. The idea that in order to move beyond society we must hit bottom and do exactly what we are not suppossed to. Whether or not this actully works for anyone (Chuck's characters included) - it's hard to tell. This book in particular uses elements of the fashion world and the famous. A product to the core, the narrator finds herself in search of a personal identity, beyond society and labels, but first she must confront tragety and sacrifice, she must do what she doesn't want..."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting...","review":"Strange story to begin with but it all ties in and makes sense in the end and makes it a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will Make You Feel ALIVE","review":"Chuck Palahniuk writes like Rikki Lee Travolta. They both have this anger and frustration boiling beneath an unsettling calm in their words. It perfectly mirrors that sense of inner turmoil that we have all felt at some point, and some grapple with on a daily basis but peppers it with dark humor. Just as Travolta dissected and brought to vivid life the Hollywood subculture with his classic angst tale \`My Fractured Life', Palahniuk mirrors the vividness with his picture of the fashion world. \`Invisible Monsters' is a rare and fascinating, authentic and justified book that will make you feel alive with emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"... ok, this book might have been good... had it been told in some type of order... but as specified in the first few pages, it was going to be told like a fashion magazine, where everything kept getting switched and there was no chronological sense... this ruined the book for me, because it just ended up giving me a headache... sure there are the funny one liners Chuck Palahniuk's great at, but... the overall story just wasnt very involving... I've read all of his books, and this one is by far the worst... don't pick this one up till you've gotten all of the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"It was full of surprises throughout the entire novel.

The story takes some interesting turns, but for me I found the presentation of a physically damaged fashion model reflective of the nasty, biting, and scratchy world that is professional modelling. A subjunctive I drew from this novel was imagining all those real life models who are emotionally handicapped due to a chronic disposition towards unattainable self-gratification.Nicholas R.W.

Maybe his time has passed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Tricks, Too Little Writing","review":"In the immortal words of Sgt. Hulka, Settle down, Francis. While Fight Club made me laugh and feel immense paranoia at the same time, I think Chuck has taken to creating tricks vs. writing real stories.

This novel cracked me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of Palahniuk, you'll love it","review":"If you are a fan of Chuck Palahniuk, you'll really love this book. If you haven't read any of his books, start with something a little more accessible, like Fight Club or Survivor. This story is so twisted and sick, I have to give it five fat shiny stars. His writing style is also refreshingly brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Palahniuk","review":"I was quite bored with Invisible Monsters and I was a little dissapointed in Palahniuk,although there are some excellent funny moments in this book. Survivor and Fight Club are much better reads with more solid storylines and better characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visible Disapointment","review":"Palahniuk starts his third novel with the same structure as his two previous works, and, for someone who adored the first two books, this felt a little like Palahniuk had found a formula for writing a novel and thus decided to stick to it rigidly. Elements of the novel are good, there are some hysterical set-pieces (the best one being around the dinner table with the narrator and her parents), but otherwise the rest of the novel fell too easily into the same sort of pattern that 'Survivor' and 'Fight Club' developed. The predictability of the narrative also tends to annoy, and because my hopes for a third consecutive brilliant novel were so high, this novel really left me feeling a little cold. Thankfully, Palahniuk's forth novel (which I finished last week) is a masterful return to form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the most important book i've ever read","review":"it should be anyway. While maybe not the most entertaining, definitely the most socially accurate and insightful of chuck palahniuk's books.

I think I wore the grooves out from listening to it so much. I then went a couple of decades without hearing it until my brother got me the CD for Christmas. If you could wear out grooves on a CD, I would be doing that. I never listen to this album just once in a sitting; it's always two or three times. It is filled with beautiful sounds and captivating rhythms and varied styles. And of course, the harmonies are stellar. Some might think I'm overstating here, but I think this is one of the great albums in rock music history. It is beyond me that it failed so miserably in commercial terms. I know I talked it up, but the only person I knew of who knew anything about this album was my brother, who lived in the same house as I and who helped me wear out the grooves on that vinyl.

The individual case studies were simplistic to a degree that prevented them from being interesting. Perhaps as a result of this the author's analysis of the data was also too simplistic to be useful. It is hard to imagine how anyone could profit from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is just bizarre","review":"This book is organized in a very odd fashion. It's like a long, long, 237-page list of bullet points. It's divided into chapters, but while Barash is good at setting up lots of horrendous possible situations, she never provides suggestions, advice or solutions. That is, there are suggestions, but they're just one-liners that don't really make sense.In addition, there's a completely weird paragraph at the beginning of Chapter 3 that just turned me off to the whole book. I won't type out the whole thing, I'll just paraphrase: A woman is jealous of her husband's ex-wife. She starts following him around, and sure enough, he's meeting her at a hotel. Then she said \\"My uncertainty was the demise of our marriage.\\" Whuh? Nooo. She caught her husband cheating, and HER UNCERTAINTY was the problem? This author must listen to a lot of Dr. Laura if that's how she thinks it works!I wish I could return this book. I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distressing and sad","review":"The Second Wives book recounted one horror story after another, making people's lives seem more like bad editorials or soap opera dramas. I purchased the book with the intent it would shed new light on an issue faced by many women throughout time, being the \\"second wife\\" and \\"stepmother\\". Unfortunately it deepened my worries and anxieties! My suggestion, talk to your husband, seek out the advice of a well trained therapist and create the life you want.

Unfortunately, there are no pearls of wisdom here. Sorry Ava. The text is very simple, the content is barely more than what common sense will tell you.

If I missed anything like a dramatic change in prose style (I stopped halfway through the book) then I apologise.I found the positioning of 'Ambient' to be (as other reviewers have mentioned) an attempt at lying somewhere between cyberpunk and Burgess's classic Clockwork Orange. However in terms of actual implementation, the prose irritated me beyond all belief. The characters speak like drunken yodas. Don't get me wrong I'm fully in favour of taking dialects to the extreme to make a point in literature (Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh being an exemplary example) but I found page after page of this annoying doublespeak too much to bear.When other reviewers say \\"this is a hard book to read\\" they are damn right.

Sick and Great!","review":"After reading this you'll never find me wandering around the woods alone. Especially if I hear a dog in the woods! This book is so gross and disgusting but at the same time funny and the characters are great. I read this nonstop.The plot is old but it works because Thomas writes good dialogue and characters. The story is about two kids, two best friends, who get captured by an insane serial killer and get locked in his basement. He tortures them in ways I can't even describe. But the first half of the book is spent letting you know the two friends in their hometown so that you actually care about them when the carnage begins. Trust me, you really will route for them, not like in those lame horror films when you just want the screaming teenagers to die. The book definitely pushes the limits of gross horror but it works.

Reading some reviews I was expecting a pure gore fest, but what I found was a story that was a page-turning suspense thriller that I just couldn't put down.

Absolutely yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great horror novel","review":"This book actually should come with a warning because it is much more graphic then most horror novels and I can see why some people would not want to read this or get nightmares after they do read it.The story caught you up from page one, the author makes you really fall in love with Roger and Tooth and you really care about what happens to them. The torture in this book made me cringe and want to put the book down at times but then again I also could not tear myself away from reading because I wanted to know what would happen next.The end was not what I was hoping for but the little surprise at the end made me happy with the ending.This is a book that will stay with me for a long time and for this being the authors first book, he did a great job at it and can't wait to read more of his books.If you like horror and you can deal with a book being very graphic pick this up, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It can always get worse","review":"I can't remember the last time I read a book cover to cover in one sitting before, especially starting at 9:00 at night, but this book had me drawn in from the start.It starts of nice enough, lulling you into a false sense of security by dealing with the sort of thing that we can all relate to: going back home after a long absence and catching up with an old friend.Then, with one simple line describing the sound of someone screaming in the woods, the glass shatters and you're sucked through the rest of the book at a mind numbing pace.This book was very well written, very disturbing, and if you think you've got the stomach for it, I can't recommend it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY %@#*!!!

Mathias Alexander, creator of the Alexander Techinque. But what I liked most about reading it was its wonderfully fresh perspective on age-old human problems. For thousands of years, philoshophers have pondered the human condition from the standpoint of someone sitting under a tree. What Dimon sees is that perhaps our greatest gift is our ability to decide to get up. From his perspective, how and where we go tells us more about who we are than we might ever have thought possible. I urge anyone curious about life and eager to improve his or her own to give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"an Alexander book for doctors and psychologists","review":"Where F. M. Alexander's own writings read almost like philosophy, Dimon's book is more grounded, with the feel of a psychology textbook. It's a distinctly objective approach, an argument for the Technique with the logical impact of a medical journal.Cautious or skeptical people who hear the success stories of others who have overcome physical problems with the Alexander Technique say, \\"OK, so what is the technique? How does it work?\\" It can be hard to get a straight answer - it's a complicated issue, and in any event the only way to really understand the Technique is to experience it for yourself with a teacher. If an intellectual introduction is what you're after, though, and if your approach to this sort of thing is more empirical, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"The two of us tried to read this book but none of us has finished yet. Quite boring to be honest and the repetitions make it difficult to understand. I think that the writer has a point but he was not able to translate it into words. As a lot of books nowadays it is so full of repetitions that after a while one doesn't even know what the goal of the book is. Saying the same thing over an dover again is not a good way to keep people interested till the end of the book. Sorry, I can't recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introductory Textbook","review":"As a linguistics student at UCSB, I must say that this has been one of the better textbooks that I've had.

Unless you plan to practice speech pathology in Scotland, I would skip this one.

The inclusion of European examples is especially confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"too dreamy","review":"I was so excited to get this book, because I love the dance form Authentic Movement and this book is all about its founder using it for her own healing.

I have listened to a lot of metal and this does absolutely nothing for me. Maybe it's the production - all the sounds are smoothed over so much that there is no punch to the guitar, or anything other than Doro Pesch's voice. All We Are is pretty good, but everything else reeks of generic 80's metal - from songs about metal (\\"Metal Tango\\") to lyrics likeI have no mercyI tell no liesI kiss the strangersAnd then watch them die(\\"Kiss Of Death\\")there are a lot better 80's metal albums for your money's worth. If you are a fan of old-school metal or hair metal, and don't mind elements of the other in your music, then give it a listen. Otherwise, pick up something like Powerslave or British Steel for some good 80's metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like All We Are...","review":"Save some money and download it as a single track somewhere.

I couldn't disagree more. Underrated is the word to describe this album. Its fun, its fast, and Blackmore's riffs and soloing are as good as they've ever been. Gillans vocal performance is excellent too. The riffs to the title track, Lick It Up, Anya, Ramshackle Man, One Man's Meat - how can you not think this is great Deep Purple music? I just don't understand why this one isn't put on par with Perfect Strangers, because I think it is almost as good. The Battle Rages On is the best DP song from the 80s till today - simply a powerful, incredible track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Purple's best post-reunion album","review":"This is my favorite of the post-reunion Deep Purple - and it's hard to compare to the 70's days, as it definitely has a more updated, 80's metal sound (although this came out in the 90's - but \\"90s\\" metal implies to me power, death/black, grunge, nu-metal, etc. - this is still rock-based, guitar-riffing, metal like Judas Priest, Scorpions, Iron Maiden, etc.) The songs are great, the musicianship is great - you've still got (for the last time) the classic \\"Machine Head\\" lineup of Gillan, Glover, Blackmore, Lord, & Paice.

In comparison, \\"The battle rages on\\" falls flat since many of the songs are at best forgettable, with exception of the title track: \\"The battle rages on\\" and \\"Anya\\". Maybe the blues-boogie inspired \\"Ramshackle man\\" and the slower \\"Solitaire\\" are above average but there's too many fillers on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last hurrah for Ritchie Blackmore","review":"This is a pretty steep dropoff from \\"Perfect Strangers\\" and \\"House of Blue Light\\" which were already a steep dropoff from the glory days of the early 70's. Blackmore seems to be about out of ideas (confirmed by his subsequent bailout and move to acoustic Renaissance music) and Gillan's vocals are multi-tracked and mixed into oblivion. Nevertheless, fans of the classic lineup will find a few nice moments here. The title track and \\"Anya\\" are about as good as anything they did in the 80's, but the remaining tracks are mostly uninspiring (and sometimes difficult to tell apart)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mach II Never Fails","review":"Let me make this plain and clear. This is a classic Mach II Deep Purple CD. That being said, if you like In Rock, Fireball, Machine Head, Who Do We Think We Are?, Perfect Strangers and House of the Blue Light then you will LOVE this CD. The lyrics are clever, the guitar is classic Blackmore and the rhythm section of Paice, Lord and Glover is as solid as ever. The production is crisp and what more do you need? Never get tired of listening to Anya, Twist in The Tale, Ramshackle Man and Nasty Piece of Work. Nothing wrong with the other tracks *(except One Man's Meat) either. With the garbage that passes as rock these days you owe it to yourself to hear some \\"real\\" rock Gods. Deep Purple Mach II are among the best.

It states in the book that the dragon can only fly 100 miles a day.... come on! By his size and wing span he covers a 100 miles in less then 2 hours. Birds can fly 150 miles a day! The estimates of the distances, time, food, water etc. do not match mathematically. The author also wants us to believe that Lawrence is going to allow this \\"shady character\\" to lead them across the dessert even after realizing that the orders from command are in question because they would have been written before they had left China. The logic of the story falls apart and there is no depth to the story line. The first book was great, the 2nd okay, and this 3rd is horrible. Should I try number 4?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't care any more...","review":"I would have given the first book 4 stars for being creative and original, with decent writing. All of that went downhill in the second book, which would have rated 1 star. This book is 2-3 for me; ending with 2 because I had to force myself to read the last ~70 pages just to get to the end... only to find it doesn't really end.On the bright side, at least some things happen in this book compared to the second. And there isn't the disjointed pace. But the characters have no depth and you don't really care about any of them (quick, name a crewman aside from Granby), and even the leads have lost their interest by this point. The foreshadowing of the Prussian's military outcome is so heavily done that each battle is painful to read, waiting for the shoe to drop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"These books are amazing! I read the entire series through and now I am re-reading them all again before the next instalment comes out in August. This is Master and Commander meets dragons! Naomi Novik writes with elegance and knowledge beyond any other historical fiction account I have ever read. At times the wording is tidious but all in all a great book with dynamic characters and an intriging plot! If you like history and fantasy but don't want another boring dragon-rider plot, this is the series for you! It is witty imaginative and fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"In the first two books, Novik did a wonderful job and exploring the relationship issues and prejudices existing, not only involving a smart talking dragon, but between people, cultures and countries. All of that was left behind in this attempt at war and strategy. I was bored and struggled to get through the pages at this attempt at military strategy - even with a dragon like Temeraire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure and characters","review":"Novik has another hit on her hands with this book. The characters she has created continue to evolve and breathe a life of their own. Indeed, the reader's (and Capt. Lawrence's) understanding of dragons grows as we encounter more of them, as well as different types. This make sense as Lawrence had almost no knowledge, so we can learn together.The story in this novel feels a little like the middle of the bigger story, staring at the end of one adventure and ending without great resolution. While this is not unexpected, a little more of a climax would have been nice.That said, I truly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Powder War--with the keg about to be lit.","review":"This book makes me want book 4 all the more. Temeraire has picked up some oddly liberal ideas during his time away from the discipline of the British Dragon Corps, and intends to bring them back to England. This can't help but cause trouble (I am waiting for him to ask why women, who are trusted aviators in the Corps, don't have equal rights anywhere else).And the war with Napoleon (now himself in possession of a dragon who hates England, Temeraire, and most everybody more or less in that order) is heating up. I really want book 4 _now_. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreary disappointment, just one long string of depressing battles","review":"after the exuberance of the first book in this trilogy, His Majesty's Dragon, I found the 2nd book (Throne of Jade) to be a boring series of political arguments and this 3rd book to be a boring series of weary battles. OK, the feral dragons lightened it up a bit, but it was, overall, a depressing book with no satisfying resolutions. The author is obviously more interested in keeping the franchise going than in pleasing her readers or taking care of her characters. Enough already! If I hadn't fallen in love with Temeraire enough to keep slogging on, I would never have finished this book. Buy it used!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Butterfly Box","review":"Santa Montefiore has again enthralled me with her writing. She has a tremendous gift of bringing her characters to life in a very real way. She also brings very real human emotions to light, & so one feels for Federica, Helena, Sam, & others so affected by one man's selfish attitude to life.I have found this book very hard to leave at times,so sad to finish, & now just want more & more of Santa's writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"On fire!","review":"I bought this book for my brother since he paints flames on cars as a hobby.

The basket is a nice addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Be sure to measure your doorway clearances carefully. The walker would not fit through many doorways, making it useless.You should be advised you need to ship this back at your OWN expense, plus they charge a ridiculous 18% restocking fee.

Luckily we are not depending on it to get into all rooms in my home, it is more for outdoors for us, but you should measure your doorways first if you need it indoors. It rolls well outside on grass."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than I bargained for","review":"After looking at many rolling walkers and reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this one. The seat is extra-wide to accommodate me, and I can even fold it up and put it in the trunk of the car. The BIG downside to this walker is that the overall height (the wheelbase to the seat) is NOT adjustable, only the handles. When I need to sit I must put on the breaks and then tiptoe up to shimmy onto the seat. Then, when I sit fully on the seat my both feet swing freely, I'm 5'5\\" tall. Since this is extra-wide, I have found that it does not go through a few of the doors in my house. I would heartily recommend it to tall plus-size persons and you might want to check the opening measurement of your doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight, but strong with a great price.","review":"It is light enough so that you can move it if you need to, but rolls so easily that you don't need a lot of energy to use it.

My only complaint is that it is a little too wide to fit through some doors. But if you are a large person, the X-wide seat and weight copacity is great and an easy compromise for it's width."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy!","review":"This rollator came with the right hand brake missing. I called the manufacturer, the distributor and Amazon. None of them could supply the missing piece and wanted me to pack it up and they would pick it up and reship. I figured if it was that difficult to get an integral part for this rollator, I didn't want it and just told them to pick it up. I ended up purchasing the Nova Mini Mack from a different manufacturer and was very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"All parts were in the box although I can see that they were not packaged well and that this could lead to missing parts due to the pieces falling out during shipping. There were also complaints about the seat being high. The measurements are listed and it's up to you to make sure that you know what you are getting.Double check your measurements before purchase as the seat height is not adjustable. - It's your own fault if you didn't verify the product before ordering.The best part about this rollater compaired to the previous model is the basket, you can hook it on the front as well as place it under the seat. A big improvement in my book.This is a great lightweight heavy duty rollater. It is meant for larger people so keep that in mind when ordering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unwanted Company brings unwanted trouble!","review":"Clean & sober for 6 years, Munch Mancini has her own limo service & is glumly looking at the post-graduation slump of summer.

This is not Evanovich...who at least let's the sexual scenes fade to our imaginations.I was sooooo disappointed in this book...after all the hype...too sick for me to recommend to my readers in my review column.

She seems to be suggesting that we should be striving to make our babies as independent as possible, as early as possible. She claims that her philosophy is the most natural way to raise a child, but she encourages parents to stop relying on their natural instinct. For example, she is against picking up a crying baby. She is against cosleeping.

Did Grape Nuts cancel the commercials? No! They made even more variants. They must have decided that being the worst was more advantageous than being just one in the crowd. The same thing happens here. This sequel takes a bad first movie and makes it worse. The main character was not endearing from the jump, so the movie makers made him even more annoying this time around. It was understandable when he made bad decisions as a closeted man, but as an insecure boyfriend, he really scratches the chalkboard with his nails. Other people have noted that the men in this flick are not as hot as in the first one. I'd add that this sequel had fewer men, not just less attractive ones. I can only assume that the movie makers and the cast wanted to make something so terrible that one has to work hard to erase it from his memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Like The Cover","review":"Cinderella's second album is not worth listening to.

It is also one of those rare albums that one can enjoy every song on.The amazing thing is that it is only Cinderella's second album...and a mere prelude to what Keifer accomplishes later, in Heartbreak Station and Still Climbing.

The bluesy sound of \\"Long Cold Winter\\" makes it stand out from anything released in its time, and although it lacks the intensity and virtuosity of Guns N' Roses, it sounds far more authentic than many contemporaneous efforts (Warrant, Poison, Bon Jovi, Winger, etc.). Tom Kiefer is a gifted songwriter, and the best tracks on this disc (including the intensely bluesy \\"Long Cold Winter,\\" the upbeat Wanderlust-ode \\"Gypsy Road,\\" and the epic \\"Don't Know What You Got Till It's Gone\\") still hold up after a dozen years. Admittedly, doing hard rock by way of the blues was hardly an original idea -- a decade and a half earlier it had already been done by Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith, and Cinderella is not in their league. Still, this is a good effort, worth purchasing for fans of straight-out, unpretentious guitar rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band","review":"Cinderella made a classic with this one.

Unfortunately, for those who are already living the gambler's lifestyle there's little in this book they don't already know.

The dictionary is pretty good and reasonably comprehensive. However, it uses the MobiPocket 4.6 as the reader software. It never tells you that anywhere, I just happened to download this sofware earlier and recognized it. This reader is horrible for a dictionary. When you try to make the letter \\"t\\" or \\"i\\" using Grafitti it triggers the go back action. Also if you try to delete a letter it triggers the go back action. It also doesn't take advantage of the full screen. These shortcomings seem to all be addressed in the new 4.7 reader but it is not clear yet if I have to buy the new reader (which costs just about as much as this card) and if I do if I can even use the new reader with the card's databases. It was inexcusable to marry this dictionary to an inappropriate reader and furthermore to not disclose that anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is a MobiReader?","review":"Sure, the dictionary has a lot of words, but the problem is finding them. The search screen is extremely jumpy when using the graffiti interface. I can rarely get more than a couple letters in the search box before the program jumps off to the wrong word.Now my graffiti skills are pretty good; I don't have this kind of problem with other Palm programs. The dictionary's search program (MobiReader?) doesn't want to wait for t's to be crossed and i's to be dotted. So a search for 'tea' and you'll end up with the first word starting with 'L'. I've resorted to using the popup keyboard screen to enter words.

The dictionary has lots of function but doesn't work well with my palm. Everytime when I try to write a \\"t\\", it will go back to the previous screen instead of having a \\"t\\" on my word. And the software itself is not easy to use. After I have used it for a few times, it started to crash my operating system everytime I try to open the dictionary or insert the dictionary sd card to my palm. If you own a Zire 72, my best suggestion is not to get this dictionary. I returned mine and got another different one; it doesn't have as many functions as the Merriam-Webster's, but it works great and easy to use.

You can click on one of the words in the definition and you get a little pop up window that allows you to view that defintion and then return to the previous word or name or whatever.

Overhead does a wonderful blend between heavy prog and symphonic prog. If you enjoy bands such as RPWL, Transatlantic, Knight Area then Overhead is for you! Switching back and forth, almost seamlessly between melodic symphonic parts and heavier guitar parts in most of their songs, their longer tracks are never boring or repetitive. They do not get quite as heavy as Dream Theater and are more melodic than Porcupine Tree, but definitely not metal prog. Vocals here are top rate (in English) which tend to be the bane of a lot of progressive groups. They have a nice well rounded sound that I believe will please symphonic prog lovers as well as those who want to rock out a bit more. Between \\"Metaepitome\\" and \\"And We're Not Here After All\\" I would probably choose the later, but both are excellent.

We are supposed to believe that Hank is a \\"normal, good\\" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it.

I will not give away the plot but I will say the book is much more violent than the movie, and the descriptions are so detailed that I cringed in some parts. I am giving this book 2 stars only because Scott Smith is an excellent writer, and the story he created here is amazing, but I believe that it is too violent, unnecessarily so.

While movies usually never measure up to a great book (Seabiscuit comes to mind) this one is an exception. Because the story is so compelling, I think the format may be irrelevant. The best movies, the best books (fiction i mean) have unforeseen twists and developments that make us flinch and then say, 'i should have seen that coming!' This is a moral thriller that reveals the darkest side of the human heart--read it or watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Scott -- WRITE SOMETHING AGAIN!","review":"As I read this book I knew they's make a movie out of it, but also knew they could never capture the incredible writing of the author on film. They tried, but as expected the book outdid the movie by an order of magnitude. This is just an amazing read.

There were many nights where i would stay up til 4 or 5 in the morning simply because i couldn't put it down. The characters are all well developed and real.

There are too many good books out there to waste my time reading this garbage. I am so amazed that such a great idea could be turned into such a poor end-product. The writing was surprisingly amateur-ish. This I could have tolerated if it weren't for an inane plot punctuated by the ignorant acts of supposedly \\"typical\\" people. I didn't buy any of it.

There was no emotion involved in any of them. Sarah instructed her husband, Hank, to kill at the drop of a hat to save their skins.

Every time there was a crisis Hank and Sarah came up with a plot to kill someone within minutes and carried it through without any forethought or remorse.

Boy, what were they smoking? I can't remember a more unpleasant reading experience in a long time. There is no one in the book to like. The characters are simple minded and lacking in any real form of self awareness. Their behavior is inexplicable and stupid in the extreme. Given characters that one doesn't care about, the plot becomes irrelevant. One doesn't care what happens to them. Actually, one is only too painfully aware of what is going to happen, because these yahoos clearly can't think beyond the end of their noses.Very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"FREE VIOLENCE","review":"THey softened the history in the movie. I was shocked by the free violence. THe scene in which Hank kills an old woman in a store is totally unecessary, and the ridiculous destiny of his daughter (an accident which crippled her) has nothing to do with the history, as if, for having murdered seven people, a crippled child would make things even.

The situation these characters find themselves in is indeed an interesting one. However, the story built around it is shallow and predictable. The main characters are simply too stupid to make this a plausible story. It is far too incredible and frustrating at times, which makes this a very tedious read. If you can, avoid this book and check out the movie instead...at least it's over in two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synonym for simple is DUMB","review":"I'm only about halfway through this book. I'll probably end up finishing it simply because so many people have raved about it. But so far I HATE it. I have absolutely NO sympathy whatsoever for any of the characters. None of them. I would never want to know any of them in real life. I don't care what happens to them. Perhaps, in a way, this makes Smith a talented author. The characters do seem real - it's just that they're repulsively simple themselves.

The characters didn't seem all that realistic to me because almost all of them handled cold blooded murder as if it was totally OK, as long as they got to keep the $4 million and didn't get caught.Yeah, it had its thrills and it was fun to read, but in the end, the characters were in the exact same position they were before they found the money. Nothing, when you think about it, happened, except for pointless murder.I personally think that this book was a waste of my time.

The plot was illogical, but after a while became predictable. The mood is dark and claustrophobic, which would be tolerable if the plot were not so silly. The characters were initially well drawn, and the writing is strong, but these strong points can not overcome the spirallingly predictable plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smith gets it half right.","review":"I admire writers who put their characters in difficult situations, ones where they are not immediately \\"likeable,\\"--and applaud writers who, despite these difficult circumstances, can create empathy (not to be confused with \\"sympathy\\") for those characters. Smith gets it half right. Yes, the situation is difficult, the protagonist morally bankrupt, but Smith fails miserably in his attempt to make us give a damn. Intentionally or not, this reader despised the protagonist (and pretty much everyone else involved in the \\"plan\\") from the moment he commits the first murder. The very weak rationale the protagonist (and Smith) supplies in an attempt to justify his extreme actions falls utterly flat in the face of murder. When a writer loses his readers so early in a long novel, he's got a major fight on his hands to win them back. Sadly, Smith loses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense will kill you","review":"I'm not a reader at all really. I'm your average teen playing video games. My mom picked this book to do my book report. This book just keeps leading you on. The suspense is great. It makes you wonder. The book about is about friends you can't trust with money and you are trying to hide the money from the police. They found money in a downed plane, that's all I will say about the book. What would you do. The reason it was not a 5 is because the ending was to fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"A white knuckle page turner cover to cover.","review":"I really think Scott Smith did an outstanding job on this book. I can say he kept this reader on the edge of my seat from cover to cover. It was difficult to put the book down, and very exciting to pick up again. There were times during this book that it felt like the author had really lived the story he was telling. The realism of the events which unfolded during the course of the book were were surprizing, and unpredictable. This fact was what I liked best about the book. I feel there is nothing worse, while reading a book, than to be able to predict what is going to occur next. This was the first book I have read by Scott Smith, I look forward to his next book. I feel if his next book is even 50% as good as A SIMPLE PLAN he will have another best seller on his hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great debut","review":"First of all, I must say it~s no very frequent that a debut novel be adpated to a movie as was the case with this one.

I bought this book after watching the movie, and loving it, but the book took a completely different toll. The book started out great, until Hank went on a killing rampage. Sarah continued to egg him on, not seeming to care a wit about the death of Jacob. The ending was the worst yet. I thought it would be all over, Hank going home to burn the money, but he decided to claim a couple more victims. After the scene at Lou's house, I lost all respect for Hank, which I did have watching the movie. Maybe I'm just bitter watching the movie before reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SIMPLETON'S PLAN would be a better title.","review":"Did the other reviewers read the same book that my husband and I did?

The main characters in this book are corrupted by greed right after the story starts. They commit crimes that are so horrendous that there will be no doubt in your mind that they will have to pay for them, but they never do, and they are never redeemed. I read this book with a sense of dread that what appeared to be predictable actually would be. And sure enough, it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say No ~ It's That Simple","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book as the plot sounded really interesting. I managed to slog through one unredeeming chapter after another before finally finishing it. The plot was so absurd as to be laughable. The \\"twist\\" at the end was predictable from the very first chapters. And honestly, Hank and Sarah deserved everything they got in the end. The only sympathetic characters were the dog and the baby who, along with most every other character in the book, ended up in Hank's orbit of destruction.

The only thing more disheartening than reading this book is reading the great reviews it got. Apparently I am in the wrong, but I always thought a book with a weak plot, poor character developement and an annoying writing style deserves poor reviews. My favorite line, the narrator describing his four day old daughter: \\"[she] had rolls of fat beneath her chin and pudgy little hands attached to her arms.\\" The writer must have had his brain detached from his head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many people liked this book?","review":"I was a bit disappointed that it was not as thrilling as it was publicised.

I must disagree, wholeheartedly, with the other reviewers. I forced myself to finish this book only with the hopes that it would end the way it should...it didn't. The characters were shallow so the pages had to be filled with senseless and repeated violence. Unfortunately, the chain of events became so predicatable that the book should be renamed Simple Plot for Simple Minds.

Apparently just the idea of free money is enough to intrique most people. Every main character was incredibly stupid, always choosing the very last course of action any normal human being would. I\\"m very glad I picked up a used copy for a quarter, but I still think I overpaid. Re-reading the reviews convinced me not to bother finishing this boring nonsense, a highly unusual action for me. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ha!!","review":"All I can write is \\"Ha!!!!\\". How this one guy can completely SCREW up his objective is downright hysterical. The movie did this book NO justice, but the book itself was a super fun, super easy read. Not a page turner, but one you WILL not regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thin line between good and evil.","review":"The book starts out with a great intro, and from there there is no stopping to the madness. I like it when an uather takes the human condition to its extreme. How suddenly killing would be so easy compesation to our securities. how our inner dysfunctional conflict are burried deep with and would only arise for the most superficial thing on earth, in this case:MoNY.A lot of people will be skeptical. But it is a one of a kind thriller looking at people with a chance to change and reach their high castle dreams over night, discovering that it is not about the source of change. It is about who they really are.The line between good and evil is really thin.Great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-fetched and disappointing","review":"I was so looking forward to this book after reading all the positive reviews, but it was just completely implausible from beginning to end. I enjoy reading so much that I very seldom DISlike any book. That tells you what a let-down this book is. At least now I can save my money when the movie comes out. (Seems like it will make perfect \\"summer blockbuster\\" fare.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"If you want a book that won't allow you a moment to set it down then this is the book for you. A little violent but this aspect could not be watered down and still have the same effect. Excellent, excellent story telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil things that normal people do","review":"This book was dark and depressing but a fast read and well-written. It's a \\"What would you do\\" type book that really got me thinking and scheming with my boyfriend about how we'd do things differently. Overall, I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely brilliant","review":"It's amazing what a person will do for money, and the guy ended up with nothing but the shame of what he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulled me through in two sittings!","review":"Overall this book is a great read. The unexpected twists and turns kept me reading anxiously. It gave me a dark and overcast feeling the entire time I read it, which is obviously the sign of a good writer. Strangely enough I found this book after reading The Ruins, and I must say this is much better. The only reason I couldn't give it a full 5 star rating is that there was overall an element of unrealistic character development. The baser side of mankind was truly explored, but I cannot see how a man who has no history of violence suddenly becomes a robotic killer and his wife just goes along with it like it is a part of his job. The lack of compassion and total self preservation is something I hope isn't common just because money is the end result. BUT, don't let that stop you from reading this book. It is worth the few hours invested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!","review":"I am a 12 year old male and I read this book in 3 days. Not because I didn't have anything to do but because I simply could not put it down. This is a great book that shows how one bad thing can lead to another. I know that everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but to give this book a 1 star rating is absolutely absurd! The characters were normal people, yet they commit such horrible crimes and do not hate themselves for it. If you have not read this book, do yourself a favor and read it. You will really feel for the characters and get wrapped up in the twisting plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great board","review":"I purchased 3 of these boards for a family vacation at the Gulf. They were a little stiffer than I remembered Morey boards being when I was growing up in the 80's, but they worked quite well.

Personally, I believe that this has a lot to do with the way these boards are made.Would absolutely recommend getting these as starter boards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kelsius missed the mark...","review":"The beach chair felt flimsy and cheap. The canopy straps were attached in such a way as to make it look way lopsided when attached to the chair. Was that designed in?

All in all, a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun in the sun.","review":"OK the concept of a small chair that reclines got to me. But what you get is a chair that feels like you are always in the reclining position.Also the stitching at the front of the arm rest near the cup holder has undo stress due to the design of the chair, mine came undone on the first trip. Its cheaply made so the price for this chair is also a drawback . On the plus side it is a very light chair to carry around and easy to pack, but knowing what I know now I'd buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light not necessarily better","review":"While I was impressed with the video about this chair and was excited to get it, the chair became a disappointment after only using it twice. The trim on the arms tore through and it really does not slide up and down in the sand. Next time I will carry the extra weight and get a chair with wooden arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might have been nice, but Amazon couldn't get it together","review":"I ordered this chair twice, and both times Amazon failed to send the UV canopy with the chair. I eventually sent both chairs back. I did use one of the chairs at the beach and found it to be rather uncomfortable. The sling design is kind of cool, but you end up sitting right at the front edge of the chair. It might be different on a hard surface, but on the sandy beach, it wasn't all that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy - it's a waste of money","review":"I purchased a reclining beach chair w/canopy. It broke the first time I tried to use it. The canopy was useless and the rod burst through the material when I tried to put it on the chair. When the metal frame is inserted into the webbing on the arms, the frame ripped right through the webbing. The chair is way too small for a grown adult and trying to repack the useless canopy is tricky and the illustrations are not clear enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless canopy","review":"The chair is way too small for a grown adult.

Amazon overnighted me a replacement and the second chair came with no canopy. The canopy is the major reason I wanted the chair because I am fair skinned and burn easily.The chair is very small and not meant for tall or anyone larger than a child.

A+ customer service but not a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Company stands by thier product","review":"We bought 2 of these chairs (to replace 2 older ones just like them, but with mesh) about a years ago. There were some comments that the \\"tube pockets\\" on the end of the arm wrests were busting through where the arm tube goes. Figuring it was a manufacturing flaw that was probably fixed, I went and ordered them. Guess what? After a year of using them 3 of the 4 arm \\"pockets\\" ripped open, no longer holding the tubes (no, we're not huge people. I'm 160lb and my wife is 120lb... don't tell her I told you, she'll kill me). So today I called customer service and they are sending us two new ones! For free! If these new chairs rip, I'll be pissed, but when a company stands by their products they deserve a 5 star rating in my book.

I definitely reccommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chairs, very comfortable","review":"These chairs are everything they say. Light weight, easy to carry, very comfortable.

We used them again this year and both years we have consistently had people asking us where we bought them, to the extent of it being somewhat annoying... :)This chair is very well built.Folds up into a small/light back pack, and is easy to transport. Although you should practice folding it back up at home before you drink too much beer.Unfolds easily, and is simple to set up.Sun shade is perfect for the hot Texas sun, although wind makes the shade a little unstable.Arm rests have a drink holder and a zip pocket.It would be great if Kelsyus made some small fold-able tent poles for the sun shade to stabilize the arm rest lines on breezy days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, terrible execution","review":"This thing is junk. Looks nice and sleek but is really poorly built with plastic at critical areas. Broke on first use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backpack chair...overall good value","review":"The chair is light and portable and only takes an associates degree in engineering to assemble at the beach. Overall I am extremely pleased with the purchase and would buy again. Here are a couple of drawbacks though. The chairs base is narrow in the back so it can be a little unsteady. The reclining mechanism gets buried in the sand so you have to manually force that action. Don't be fooled into thinking the canopy is blocking the sun...wear sun screen...a personal experience :( Finally, put a small towl on the back inbetween you and the material. The edges of the fabric can cut into your back. Again, nothing serious and I would buy again. It would have to take a lot more than this to out weight the chairs portability! They drew rave reviews from beach goers as well.Phil"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight and easy to transport.","review":"The chair is really comfortable and lightweight.

The only songs I really get into on this cd are \\"The Right Stuff\\", a classic get down romp with Vanessa tellin' it like it is, and \\"Dreamin'\\" a romantic ballad with smooth vocals. I was dissapointed to find out that \\"He's Got the Look\\" is the original album version, not the video version they released in the 80's. The video version has re-recorded vocals, and a better beat with better breakdowns and some added samples. The album version has sloppy beats and some of the vocals are pretty weak as well. The other tracks on this cd are ok, but sound pretty dated, but if you want that 80's sound, you sho do have it on the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allright, allright!","review":"Some of these reviews are hard to read, lmao. Granted this was the 80's and I'm glad I was born in 81. Because some of these beats let me know how the clubs were in the 80's wack!

However, the Bell Lighthouse Tower and the London Sewers were a delightful surprise. Who would try to build a lighthouse eleven miles out to sea and expect to be successful? Well, it is still there today!The interesting part about the London Sewers were how the egg-shaped design of the tunnels made the sewers self-cleaning. Maybe India should learn a lesson, as the youth that they employ to hand-clean their sewers continue to become very ill, due to the work.The Hoover Dam portion did a pretty good job of making it seems as though the dam had not yet been built.I just wish James Cameron would do a movie on Hoover the what with the depression, high unemployment, Ragtown, Boulder City, men surviving being washed down the diversion tunnels.For the price, this DVD is well worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The lyrics and beats did not move me.

Definitely read this if you liked the first novel, but be warned that Michael Marshall is trying too hard to make a franchise out of The Straw Men. I can't really fault Michael Marshall for the effort to be like Nora Roberts or Jeffrey Deaver, but this novel just isn't very well coceived and lacks congruity. This novel really has two competing storylines that just don't work together (read it, see if you agree). Ward Hopkins is a compelling character. His rants and diatribes about society and the world alone are worth reading this book (I'd give his observations 4 out of 5 stars). Not a \\"page turner\\" like the first novel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murky and confusing","review":"The first thing about \\"The Upright Man\\" that any prospective buyer should know is that it's a SEQUEL! This is not mentioned anywhere on the book cover; I had absolutely no idea about that when I picked up this book on a whim. The author makes almost no allowances for this; he simply assumes that you've read the first book. It becomes very confusing when characters make cryptic, fragmentary references to the events in the earlier volume.Marshall is undoubtedly a talented writer; he has a good ear for dialogue and his social observations are interesting. However, that's the best I can say about this novel. There are too many characters and the point of view is constantly shifting. Marshall also includes some digressions that seem to go nowhere, such as a lengthy subplot about Bigfoot (!). By the time I slogged through to the big finale, in which characters are staggering around a dark forest shooting at each other, I didn't know (or care) who the \\"bad guys\\" were anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TERRIBLE Sequel","review":"The prequel, The Straw Men, was as Stephen King said: \\"A masterpiece\\".This one is boring, it has the cheesiest ending I've ever read, nothing is clarified at the end, and the reader is left feeling confused and irritated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violet and unfocused","review":"I was 20 pages from the end of the book and just couldn't bring myself to finish.

Despite what these diehard synthpop afficionadoes might say, I didn't find a single track with a hook worth listening to twice. Although the music is well put together and excellently produced, the melodies are mostly cloying and always unremarkable, attempts at new romantic opera that seem to have no musical knowledge backing them up -- exactly the opposite of catchy. The vocalist sounds like he phoned in his performance from a tanning booth. As someone who likes Covenant, Soviet, Cosmicity, etc. I still found myself thinking that ESH was just a little too soulless and half-hearted: compared to the Pop Robot tracks, even the most reserved Erasure song sounds like hair metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Electro-pop","review":"\\"Pop Robot\\" is a very strong album from Empire State Human. Given its price and the fact that the CD has twenty-one tracks, it's also an excellent value, doubly so in that the CD does not become tiresome with repeated listens. It stays fresh and interesting, and is definitely one of the best synthpop albums I've bought in a while. Fans of synthpop will recognize a range of influences on \\"Pop Robot,\\" like Kraftwerk and early Human League, but the album does not sound at all dated.

I am not an anthropologist and so cannot comment on its research methods etc. I can, however, attest that this book articulated a strongly post-colonial viewpoint and made me think deeply about the way we live in \\"developed\\" countries. The anthropological information is constructed around Maybury-Lewis's story of living with the Xavante people, and this biographical aspect of the book's construction helps to engage readers further with the ideological orientation of the text. I loved the photographs, the inserts about various historical writings on anthropological issues. My favourite part of the book is when David and his family witness a \\"log race\\" whilst living with the Xavante - we witness the beauty of a life lived without pointless competition and egotism.

The characters, especially the two main actors, have no common sense, no brains. This story is about lies, betrayal, selfishness. It justifies all these values in the name of love. Is that true love? The real victim in this whole film was the poor fiancée who had no idea that his girlfriend, Gabriela, was a total whore. How could anyone trust as woman who changes her mind ever 5 min?. I felt absolutely disgusting after the film. It's not romantic, its definitely not a love story, not exiting, intelligent, nothing, It offers nothings. It's cheap and I wasted my money by renting it. The only good acting in the film was by Lupe Ontiveros. She deserved more scrip time.

Not even close to being a classic. It's too easy to trash B-movies (and I'm a fan of some of the worst the world has to offer), but this one really tried my patience.

Nothing new was really gleamed from it for me.Worth a read through if you can borrow it.It maybe that this is a book for people with too rosy a picture of Jesus.

I like Brandon Lee, and I like martial arts movies. But this movie really was more of an 80s action flick than a martial arts movie. The plot line and acting weren't bad for a movie in this genre. Fairly formulaic. And the dubbing is something that you are probably used to if you watch many hong kong movies. But the actual fight scenes tended to be very short, and involved a little too much gun play for what I was hoping was more martial art oriented. Over all I was kinda underwhelmed.

This is the unusual story of a Victorian woman who fights for herself and lives independently long before society provided any protection and support for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming and well-written book","review":"I loved every minute of Mister Ed and Me.

Whereas the single (and its remixes) seem a bit more dancefloor friendly, this full-length has songs for every mood. Personally, I feel the first two tracks (\\"Give Me\\" and \\"The Sweetness of my Pain\\") are the strongest. I could not get them out of my head for days!My only gripe? The bonus disc should have included the \\"Devil In Me\\" Melodramatic Goodbye Mix. This gorgeous remix is one of the most beautiful songs released in the last few years. Be sure to pick it up on the \\"Devil In Me\\" single. It's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"gross","review":"This is not even in the same categorie as Iris depeche mode etc. This is euro dance crap.

This book provides nothing but fluff and a few pretty pictures. For example, the chapter on modifications will tell you a tiny bit about roll bars, snorkels, winches, lockers, and skid guards, but WON'T tell you how to install so much as a shock absorber. Written and published in Britain, so if your steering wheel is on the left hand side this book will be all but useless to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL MOODY","review":"I like SUR LA MER, the Moodies initial release in the 90s. While certainly respecting purists who didn't like the band's progression from their early sounds, I appreciate the band's decision to move with the times and manage to deliver quality music.With that said, SUR LA MER has some great tracks: I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, the infectious Top 40 hit; the melodic WANT TO BE WITH YOU; the driving force of RIVER OF ENDLESS LOVE and HERE COMES THE WEEKEND; the incessance of BREAKING POINT and the album's best track, DEEP, with its gorgeous chord structure and Justin Hayward's impassioned vocal.The Moodies longevity is commendable and while SUR LA MER may not be their best album, it's darned good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you can't take the blues out of theMoody Blues","review":"This collection is pleasant listening.

If you ejoyed \\"Long Distance Voyager\\" and \\"The Present,\\" you won't be disappointed. Best songs are \\"I Know You're Out There Somewhere (very pretty rock song),\\" \\"Want To Be With You\\" (romantic with some oomph), \\"River of Endless Love\\" (powerful and often left off of \\"best of\\" compiliations), \\"Breaking Point\\" (Unusually dark), and \\"Deep\\" (becomes more interesting with repeated listening)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phew!

But, I can still remember how sad I felt when I listened to this one. It really just sounds like generic 80's music, with very little of the Moodies sound. Even the melodies don't stick much. I'm pretty sure that Graeme Edge didn't play any drums on this at all (everything sounds like drum machines) and Ray Thomas isn't even credited. It's really a very disappointing album--luckily, they would get better after this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album shreds","review":"Hook laden, noodely, up tempo, fast pased, clever and catchy riffs.

I still have my old stick and the comparison is shocking. Normally, the stick has a very subtle, fresh, natural fragrance.

After I shower I apply once or twice a day; if I'm understand the sun the funk kicks in/if I'm reapplying, it kinda masks odor for about 30 minutes. I'm in LA, it gets hot; sometimes I bike, sometimes I'm just walkin to the corner store, either way I come home reeking.

After listening to it I am greatly disappointed. This album appears to be an attempt to have a success like Asia. The qualities that make these guitarists great are not apparent. If I had heard this without knowing who it was I would have never suspected. It is almost undiluted pop-rock-shlock from the 80s.Only two songs are bearable, \\"Sketches in the Sun\\" and \\"Hackett to bits.\\" Sketches is a lyrical acoustic-type song played on electric guitar. Hackett is a slightly altered version of Steve Hackett's \\"Please don't touch\\" on the album of the same name. That album and that version of the song are far superior.This is much more akin to Asia, Journey, or Boston than to King Crimson, Yes, or Gentle Giant. If you're looking for an undiscovered progressive gem, look elsewhere. This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No wonder AOR Radio died!","review":"JD Considine had it best in his Rolling Stone review the entirety of which isGTR = SHTWhat more needs to be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fromage","review":"I figured that since both Steve Howe and Steve Hackett were on the album, there would be something good, somewhere. This is a disappointingly cheesy 80s album, with not an original song to be found. With tiresome lyrics, stale synth-heavy music, and silly 80s rock-star posing, they certainly were knee deep in the hoopla. The things that make Steve Howe and Steve Hackett such innovative players are just not highlighted here - the guitars are BURIED in the mix or else playing generic, beer-commercial lines. Listen to \\"South Side Of the Sky\\" or \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" and tell me this isn't a sellout.Updated - one reviewer commented that no one pointed out how embarrassing the lyrics were. My bad. The lyrics of this album deserve special vilification. At least Jon Anderson just had vague stream-of-consciousness new age-y stuff. This is very cheesy 80s lyrics, she said babeh babeh babeh, i said honeh honeh honeh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very 'Asia-like'","review":"Since the group contains some members from the '80s band Asia along with some of the song writers, I expected an 'Asia-like' album. I am not sure what it sound like, but I didn't find it very 'Asia-like'.On top of that, the track 'When the Heart Rules the Mind' is not that good. The 'fog of youth' must have clouded my judgement, I remember that track being much better when it first came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grade A-","review":"What do you get when you cross Asia, Yes, with a little \\"early\\" Genesis, throw in? You get GTR. If you like thoses groups, you'll love this group. GTR only had one studio cd, and it rocked. There are some really good songs on this cd, WHEN THE HEART RULES THE MIND, and THE HUNTER are the best.

It was hyped big time by MTV way back when, when they played videos. Of course I ran out an bought it because it was supposed to be the greatest guitar record ever made. Turns out it was not even close. There are a couple of decent songs on this thing but for the most part it is synth heavy with very weak, thin sounding guitar work. Nothing but bland corporate rock then and very dated sounding now. Lesson learned - just because some record company throws together some veteran rockers and records them does not mean that their product is going to be good. In the case of GTR they were pretty far from good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice intro to Nico","review":"So many people whom I have come across either have not heard of Nico or see her as some type of person with very little musical ability or intuition, and a hanger on to the Velvet Underground. This recording gives a nice initial introduction to Nico, her voice and pronunciation etc, though it perpetuate's the afformentioned perception of her. There are some nice songs here sang with her inimitable style. Interesting songs for me are These day's, Winter song, I'll keep it with mine, and Wrap your troubles in dreams. If one likes this and you want to know more of Nico's orginal sound/ music then go for the Marble index, and Desertshore. Nico was truly original and innovative in her approach to life and and her music reflects this. If you like diverse and emotinally reflective songs which do not border on one \\"reaching for the bucket\\" then Nico might be enjoyed by you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Nico's impact can still be heard and felt today. The fact that this album was released in 1967 baffles me when you consider the sound of popular music of that time. Nico was a true original, and perhaps one of the first authentic \\"alternative\\" artists of our time. This album is beautiful, string-laden and passionate. Nico can make you feel blue without totally bringing you down. Her voice is what it is: imperfect, childlike and yet (most importantly) VERY MUCH HER OWN. Listen with an open mind, don't listen to the Nico nay sayers, and cut the girl a break: she was only trying to infuse some beauty into this ugly little world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for whom?","review":"I have read a few reviews saying this album is not for everybody. Who is this album not for? Deaf people? This is a beautiful album and though it is not for every mood if anybody doesn't have a part in their soul that can appreciate this I would question how alive they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"for fetishists","review":"More to the point, the PROSPECTIVE PURCHASER of this record should also know by now that Nico couldn't sing (very well), especially more to the point because she does not attempt here to play an instrument, to write, to arrange, to produce, or to ride a bicycle; singing is it. \\"Chanteuse\\", by the way, is French for (female) singer, and thus to use the word in English is to evoke the French manner of singing: boisterous, exuberant: precisely the opposite of Nico's manner--or, I should say, MANNERISM. Merely to call that manner dry would be to suggest we might go swimming in the Sahara. If Nico were a wine, she'd be so sec she'd lower your blood sugar level--and so far from evoking the manner of a chanteuse, she sings with a heavy German accent (feigned or not I can't say, but it sounds to me like a caricature of a heavy German accent, Andy Warhol's idea of camp). Her style is the absence of style.Muss es sein? Es muss!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No, oh please no","review":"There's nothing avant-garde here, and nothing that will benefit from listening with an \\"open mind\\". The problem is not that Nico can't sing. In fact she can, a little.

The promoters of this nonsense are the kind of people you read about in The Bonfire of the Vanities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Britney Spears wannabe","review":"Sigh.

He uses his position to squeeze his subjects to find out how inner city people make income (by pretending he is \\"down\\" with them... yeah right!) and write about those sources for his book, supposedly under the careful hand of being a sociologist.

My husband dropped it while changing the batteries (which seems to be required rather often) and it's broken -- we can't tune it. While the reception is pretty good and the sound quality acceptable for an inexpensive shower radio, it's way too complicated to change the volume or the tuning (as other reviewers have pointed out), and I'm not a big fan of the antenna wire dangling down. At least it stays on the same station when you turn it off, as some other cheap shower radios do not, although you do have to re-tune it and re-set the volume after changing the batteries.

While I did get the radio to play, one local FM station could be heard across about half of the FM dial, and all FM stations had a loud hum in the background. I cannot imagine how Jensen could put their name on this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Wish I had read the reviews here before I bought it (from another website). This is a piece of junk. Yes, the item is listed as \\"splash resistant\\" but it's also listed as being a SHOWER radio. One would assume that it would therefore #1) be used in the shower, and #2) GET WET. But God forbid you actually GET it wet. We've had this for ONE WEEK and it died - same as other reviews...poor volume (when it got wet) and it couldn't keep the volume at a steady level (we kept having to turn it WAY up and then all of a sudden it would be REALLY loud).

In that time, it went through a ton of batteries, which was particularly annoying, because a screwdriver is required to open the battery casing. And the memory buttons are a joke - you have to press multiple buttons to change the channel, then the on/off button twice to turn the thing off when done...after the first month, and after changing the batteries, I gave up on that feature altogether.Amazon should pull this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great...if I could turn it on!","review":"The couple of times I actualy had this radio on, it sounded quite good and decently pulled in stations. The on/off switch was faulty from the start, however, and after a few days, I was no longer able to turn the unit on. I returned the unit several months ago for a replacement to Thomson, Inc., the new owners of Jensen. I did not hear back from them and recently tried contacting them again. I can no longer find a phone number for them. I called 411 in Socorro, TX where they are located and there is now no longer a number or listing for Thomson, Inc.

Only complaint up 'till then was that the setup was somewhat tricky and not intuitive.Then the \\"shower\\" radio, with occasional use, burned through its first set of batteries. Clearly, it had shorted and the batteries used up their juice way too quickly.In the second month, the radio stopped working altogether which, uhhm, was pretty much the point of the purchase. Much to my surprise, one throw of the device onto the floor seemed to fix it for another two weeks but then it malfunctioned again. Tossing the thing against concrete a second time did not seem to help anything. I'm off to buy something new.Bottom line: the battery compartment and the innards leak water and the radio shorts out. Jensen should be ashamed. If you have the misfortune of already owning one of these, toss it hard against a wall. It may help."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE BUY!","review":"This thing is a piece of junk. I bought this particular radio because I thought with a 30 dollar price tag, I would get something of quality. Wrong! The stupid thing stopped working less than a week after we got it! A WEEK!

His parents say yes, but his sister--who seems to be very sure of herself--tells Ira he'll be laughed at for sure. Ira is afraid he can't sleep without his teddy bear.

Just about 1/3 the way into the book my parental radar piqued at the conversation between Reggie and Ira concerning ghost stories, \\"scary, creepy, spooky ghost stories.\\" To my sorrow, no mention or even allusion of this was in any of the reviews.My youngest 3 children (two 5 year olds and a 7 year old) are from a culture that emphasizes ghosts, the boogie man, evil spirits, etc. in a demonic fashion. Prior to becoming part of our family, ghosts were used as a form of disciplne to terrorize them to comply and obey. Even after having them in our family for a year they still struggle with the memories of these demons.

Fills tires quickly. I do not use frame mounts because I don't like them, so I am very glad it is light. If you switch between schraeder and presta often, do not get this pump. The process is not intuitive. I don't so it works great for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"Even though it looks almost identical to the one pictured, I must have received the wrong item. There is no way possible for this thing (the one I received) to be compatible with a Presta valve, as the description says it is. It works OK with Schrader valves, not great though, so even if that was the only criteria I was basing this review on it would still only get 2 stars... max.On top of everything else, the package was obviously opened and the item used before I received it.Nothing else to say about it. Just simply don't waste your money on this product, especially if you have Presta valves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Attaches quickly. Stays put. Pump works great and yes you have to use a little elbow grease. Would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for Presta valves","review":"It works, but I had a devil of a time getting and maintaining a seal on presta valves. It's very cumbersome to use and heats up quickly. But, it is affordable, small, lightweight and connects nicely to the frame (plastic holder bolts to the frame). So, I'm keeping mine for emergency use, but if someone swipes it I won't shed any tears, and will happily replace it with a pump that's easier to use.Note -- I haven't tried this on a schrader valve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but after a struggle","review":"I purchased this pump and tried using it before a really long ride... It took me about 30 min to get it to work in my house, after i lost most of the air in my tire trying to get it to work and still wound up with really low tire pressure.

This is only good for extreme emergencies where you have no other choice..."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective product","review":"I could not get the head to work on my presta valve.

Sorry it didn't work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but no instructions!","review":"it says specifically only sold in bike stores, so it makes sense that there would be an associate to help with any questions. it would also make sense that someone buying this fine tool would know how to use it, considering the price.

Looked good, with a handy bracket that secures well to your frame, but I ended up carrying mine in my backpack.On the plus side - this pump worked well for about two years of regular use. I'm a regular weekend club mountainbiker, and would use the pump almost weekly, just for punctures. I have a stand pump for general inflation. It's not too heavy, and fitted nicely into my packs. But that's about it...On the minus side - after a while the pumping power faded, as the plunger wore out. The connection mechanism to the valve also wore quickly. The other day it gave up after half inflating the tyre.Try Blackburn (with a lifetime guarantee as long as you keep it) at a fraction more of the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product did not come as stated in description.","review":"When i received my pump it came without any adapters for a Presta valve.

Worked like a charm. Easy to attach to bike and the frame bracket that comes with this pump allows you to install this under a water bottle cage. This frees up for another water bottle cage! Good value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is supposed to do","review":"Yes it does Presta valves. No you are not missing any pieces. Yes the instructions on the box make no sense at first. Unscrew the head and you'll see a rubber stopper. It doesn't look it it comes out but lift the lock and you can pull it out. Then flip the two parts according to those instructions that now make more sense and put everything back together.As for how it works, it does its job. Has a nice attachment to go under a bottle cage and feels nice and secure. As for inflating a tire, going from a new tube to 140psi is a pain. That's what a floor pump is for. This is for when you are out and need to go from a flat to enough to get back home. I bought this thinking I could only use this and after a few days, I bought a floor pump. That's not to say it can't get the job done, its just doing a job its not made to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we need for our non-pro bikes","review":"We were tired of pulling out the compressor, and had problems with past pumps.This one is well machined, no wobbly parts. It pumps on the push and the pull strokes.It seems fairly small, but it made quick work of inflating my kids' 20\\"x2.1\\" tires - maybe 1 minute to get to 55LBS.Also, it's inexpensive. Just exactly what we needed.This goes to 140LBS, and can work on Shrader & presta valves, plus a third kind (dunlop?). It's compact, light, and has a mounting bracket to install under a water bottle holder. Definitely a good choice for all but the most intense riders.Just be sure your rim hole is deburred, because it's hard not to push the valve stem sideways when using this little pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice pump. Better than I expected...","review":"I figured these were decent pumps based on other reviews but these (I ordered multiple) were better than I expected. I hadn't bought a pump in a very long while.

The best thing about the series were her creepy parents. Overall, it was interesting, but it all falls apart in the non-end.

I loaned him this book and he returned it the next day, he said he couldnt read it because it gave him the creeps. I greatly enjoy Lovecrafts writing and stories in the Cthulu Mythos are by far my favorite.

It still chills my spine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needed Better Story Selection but Still Good","review":"Most of the stories in this book are good. Robert Bloch, from Psycho fame, was as good an author as Lovecraft. The Steven King story was typical King, if you like that sort of thing. Philip Jose Farmer and Robert Bloch carried the weight in this one. I think the editor could have found better Lovecraft noir stories, but it was good regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected. . .","review":"I was excited when I first saw this book at my library and immediately picked it up, expecting to read lots of great tales with Lovecraftian elements/themes. However, I felt that the majority of the first half of this book was trite pastiche of Lovecraft's earlier tales - which weren't even his best ones. In fact, in the preface to the edition I had the editor even admits this! There are a few decent stories in here (the Lumely, the Campbell, and King for example) but most of the stories either fall flat or only have a sentence or two that may mention the Necronomicon or an Elder God in passing. If you're a big fan of early weird fiction(i.e. - from Lovecraft BACKWARD) and Lovecraft you may enjoy this. In my opinion there are just too many stories in here that fall short in their plot, development, and attempt to contribute to the mythos to make it worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive collection of Lovecraftian horror","review":"If you've ever wondered what the phrase \\"Lovecraftian horror\\" meant, read this book.

Full of pyschological terrors, alien horrors, and mind-twisting frights, this book proves that Lovecraft's legacy lives on as he intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date and narrow in scope","review":"I read the Cthulhu Cult Lovecraft story by curiosity when I had the opportunity while taking a vacation at the beach; it is really short and took me less than an hour to read. The story is about extra-terrestrial creatures posing a threat to men via a voodoo type cult following. When I read the other reviews to this book, I wondered if indeed the readers are not under the influence of some voodoo Lovecraft cult. I found the style and the content somewhat outdated; these stories must have been written to captivate and frighten the young teens of the early part of last century before TV and the movies were invented. Without real violence or foul language it can be enjoyed by the older pre-teens or very young teens who still believe in fairy tales. Not a must read and there are a lot of much better and more current books for this age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"ronald lebay is the controller of the car.","review":"it is a very creepy. the best book i've have ever read.his best book. it is a thiller.i don't like what happens to arnie and leigh.it is cool how the car. never mind i won't tell you cause you should read it find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.

The next day, we tried again with a different car, and it worked. I would have gone completely mad if not for Christine and Cell (Which is also awesome). Christine is the story of three friends in high school. Doesn\`t sound like Stephen King? Oh, yeah, one of them has a murderous car. That makes it more like Steve, doesn\`t it? What unfolds is a particularly exciting multi-character tale of violence and jealousy.

You're wasting your time. The characters are an irritating bunch, none of them even remotely likable, and the best of the cast--Christine herself--is inexplicably kept out of the 'action' (we're supposed to be scared of her occasionally gunning her engine without a driver--ooh, save me!).

There was so much mundane crap that had absolutley nothing to do with the storyline!! It was like good old Steve was just trying to fill up space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christine rules!","review":"This is one of my favorite King books. The characters are well developed and memorable, the high school setting is cool, and the plot is imaginative and moves with good pace. I especially dig the high school setting, since it makes for such a great place for different personalities to collide in a way with which every former high school student can relate. Arnie, the main character, is the classic loser-nerd-loner guy who falls in love with one bad car, Christine, that figures to change his life with a vengeance. His buddy, his girlfriend, the high school dirtbag enemies, and the old guy who owns the garage are all cool cats that King does a great job of bringing to life. And only the wild genius of King can inject human qualities, like jealousy and anger, into Christine in such a cool way. This is King at his best. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I just finished this book, and it was great. I started to read it last year, but I put it down. But last week, while at a bookstore, I saw it and bought it on impulse. It was definatley one of the best books King has written, and certainly one of his most underrated. If you like King and haven't read this modern masterpiece yet READ IT ALREADY! It will captivate you, thrill you, make you cry and cause you to lose sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nausiatingly painful to read, but slightly scary.","review":"Reading through this book makes you want to get your teeth scraped.The premise is unimaginative, although somewhat origional. The thrillsont the other hand are not up to King's standards. The scares only comeabout when you realize that this is a Stephen King novel and it really sucks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepiest Car ever","review":"I enjoyed this book, but expected a bit more. I had read that this was so scary and just terrifying. In my case I didn't think it was scary or creepy. It was however very well written and it was suspenseful. It kept me listening to the point I was ignoring my coworkers (more than usual) and caused them to throw stuff at me to get my attention.The book was a bit slow at times and some of the info could have been left out, but for the most part it was very engaging and interesting to read. The pace was very good overall and I loved the character development. Each character was fun to learn more and more about. It really made some very likable and others so evil it was almost a joy to hate them.For one of King's earlier works I can safely say that he has stayed consistent in quality and depth of his writing. I was expecting to be scared out of my mind, but will happily settle for a great suspenseful ride in Christine."},{"rating":"2","title":"SK's Best Work Ever!","review":"this book is one of the single most outstanding stories I have ever read. The movie does it no justice. read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me WANT to look both ways before crossing the street","review":"This is a wonderful book with sad undertones. The REAL message is a heartbreaking one: Friendship is one of the best things a living soul could have, and best friends should not let anything come between them. Well....something does come between the two best friends of this little gem: Christine, an evil '57 Plymouth Fury. After reading this story, you will seriousley want to spend some time and hang out with your best friend, for the book reminds you of the importance of friendship. While book two (ARNIE - TEENAGE DEATH SONGS) can get painfully boring at a few points (like when King goes off subject, a nasty little habit he has), the book is still great. It is not really a SCARY book...but it is an enjoyable, WONDERFUL read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent story of a teenager is transformed by his car.","review":"When I first bought this book I thought this was carrie but to my surprise was a google(a real number)times better.In this book a young fresh mindsaw a car that would change his life forever.After extensive bodywork it becomes part of his living breathing soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked me on Stephen King","review":"This was the first Stephen King story I ever read and it hooked me on his story telling. I must say as a storyteller he just keeps getting better and better. I read in a review of one of his books that \\"his is an imagination to be jealous of\\" and I have to agree. I am jealous and inspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Having read a few other SK books by the time I picked up this one, I was familiar with his writing style and work. I wasn't disappointed with this one, since most if not all of his older books are great reads. In highschool for my English class we had to pick a novel to read so we could do a couple of small projects based off that book, and I chose this one. Funny thing, another kid in my class chose 'Thinner' (a book I had already read at that point)The ending of this book surprised me a bit when I read it, but looking back now (after having read more of King's books) it felt more appropriate. It's really cool to read about an evil car, my only complaint was that there was no real back story for the car, where did the evilness come from, etc. Still, whether or not you have read other King books, you should read this one if you're into evil cars. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never jay walk again!","review":"I just recently read The Green Mile which was very good and it made me think of his earlier work when I was a huge King fan. I thought I'd sumbit a review. Christine is so good, I read it twice (one of the few times I've ever done that!). It is a very well written and plotted novel with great character development. It took me on a ride back to those high school days of my 80's.Of course cars don't drive around by themselves killing people, but somehow King takes the concept and nails it. Your belief is suspended and although not as scary as some of his other novels, it's still hard to put down! Give it a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character driven story.","review":"I've read a lot of Stephen King's books. In general he tends to have a lot of stories that are character driven. The major characters in this story have really great character development behind them. A reader will really get to know his major characters in this story. Stephen King really captured what and how a typical teenager thinks. It makes for a very rich love story and great supernatural thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kings best hands down","review":"Stephen King introduced me to adult literature my freshmen year of highschool and I havn't quit reading his stuff since. Christine is a novel that is a super scary read, but what makes it great is the story behind it and how everybody can relate to his two main characters Arnie and Dennis. It is a dark novel that uses the highschool as its back drop and that is how it first hooked me being a Highschool sophmore at the time. That setting makes this story his most relatable yet. Anybody who went to highschool was in some way or another reminded of someone they once knew by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Album","review":"I have every bone thugs album, they are my favorite group, but this album is just flat out terrible! My recommendation: Buy any bone thugs cd as long as it is not this one. Their other albums easily make the 5/5 mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone Thugs-N- Harmony Grow Up :)","review":"Let me say this: Not what i expected but it's still bangin. No more smoking marijuana for Bone, this was strictly about everything that has been going on in the world and in their lives. No more hardcore beats, just them rapping in harmony. They keep the guest appearances to a minimum like usual.My personal favorite on the album would have to be What About Us. This song explains it all, what is going on in the world (with the war on terrorism, Iraq, etc). Other hit singles would have to be \\"Get Up and Get It\\", \\"Money, Money\\" and \\"If I Fall\\".Next June Bone is expected to release another album, i just hope we get another bangin album."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO","review":"Bone has done it again. Unlike the last album, all songs have all 4 members. The only thing missing is Flesh, but it vibes nonetheless. The only problem is that it is only 16 tracks, 13 of them actual songs. A Bone album hasn't been that short since Creepin on tha Come Up (8 tracks). Kinda leaves you with the feeling that somethings missing.Great anyways. A must-buy for any Bone fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bone Album of all time","review":"I am a huge fan of BTNH, but even I will admitt this is not a good album. The worst being \\"Home\\" which uses samples from Phil Collins. The whole thing feels kind of empty, with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works. There are a few songs worth listening to. Most notably is \\"Clevland is the City\\" which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any \\"harmony\\" to it. Other songs worth mentioning are \\"What About Us\\", \\"Not my baby\\" and \\"Pump,Pump\\",the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage. It is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Bone Album Ever","review":"This is the worst Bone album ever made. In this album they go soft and arent hardcore like they used to be back in the good ol' days.Even though BTNH are one of my favorite rap groups I have to admit that this album is just plain horrible and too goody goody for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Like Thug World Order too much","review":"I don't like this album that much. This album is more for r&b and slow jam lovers than real hip-hop fans. I only like 3 phat tracks. \\"Bone Bone Bone\\" is definitely the best song to start out the album. The first four tracks went good, till it kind of turned. \\"Home\\" has a good beat at the expense of the chorus. Phil Collins sings good, but I don't like slow jams or anything like that. My favorite track from the entire album is \\"Pump Pump.\\" That song got the tightest beat I've ever heard from Bone Thugs. I would recommend this album for r&b fans only."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Ive heared few songs from this album before i got it.I only got it today and i gotta say that this is better than the art of war or any other of there cd's.Home is one the best songs,but i also liked pump,pump.If u are a fan then you aint gonna be disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend to the BTNH we used to know?","review":"I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible.

A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thugs need to be put in order","review":"When I heard that Bone thugs were releasing a new album, I was on of the first people to buy it because I thought it would be like their critically acclaimed album East 99. But I was really disapointed when I jammed it in my car stereo.I've listen to bone thugs for a long time and this has to be their weakest lp they have released.There are some good songs like \\"Get up & Get it\\" and \\"pump, Pump which is an intense song... I was orignally was going to give it a 1 out of 5, but their intro is Old School (the evil type voice that introduces them in their other lps) so I changed it to a 2-5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better then resurrection, but still bad.","review":"I'm a big fan of bone thugs. first rap CD i ever bought was e1999 eternal.

Worst Bone group album yet!","review":"It seems like the boys in Bone get worse and worse, when it comes time to drop a group album. This is their worst effort yet. Nothing too exciting at all on this CD, but \\"Not My Baby\\", \\"Money Money\\", and \\"Pump Pump\\", are the few highlights on an otherwise mediocre disc. It looks like Creepin On Ah Come Up and E. 1999 Eternal will go down in history as the only Bone Thugs albums worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone never went anywhere!","review":"Thug World Order is crazy hot. Almost all the Bone fans are mad because it's not all about murda mo, how can you expect that? East 99 came out seven years ago and a lot has changed since then in rap music and with Bone. Bone style is always evolving and for the better. Their style is the tightest and will never be touched by anyone. Thug World Order has great production and Bone's lyrics are deep and more than just bragging about money and partying like all other rappers. Bone comes back spittin verses at back-breaking speed. I believe that Bone is very underrated and deserves a lot more respect. This album can be played straight through with out skipping any tracks. I'd say the top 3 songs on this album are 1) Set It Straight, 2) Money, Money, and 3) T.W.O. Intro leading into Bone, Bone, Bone, where Krayzie just rips!

Resurrection was okay (about a 3/5)- if they had changed the chorus in some of the songs (like Servin' tha Fiends) it would have been great. As for T.W.O., I was really anticipating this to be their true resurrection. After seeing them on BET and flowing on the show, I was pumped. Unfortunately this became their worst album. It teases you with the AWESOME INTRO and \\"Bone, Bone, Bone\\", after that it hits rock bottom except for the song \\"Pump, Pump\\"- the only other good track. This is so commercialized- it has ADVERTISEMENTS at the END of MULTIPLE SONGS. They're promoting upcoming albums from their labels-and that is plain wrong. It lacks the goodness found in E.1999. It's almost like it's meant to tease their fans. Avoid this album, get Bizzy Bone's \\"The Gift\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone thugs representin Cleveland","review":"Honestly, this isn't one of their better albums, but it has Cleveland Rocks on it and thats enough for me to give it four stars, cuz im from Cleveland"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES!!!!! this.","review":"My son has a few of the DVDs that go with this system but he absolutely LOVES this one.

Some fine musicianship on this and the extended version of Dr. Funkenstein is the best part of the album with many of the musicians contributing outstanding solos.

I will say that this book is a comfortable read and it reads like a fiction novel...except that the events actually took place. I wasn't that interested in reading about Kit Carson but after reading this book, it changed my previous limited view of Kit Carson. He was an extraordinary individual. This book covered his adventures quite well and the author gives a very descriptive idea of how things actually were during those years. Since I have been to many of the places mentioned in the book, it made it more interesting to me to learn more of the history of that portion of the Southwest. I learned a few things about the Navajo, Pueblo Indians and of the New Mexicans of that era. Pick this book up and I assure you that you will not be dissappointed. A great read! (Rating of 5 Stars)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm definitely in the minority here, but \\"Blood and Thunder\\" on CD did not live up to my expectations. The one saving grace would be the information on the great Kit Carson. That is the only reason why I would give this as much as 2 stars. In my opinion, this is a biased account that almost totally favors the Navajos and other Indian tribes. Yet again, the white man is the Devil even though most rational thinkers know that there were transgressions on both sides. The author always seems to have an excuse for the Indians cutting somebody's head off because they (whatever tribe he's discussing) were driven to do this.Obama and his pals would love this book, because it would be another reason to apologize for our \\"behavior\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, fascinating history","review":"Absolutely fantastic book, one of the best that I have read in a long time.

I haven't found a recipe that isn't very good or excellent. The best thing about this book is that the ingredients are all probably already on your shelf. Nobody has to go in search of unusual or expensive products to create the recipes! If you are going to own one cookbook, this should be it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is a joke","review":"I read many similar books and this is the worst one yet. Don't buy it!I mean it's OK, but it's more of a book for a 10-year kid, with down syndrome.This book is a compilation of Self-Help basics ex. Write some goals out!, Read these super-duper Thomas Edison motivation quotes... It gets boring really fast.. Actually, about HALF of the ENTIRE BOOK are quotes from other great books and other filler. Hahahaha. I'm so stupid for buying this book.This is NOT a book for a serious individual looking to make money.Currently i'm reading Seven Years to Seven figures and it seems pretty good. Other ones i can recommend are Growing a business by Paul Hawken and The Millionaire Real Estate investor by Gary Keller.BTW: i don't know about the reviewer before me, but i have no financial interest in anybody's book sales.Also, i was laughing a lot from the completely random God references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Compilation","review":"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is well-known for its soundtrack. You don't even have to play the game (which by the way, is an incredible experience) to enjoy the music from it. Like other reviewers, I believe this is the best compilation from any of the radio stations.I was surprised at the amount of music on this collection that I did not recognize when I first heard it. Several artists like Rick James and Kool & The Gang had bigger hits, but they used less known songs instead. I had never heard of Oliver Cheetham or Fat Larry's Band before this collection, and now I own albums by both. Not one song from this station is bad or even mediocre.Recommended for those that haven't played Vice City. Highly recommended for Vice City veterans, who will definitely enjoy the commercials and DJ tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vicy city the wonder CD","review":"Is it me or is this the one of the best CD ever made! my fave song is Automatic! and i also love the game this CD is from. Whoever hates this CD should go to hell because it's the best!.I also like the picture on the front of the CD its very artistic and creative. The songs on the CD are old but you'v gotta love'em!.So in conclusion if i was you i would be dying to get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Cop Flavor","review":"Mr. Wambaugh as always, is able to catch the true flavor of what it was really like to be a cop and be a man. How hard is/was to \\"keep\\" a marriage, capture the essence of another culture and still tell a story as if we were all sitting in a bar listening to the ones who saw it all. The Seventies were ripe with blurried lines of two countries, two cultures forever linked in land of sometimes chaos. Those guys were the cowboys of the Seventies. It wasn't just a \\"Mexican\\" thing,... it was a Cop thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back many memories","review":"My review will be biased, can't help it. You see, my dad is Lt.

Yes, there are definitely extremists who say that it is impossible for us to know anything. But there's nothing wrong - indeed, everything right - with recognizing that everything we know exists in a context and the degree if certainty we can have about what we think we know will vary. Boyle's Law is not socially-constructed, for example. On the other hand, the idea that homosexuality is a great evil stands on very shaky ground. And the idea of absolute truth, the idea that truth can exist independent of *any* context whatsoever, is just plain dumb. Even Boyle's Law depends on the actual observed behavior of gases under varying conditions of temperature and pressure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable resource of synchronization in digital comm.","review":"This book summarizes authors' works on synchronization in digital comm over the past ten years. There are very few books specifically dedicated to this topic. According to my knowledge, several books on sync are now out of print, and the publication of this book can fill this blank. The most important feature of this book is that it provides valuable information on the sync techniques for continuous-phase modulation (CPM) which will play an improtant role of the next generation of PCS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it despite the obscene price","review":"This is the best book on synchronization in digital communications. The explanations are exceptionally clear and each chapter ends with key points highlighted.

It's better than #4. If you already have #3 this one's almost as good. Much like #3 there are a bunch of German bands I've never heard of & most of them [stink].

Sewing With Nancy and Die Toten Hosen do good songs too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of a very good bunch","review":"This album followed up the \\"Strong Persuader\\" LP (yes, it was that long ago) and hit the pop side of the Cray ouevre far too hard. It has several good songs (such as \\"Your Secret's Safe with Me,\\" and \\"Across the Line,\\" which are even better live) but also more stuff that sounds like a beer commercial (the title track) or ez-listening (\\"Night Patrol\\") than any album by someone this talented should feature. You would be better served by _False Accusations_, _Strong Persuader_, or _Midnight Stroll_ for your first dose of Robert Cray. Then go see him live. While \\"Young Bob\\" is now \\"Older Bob\\", he's still well worth a night out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was It A Woman Or A Bottle?","review":"Tough to follow up an album that catapulted you to stardom, but I still give this one 4 stars. I like to think of this as Young Bob's Guitar Slinger album. He's just squeezing sparks out of his Stratocaster all over the place. If you've ever encountered homelessness & thought \\"there but for the grace of God...\\", then Night Patrol is gonna speak to you. I can remember the first time I heard this song like it was yesterday. I think this song is Mr. Cray's greatest recorded guitar playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Bob conquers the blues guitar","review":"I am buying this CD for about the fifth time! I hope Young Bob puts me in his will. I have seen him live several times and he puts out a masterful effort every time. If you dont own a copy of SHOWDOWN, with Albert \\"Iceman\\" Collins, Johnny \\"The Texas Twister\\" Copeland and Robert Cray, produced by T Bone Burnett,you are missing out on some of the best guitar playing ever. What a treat! Recently, I grabbed a stack of CDs without looking, for a road trip. And there was Dont be Afraid of the Dark. I'd hid it from myself and now it was like hearing it brand new. When the opening notes of Across the Line came on, I howled out the window. Like seeing an old friend after a long time away... I give it 5 stars and a Boy Howdy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap baby toy","review":"Little Tikes Grow With Me TrikeWhen I searched for tricycles this one came up.

She had outgrown this before we got the box open. It was cheaply made. I wish I could have returned it, but after putting it together, it wouldn't fit into the box, so I just threw the thing into the garbage and we went anf bought a real tricycle.

Even he said it was difficult to understand and he has been studying China for decades. This book was simply a mess of facts. The author should have worked more on the order of the content he was stuffing into this book. I give it two stars because of the great images it provides. But, at the end of the day, images will not teach you about China. The author may have covered a variety of Chinese history and provided nice pictures, but it doesn't do any good if it is simply scattered over the pages. I am a deans list student but not after this book.

Out came my 30 year old Pfaff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that transcends language barriers","review":"Whether you listen to this in the original Russian or in the English version, it has a catchy ,infectous sound which is testament to a genuine musical quality.You can listen to the Russian version with not knowing a word of Russian and because of the emotion and energy skillfully conveyed by both the vocals and the instrumental arrangement, it is still very enjoyable.The packaging of the group as Lesbians was probably, like it or not, a marketing necessity to introduce the Russian pop group to the US audience. I say this because while TATU are clearly talented, they still have not yet attained the musical level of say, Russian pop artist Kristina Orbakaite, (same genre of Russian pop) who is all but unknown in the US. Ultimately, people will forget the Lesbian issue, and the music will stand (or fall) on its own merits.All in all, a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invigorating Russian Music","review":"I don't know how to speak Russian, but I absolutely love the Russian version of t.A.T.u.'s cd.Their voices are beautiful and the prounciations of the words are mesmerizing.

I would vote this CD 5 stars because of all the work that went into it and because of all the work that came out of it! It has hit top of the Charts in Spain. And Number one in Russia Also. The video,all the things she said has been wrongly banned in the U.K. for the raunchy outfit and the kissing of the 2 girls. 87% of americans thought that the video wasn't as raunchy as sone of the others here in america.

Soul Hooligan? Filter? They were all in the movie. After all, the music was the only thing that kept me staring at Burt Reynold's bad face-lift, listening to Stallone's bumbling lines or even caring anything about the characters that the story never adequately developed. Sure, the driving scenes were good. But some screenwriter (Stallone) got lazy. And didn't even bother to make up for it with a great soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This soundtrack is missing the song that made the movie.

The best part of this movie, audio-wise, is in the bar where you can hear in the background \\"Mad About You\\" from the band HOOVERPHONIC - yet it goes missing on the soundtrack. What a HUGE oversight. This band is fantastic and I find it truly hard to believe that the music producers left the track off this soundtrack.

Anyway, anyone interested in the song (female vocals, good beat) in the bar with the girl and guy chatting it up head to hooverphonic.com and check out their kicking music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Driven Soundtrack","review":"Just another collection that goes along with the mood of what's going on in the movie. You'd think that a race car movie would have much more fast paced techno songs, but it it doesn't.I'd say that it would be better to single out the cool songs on the soundtrack and go get their albums. If you like raceing movies you probably like the music that goes well with driving fast (techno). So go get some BT cd's or maybe some Rob Dougan.By the way whoever wrote that comment about a crystal method song being played when they race through downtown Chicago is stupid because that's a Filter song off of their Title of Record CD called The Best Things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Name that song","review":"Does anyone know the name of the artist and song in Driven that's playing when the race goes to Germany??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Songs","review":"The song that is played in the nightclub and in the final race is Poison Well, performed by Insolence.

Well that is nothing like the cable I received...A couple other reviewers mentioned it too-- its a bait and switch. The cables pictured are thick gauge heavy insulated wire and gold plugs. The cables you get are of the absolute lowest quality, tiny thin uninsulated wires, no gold plated plugs, basically the cheap RCA cable you'd get packed in with a $20 DVD player.Granted it really doesn't make that much of a difference in the end, they work, the signal gets through and if someone really cares about picture quality they would never use component cables anyway.Still the vendor needs to update their photos and description because it is deceptive and I'm annoyed that I spent money on a cheap cable that wasn't what I expected. If I wanted a cheap cable I would have kept my money and just used an old RCA cable instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU WILL BE SURPRISED!","review":"I was surprised at the quality for such a reasonable price.

It addresses health and well-being in an articulate, intelligent way. While it is a bit dated, that does not make the information less relevant...it is as pertinant now as it was then and will remain so in the future. Why? Because it addresses not just regular excercises that focus on one or two muscle groups at a time, but CELL exercise which focuses on every cell in the body at the same time. There are other books out there, but this is the original, and in my opinion, still the best. Mr. Carter is the man everyone else references for their information, and even his competitors acknowledge as being the Father of Reboundology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating and Insulting","review":"I found this book, as the title would suggest, infuriating and insulting. I have been a fan of slash for many years, to the point that I am writing my Masters thesis on the subject. This book completely dismisses the fact that desire can be culturally inscribed. There is more to sexual psychology than just evolution. A case is made for what is essentially the nuclear family in ancient times. It is a logical argument, but there is absolutely no proof. Slash cannot simply be dismissed as the result of female sexual psychology, or a male/male romance novel. It is infinitely more complex, as anyone who has been part of a slash community would know. Check out NASA/Trek by Constance Penley instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"it took a few listens","review":"this CD took a few listens but it really grew on me. nice melodies, great musicians. initially the vocals sounded a bit srained/weak but i later changed my mind and really began to enjoy his voice. i've since aquired all the PALLAS CD's but this one remains my favorite followed by the double \\"Live\\" disc \\"blinding darkness\\". i recommed this one to all that like the band \\"arena\\" or just who like hi-quality melodic prog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Unique","review":"I have never written a review on Amazon before but I am so impressed with this work by Chris Poland that I felt compelled to do so.

I own numerous works by Steve Morse, Joe Satriani and Jeff Kollman, to name just a few. Chasing the Sun is wholly different from these other stylists. It dislays uniquely different artistry.

The story is excellent about a man trying to feed his family during the great deoresion. The acting was excellent and I think Crowe, and Zellwiger should be nominated for oscars. I liked the visualsa espesailly wne they show hoverville's in central park it was sad watching the people live like that.

However...I thought this was one of the best movies of all time. Direction was superb by Ron Howard (I'll seek out and see any Ron Howard film). I also thought this was a great role for Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger. I can either dislike or like performances of each of those actors. This was a great fit for both. The period presentation of the late 20's and early 30's was wonderful too. Finally the story was satisfying with the solid husband-wife-family relationship and the honesty and integrety of the true life character James Braddock."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - Excellent!","review":"A cinematic delight that hails back to a time when movies treat to watch. Russel Crowe did a marvelous job portraying legendary boxer James Braddock. The real performance though in my opinion came from Paul Giamatti as his friend and manager. It is another movie from Ron Howard so you know it is directed masterfully. This movie will make you laugh, cry, and really appreciate all you have. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest American fillms ever made","review":"Russell Crowe may be the Marlon Brando of the 21st century after 5 years of great films, his greatest is stil Gladiator and now his second greatest is Ron Howard's uplifting masterpiece \\"Cinderella Man\\" this good hearted biographical story of depression era boxer Jim Braddock, who brought hope to those in the great depression. a shining and starlighting triumph that is Ron Howard's greatest film, and by the magic of Ron Howard I can't believe my eyes and ears that not many people went to go see this beautiful picture, it did come out at the wrong time. It's still wonderess to behold, a real fairy tale hence the title \\"Cinderella Man\\" one of Hollywood's greatest motion pictures. Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti are marvelous. See this entertainment gem before the oscars. Jake La Motta and Rocky Balboa are knocked out by this knockout king of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Star Movie but horrible price on 2 disc set!","review":"This is one of the best movies of the year, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, it did poorly during its theatrical run and apparently the studio is trying to make it up by gouging the public with a $45 2 disc set. This doesn't come with a book or cd soundtrack or any of the other bells & whistles associated with a GIFT set. It isn't a gift set, merely a 2 disc release which would normally have a $29.99 retail and be available week one with a big discount price. Now the skimpy one disc will be mass sold at probably $14.99 at most B&M stores but none will highly discount this Limited Edition. For this price I want Russell Crowe to autograph it and personally deliver it to my door. Unfortunately, this is a new trend (Constantine, War Of The Worlds...) & to get what always was the normal 2 disc set consumers will have to shell out big bucks for it. There is no reason other than greed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"This was supposed to be a new movie.

He's a good actor but he's such a creep in real life. Also, I'm not a fan of boxing. Yet, I tend to like boxing movies. Go figure. :^/Well, this movie had lots of heart. How can you not like an upstanding person that James J. Braddock was portrayed to be? He loved his family and he tries so hard to keep his family feed and off the street during the Great Depression. It was important that his family stay together. You want the man to win."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I've come to pray for Jim.\\"","review":"Based on the true life story of Depression Era boxer, James Braddock, Cinderella starring Russell Crowe as Braddock is a heartfelt and stunning achievment in cinematic history. Renee Zellweger plays Mae, Jim's wife, who stands by him no matter what. In the beginning, the couple and their three small children are happy, healthy, and rich but then the Great Depression strikes, their world is turned upside down. They are forced to live in a tiny apartment, they power is turned off, and one of their children is taken ill by lack of nutrition. The only reason I can't give this film 5 stars is that Cinderella Man can be slow at times, some of the boxing scenes are kind of boring but if you are a guy, of course you'll love those scenes, but overall, the film is classy, enchanting, and inspiring. Crowe and Zellweger are perfection together.

One teensy-weensy problem though: I CAN'T STAND IT WHEN A MOVIE ABOUT REAL PEOPLE AND REAL HISTORY GRATUITOUSLY AND IRRESPONSIBLY DISTORTS THE FACTS FOR THE SAKE OF \\"DRAMA\\"! Max Baer was not anything like the evil monster depicted in this film. If his family isn't suing for defamation of character, they should be.Do any of you who rave about this film care about this, or is all forgiven for the sake of a good story?

I agree with another reviewer... I have been here before. I like Ron Howard's movies, I do. (my favorite Apollo 13) And though this movie is about a real person (just like A beautiful Mind and Seabiscuit) this film offers nothing new. Yes, it's well acted--but it feels like a movie made for the sole purpose of an Academy Award vehicle. See Russell Crowe act. See Renee Z. act. The one who stood out above the rest was Paul Giamatti who, IMHO, has blindsided the world in the past two years with his acting chops and range.Back to the film. Jimmy is perfect. He doesn't abide by stealing no matter how hungry the family is, he works everyday, and comes to the rescue of damsels in distress. He doesn't curse, never raises his voice...I mean, c'mon. I think there is a danger in creating perfect characters. I can't relate to them..and I doubt this is the truth. Hollywood uses their artistic freedom card frequently.It's a descent film but I wasn't wowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"cinderella man","review":"I dislike boxing, but I love true stories and this is a great movie to watch.

It really is one of the great unsung, unheraldeds of '05. Brilliant and visceral acting by Russell Crowe (never utter the word \\"whatever\\" to him, by the way) and Renee Zellweger and compelling, explosive, cinematic storytelling. That, and some of the best movie fight scenes since \\"Raging Bull\\".

True stories of people overcoming the odds is a better story, since it shows that it can be done. The more telling moment to me, was how Braddock needed public assistance to feed his family and the shame he must have felt. The fact that he walked in their office later and paid it back was even more telling of the kind of man Braddock was.This is a must have for sports movie collectors along with Raging Bull, Pride of the Yankees, Bang the Drum Slowly, Rudy, and Friday Night Lights IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella Man","review":"Fantastic movie!

Second Russell Crowe is absolutely convincing and credible as a man literally fighting to save his family from the ravages of the depression.

It features visually fascinating scenes of animals large and small. Not as great as some of the footage in the Planet Earth series (Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series [Blu-ray], but Anima Mundi (originally released in 1992) predates that series by more than a decade. Philip Glass's soundtrack for Anima Mundi is good but nothing groundbreaking if you're familiar with his work on the Koyaanisqatsi films. And speaking of which, the entire 28 minute Anima Mundi film is included as an extra on disc 2 (Powaqqatsi) of The Qatsi Trilogy on blu-rayThe Qatsi Trilogy (Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]."},{"rating":"2","title":"the animal kingdom","review":"Yes, it's directed by Godfrey Reggio, no, it's not like the hopelessly overrated Koyaanisqatsi but with animals, but it is a beautifully filmed, meditative close up of animals in the wild. As others have noted, the running time is quite short."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, short work","review":"A comment was made that this film is derivative of Koyaanisqatsi, which is a silly and ignorant statement at best. Anima Mundi covers a completely different subject: the diversity of life on earth, where as Koyaanisqatsi was a reflection on the affect of technology on nature. Anima Mundi has no time lapse photography and Koyaanisqatsi has no animals. They are quite different. Yes they have the same style, but why should a film maker be blasted for having a distinct style? The footage is striking and it is very well put together. Much of Philip Glass' music actually isn't instantly recognizable as Philip Glass music. It's short and not as evocative as Koyaanisqatsi and Baraka but it's a fine piece on it's own merits. The DVD could be better quality... the dark shots have some unfortunate digital artifacts... but the brighter shots look quite nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I have read the other customer reviews that praise this DVD.

I am sure the raw footage was breathtaking. However, the clips are too short and the editing doesn't seem to flow. The music is overbearing and unnecessarily focal, as if the director is depending on the soundtrack to lend coherency to the film. Give me National Geographic's stock footage library and a Mozart CD and I'll make a better production than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Video Quality","review":"Not worth owning, and probably not even worth viewing if you are used to current DVD quality.

The handset was not clear for either party. Sounds were \\"clipped\\". The recordings on the answering machine were unintelligible and had to be repeated several times. The message counter only indicated new messages, so there was no way to gage how many old messages might be on the machine without playing them. The beeping tone indicating new messages was nearly inaudible. No backup battery in base to keep settings in case of power outage. And, lastly, it was nice being able to perform any answering machine functions from the handset on my last phone; no such feature on this phone. At least the handset wasn't so small it couldn't be held or cradled between your cheek and shoulder.

If I choose to I can turn the ringer off if I choose not to take calls and the message machine picks up, recording messages for as long as 18 minutes and the memory has a capacity of any where from 36 to 54 messages capacity.

Very good album, &some interesting stuff on the bonus disc. Great price, too, butthe packaging is lame. It is in a paper covered, cardboardclamshell box, like boxed-set LPs used to come in. This is sealed closed with a round, transparent sticker, which, in my case, tore the paper off the box when I tried to remove it. Inside, the two CDs are stacked on top of each other on a single sponge hub that is glued to the inside of the box. It tore loose the first time I tried to remove the CDs, leaving a sticky, gummy residue inside the box, which would, no doubt, stick to the CDs or booklet if you put them back in loose. You could transfer the CDs into jewel cases, but the booklet is too tall and thick to fit in with them.

There's a great range of experiences here for the reader who wants to concentrate on the mother-son relationship rather than on family relationships in general.I sometimes cried and more often laughed -- but I also thought about my female friends and their sons, and agreed with what I was reading -- then remembered my mother and sisters and their sons, and argued back -- considered my male friends, and understood more than I had before.The authors had some great stories to tell, and the quality of the writing fully repaid a second (and for some essays, a third) reading. The author's own very moving contribution was my favorite, but months after reading the book, there are many moments I remember."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired *me* to start writing again","review":"Perhaps this collection resonated more deeply with me than other reviewers because I consider myself a feminist *and* a mother of two spirited sons.

What?!","review":"Okay, let's get something straight. This band sounds NOTHING like the Arctic Monkeys. Seriously, you can't compare the two. It's like comparing Belle & Sebastian to the Sex Pistols. Both of these bands have british accents, but it's a little less annoying with Test Icicles. I don't know what is going on with this freakin british accent music craze...with Art Brut and Arctic Monkeys, but really, if this is considers one of the albums in that genre, then this is by far the best one.This album has energy and good screaming. As much as I think I could put it better then that, that's really the first thing that comes to mind. It's not over produced, it's raw, which is another quality I like in my music. The song titles are fun and so are the lyrics.I think you will like it. It grew on me pretty fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was very thought provoking.","review":"I think that this book gave us all something to think about and that it was not to be taken so literally. I believe that we generation xers are struggling to define who we as a group are in this new generation and I think that this book just says hey while we are doing that lets not get too caught up in the world we live in b/c it could change at any second.I really enjoyed this book and it thought that it was a bit of the \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" for the generation Xers."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst to date.","review":"Douglas Coupland's writing has gone consistently downhill since _Generation X_. This is the absolute nadir of his career. I've never written a review of anything, nor a fan letter to any artist. However, this novel was so bad, I felt I could not hold back. Nothing awaits you save disappointment if you buy this book. I can't help but think that the *ONLY* point (and I mean, the ONLY point!) to this novel is to see if Douglas Coupland can quote the title of as many Smiths songs as possible in one go. By the time I got halfway through the book, I was so bored, that that was what I was doing - counting Smiths song titles. And even THAT was poorly done - Karen, the 'Girlfriend in a Coma', wakes up quoting Smiths songs released during her coma. Richard, the narrator, quotes songs that weren't even RELEASED at the time he quoted them. Poor, poor, poor. Spend the money on something more entertaining, like an ab-roller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb and captivating message of hope","review":"Girlfriend in a Coma was the first book I have read by Coupland, and I am now afraid the others will not measure up to this excellent novel. Coupland has masterd the art of relating to his readers in Girlfriend... so well that i had extreme difficulty putting this book down. I found that I would intend to read for only five minutes, and read for 2 hours instead!One thing that Coupland was able to do somehow in Girlfriend, was to capture the full attention of his audience, and make them believe that all of what was happening in his post-appocalyptic novel is really possible. Not once did I find myself thinking \\"yeah right, like the whole world could really ever fall asleep!\\" Coupland does this by making us relate to his characters: both their thoughts, actions, feelings, and situations. I can only hope I will get as much joy out of reading all the rest of Couplands novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"striking","review":"Probably one of the most enjoyable experiences I have ever had, this book now follows me around.A very touching, wonderfully written story. I would recommend it to anyone who is in need of reminding that they are alive. I have read this book at least 10 times, and each time I read it I find myself lifted and restored.The writing style, especially in the sections dealing with the aftermath of the \\"big sleep\\", is of especially high quality : the joy and the pain of silence (no planes, no industry), nature returning to the city, the aching loneliness of a world empty of people and community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely riveting","review":"I picked this book up totally by accident based on the title \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" - it was the name of a favourite song. Once I started to read, I couldn't stop. What if this really happened? What would I do? The mind boggles. Over the course of a day I read and read until my eyes hurt...

His writing is clearly among my favorites. This book was alarming in a intropesctive kind of way - forcing me to delve into the characters as I examined my own existence and life purpose. The ending fizzled a little, and I am curious as to how things are expected to revert back to \\"normal\\" after what the group has experienced. My favorite Coupland novel is still Shampoo Planet, for I was able to connect better with Tyler and his experiences. However, Richard, Karen, Linus, Pam, Hamilton, Wendy, and Megan were intriguing characters. They embody a spirit that I feel is within each of us - though we may fail ro recognize just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commits the worst of literary crimes... Wasting its promise.","review":"GIAC is a book that you should not read. It wastes your precious time when you should be preaching on the purpose of existance. Or so Coupland would have us believe.The first hundred pages or so are at times exciting, mysterious and above all filled with potential. What happens to a clique stuck in a hick yank town with nothing to do?Of course, they do nothing. Who needs plot, pace or invention when you can have boredom, apathy and rot?

Books like Generation X, Microserfs, and Shampoo Planet are clever and ingenious looks at today's society. This book is not. It reads like a recycled young adult horror novel. It doesn't have the same spark as his earlier works. Furthermore, the ending is really, really lame. Really cheesy. I know that reviews won't stop the curious, but if you're wavering about spending the money on this hardcover edition: don't! Wait for the paperback if you must.... Better yet, skip it entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coupland Dropped The Ball On This One","review":"I have loved Douglas Coupland for years, so when this book came out I was plenty excited for it. What a disappointment. The story was choppy, amateurish, and this book has the single worst ending of any book I've ever read. A complete waste of time. I threw this book off my balcony when I was done because it was just so bad I couldn't stand to have it in my apartment for one more moment. Read Generation X, Shampoo Planet, Microserfs, or All Families Are Psychotic, but stay away from this one if you know what's good for you.

OK I will admit me wasting my money was my fault because of the interesting cover (white with the barcode and title on each cover). But uuughh, if this isn't the worst book ever. It started off very well with the first 46 pages, then the book got stupider and stupider. The plot sounded interesting with the idea of a girl being in a coma for 18 years, but as the book went on, it became the reader that's in a coma.

We are subjected to the intimate thoughts and actions of a thoroughly meritless, shiftless and vacuous collection of misbegots without whom the world would be infintely better-off. The terms of their rehabilitation are presented to us as if they are profound and thought-provoking when in effect they are juvenile and shallow. Mr Coupland should read Darkness at Noon or its equivalent before dishing up his platitudes as truisms.For all that the literary style is readable, though unremarkable (and occasionally ungrammatical - my copy had at least one typo too).I would not recommend it for purchase but if one is bored or perhaps trapped in a holiday hotel during unexpectedly bad weather, it could be read in order to avoid being obliged to play endless games of Pictionary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow--a staggering disappointment.","review":"I'll be brief--I have loved almost everything Coupland has ever written. The earlier novels, the short stories in _Life After God_, the magazine articles I am lucky enough to track down, and of course _Generation X_ (a book I must have worked, somehow, into almost every undergrad English paper I wrote). _Girlfriend..._ literally saddened me as I read it. No great Coupland characters to latch onto, a disturbing shortage of the memorable phrasing and epigrams that made him such a delight to read, and (most distressing) a cop-out, lame ending--I have always defended Coupland to skeptics by saying that if nothing else, the man can construct beautiful conclusions--always moving and poetic. I finished this novel out of loyalty to Coupland and hope for better next time--the only value of the book for me now is as an example of \\"spot The Smiths lyrics Coupland's inserted into the text.\\" That was sort of fun, I suppose...sigh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"This man is the greatest writer of contemporary fiction today!(well, tom wolfe and brett easton ellis are pretty good to!)

At first, the novel seemed to touch upon the sensitive issues of dealing with a loved one in a coma. For example, the drastic differences in the ways Richard and Lois dealed with the loss of Karen. The plot took a nice, fairy-tale kind of turn when she wakes up after eighteen years, but after that the story takes an unbelievable twist, with ghosts performing miracles and people falling asleep...everyone but the main characters. An even greater twist is when a character is impregnated by the ghost. All in all, I felt that the ending was feeble and could have been better. However, the questions that the author posed are very thought provoking and should be considered by everyone, because there is truth behind it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a great book","review":"In some ways this book was better than I expected from Coupland. I've enjoyed his previous books, but found them a little to glib. In this novel, I felt that he retained his distinctive brand of storytelling, but with a deeper insight. The first part of this book was fascinating, even when things got pretty weird. In the third part, it really strained my credulity, but I was interested in the purpose of all the strange events. Unfortunately, in the end I was disappointed. It was like lighting a firecracker, anticipating the big \\"BOOM!\\" and getting a little \\"poof.\\" The final revelation just didn't impress me. Maybe it's a sequel and the anticlimatic ending is just a jumping off point for an even stranger trip for these characters.

I have read almost every Coupland book to date and I have to say this one was still very good. The idea of the book was typical of Coupland's clever style, and kept my interest. It was way more wild than his other books--- perhaps a bit of an experiment for him? This one incorporated a sense of SCI-FI in mundane every day life.

It was not until I went home during the Christmas holiday that I decided to grab the book and see what it was all about. The title alone lead me to believe that was a sappy, Oprah meets Nicholas Sparks novel that would attempt to tug at my heart strings.What I soon discovered was this book was not what I expected. It was better. I have such trouble decribing all that is in this book, and feel that i would short change the reader by divulging any plot twists, turns, or even a synapsis. This is the type of book where the less you know about it the better. I can honestly say that I wish I could read it again for the very first time.

I have a problem with middle-aged male authors who go on at great length asking the rhetorical question \\"Life used to have so much meaning; what happened?\\" (Hint: the only change was that your ability to perceive the presence or absence of meaning became more acute as you matured.) And that's not only a tiresome obsession in this book; it's what the book is about. Coupland also assumes that this phenomenon is unique to his generation, as if people haven't been grappling with it (and writing tiresome books about it) since the dawn of culture. Combine these with magical realism poorly done, an arbitrary deus ex machina to fix everything up at the end, and disappointingly flat prose and characterization (Coupland is capable of much better than this.) and you have a book that I would pay not to have to re-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me make a suggestion--","review":"If you've read Coupland before, you've read this novel. Good, but same-old, same-old. If you're looking for something really different, something that you can't put down and that will stick in your mind long after you finish it, I highly recommend Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. It's the best read I've come across in years, if not one of my favorite novels ever. Highly provocative suspense thriller with a hell of a surprise kick at the end. Please Mr. Coupland, can we have something fresh next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Enjoyed (with qualifications) Coupland's earlier efforts, but literally couldnt pick this one up again after the first chapter, which featured the clunky device of a dead high school football star's narrative.

However, everything else about the book is nauseatingly bad. The characters? Oh Beb, we've seen 'em before. Completely Coupland and cliche to the hilt. By the way, what 34 year old *still* hangs out with all of his/her high school chums? Say, shouldn't we be referring to them as Richard and Karen CARPENTER? And since were on the topic of music superstars, what's with the nicked one-liners from The Smiths, REM, Pink Floyd, etc. It's just not *that* clever. Oh! Can we please hear about the Berlin Wall and AIDS one more time?Hey, if after all this ranting, you just simply MUST read the book, for Pete's sake, don't waste your hard earned money.

This book starts off in one direction, one type of story very typical to Couplands previous works, and becomes something else...scifi, fantasy, end of the world, or how ever you may choose to describe it. Coupland handles the transition beautifully, and it in fact, added to my interest in the novel. It's just like a song that starts of drowsy and slow, but then halfway through roars into an audio assault that makes me want to jump up and break something....or at least air guitar a bit. This first part was interesting...but in a typical, comfortable Coupland kind of way. In the second part he tries something a little different...cept maybe for some of the appocalyptic visions in 'Life After God'.If you want some fun, some adventure, fine writting and a bit of philosophy to think about..then enjoy...just understand that it's a new evolution for this particular authour.

It has to do with a disease that random people get by sleeping, it really doesn't make any sense.

This starts out as a charming little story about loss and the need for closure, then makes a huge leap to a story about a weird plague sweeping across the world (ala The Stand), and then makes another huge leap to some supernatural tripe about altering history by not answering your phone or some such nonsense. I don't know. By the time I got to this little deus ex machina (in the last three or four pages in the book, by the way...nice, real nice) I was just fighting to get to the end so I could say I'd finished it.

Sure, whoop-de-doo, it take a very deep and critical thinker to see that in our modern world. I felt he oversimplified the modern day lives and events. To top it all off there is a ghost, from the main characters past, who performs miracles and a coma vicitm who sees the future with three paperbags over her head. Honestly, do I need to say anything more?Needless, to say this book was uninspiring and uninsightful. Maybe because I dont long for the late seventies that I don't mourn the wonders of feathered haircuts and down jackets.Instead, pick up a Milan Kundera book. Don't waste your time with an early nineties fad...gone bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"His weakest novel, by far","review":"If you are looking for Coupland's best work, go read Generation X or Microserfs. I don't know quite what happened while he was writing this one, but it falls terribly flat in comparison.All of Coupland's work address the similar theme of \\"Is what you see in life really all there is?\\". The characters in his books passively and actively search for meaning in their own lives. That's why I love to read Coupland -- I think he's asking the right questions. But unlike his other books, where this theme is subtly developed through a believable plot, this one practically shouts at you through the most preposterous of plots.I couldn't wait to finish this book and throw it away. It was _really_ that bad. (And for everybody who thought Girlfriend in a Coma was amazing, go read his other stuff... truly.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Band Project Featuring Who's Who of TOTO Production","review":"Radioactive is a melodic rock project produced by Tommy Demander a Swedish guitarist who supported TOTO albums. Guest musicians alone will catch your attention such as David Foster playing keyboard for Toto-styled ballad Grace(my #1 favorite) and Bobby Kimball of TOTO, ex TOTO vocalist Fergie Fredericksen, and big shots go on and on... And for Toto fans, incredible lineup. Jeff Pocaro, legend of TOTO who were killed by an accident in 1992. In fact the album itself was being produced in 1991. So the album on the whole sounds like TOTO and partly Fergie's Equilibrium. My quick picks are TOTO styled pop rock On My Own featuring the vocal of Fergie Fredericksen, Grace nice ballad starting like Africa a bit and Haunt Me Tonight,Richard Marx styled ballad(no doubt because it was written by Richard and his songwriting team). Essential for anyone who enjoys Fergie Fredericksen's Equilibrium, and TOTO fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"sylvania dvc850c dvd/vcr","review":"This unit stopped working about four months after I purchased it.

There's no way out; this has to be one of the most disappointing CD's of all time. Disappointing, because PG is, without exception, the most talented artist of our time. He totally missed it this time. There are, in fact, only 3 good listens on this CD, and one of them is a repeat. All the reviewers who suggested this album deserves a second listen or that it should be \\"an acquired taste\\" are fooling themselves or maybe they're fooling us.

There's nothing here that you can hum along to.The songs are okay, none of them are terrible, all of them are LONG. I'll give it a little more time, but I'm thinking that none of the songs on this CD will be on my regular listening list.So, why still give it 4 stars? Well...it is Peter Gabriel after all.

I really thought he was never going to release music again. What makes Peter Gabriel a step ahead of his contemporaries (read the sarcasm into this. Those boring lunkheads in the Rolling Stones and anything related to Robert Plant/Jimmy Page) is that Peter continues to push new boundaries with his songwriting. Peter is a rare musician that continues to evolve with the times. I love this CD.However, I do have one complaint. He recorded 150 songs to get to these ten. Instead of waiting YEARS for the next CD can he humor us and maybe release one or two b-sides compilations with music from these marathon sessions?"},{"rating":"2","title":"First masterpiece of the new millenium","review":"...just brought Up home and listened for the first time...I am overwhelmed...this is not a \\"commercial\\" album, no Sledgehammer, no Big Time....just the poetry and brilliance of a master craftsman at the absolute top of his game...\\"did i dream this belief or do i believe this dream?\\"I am sure this is a cd that will be played many many times, with new discoveries...thanks to Mr Gabriel for the inspiration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No Triumph With This One\\"","review":"I thought this one was not up to Peter Gabriel's norm of 'splendor.' so sue me. \\"Gabriel's\\" voice in this one was lacking his usual range, I thought.

I know from this review it doesn't sound much like I'm a fan of Mr. Gabriel, but I am...usually...just not with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth buying, even if you have the original CD","review":"I'm astonished at how different Up is on SACD, compared to the CD. My impression is that there is a lot of instrumentation that Gabriel has specially added for the SACD. (And the CD was pretty multi-layered in the first place.)I believe 'Up' will eventually be regarded as a classic -- it's a slow burner. Anyone who had the privilege of attending the concert in-the-round, or of seeing the DVD of the event, will know how much attention to musical and visual detail went into this creation.I ought to warn that this SACD might be a bit troublesome in some players. I got a very staccato performance whenever I tried playing it in my old Sony SACD machine, and forced myself to wait until my next birthday to buy a replacement player. The new SACD player plays the disc flawlessly in 5.1 surround.This is one of the best SACD discs I own -- as good as 'Dark Side of the Moon' or 'Gaucho'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning, complex and rewarding album","review":"A welcome departure from the \\"pop\\" Peter Gabriel, this work is something that you can HEAR is years in the making. It's meticulous, it's complex, and extremely rewarding. Fans of \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Solsbury Hill\\" need not apply...those songs are not on this album. Part of the reward is realizing how an artist of Gabriel's quality allows his music to grow and evolve as he grows and evolves as a human...as we all do. This is a stunning work that I recommend anyone try, although not everyone will take to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effort pays off","review":"Though not all of Gabriel's albums require effort to appreciate, some of the better ones do. This one and Last Temptation are my favorites now. I've kept the disc spinning in my car for my daily commute for the past 3 days to get something like a grasp of it. The effort payed off. I'm hooked UP.Some wonder why so much should be required of a listener to appreciate music like this and much of jazz and classical. The answer is: nothing's required. You're welcome to skip the difficult stuff and stick to the commercial fare that hooks you in with the first listen and then spits you out by the fifth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Music","review":"If you are like me and you love Peter Gabriel, you are in for a big treat! The music is incredibly expressive and as usual his lyrics are amazing. This is a man who obviously has looked into his own soul, and is generous enough to share his findings with the rest of us. My favorite song is Growing Up which begins with a description of being in the womb. Peter Gabriel takes artistic chances - he pays his listeners a compliment with this intelligent, emotion provoking art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabriel continues to evolve","review":"Peter Gabriel, never taking his audience for granted, could easily have given us another \\"So\\" and sold zillions of discs. But that is not his way. He has once again shown that he is a man of great creative brilliance, and he gives us, his fans, enough credit to know that we can keep up with him. He has created here an excellent recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"It had to grow on me...","review":"Surprisingly enough, as a long term Gabriel/Genesis fan, I originally found this album quite disappointing. The sound is a bit muddy throughout (intentionally?) and there's really nothing very inspirational in any song... so I thought.Then I saw PG perform the songs live on tour in San Jose and then went back and really listened to the album. The sound is still a bit muddy and derrivative from previous works, but the lyrics make it an absolute winner.I now >love< this album. I needed the theatrical interpretations of the tour to really bring it to life for me. If you can get videos, see him on tour, whatever, do it. It will change your opinion about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex, nearly visual music","review":"You have to admire Peter Gabriel,he experiments with sound, emotions, and melodyuntil it's nearly visual.His latest effort, Up, is a return to his complex,sometimes angst-filled music, that somehow remainsrhythmic and melodic.This recording, especially when compared to his other efforts,reveals what you get when someone capable of pop hooks, dark melodies and film soundtracks interweaves them all together.I've listened to it repeatedly since I got it,hearing new things each time.Well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let Peter be Peter...","review":"Having been a big fan of Gabriel's commercial stuff, i.e. \\"So,\\" and \\"Us,\\" I feel qualified to step into the fray and make a call on this recording. This is not \\"So\\" and it isn't \\"Us.\\"This is Peter's attempt to mesh 60's experimentation like the Beatle's \\"Magical Misery Tour,\\" with modern experimentation like Beck.\\"Up\\" is not a terribly complicated recording. The themes are as always, Gabriel's demons, and the delivery is pure Peter. \\"The Barry Williams Show\\" is my favorite track, because it is such a pleasing mix of \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Band/For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite,\\" run through modern layering techniques and sounds.Is it any good? That depends on the listener. If you only like Peter Gabriel for his Pop material that gets radio play, you might as well just buy \\"The Barry Williams Show\\" single. If you like Peter Gabriel's introspective demon hunts, you probably will like the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to listen to it repeatedly to appreciate","review":"Up certainly isn't as accesible as SO or even US. However, the album really grew on me after repeated listening.I Grieve is a highlight as is the Barry Williams show, but really there is not a weak track on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignor the \\"philosophizing\\"","review":"I'm a long time Gabriel fan. But before purchasing this title I read a bunch of reviews to get an idea of what to expect. There's an awful lot of \\"philosophizing\\" about you have to listen to this CD half a dozen times before you get it. After that, you'll love it. Based on some reader comments and listening to the samples, I was expecting a bizzar and interesting new Gabriel album--but tough to listen to. Well, the first listening for me was fantastic and not abstract nor strange at all. If you enjoy any of Gabriel's albums, you'll love this one just as much--at least I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very deep","review":"Takes multiple listens to appreciate the artistry and beauty of this CD. A little on the dark side but some of his best work. Some of it reminds be of his genesis work and early solo work. Don't miss this excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up SACD is an amazing listening experience","review":"Peter Gabriel has always been ahead of the game. Releasing his most recent cd Up in hybrid SACD format was just in time for his summer tour in the US. The SACD format which is mixed in 5:1 for audiophile's pleasure really brings out the little blips and blurbs in each track and really deepens the sound. Tony Levin's bass is in fine form and the lyrics tackle a wide range of topics that remind us how fragile life can be and what can happens along the journey. Highly recommend Up for any PG fan and the SACD is a must. Hopefully the music industry will embrace SACD over DVD-A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The least effort possible must have gone into this album. Boring, boring, boring.

If it wern't for Tony Levin this would be a 0 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cacophony for your Stereo","review":"After such luminary accomplishments as \\"So;\\" \\"Passion,\\" and \\"Secret World Live,\\" there can be no doubt that Peter Gabriel is a brilliant artist and visionary. That truth is precisely what makes \\"Up\\" such a bitter dissapointment.This album is absolutely horrible. It is almost unspeakably bad - a cacophonic disgrace. Several tracks are largely chaotic, lacking any sort of logical melodic flow. In particular, \\"Darkness,\\" the opening cut, is little more than a hideous amalgamation of electronic noise. I cannot think of anything sold as \\"music,\\" short of perhaps Marylin Manson's various disgraces, that has ever repulsed me more.Do yourselves and the world a favor - instead of buying \\"Up,\\" donate the money instead to some of Mr. Gabriel's favourite charities."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Peter Gabriel fans only","review":"My better half and I really enjoy PG's work.

I know that he has moved on from his earlier works, and you can't expect an album like SO to be topped, but if Secret World was good to better than average, this one is just awful. It basically is unlistenable, and hard to fathom what he was thinking when he released it. I saw the tour that goes with this atrocity when it came to D.C. and it was awful as well. Only hightlight was In Your Eyes, but same tired arrangement from the Secret World tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Was looking forward to PG's next release, but after purchasing \\"UP\\", and two quick listens I wish I had waited to hear more reviews.

Now only if he goes on tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Gabriel fans will love this record","review":"From start to finish, UP offers a challenging, rewarding and UPlifting listening experience. Like other great records, the first listen is sometimes difficult, but as you hear UP again and again every part of the CD grows on you--it becomes more rewarding with each listen. \\"Growing Up\\" should have been the first single. It's a great anthem with driving beats. \\"My Head Sounds Like That\\" is a classic Gabriel tune. \\"More Than This\\" evokes memories of \\"In Your Eyes\\" and \\"No Way Out\\" will thrill any die-hard Gabriel fan. Just because radio stations refuse to play this record doesn't mean the CD is bad. It just means radio's target audience (17 and younger) doesn't have the patience for such a mature piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man's in pain","review":"Some years back I saw Peter Gabriel in concert. This was his \\"bald\\" tour. He purposefully shaved his head in atonement for cheating on his wife. I say this because for anyone who is familiar with this man's music & performances will know that he is a very passionate man, almost wearing his emotions on his sleeve. And so it is with UP, his darkest, most inaccessible offering. More discord than rhythm, more disjointed than rhythmic.I offer a theory in the form of a question. Why do you suppose water is featured on the cover art? I suspect the answer lies in a review of his earlier work & note how often & in what context he refers to water & rivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed reaction","review":"It is really a weird cd, I still dont know what to think about it.

BTW lyrics are weak, especially for somebody who liked PG I-IV."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"UP\\" lets me down","review":"I love & have loved Peter Gabriel for many years. He is a brilliant, intuitive, insighful artist. I saw him perform live last December 2002 from first row seats. He is a fabulous live performer. I was and still am terribly disappointed by \\"Up.\\" It is muddy and overproduced. I remember unwrapping the CD in my car immediately after purchasing it in the store, feeling like a child on Christmas morning, only to open my packages to find dirt & mud & rocks.

The rhythms, melodies and textures blend perfectly to create an album that is now my favorite by Peter Gabriel. The mixture of electronic and organic sounds, which has always been a part of Peter Gabriel's style, shine more than ever on this album. The album is dark, but beautiful at the same time. My favorite song has to be No Way Out. This song still gives me the chills every time I listen to it. I am highly anticipating the Growing Up Live tour, it's going to rock!!! 5 stars for Peter Gabriel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your average album","review":"Once again Peter Gabriel has managed to put out a \\"different\\" album.

However, there are times when he is trying to much to be different. \\"Darkness\\" is a great track but who needs the noise! If you like PG then you will love this album...just not on the first play. I have listened to it about 3 times already and cannot stop..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Gabriel is up to greatness again.","review":"One thing I've always thought of Peter Gabriel's music is, either you get it or you don't.

This album is way too complex, dark, and narcissistic for my taste.What makes Peter's music so interesting is the dynamic tension between manic \\"shock the monkey\\" songs and depressive \\"blood of eden\\" songs. There is no dynamic tension here, it's all depressive.Also, David Rhodes, Manu Katche, & Tony Levin are as important to the \\"Peter Gabriel\\" band as Peter himself. There is very little of their spirit on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry","review":"Talented star.....distorted display of it in this album.No one respects Peter Gabriel more than me but this albumjust baffles me.

I am sorrybut I have to rate this a \\"dislike\\" and a strong one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 10 Years, I Expected Much More Than This!","review":"A very disappointing effort. After ten years of writing/recording and with 150 songs to choose from, it is hard to believe that Peter Gabriel edited the list down to these 10 rather uninspired songs. Overall, the release sounds dated and possesses none of the production values that kept Gabriel's work on the cutting edge of music. The lyrical content and mood of the music can best be described as dark and depressing. In my opinion, the ten years between \\"Us\\" and \\"Up\\" were not worth the wait. \\"Us\\" will remain one of my favorite albums of all time and \\"Up\\" will be buried somewhere in the deep, dark recesses of my cd library."},{"rating":"1","title":"now i lay me down to sleep","review":"UP is simply a very tired and lifeless sounding Peter Gabriel album. Regardless, he still remains one of the most brilliant recording artists of our time. For those who don't own any of Gabriel's earlier records (I met one such person recently), go and purchase SO and listen to \\"IN YOUR EYES\\" , \\"MERCY STREET\\", and \\"DON'T GIVE UP\\". By far some of the best songs he's ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, but for One track","review":"This album is typically fantastic Peter Gabriel, but not his finest work. It comes at you from all sides in a sinister, enveloping sort of way. A miasma of sadness somehow uplifting. Both sounds and words started catching me off guard after a few turns. I am excited to keep finding its depth. But what upsets me is that PG apparently culled 150 tracks down to 10 \\"gems\\" and still managed to put \\"The Barry Whatever Show\\" on the album. This song smells like a dog pile with flies. Hard to believe it made the cut. But I just skip over it and enjoy the rest from one of the best. I would like to hear the other 140 songs......"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I","review":"Peter Gabriel proves again proves why Psychedelic music will never die,it just like Rock, it will live forever and ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"Peter Gabriel's music emerges from pure inspiration and passion. I have listened to this album from start to finish at least twenty times and still hear new things with each experience. Only an artist who lives inside his art can pull you into his world on a micro level and lets you discover things all the way down to the hidden secrets. UP lifts you into PG's dark world, yes, lifts you, because through his pain and brutal honesty we fall deeper in love with life's rich experiences. This music is profound, emotional, absorbing. And you haven't lived until you listen to THE DROP while 30,000 feet up in an airplane!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has it been ten years?","review":"...The album's greatest successes couldnt be further apart : \\"More Than This\\" is such an uplifting, eloquent statement of hope amidst the emotional turmoil of the album and indeed, our times, its like a blast of blue sky through the album's cloudiness with skittering, flamenco-like guitar lines and a transcendant drumming performance from Manu Katche. (Killer second single!) The dark \\"Signal to Noise\\" achieves equal grandiosity through deep drum lines, the piercing cries of the late Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and masterful orchestral backing. The production is outstanding, achieving an understated delicacy where literally every element of the music breathes and pulses. This can take away some of the more immediate and cathartic excesses of the orgiastic percussion feasts of PG III/IV, but thats just a difference, not a detriment..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOWN!","review":"Just horrible and out of touch and I'm seriously angry after a 10 year wait, and this comes from a fan who has loved everything he's ever done!

Where are the brilliant lyrics, the soaring vocals, the enthralling musical arrangements?? I picture the man in his studio late at night, mumbling out words when none came too readily, and I suspect record company pressure to get this album out when it wasn't nearly finished!

His lyrics vary here; some are simple--capturing of moments, some are deeper exploration of feeling and sadness, some are the result of his research type songs (Barry Williams-which is not about Greg Brady) where he delves into a topic. It feels like a retrospective but with new songs, with some vocals sounding like PG3 and PG4 (\\"Drop\\" reminds of \\"Family Snaphsot\\") the first track has a warble like \\"Moribund\\" from PG1, etc.... There is also a strange John Lennon-like quality to some of the vocals. It doesnt have the radio-friendly tracks that \\"So\\" and \\"Us\\" have had, but who cares. It sounds great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good music--but copy protected","review":"I'll leave the music reviews to everyone else here, but you might want to be aware the CD is copy protected, so you can't rip it to you computer-very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"PG Does it again!","review":"Peter Gabriel does it again! Awesome CD, Amazing Music, Full of feeling and life in that special way Peter Gabriel always does. My car got broken into and they took my cd player and a huge stack of CDs. They must have missed my PG CD and knocked it off in the floor. That was the only CD that I was concerned about and was sooooooo happy that it was still there, even tho I would have gone out that morning to buy a new copy!

It covers the broad range of their stance (be it religious or social or political), how they were treated during deliberation of their C.O. status, as well as many other topics. An excellent resource for research papers, as I'm finding.As a side note, as Amazon.com's information is slightly inaccurate, the book was authored by both Mulford Q. Sibley and Philip E. Jacob. Including the Appendix and Index, it is 580 pages long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book in the field","review":"The book really brings an in depth analysis of the modern financial world, through a very simple and easy to access method of presentation.

It holds a 10-12 cans with ice. The only thing it's missing is a dry pocket on the outside. The only down note I have is it retains water in the canvas around the air tube (not in the cooler itself), so when you take it out of the water it's really heavy and needs to be drained. Kept our beverages cold all day long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We have a lake house and an inflatable raft 30 feet off the dock.

Too late to send it back....should have stuck with a known brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"So handy on the river!","review":"I wish I had purchased this years ago. Why didn't I? We used ours to float down the river on inner tubes (3 people). It did great! Ran it over rocks with no problem. The outer covering of canvas like material seems to make it really durable. We could throw sunscreen in there, water, drinks, and some ice (but not much ice) since we went on a 3-4 hour float. Great item with a really reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks are deceiving","review":"When we blew the cooler up, it looked very small on the inside. However, we ended up fitting 6 large cans and 6 10oz bottles in along with ice. The cupholders are a great feature and since there are just 2 of us using it, we put extra bottles of water in them. Very good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"River Ice Chest","review":"The Ice chest worked great and held several cans and kept everything real cold for floating the river."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its okay","review":"This would be worth the money if it were bigger.

I have some normal wear and tear but for going over rocks on the rivers and being dragged around they have been more than adequate! Four of my friends have now bought some since it's the best thing they have been able to find. I would highly recommend this for tubing or evening hooking onto the raft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sure....","review":"Just received my floating cooler. Am a little disappointed that the interior of the cooler has no nylon liner....I'm thinking maybe I should have ordered the Aqua Oasis...it has a removable cooler that just sits inside the tube....and....there is NO outside zippered storage pocket! You should take that out of your description. I'll be trying it this weekend on the lake....we'll see how it performs.

The arm rests (which also serve the backpack straps when its folded-up) broke/tore within 20 minutes of use. Quite a dissapointment, as I generally like the chair. Given the price of the beach chair, you would expect better quality. I will try to fix it myself with some sewing, as its not worth my while shipping it back. In terms of comfort, its OK, not great, but not bad either. The one drawback with the canopy is that if you are of average height (I'm 5'11) you head will be pushed forward by the canopy. The one plus is the backpack feauture, which make it easy to carry, and is not too difficult to figure out (they could use better instructions).

As I lover of all William Gibson novels I can handle a future world and accompaning vocabulary. Mr Womack could I have a dictionary or something? Your expertise in a whole new language was skillful but I'd still like to know what happened. Sounded like a great idea. I loved A Clockwork Orange and it had a strange dialect as well.

The author takes a very short list of ideas of ways to see your children (who their friends are, what sports they play, what they like in school, what their dreams are) and tries to stretch it into an entire book without originality or creativity. I was terribly disappointed with the lack of effort the author made compared to cheaper options filled with more information, even a basic scrapping magazine (pick any of them) has more technique ideas, layouts, color schemes, product ideas, titles, and suggestions than this whole book.

(Shameless self-promoting - I have no pride.)Munchkin 3 is an expansion of the original Munchkin. It's not a complete game in itself. It provides no new variants to game play, no extra aspects to consider, no new rules. It's just more cards. More items, more monsters, more humor, more cool stuff.BUT... more cards means less card repetition which makes the game more fun and definitely increases the replay value.

I have heard many bootlegs that sound pristine compared to this. I literally had to turn my (100-watt) car CD player all the way up to even barely hear most of it. Many of the lyrics and the between-song dialog are practically unintelligible. This is extremely frustrating, especially knowing all the technology that's available now to fix these sorts of problems. This is 2003.

First of all, there really was no better way to end thie series and second, I was too happy to care. The plot of Lain has always been secondary.

In fact, I read it before I buy it, but I really needed to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nausicca Review","review":"I have always wanted this book series ever since I first saw it at my local library. I was finally forced to act when that library removed it from their shelves for some reason. This is an awesome series by an awesome author. I respect Miazaki's work so much just because it is original. I know that there was a movie of this book series made, but the movie doesn't even scrape the surface of how much detail was actually created in the original books. There is so much more happening in the story and so many more characters. It is really an expansive and interesting series, not to mention philosophically deep. But it's all wrapped up in some of the best art and one of the best storylines I have ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern-age Tolkien at work","review":"I like this refelective tale of a world decayed by the very deeds of its inhabitants, which somehow finds its own relevance to our environment nature these days. The pacing and complexities rival those issues that today's world is facing.Certainly too story-heavy for kids but satisfying for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have seen all his wrks but this is the best","review":"I have grown up whatching Miyazaki san's work. From totoro to laputa and more. All his works leaves you thinking and it can't get out of ones head. but only last year I found that he had comics! As I read his work was even better. The other work he's done is a bit happy happy dixieland but this one was portraying the truth in land corruption and the \\"maybe\\" future of man kind if the pollution doesn't stop. Conlcuding, Miyazaki Hayao san's work is all great filled with vivid land scape unforgetable characters, but the most important part is that it has theme of naturalism, but Nausicaa is the most vivid more unforgettbale and most naturalistic viewed book/manga/epic/movie you will ever see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondrous piece of work. Miyazaki at his best","review":"This excellent graphic novel took Hayao Miyazaki 13 years to complete, and all the hard work he put into it shows. This masterpiece of literature and art surpasses the Nausicaa movie he made, and everyone, no matter what age they are, can enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Metaphor of Our Own Era with a Good Message!","review":"Not only is Nausicaa one of the best manga titles out there, it also managed to capture the essence of a fantasy that resonates our own era.The story easily mimics the environmental problems of our days, where human civilization gets its comeuppance from mother nature. The girl Nausicaa represents the very few of us who still care for the crying world ecosystems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Go Go Whitesox","review":"Finally after 88 long years the Chicago White Sox are world champs once againThis dvd is a great wrap up of the postseason run and celebrations on the bonus features this is highly recomended for any Chi Sox fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an actual Review","review":"Some reviewer here said that the astros didn't score any runs. That is inaccurate. They did score many runs, but didn't win any games. I was at game 4 in Houston where backe was awesome but we couldn't score. Our offense just didn't do the job. But I'm still proud of the stros for the amazing run down 15-30 and left for dead all the way to the series. GO ASTROS. There are die hard astro fans out there like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"For every Sox fan","review":"I love this video. It presents the very best of the 2005 season and playoffs including great world series highlights.

Melito's Peri Pascha is translated in accessible English with scholarly comment. This slim volume can be read in an evening and considered for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I decided to read this book for the sake of comparison. My normal flow of reading revolves around SF novels of the intelligent, thoughtful, mind-bending type, so I was fairly disappointed in this book for that reason.There was a tremendous amount of action, but it offered little to people looking for drama or subtlety.I understand how people can enjoy this book, but it just isn't my personal cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for true beginners","review":"I should have taken more note of Robin's review. This book is NOT for someone who knows little or nothing about Exchange Server despite what the introduction of the book states. It jumps right in to migration issues and follows up with other subjects including installing and other administrative issues. There was no overview of what Exchange Server does as would logically be the first thing a beginners book would include. Purchasing and reading this book has been a waste of time and money for me. Maybe after I find a book that can get me up to speed I'll go back to this book and benefit from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very simple!","review":"Great Book for domains with child domains but for simple starters it is not what I thought it would be. Limited detail in the migration and even more limited in basic tasks. The book is good just not for starters. I recommend something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting block","review":"I did not know anything about exchange server and i tried to install it first up with no references, obviously encountering many problems. This book was a great help, after reading it i was successfully able to install and configure exchange with relative ease. It is as the title suggests, a beginners guide as it does not dive into to much detail that may be required for more complex administration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I don't much like the s-l-o-w-n-e-s-s of yoga, but I do like the stretching and relaxation benefits. This workout fits the bill - a little breathing practice at the beginning, which I am sometimes tempted to skip, but it does actually help me to focus :-P I love the flow-through poses, and while they are not held for an excessively long time (which I would hate), they aren't rushed through, either, like some of the Power Yoga I've tried. The instructor is encouraging without making me feel like a totally uncoordinated clod. I found the set and music to be quite relaxing. I also enjoyed the short ab-work at the end, although single-leg and double-leg stretches is Pilates, not yoga. The 30-minute length is just perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on the Plastic","review":"I might have been able to enjoy this workout were it not for the stiff, robotic instructor, and inauthentic--sometimes eerily downbeat--new age/zen music. It would have been nice if the instructor kept better eye contact, spoke as though she was there with you in a natural setting--rather than read mechanically from a prompter. She also has this strange head-nodding tick that just became another distracting turn-off. The DVD reminds me once again that with any lesson, the instructor can make it or break it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very upset","review":"I ordered this product at the beginning of September and I never received it- today is Oct 13. I tried emailing the seller, and they never responded. I hope your business goes down the tube because your business practices are TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Book of Lionel","review":"The book covers a wide range of subjects on planning, building and operating a Lionel O-guage layout, but does not go into a lot of detail. Both Post-War and Modern Lionel trains and tracks are covered as is the newer TMCC electronic controls. The photos of existing Lionel O-gauge layouts are excellent, but the book did not describe the type of track nor were track layout diagrams provided, which would have been very informative. Nevertheless, the book is interesting and provides a good overview of what to consider when planning and building a Lionel O-gauge layout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Toons","review":"After watching The Simpsons Anniversary Special in 3D on Ice, I wanted to revisit some of Groening's earlier works. The Big Book was sold out, so I went with this one, and I am not disappointed. There's a lot of funny, high quality strips in here. If anything, it makes me wish the Simpsons still had the edge Groening's series here. But if you're looking for a book full of self-referential, self-deprecating comic strips filled with bunnies, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS guy created the Simpsons?","review":"I can't believe that THIS guy created the Simpsons. This book isn't fun at all. I keep looking for it to be funny, and finding nothing. It's not worth the price of shipping. I grew up in the 80s and 90s, I understand that situational comedy was big then... but this is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"WW II Newsreels","review":"I ordered this thinking that it was another product.

If you don't have a problem with that, you'll love it. I just like getting what is described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tight enough","review":"When you see the Silicone skin case or even the description of it, you tend to think hard molded plastic. On the contrary, it is actually made of a loose, rubber-like substance. I did not like the way that it fit the device, it slides on and off to easily, also the material that it is made of sticks to the lining of your pocket, so it sometimes makes it difficult to get in and out of your pocket. I wish the product had a smoother tighter construction. In its defense it does match up exactly to all the components of the device it allows you to access the camera the speaker, USB port, all of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits like a glove but .......","review":"Fits like a glove but is that what you really want from this product ? When you're ready to use your (very expensive) smartphone it's very problematic to slide the screen out - not to mention the cheap feel of the plastic used (supposed to be silicone ?! Excuse me - it looks like really cheap plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching so students will truly understand.","review":"This book is excellent reading for teachers, school administrators, and school district managers who are truly interested and concerned with student achievement. Under a discussion of facets of understanding, readers are 'taught' to think like an assessor.

A Must Read for anyone interested in improving student learning or working with change within a school system."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MAGIC IS GONE","review":"Unfortunately, this falls under the heading of \\"band gets back together, but cannot recreate what they once had.\\" Without some of their original members, including the founder, it's easy to see why. I'm not saying this is really bad pop-rock, but as a FATE fan, I was expecting more, especially after the encouraging bonus tracks on their old cd re-releases.If you're a FATE fan, then heed my review. If not, it might be a bit expensive to make such a blind purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected. It was not as decribed.","review":"In the description it says the handle is metal/aluminum when it got here it was plastic. Had to return it. When you use it in the cold they break.

Unfortunately, as some might be able to read on the Target related reviews of the same product here, I weigh about 185,6ft \\"normal\\" guy and was quickly sinking to where I could basically feel the support poles every time. Unfortunately what would have been perhaps a 4 star comment later on became a 2 because my father laid down to relax, and he weights perhaps 200-210 max and the support structure completely ripped through, and he could have injured himself pretty badly. So I guess it's really the luck of the draw and I might risk myself at purchasing one again but through a brick and mortar store to be sure it can be returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"This portable hammock is a really nice purchase. It's pretty comfy and great to use in and outside. My only problems was it seems to weight more the 22lbs. It is still easy enough to carry around. Also, it doesn't have the big swing range of regular hammocks but I guess that's an ok trade off just to be able to take it with you. This is a very sturdy product that's a good size and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome for me","review":"Great price on a great product for solo lounging and napping. Compact and comfortable for my size of 5'10\\" 160. Struts appear to be plenty sturdy to withstand a trip in checked airline baggage unscathed. Will likely gift this one and search for the deluxe model with book and beverage holders built in. My item came in gray rather than blue. Ordered on a Saturday and arrived following Friday to New York standard UPS from merchant Guide Express with a UPS origin of Minnesota.I am a perfectionist consumer. For five stars this it would need the beverage and magazine holders and an option for some sort of sun shade for the head.Note: I could see heavy usage by two adults ripping the stitching out at the spreader bar attachment points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kelsyus Hammock-worth the relaxation by far","review":"Hammock is great!

I finally went for it and couldn't be happier. It is really easy to set up. The hammock is big and comfortable. My only complaint, which I knew would be the case, is that it is heavy. This makes it great for use at home and when camping or traveling in a car with very little walking/carrying necessary. I certainly won't be dragging it the the beach every weekend, but I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"portable hammock mmmm!","review":"I should have paid attention to the reviews.

This hammock is just that. I am 6ft 210lbs and I can only disagree with the poor reviews I have read. My main reasoning to disagree would be that this is not a rope hammock that takes a min. of 13ft and the cost is very low.Why complain about not getting a Cadillac when you paid for a Dodge. I find the product to be very sufficient and comfortable. I can only imagine that a more expensive and better quality hammock is superior, so if that is what you want then buy it. For everyone else... I think you will be content and satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable relaxation","review":"Forget about lounge chairs. This thing rocks! hehe. Sets up and breaks down in under a minute. A little tricky to get in and out of at first but, no sweat after a few tries. I'm 5'5\\" and it's perfect size for me. Caution to anyone over 6 feet, you're not going to fit on it too well also if you're over the 250 weight limit. Otherwise seems real rugged and easy to clean with a damp cloth. I wouldn't want to hike too far with this on my back though. It is quite heavy. Amazon's price is the best I found with the free shipping. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"very relaxing","review":"Easy to assemble. Very compact. And it is great using it outdoor as much as indoor.

This is the worst album she's ever made. Traditional country is all fine and good, and what she does best, but anyone who thinks these songs are good because they're \\"traditional\\" needs a reality check.Being \\"traditional\\" doesn't excuse the shoddy lyrics and way, way overproduced quality of this music.If you're looking for something to get a feel of Reba's early days, try \\"Behind the Scene,\\" or \\"Feel the Fire,\\" or \\"Unlimited.\\" Even her very first album, \\"Reba McEntire\\" has a better quality than this dud.There is seriously not one quality song on this whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST CDS I'VE EVER HEARD","review":"There's some great stuff on this one!

This book is a teen whine-fest about school, friends, and boyfriends. The entire book is a setup to the \\"bad thing\\" that supposedly happens..and then it actually doesn't happen. This is kind of of like watching the movie Titanic, except the officers are able to avert disaster, learn an important lesson, and everyone goes home happy. Not impressed. I know it's a teen book, but I would have enjoyed this more if the girl's life had been ruined and we get to read about how she actually deals with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Sticky Are Your Fingers?","review":"This book was ok. I liked the book but did not love it. The begining of the book was very slow but picked up towards the middle. The ending of this book was very good and very surprising!

I think it has a very important message with it. I encourage all girls to give this book a read. See what you get out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked.","review":"The first 200 pages were boring as hell. The only pages worth reading were in the end. The only thing good about this book is the cover, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"First off, the summary on the back of the book is totally misleading. \\"But one drink is all it takes for her perfect facade to shatter.\\" The incident that is supposed to be the whole lesson of the story occurs in the last 43 pages! In the copy I have, there are 274 pages total and she takes the drink on page 231! Ultimately, the summary on the back exaggerates everything and the book is really slow. I was looking for a good read but I got something that was completely boring and, in many ways, predictable. Even the title doesn't match. It doesn't even apply to the main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best","review":"I have read Royally Jacked and Spin Control and I must say, they were far better than this book. The main character rambled too much and even though her personality made her realistic, some of her thoughts made me question her sanity. i finished this book in two days and by the end, i was very disspointed. While i admired the attempt at Scott and Courtney's character twists, Courtneys seemed trivial while Scott's was a complete 360. I strongly recommend reading Royally Jacked and Spin Control but passing on this book because even though the author is great at what she does, this book does not prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better YA books...","review":"Nothing happened in this book until the very end, and that wasn't even exciting. Jenna is boring. Her boyfriend is boring. Her best friend is the only one with any spunk. The author could have really gone somewhere more emotional with the date rape drug storyline. Instead nothing happens, Jenna gets sick. There are probably better YA books out there that deal with date rape better than this. Do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I think this book would be better for a younger teen, or a teen who is used to reading teen books. I'm only 17 but I hardly ever read books found in the teen sections. So I think thats why I didn't like this book. It had lots of teen slang and cheesey high school girl talk and romances. (I know I'm in high school, but I'm just not used to reading things like this). It had a good concept and lesson in the end. I really did like the ending, but the rest of the book was just personally hard for me to get through. I would recommend this to any teen who typically reads teen books like this... but for anyone else who reads more mature novels, don't waste your time. Overall, it wasn't bad, but NOT for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"An elegant classical offering from a pop icon","review":"I'm program director of a classical music radio station, and this disc has become a favorite with our morning drive audience -- less idiosyncratic than Sarah Brightman's popular but over-hyped offerings, and Mouskouri's voice is richer (though with less power) as well. Mouskouri has always been more popular in Europe than the US but has had a strong following in America anyway. Even her most ardent fans must have been surprised when this disc was released a few years ago, for it is a surprisingly elegant and moving interpretation of classical melodies. A few retain their original lyrics, and Mouskouri has added lyrics to some works that were originally instrumental, but everything is handled with grace and style. And that voice! Fluid, silky, always balanced -- it's a wonderful disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Buy It.","review":"You cannot get a better message and uplifting photos for $10. It is such a bargin. Yes, I know the preview here at Amazon does not show you much, but this little book will inspire you, make you think about life, and is a wonderful little gift to a friend or loved one.

I have listened to parts of it.The CD is obviously a recording of a stage version of Chips, with some added songs. But also with some rather grievous omissions. Where is \\"London Is London\\" which was so beautifully performed by Clark - and for that matter Clark's soulful lament to \\"Apollo\\". This recording just won't do. I'm sorry I can't share the other reviewer's enthusiasm. I would much rather listen to the VHS version to get my fix. I do own the original MGM issue of the soundtrack on vinyl, thank God. It's about time the original with O'Toole & Clark were issued on CD. For that matter I would love to see this film on DVD also. So how about Apollo \\"make my dream come true\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally this CD was released!","review":"Ever since I saw the movie 'Goodbye Mr.Chips' starring Peter O'Toole I've been searching and hoping that someday the songs and lyrics of this great musical would be released. I have never seen the stage version of this musical however so I knew there would be some differences. It's been a while since I've seen the movie so I could be wrong on this, but I believe all of the songs featured on the movie are in the soundtrack...not sung by Peter O'Toole but equally as good I think. There were also some songs that were new to me, that weren't featured in the movie. Also, the plot of the stage version must be somewhat different from the movie, so there are surprises there as well. Overall my long awaited release of this soundtrack was met with a wonderful CD to add to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grab the movie soundtrack instead...","review":"I searched this one out hoping for great things (more \\"Chips\\" songs!), but what a let down!

It's good to have some practicality and clarity with essences so \\"everyone\\" can have the opportunity to use the them. If the essences are kept too confusing and too mystical then people will not want to even try the essences. If they would happen to need them, then that would be sad if it was too confusing for them to use. One thing I wish is that the author had included the list of essences with some descriptions of them, separate from the other listings. The listings that are in the book are by symptoms. Then the essences that are needed for that symptom are underneath. The essence is then described there. It's a very handy and understandable book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another perspective","review":"From my personal perspective, I did not find this book helpful. Possibly this was because, as one reviewer put it, it tries to take the mystery out of flower essences. Think about it - the workings of the essences are a mystery, even though the community is learning a lot about the situations in which a particular essence is most suited. I believe that it is a mistake to treat them as though they were drugs in the PDR, which I feel is the overall message of this book: find a sympton; prescribe an essence; Voila! An essence is a gift from the plant to the animal/human world and needs to be respected as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs an editor","review":"While the basic information is presented in a concise and well-organized manner, it was very distracting to fight through the grammatical mistakes, punctuation errors and/or typos on nearly every page!

What I got was a book with big type and lots of white space that offers little real information on performance improvement. Much of the book is about deployment options or coding tips and tricks unrelated to performance. For example, there are 24 pages on common naming practices.

Some of the good things in the manual are some of the specifications that it has for the bike, Tire pressure, Spark Plug gap and type, things of that nature.

The characters are 'real' as is the portrayal of life aboard ship. The men in this book, as in life, didn't start out to be heroes but, in the final analysis, became ones. The novel is written so that one feels apart of the action occurring and the experiences of the crews are our own. There is a point where one doesn't want the story to end but, conversely, can't wait to read the final outcome.

Still, the box set is value for the money, and a nice place to collect (mostly) all of Lisa's greatest moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and slow to get going","review":"This book contains very little continuum mechanics in it. It starts out with a tedious development of suffix notation, as well as two chapters developing the properties of cartesian tensors of second order. Unfortunately, this includes proving such basic things as the sum of two tensors being a tensor. The author seems to also enjoy avoiding conventional notation wherever possible, and places everything (products of matrices, products of matrices and vectors, cross products) in suffix notation, which blurs clarity quite often for those new to the convention. Furthermore, the fundamental laws of continuum mechanics are delayed until page 325 (the third from last chapter), leaving only two chapters (a measly two-thirds of the book) for elasticity and fluid mechanics. Finally, the style is a fairly strict theorem-proof, which makes it quite a dry read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a period piece","review":"Set in Rhodesia , as it then was, this is an evocative tale of war, romance and suspense.

Regardless of what you may think about her, the books on diet, exercise, and bioidentical hormones are no worse or better than anything else out there. I did take her advice and went to my primary care physician and told him I wanted off the HRT and wanted to use the bioidentical hormones in the dosages recommended by the Dr.'s interviewed by Somers. I have felt so much better that I have regreted I did not read her books sooner. I have struggled with menopause symptoms for years even when on Premrin.

This book has much to teach in regards to the symptoms of aging and safe recommended approaches to decreasing and or eliminating them.Again, I believe this is a must read. It describes the symptoms of menopause so well, that if men want to understand what women are going through during this time of their life, reading this book will show them. It also gives great insight into the changes that men go through as they age, which is helpful to both men and women in understanding the changes occurring.

I gave it away. It only talked about the discussions Suzanne and the doctors or so-called experts had to say. She also made a lot of assumptions. It was just a lot of interviews. There were no suggestions as to what you should take, only suggestions to go to such and such a place and mention certain things you should be taking and hoping that someone understands what you are talking about and give it to you. Many women can't take the hormones or follow the regiment. All in all, I found the book very disappointing. Anybody could have done what she did-research with no definite conclusion. It was all about her and what worked for her. I can say that Suzanne was very lucky. Wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dare she","review":"Suzanne Somers has crossed the line - from a sensible advocate of bioidentical hormones to an out-of-control MD-wannabe.

Wiley, who has zero medical credentials. Before any women buy into the Wiley Protocols outlined in this book, they should do some internet research and read about the women who have tried it and now bitterly regret it.

She consistently bashes feminism & feminists by name, blaming this \\"modern movement\\" for the state of women's health. She repeats over & over how we need to have lots of babies, breastfeed, skip birth control [no thanks, Suzanne, that was the life of my short-lived elders]. She praises the health habits of Bush, while damning Bill Clinton; she even manages to mention Monica! What is going on here? Is she planning on running for office? The vegetarian rant was also weird. Lastly, I had a hard time reconciling her preventive prehysterectomy with her claims of safety.Overall, I had a hard time taking her seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless By Suzanne Somers","review":"This book made such a strong impact on me, I bought one for several of my friends.

Potentially life changing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream the Nearly Impossible Dream","review":"When heard on television Ms. Somer's vision and ideas sound very positive and encouraging for fighting the battle for a quality life. The devil is in the details as reading about the whole concept brings sharply into question the medical aspects and the availability of the entire process to the average consumer. My end take was that the medical benefits are secondary to the ability of the average consumer to actualize her program.

I also applaud her ability to recover from cancer on her own terms. But I have serious issues with this book, which promotes the use of bioidentical hormones to \\"treat\\" the natural aging process that accompanies menopause.You cannot put something into your body without it affecting every organ and system. The long-term effects of systemic hormones have NOT been studied. They may cause cancer, strokes or heart disease, just as synthetic hormones did. To take them willy-nilly just to look young, considering the unknown risks, seems vain and foolish.Not all of us are willing to compromise our health in the name of vanity. Readers should proceed with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless Indeed","review":"\\"Ageless\\" by Suzanne Somers is a splendid account of her personal history with aging and hormones. it is an excellent book which reads well because, for the most part, it is in layperson's terms and easy to understand. there is a lot of technical information for those who really want to know the details. i, myself, want the bottom line, and i get that here too.mind you i have questions for Suzanne, and i am not 100 percent convinced that the bioidentical hormone is the answer to all of my issues, but i do believe it might be worth a try, and this material is presented in such a positive, upbeat manner with quotes from many medical professionals that it is really convincing.i would definitely recommend this book for anyone with aging/menopause/hormone situations because it is thought-provoking and informative. i may even go out and purchase suzanne's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick delivery in perfect condition!","review":"I recieved my order for Suzanne Somer's 'Ageless' and Dr Michael Platt's 'The Miracle of Bio Identical Hormones' very quickly and in perfect condition.

He has agreed to read it and I hope next time I go to see him I will be able to obtain the prescription for these wonderful bio hormones mentioned in her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ageless","review":"I am disappointed in this book. Suzanne comes off as a medical authority on bioidentical hormones. She is not a practicing doctor, so how can she make recommendations on a conversational system of administering hormones called the Wiley protocol. The doctors on Larry King Show should have taken her to task. Suzanne has done a good job of educating women about the impact of insulin on their weight. However, she fails to discuss that at the age of 60, she is taking human growth hormone which helps people lose weight. It is a very expensive and controversial therapy. Believe me she doesn't look the way she does just by dieting. She also has had plastic surgery which she reluctantly admitted to. Women have to stopped being influenced by these hollywood types who hustle books and products to get rich. We all age and go through menopause. There is no magic bullet to weight loss. Eat less and excercise more. We will all get wrinkles and start to sag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things you need to know","review":"After watching the lopsided hit piece on ABC's 20/20, I read Ageless. My girlfriend is taking bio-identical hormones, and she's done a far better job of researching the subject than 20/20, who made a huge deal out of a typo (Gambia, instead of Georgia) in a sentence about longevity. When you don't have a coherent argument, blow smoke.Read this book, and then decide for yourself. But I have an old Popular Mechanics magazine from the '50's, which raves about the benefits of hormones made from coal tar. Big pharma has shown time and again that they tend to value profits over the health of people, their customers; the evidence shows that bio-identical hormone replacement therapy is NOT the same as standard horse-pee replacement therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"might be great movie--but must have bundles of cash for treatment","review":"THis movie may have grand things to report about the doc's ideas for treatment of cancer, AND my friendwho has moved from middle stages to late stages of cancer, has attempted to get this wonderfultreatment for cancer listed on the movie from the doctor, and lengthen his life span,BUT the doc takes no insurance and requires a car load of cash, which my friend did notand does not now have.

Even with the very quiet and beautful scene at the end that gives the audience time to reflect and reel back from the emotion of this film it also ends on a positive note despite all the tragedy and injustice that has gone on.Just be prepared for a very powerful movie. Kind of like the feeling you get after watching movies like 'The Killing Fields' or 'Shooting Dogs'. Conequently give yourself the time and space to watch this without being disturbed and certainly in one go, to really appreciate it.

You can sit there for hours trying to find 'the pattern' to color. The majority of images are outstanding and a blast to color.

It's ridiculously attractive album and \\"Third of June\\" is one of the most powerful rock songs I've heard. Yes I said \\"rock\\" because this album really rocks. In different kind of way though.This is also the only album that EVERYONE I have played it loves immediately. It's amazing that this wasn't a HUGE hit when it originally came out. Stella, Flag and You gotta say yes... are Yello in their prime.Personally, I don't care about the new techno stuff at all, they should never abandon this original and experimental stuff they did in the 80's. This album is amazing, I own about 3000 CD's and this easily goes to my top 10.Priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST SYSTEM TEST CD's","review":"IMO- this is CD is not only one of the best system test CD's I have ever heard but it is also the best Yello CD.

It has the horns and wah-wah guitars that were the black music standard at the time. It also features some crazy, distorted bass playing by some William Collins kid. And some decent lyrical concepts that rose above the usual love song treacle. \\"Together\\" and \\"RIde On\\" are incredibly fun, and \\"Big Footin'\\" manages to keep the listener's head bobbing despite the fact the melody changes three times within the song! THe only real weak link within the album would be \\"Let Me Be\\" which is boring despite the inspiried vocals. All in all, a funky, if unpolished album.

But this album IS addictive, as someone else here had already written. No other band sounds like this. Although they, on this album, have removed a little bit of the multilayered rhythmic and melodic complexity that has always marked their music, it makes for a stronger work of art in the end. This thing just blazes: there are certain segments on this album that are the best things they have ever written. Extreme speed, achingly original melodies and bizarre atmospheres. Probably my THIRD favorite Abigor disk, after the beautiful Nachthymnen and the incredible Supreme Immortal Art. If you are a fan of original, creative, innovative music that is filled with passion and which strives to break through boundaries and stale cliches in the metal scene, check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A whole new realm of black metal","review":"These guys may have set the record for most leads in a black metal album, in fact im sure they have.

If you buy an Apple Cradle it's about $40 and add a USB 2.0 5-port Hub (which by the way most of them are really ugly and only 4-port) for $20 it's already a bit higher than buying this single device that helps you avoid clutter on your desktop as well.Pros: no cable clutter, slim design, cradle for ipod and usb 2.0-hub, audio out, usb 1.1 and 2.0 compatible.Cons: The leds on the front are a bit flashy for my taste, ipod re-connects and goes to \\"do not disconnect\\" mode every time I power up any other ac-powered devices connected to the hub.Overall: Good device, great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to perfect","review":"I bought this because I needed a USB 2.0 hub for my laptop and this has the bonus of having a dock for my iPod Nano. It fills both roles very well. I have three issues with it: First, it didn't come with an insert for the second gen Nano so it sort of just floats in there, be careful not to smack it or I'm sure it'll break the connector. Second, the ports on the hub are very close together. Not a deal breaker but mildly annoying. Last, occasionally when coming out of standby mode on my laptop the mouse plugged into the hub isn't recognized. All that's required to fix it is to unplug the hub from the laptop and then plug it back in. Not a big deal unless I'm using my portable hard drive. Overall I'm happy with the device so it gets four stars in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupported by Belkin","review":"I purchased two of these hubs as a way to keep limited desk space clutter down. Initially, it worked well, but over time it failed. Repeated attempts to work with Belkin tech support (or more specifically, lack of) proved fruitless. Initially, they even refused to admit they made the product. There are no updated drivers beyond the disk shipped with the product. I am running Windows XP Pro, service pack 3. Both SP2 and SP3 indicate this has a hardware conflict. Uninstalling completely and reinstalling per their eventual advice has not cleared the conflict. The PC (HP Media Center) simply refuses to connect for more that charging the iPod. No synch on iTunes and no other devices pass signal. It's now a rather expensive charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good hub. But no support for updating dock adapters","review":"This is a good USB 2.0 hub. The inclusion of an ipod dock is handy but there is a drawback. Belkin has made the dock incompatible with the Apple dock adapters so you cannot use a plastic Apple dock adapter for newer iPods and the iPhone with this hub.This would not be a problem if Belkin would release new plastic dock insets to match newer iPods and the iPhone. Unfortunately, after several emails and phone calls to Belkin tech support the final answer is that Belkin will not be releasing plastic dock adapters for more recent iPod and iPhone models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just works","review":"I needed a dock for my iPod, but didn't want One More Thing cluttering up my desktop.

This is the nicest low cost digital model that I found. After using it for a couple months it works great! The buttons feel nice and overall has a well-built solid feel to the unit. I think this will last for many years. However there is one thing I wish it had (the reason for 4 stars on the review instead of 5): you can set 4 different custom timers, but you can only choose one of these modes at a time so the device will only turn on and off one time per day. In other words you can't turn something on at 2pm turn it off at 3pm then back on again at 5 pm and off again at 6pm. That's impossible with this unit; instead there's only one on/off cycle, but you can manually switch between 4 of these cycles (plus the zip set and random settings).

For me this is the type of book that would put potential students off bioinformatics for life. It is too technical and uses inappropriate notation.

It's been a solid performer although now I'm having a little difficulty pinning down a source to replace the polyurethane band that just broke from wear and tear. I wouldn't recommend the watch as a primary dive watch, particularly if you're a cold water diver (impossible to work with gloves on). I do wear the watch as an every day watch and for when I'm free diving, snorkeling, open water swimming or any on water activity. I do also attach the watch to my BC as a back up chronometer when I dive (generally 40' - 100'). I haven't had any trouble with water getting into the case. The convex bezel and luminescent hands & hash marks make reading it under water and in low viz pretty easy. I don't use the alarm, so I can't speak to that. There are easier watches to use and read available (digital back lit for instance), but I like the styling and the heft of the watch so I chose it over more utilitarian watches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for the price!","review":"This watch sells for $120 at the local surf shop. Amazon has it for $70!!! Can't beat that! The watch itself is great. The poly band will only last a year or year and a half before it cracks and breaks off. The rotating bezel will pop off if you drop it. It usually snaps back on, but will not click when you turn it, just spins. The watch looks great though. Just take care of it! Don't drop it, and don't expect the band to last you years! This is my third Freestyle watch. Just wish the poly band would last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bummer of a birthday present","review":"I am currently sending this watch back to Freestyle. I'm hoping that it is covered under the warranty. This is supposed to be a dive watch for up to 200 meters. Well.... it didn't last one \\"dive\\" in our swimming pool.

That fact alone should be a BIG red flag.While the Bible does contain numerous examples of the demonization and subsequent deliverance of unbelievers, there is not one example involving a believer.Is this not an odd oversight on the part of the Holy Spirit, the Author of Scripture, if the demonization of Christians really is the danger many would have us believe it to be? Why didn't God warn us of this problem, as well as give us clear guidelines on how to deal with it? He did neither because it's a non-issue.I am forced to disagree with an earlier reviewer: I believe Satan DOES want you to read this book in order to trap you in the very fear-driven, demon-obsessed bondage folks like Dickason, Neil Anderson and others would presume to break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"um?","review":"Wow, I had such high hopes for this movie just from the cover shots.

His eye for detail and the ability to unfold latent meanings in art and literature parallels only to that of S. Liberman in his work on Hellenism. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute best explanation for behavior, wars, pretty much the basis of European history. I","review":"I bought this because I wore my previous copy out.It is a must have when traveling in Europe, but it is invaluable while reading other histories, as it carries so much of the layering of attitudes, behavior, invention of rules and manners.Anyone who loves history will love this book. It is written and translated in a clear and concise manner from beginning to end. This is important to me, as I find that many books of this type will kind of peter out at the end, as if the author tired of the subject.The best example of this is a book which should be fascinating from beginning to end, \\"Life in a World Lit Only by Fire\\". It starts out just great, but then gets less and less imformative."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is of major importance to Dutch history-writing","review":"This book is written in a grotesque and literary manner. Johan Huizinga, the Great Dutch pre-War historian, possesses large cultural acknowledge and a huge historical skill. Comparisons can be made with Burckhardt's book about the Renaissance. If you want to know something about the later Middle Ages, especially in France and the Burgundian Countries (Low Countries), you must read this book for fully understanding the cultural-historical aspects of human medieval life and thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"out-dated.","review":"Even though this book is a clasic, the main thesis of Huizinga is rather out-dated. Recent studies have shown that the decadence that Huizinga discribes isn't accurate -- none the less there was, no doubt about it, a crisis. So, I'm giving this book one star not because it's that bad, but because I think its neccesary to pull down the ratings it has; now a days it doesn't deserve them. Intresting reads for anyone intrested in the Middle Ages -- and that are more up-to-date -- are Jacques Heers \\"The Invention of the Middle Ages\\" and Jacques Le Goff \\"La Civilisation de L'Occident Medieval\\". Although these books can contradict each other in various points, the first one is intresting (although sometimes arbitrary) because it deconstructs the popular image that exists about the Middle Ages. The second one is intresting because it gives a general overview of the historical procceses that take place between the XI and the XIV centuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"A friend gave this to me.

And even that's beside the point, since the quotations are always so short, often a single sentence no more than fifteen words long. As for the so-called recipes, they're just one or two paragraphs, running to no more than fifty, sixty words per entry (for both quotation and recipe), and they're completely superfluous. You get infinitely better recipes at the back of any cereal box. To put it another way, never have I seen such a gigantic waste of paper in so miniscule a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb retelling of the Ulster cycle of Irish legends","review":"While this retelling is written primarily for younger readers it is anything but childish. The sex and bloody mayhem of the source material, central to the explanations of the actions of the protagonists, remains. Consequently, even though the stories are about \\"superheroes\\", these heroes remain, in very many ways, recognisably human, driven by deeply human motives of honour, jealousy, love, lust, greed and envy. Often the most heroic can be petty and the most venal given to acts of great courage.Sutcliff clearly took the time to ensure that the stories were properly rooted in the geography of the North of Ireland and the West of Scotland, something that adds to the pleasure of the reading. A classic that will bear reading and re-reading again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"WITH THIS HDMI CABEL THE PICTURE QUALITY IMPROVED A LOT.

I know the series is only 11 episodes and in the last episode the producers didn't follow very close for whatever reason, but that doesn't take away from the charm. If you are super concerned you should read the manga because it is even better. The only problem is unless you can read Japanese, Italian or French you will have to use one of the online manga readers to read it. Again I personally don't mind. I signed up for one of the sites and I get updates when a new chapter is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the most relatable anime I've ever watched.","review":"If there's ever been a single moment in your life where you've felt impossibly awkward or socially impaired, this anime will most definitely make you smile. Not to mention you will almost undoubtedly find yourself rooting for the cross-dressing Kuranosuke in his attempts to help and win the heart of the strange jellyfish fanatic, Tsukimi. For sure a feel good, heart warming title. Here's to hoping for a season 2, Funimation. <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fell in love with anime all over again.","review":"Like some people out there, I was one of the ones who was getting burnt out on anime; the beautiful storylines started to run into each other and look very much the same. But Princess Jellyfish is definately different than the rest! For which I am glad as it has renewed my love for the anime genre. I've watched only the first few episodes On Demand so I cannot speak for the overall plot of the show, but what I have seen is very tender yet extremely funny.

I lucked out with this one purchasing it based on just the reviews. I am a martial artist and have Trochantric Bursitis in both of my hips. This video along with a styrofoam roaller has done wonders to stretch all those muscles in my hips and my IT band."},{"rating":"2","title":"very thorough routine","review":"This is a pretty challenging routine. It is the most thorough of any yoga hip routines I have found so far. If you don't like to use props, you may not like this one. While I don't have a wall space to do yoga, I was able to effectively do all of the exercises in the video with some sort of temporary solution, except for the ones where she uses a rug on the floor for sliding exercises. If you have a carpeted floor, you are supposed to use a garbage bag. This didn't work for me because I kept sliding off the garbage bag.So, I was frustrated that I couldn't do those exercises effectively. Even so, I find this program to be very helpful for hip pain/issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT yoga - more like boring physical therapy","review":"I like yoga and am more flexible than average, but my hips tend to be tight which is why I bought this video. I expected it to be a great yoga routine full of helpful hip poses like pigeon and ankle-to-knee seat. It did not include either one of those basic hip-opening yoga asanas - in fact it didn't really feel like a yoga routine at all. It felt more like doing boring physical therapy. Also you need to have props to do this video, including two blocks, a ledge at about knee height, another ledge about waist height, a hardwood floor, a blanket, and possibly a strap unless you are very flexible in your hips already (in which case, why are you buying this video?). Aside from all this, the video is just dull. I was incredibly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful introduction to the projective approach in math and art","review":"An innovative thinker and a gifted artist, Tony Robbin filters the world of mathematics through the nuances of human vision, creating masterful representations of higher dimensions. His new book stands as a testament to his meticulous scholarship of the history of projective geometry, in mathematics, physics and art. It is a thoroughly enjoyable account of how the notion of finding shadows of the fourth dimension emerged in the 19th century, permeated modern art in the 20th, and now represents one of the frontiers of computer graphics in the 21st. Along the way, Robbin shows how projective geometry could provide the key to a quantum description of gravity. A must read, for the curious anecdotes, cutting-edge science, impressive array of references, colorful art, and insight into how we can perceive the seemingly imperceptible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds a new dimension","review":"Shadows of Reality discusses the 4th dimension in math and art.

Mr. Kaufman certainly has a knack for fiction. This book was as funny as the Hitchhiker trilogy. Perhaps Lloyd missed his calling when he went into film, I hope he considers writing more.

Well, here's exactly what NOT to do. Troma film and vidio, the oldest running indepedent film company has been keeping their heads above water for 25 years and none of them seem to know how they've done it. Join Lloyd Kaufman and the rest of the Troma crew for a hilarious adventure through 25 years of some great film making and some terrible film making. Did you ever wonder how to make green foamy vomit, or how they make those wonderful head squishing and decapitation sceens look so real on a nonexistant budget? I know you're all dying to know who played the bum in Rocky. Find the answers to these questions and get to know the Toxic Advenger by reading this book. If you didn't love Troma before, you will now! (After 3 days Lloyd remembered MY name.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that actually inspires while being fun to read","review":"Troma may be known for schlock than education but that's the wrong way to look at it. This book isn't exactly a how-to book as much as a memoir showing that a guy, whose interest in movies stareted in his college dorm room, can 30 years later be in charge of the oldest independant film studio in the world then anyone can do it. Obviously this book will be more interesting to Troma fans because it references some older Troma classics. But if you are reading this book you are probably an aspiring film maker and you should take a look at \\"Tromeo and Juliet\\" or \\"Citizen Toxie\\" to see what else is out there aside from studio style films. Lloyd's commentary ranges from hilarious to heartwarming. Everyone with an interest in independant film should read this book. Now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Roll on, Troma juggernaut...","review":"This book is incredibly hilarious. While you may not learn everything Lloyd learned from the Toxic Avenger from reading this book, it will certainly leave you infected with Mr. Kaufman's enthusiasm for filmmaking. It is both entertaining and inspirational. (And there's always his 'Make Your Own Damn Movie' book for further nuts-and-bolts moviemaking advice.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly inspiring","review":"In this book, Lloyd Kaufman, president of the impossibly quirky Troma Studios, shares insights and practical advice about making low-budget (or no-budget) feature films. Lloyd's writing style is just as unusual as the movies he directs, as he meanders aimlessly from self-deprecating autobiography to detailed, spur-of-the-moment instructions on how to fake an onscreen head crushing or make actors appear to vomit green foam. There's also plenty of out-of-place crude and scatological humor peppered heavily throughout. I wouldn't have expected anything else from Kaufman, whose unfathomably eccentric (but amiable) personality and genuine love for the art of do-it-yourself filmmaking shine through on every page. Fans of Troma, young and old, owe it to themselves to read this book. It really is an inspiring read for all of us who have the filmmaking bug but often become too easily defeated by lack of funds or crew members. Long live Troma!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LLoyd Kaufman Rocks and he writes good books too","review":"This book is one of the best books I have read to.

But the title of the book is deceptive. It's not really another stuffy lecture about the logistics of filmmaking. It's a silly but insightfull look at the depraved life and times of a truely unique individual. The lunatic ravings from someone who has made a career out of taking on the system. Save your film school tuitition and use it for something useful like pornography.

All of them are the same; sell your car, max out your credit card, hit your parents up for money. Blah blah blah. What Llyod does is not go into details about the production of independent(although we do get the recipe for zombie vomit for the price of admission), Llyod covers more of the spirit of independent cinema, and how it's alive in it's purest form with Troma. With this book Lyod inspires a new breed on independent filmmakers, and secures the Troma legacy. Llyod earns his place in history with John Handcock, Malcolm X, and Richard Speck as a true American patriot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, Best Book on Filmmaking EVER!!","review":"This is, by far, the best book for an aspiring filmmaker. Laced with entertaining anecdotes, as well as practical filmmaking advice on actors, props, and even special effects.

A must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I love How-To books. I've read scores of them and have learned something worthwhile from every one. Except this one. It's 300 pages of self-indulgent, autobiographical rambling.I wanted to get an overview and some nuts-and-bolts insights into independent filmmaking. Instead I got Kaufman talking about himself, which is his favorite thing to do. It's not uninteresting, and he is a character, but where's the beef in the burger? It's all condiments and anecdotes about how clever and iconoclastic and offensive the producer is. Here and there he lets slip real information such as how much soundtrack editing costs per day, but most of this will only interest fans of Troma films.A really helpful nonfiction book will give you a bibliography at the end so you can find more information on the topic. Kaufman the salesman gives a 22-page filmography of Troma productions so he can make more money off you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The same as his other book","review":"Anyone considering purchasing this who has bought David Franson's other book \\"2D Artwork and 3D Modelling for Game Artists\\" should think again. This book is just a much smaller version of that. I bought them both, and I was quite disappointed that David would just blatantly copy his other work. There are a few different tutorials but it's not worth paying the price, get the other book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Although quite adept in Photoshop, I thought this book gave me more \\"lessons\\" then I thought initially possible. Overall, I thought it was an excellent read as one can read this over a weekend sitting in front of the computer and replicating each step 1 by 1, or just out on the couch for fun. From the author's insights into game texturing, I was able to quickly gleam how I could instantly recreate the same effects and now am confident discussin game texturing techniques with anyone. I don't generally write reviews, but this one was worth it. This is definitely a good book for anyone who wants to UP their skills and deepen their knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some-what dated and tacky","review":"I found this book to be some-what dated and the examples of textures to create suitable if your planning to put them into a game of late 90's graphical quality, at least thats what the demonstation photos look like anyway, I was very dissapointed at the overall texture qualities.There is also random bits of information about weapons and things which are totally unrelated to textures all together and although I'm sure there fascinating I didn't buy this book to find out about the history of a rocket-propelled grenade launcher.A lot of the \\"free\\" texture photos provided on the CD are, in my opinion, quite useless, they are either framed on a random angle cutting out useful parts, partially out of focus or heavily shadowed.I was very disappointed with this title and would reccommend buying - 3D Game Textures by Luke Ahearn if you are looking for a good professional standard book to teach you how to make quality game textures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dated techniques","review":"These approached for things are unfortunately a bit dated and I felt reading through the text that things were going to be a bit cookie cutter. With new practices such as normal mapping, specularity mapping and such, this book covers the most basic of steps in texturing without going into much theory about how to create procedural textures to a great degree of detail.I would recommend getting Digital Texturing and Painting by Owen Demers as your primer to interpret what you see in the real world and my school teaches and recommends 3D Game Textures: Create Professional Game Art Using Photoshop. The work I have seen the students in the game texturing class at my school is very impressive and it looks a much higher caliber of work than what could be done learning from this Dark Side book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot book","review":"If you want to lean to texture anything using Photoshop, try this book. David starts off with general explanations of how-to's and parameters required for various game engines. Then each chapter is filled with great texture examples-- he starts of easy, using Photoshop techniques I've never used, and creates cool textures mostly from scratch or using photo elements as a base (as most texture artists do). There's even a couple of small sections that show a 3D model unwrapped and textured. I highly recommend this book if you want to learn how to texture anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book would have been awesome in 1998","review":"This book as really good basic information, although most of the other information is obsolete.

I emailed them again asking for an update. 72 hours later, they replied with a \\" It was sent but USPS states that media material takes slightly longer to deliver sometimes\\". Seriously? Four weeks late? I know US Postal is snail mail but give me a break, they're not THAT slow. My requests for a refund have fallen on deaf ears.

Sometimes you don't get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy gold","review":"David Franson does a fantastic job of showing aspiring texture artists how to strive for ever greater levels of mediocrity in this book, which amounts to little more than a printed compilation of the basic free tutorials you could find in 20 minutes of Google searching.The example textures Franson walks you through are pretty basic and lame, and the included images on the CD are hilarious by themselves. For example, a lot of them have a major case of flash burn or other serious irregularities that make them very bad source material for your own textures-no amount of cloning or doctoring can salvage a nicely tiling texture out of many of the images on the CD. You're better off building your own collection of source and reference images by searching for \\"Mayang\\" and \\"CGTexture\\" on Google.However, it is not without redeeming value-it's a great comedic read if you're a more experienced texture artist than the author. That bar, if this book is anything to go by, is pretty low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is awesome... author teaches how to create a ton of really cool textures, not cheesey ones i've seen online. if you want a great place to start for games and mods, this is the book-- he even covers weapon skinning but wish there was more on character skins.

The only thing I can figure is that we have reached the sorry pass where our academic MFA professors and their students like anything that doesn't sound like poetry. No need to despair, though.

The other one I put in the water didn't break, but continued to crack and would have smashed apart with any pressure. I packed them up and shipped them back right away.

Of course, depth-psych mavericks like me keep wondering whether, for example, the game of life is less a matter of holarchies, growth, and spiritual ascendance than of a deepening down and enriching of soulful experience (regardless of where you are in someone else's hierarchy)--but Wilber supplies the best overall developmental scheme I know of.

Thompson by reading this book. It is one of those epochal sensations, as Tom Woolf called it that becomes more effective with every passing decade. It is one of the craziest trips around, a buddy-road trip to the \\"savage heart of the American Dream.\\" Thompson's drug-fueled \\"trip\\" to a Las Vegas convention of police chiefs is less a journalistic tour-de-force than a ground-breaking, rule-discarding primer on \\"the new journalism,\\" a movement that many believe began with this book. Many successful journalists aspired to write the way Thompson did, but none of them succeeded. Thompson was literally, the only effective practitioner of the Gonzo style he invented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild, astute, articulate and stunning in detail.","review":"Hunter S.

But mostly comedy. Thompson is a gifted writer, there's no doubt about it. He makes the novel funny - it's not just the hilarious story doing that. His cynical, totally unique and offbeat writing style is exremely fun to read. Furthermore, he does actually look deeper than tons and tons of drugs (though maybe it's just through those drugs), and reflects on the 60s and the American Dream. Really.You will definately laugh, and possibly squirm at some of the situations they get themselves into. But if you've made it this far, you won't regret reading this novel.

Mostly I just found it self-indulgent and tedious. This is your basic story of two guys badassing around, 70s style. Really not much different from Animal House or any other frat story. It is a little ruder than F. Scott Fitzgerald and not as glitzy as Less Than Zero. Not badly written, and yeah, Vegas is ugly and scary, but this book is just too impressed with itself. Any claims of deep social commentary or other insight are vastly overinflated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely Pointless","review":"I put Hunter S. Thompson on my reading list this month, since I haven't read anything book-length by him before. Sadly, I found Fear and Loathing to be mostly pointless. Undoubtedly, Thompson is a gifted writer; in the hands of a lesser talent, Fear and Loathing would be ridiculous rather than merely pointless.The plot, such as it is, has been noted in other reviews so I won't attempt to recount it here. Fear and Loating reads like a poor man's Tom Wolfe. Thompson and his lawyer run around Vegas getting outrageously stoned and doing crazy things. Near the end, there's a fairly laughable attempt to make serious sense of the 60's drug scene, with some sort of quasi-justification of Hell's Angels founder Sonny Barger.Is Fear and Loathing really bad? Not really. There's just not much of a point. It's another hopelessly dated, overhyped drug era entry praised by the same critics who still think Pynchon's relevant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whattawaytogo","review":"When I heard last night on the Drudge Report that the Hemingwayof our times had shot himself-at first, I couldn't believe it-nor could Drudgie.

I found this book sophomoric and rambling. I saw no point in the drug-infested antics and childish behavior by him and his lawyer friend even for hilarity value. It, unfortunately, did remind me of a time when all cops were called pigs and people in the military were viewed as scum as detailed in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was stupid","review":"Some people I know were reading this book so I though I might take it on. In the beginning I was quite compelled and couldn't put it down.

I thought there might be a some kind of \\"lesson\\" to be learned at the end, but that wasn't the case. No consequence for illegal, immoral choices and actions.

After the first 43 pages it dawned on me this was not a book but rather a masterpiece, akin to Michelangelo's Pieta, or Rodin's Thinker. Warhol tried to remind us art abounds, as we're each artists. But Hunter lives the art, almost with the solitary focus of a monk, and his intentions direct results that this book provides, which is completely hilarity plus insanity. A book? Nope, low rating as a book. This is an experiential life form!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I have to admit that this was a required book for a college course I took on art and criminality, most of the required books I found interesting, but this was very boring and silly. I didn't like how the book had a modern tone and yet is obviously set in a past time. It is hard to imagine the Vegas they describe to a younger reader. Also the drug culture that is talked about profusly in the book is both boring and pointless. I think you would have to be interested in the drug sub culture to like this book and that is something I am not. Maybe this book is interesting to a certain type of reader, but I found it more or a nuissance than a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas","review":"This is a book that depicts the insanity of Hunter Thompson's life in an insane era.

Yes. American Dream? Where?","review":"I thourougly enjoyed Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson. I found the book to be stimulating and for the most part, enjoyable. It was hard to believe that such an outrageous story was true. Mr. Thompson, if you ever read this, please explain to me how your nervous system has not entirely shut down. Being someone who was ignorant to the world of drugs, alcoholism, and gambling, Fear and Loathing was an eye opener.The only thing I can possibly find disagreeable about the book was the business involving the American Dream. Throughout the entire story the main goal is to find the American Dream. However, never does it actually specify what the American Dream is. Is the American Dream driving around with thousands of dollars of drug paraphernalia? Is the American Dream ruining numerous hotels and spending money that isn't yours? Or is the American Dream simply seeking the American Dream?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter S. Thompson - brilliant, or utterly insane?","review":"I bought this book for a class, and had no intention of enjoying it half as much as I do. Hunter S. Thomson (writing as \\"Raoul Duke\\"), entertains and enlightens the audience as he travels with his \\"attorney\\" to Las Vegas to cover a story. Readers are transfixed into \\"Duke's\\" world of intense drug use, hilarious (and sometimes dangerous) encounters with hitchhikers, police and other assorted supporting characters.This is a book you will either love or hate, but in either case, you will not want to put it down, if just to see what crazy events take place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely wonderful pick","review":"This book will crack you up until you finish the last page!!!

I haven't the heart to tell him I really don't get it. I've read some tripped out, scatterbrained stuff in my day, but this just confounds me. I think it's supposed to be the ultimate in excess, or maybe not. I think it's supposed to be funny, and I'm not reading it that way. Or maybe not. I can't tell. I have gotten about halfway in, and it's not going anywhere. Considering this has such a strong reputation, it's not cutting it for me. About the only compelling thing about it to me is how the two main characters can handle so much booze and drugs. Most of us would be face down for 3/4 of the story if we were in it. Page after page I keep waiting for something to get rolling, but it never does. Is that the whole point? Sorry, but this is not worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"i missed the boat","review":"I just did not get this one. The whole anti-establishment, negative view in the 60's did not come out of the book for me. It just read like a couple of idiots on a party binge with each chapter a copy of the last. I am a party person too and just did not think their antics were that funny. Maybe I am too young to enjoy this story. Not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"After reading many of the excellent reviews on Thompson's book I decided to purchase it. I tried liking it, and sometimes did, but overall I don't see the point. I wanted to take something away from the book, whether for better or for worse, some type of message - unless I totally missed it, no message at all. Two druggies, always high, rambling on, no direction and again no message. I would not recommend the book - waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The emperor has no clothes","review":"I read this book while traveling in a small third world country. When you are surrounded by normal people struggeling to get by every day you can see what a self absorbed jackass Hunter Thompson was. This explains why he is so popular with old clapped out hippies.In the book he is constantly stoned and hassels everybody from maids to hotel clerks. Anybody struggeling to get by is his target. His character never goes after anybody who can do something about it ,only the powerless. Apparently his fans think this is high humor. It takes a low IQ and a lot of self loathing to really appreciate this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"hilarious!","review":"If you are looking for a good laugh and are not offended by drugs, lewd behavior, and hooliganism, then I would highly recommend this book. 90% of the story takes place while the two main characters are doped up on various drugs or combinations of them, and the consequences are hilarious. I laughed most of the way through.On a deeper level, I'm guessing there's also some kind of deep social commentary about the condition of America during the early 1970s. However, I'm only 20 years old and I'm pretty sure most of it went right over my head. I did notice a tinge of sadness in some parts, which I think has something to do with the end of an era and the elusive American Dream, but like I said--right over my head. Even without a complete understanding of the underlying social commentary, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.If you're looking for a funny diversion that's easy to read and entertaining, I'd highly recommend this title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rah Rah","review":"The previous reviewer is what one may call a \\"gotard.\\"He feels that fear and loathing is only about drugs.

It is a lot more than some drug book. It's a look at the times from Hunter S. Thompson's eyes. It seems poetic the way he transfers thoughts and can make someone laugh. It is a must read. I couldn't put it down. For some reason you just can't seem to let go of the book. The odd flashbacks seem to keep you reading and helps you understand what it was like for him and a little pice of the American dream that people still search for, but can't seem to see because of the glare in there eyes formed by the shady governmeant and the somewhat scary facts of life which call to you from the heavens and keep you from climbing to the top of the mountain.

It recieves high reccomendations as a student of politics and history it is definately an eye opener and the writings of Thompson have had a profound affect on the way i view my educational experience.

If there were ever an author that has changed my outlook of things in general, Thompson is the one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant but Flawed","review":"The first 50 pages of F & L are the most dynamic I've ever read. I laugh out loud every time I pick up the book. Alas, the force, fury and humor wear out as Thompson descends into drug-induced madness. Perhaps a bit too long, but the great writing in this book really drives me through. Thompson changed the face of journalism with F & L, and the form has never recovered. Taking the personal, the confessional, the delusional into the real of so-called non-fiction, Thompson make a post-modern melange of words that vibrate manically. To my mind, this book is his best, creating a persona that Thompson felt obliged to live up to, and many others too. Gonzo is fun, but it has costs too. You can find them in this book, as well as late 1960's paranoia about the right (justified, oh, justified), a solipistic view of the world and personal enlightenment through chemical abuse.Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, so this is what that movie was trying to say...","review":"I saw the movie.

From the beginning paragraph to the end it is one of the most convoluted books I have ever read. This book really is \\"A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream.\\" Thompson and his \\"attourney\\" do so many drugs in this book, you would think that they were madmen. However, on this strange trip it's is Thompson's madness that carries him through his dangerous adventures, it's almost like a catch 22. I would recommend this book to anyone that is mature enough for the contents. Thompson may be no \\"Hemingway,\\" but he has a knack of giving us a different perspective, as valid as it is skewed. Perhaps this is key, to understand and survive in a mixed up world one must be mixed up.

On the surface it is a great story of two people on gigantic drug binge who are outlaws even in the accepting vegas atmosphere. Thompson is Thompson, he is an incredible storyteller and his prose is cuttingly satirical and flows beautifully.But F&L; is also much more. It is a search for the American Dream and a critic of the drug movement. For those who \\"don't get it\\", it is pretty clear how Thompson ridicules those making the pilgramage to vegas in hopes of striking it rich. One passage which is omitted from the movie shows Thompson & his attorney asking where they can find the American Dream at a drive in fast food restaurant.

This hilarious, fast-paced \\"true\\" account of Hunter S. Thompson's coverage of the Mint 400 motorcycle race was indeed a journey that needed to be told. Tales of drugs, destroying hotel rooms, drugs, motorcycles, drugs, bats, drugs, and more drugs are the meat of this not-quite 200 page book.A friend of mine has just finished this, and she described it as \\"exhausting\\". Rightfully so. When describing his drugs and their effects, one really tries to visualize and identify with Thompson, at that very moment. This kind of hyper-thinking runs a risk of headaches. It doesn't. I just made that up.Nevertheless, this book is indeed a classic. Hell, Burroughs made it work with \\"Junky\\". Hunter S. Thompson's \\"Fear and Loathing\\" is a must-read.

His work was absolutely hilarious, this book is full of memorable moments from the beginning to the end. I can open to any part of the book and instantly recall the awkward situation the two main characters had gotten themselves into, and I immediately begin to laugh uncontrollably. Many books have dull interlude moments, but not this one. It seems that every chapter has an equally interesting and hilarious (although sometimes frightening) story to tell. That's why it was so depressing when I heard Hunter S. Thompson had committed suicide.

Word is, there is to be a movie with johnny depp as the lead role so look for new fans. The book never really lets you go and it is one of those that you feel sorry to have end. People have said that the end lets you down as HST leaves Veags, but for anyone who has even remotely been there the end is a fittng shot.

A lot of high school students like me probably have heard of the book because a movie was made about it, so they might pick it up to checkit out.

They pack the trunk of their rental full of so many drugs that they could keep a small army messed up for awhile.

Hunter Thompson and his attorney become locked in a drug induced mania while in Vegas to cover a motorcycle race that they completely miss altogether. They rip off (and destroy) every hotel they stay in, they run from the police, and get into every possible bad scenario imaginable. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy","review":"I read this book years ago. Like everything else from the 60's that seemed hip and inspirational back then....it now seems dated and ridiculous. Reading it is kinda like watching a black and white movie that is suppose to be a classic but just seems old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear and Loathing in your face","review":"I made the mistake of watching the movie before reading the book. I really regret that decision. After watching the movie, you make visualizations in your head while reading the book which draws away from the books spontaneity. The descriptive language that Hunter S. uses really grabs you unlike the movie. It leaves a lasting impression on the reader and its very hard to put down the book once you get into it. The book itself takes you on a journey through the minds of 2 drug addicts trying to find the American Dream. They encounter many issues along the way and seem to be living on the edge of life. By not paying for a single thing, both Dr. Gonzo and his client \\"The Duke\\" are always in a rush trippin on all types of drugs. Most of the time they are distraught and confused because of the drugs which makes everything more interesting. I really enjoyed reading this book and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre, and confounding, yet quintessential","review":"This is a great piece of literature that poses many questions about the nature of being an American.The book is broken up into two parts, and part one is clearly the strongest. In book two, Thompson loses focus and begins to drift. The story attempts to take on several metaphorical resolutions, very few of them powerful. If Thompson had kept the intensity of Part 1 throughout the text, this would have been even more groundbreaking than it already was.Part 1: 5 StarsPart 2: 2.5 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read out loud fun!","review":"My boyfriend read this out loud to me, while I was driving and we both kept laughing, out loud.

Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanely Perfect","review":"When my friend reccomended the book to me, the movie had alreaady come out. I told him I would just watch the movie and not waste my time. He urged me to just read it. So I did. I found myself picking up the book and reading, only to look up and find that 3 hours had passed. I then read it twice more. It was that good. I would highly reccomend this book to anyone that is bored of the same old stuff. This is it's own wonderful thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilliarious and sometimes incredulous at the same time.","review":"If your looking for an existential take on modern day soul searching, comic-relief, and overzealous behaviour, this is one you will want to take the time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A total head trip conjured up only by the duke of gonzo.","review":"An amazing head trip into the minds of the duke of gonzo as so many have labeled him. If any book captures the karma of the years that so many of us were not alive to experience, it's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The combination of Thompson's writing and Steadman's drawings create a book of pure energy, pure power, that it craves to be read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable descent into the very soul of American dementia","review":"Wow.

Should be standardreading for every child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Dr. Thompson again shows his genius. I've read the book about 6 times now and it just gets better all the time. It is not the purpose of the book to merely relate a story, be it true or not, but to tell of EXPERIENCE. Dr. Thompson's point being that the best way to tell about something is to experience it and become directly involved. Only then can a story be purely told because EXPERIENCE is humanity"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Read Hell's Angels instead of this one. His earlier books are subtle and brilliant, where this one is maniacal and completely ego-driven. In addition, Thompson himself has admitted that it is fiction, and not the product of a crazed junky's prodigious memory. Take it from a Thompson fan, it ain't all that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Classic","review":"This book is a classic of American 1960's literature (originally published in 1971, but a reflection of the 60's nonetheless). If you're interested in the time period run out and get this book right now.Much has been made whether this is a \\"true\\" account of some period in the author's life. It doesn't matter. As William Faulkner's famously declared \\"the best fiction is far more true than any kind of journalism -- and the best journalists have always known this.\\"Hilarious in places, terrifying in others - and always surreal - this book will make you want to get back in touch with your inner drug-addled anarchist."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the American is really all about.","review":"Hunter S. Thompson has done it again with his sinister story of two men in search of the \\"American Dream\\". With a pocket full of money, that's not theirs, and a briefcase full of drugs, is how these two go throughout their crazy and wild escapades in search of the \\"American Dream\\".While they drive around Las Vegas consuming their wide array of drugs in the \\"Great Red Shark\\", they are faced with odd encounters and experiences that will blow any readers mind away. For all those people that think that the book is better than the movie, than your right with this one. There is never a dull moment with this book and it will have you at the edge of you seat the whole way through.I deeply recommend this book to anyone who has trouble with books because from the start till the finish you will want to read and continue with this wild and twisted journey in search of the \\"American Dream\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic for all time","review":"Seriously, this is the best book I've ever read. I read \\"Fear and Loathing..\\" for the first time about thirteen years ago, and I have read it several times since. Hunter Thompson is a master of the english language, and in my opinion, the funniest writer ever. His terminology in \\"Fear and Loathing..\\" is so vivid and inventive that it costantly leaves me shaking my head in disbelief anytime evry time I pick the book up. You can open this book to just about any page and be astounded by the sharpness of his wit. There are those who complain that he exaggerates, but so what if he does. It would take a truly unique voice just to exaggerate this. The book might be an even more impressive accomplishment if none of it were true, because that would mean that Thompson actually thought it up on!! Woah, now that is scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screaming jibberish","review":"\\"Eyes glazed insanely behind tiny gold rim greaser shades.\\" So goes one of my favorite lines in a book recommended to me by a buddy named Douglas Mallach (we call him Doug Mallach for short), an Irish name to be sure and thus the literary sensibility. For anybody who hasn't read Hunter's famous story of excess and depravity in the once desolate and simultaneously luxurious oddity known as Las Vegas, this is a quick read and one perfectly suited for road trips and travel. Though be careful if you're flying by air. Others will hear you laugh out loud.In spite of its wit and borderline sanity, the author has one eye on history. As my friend Doug pointed out, he's writing at the time when liberalism in this country hit its \\"high water mark.\\" There's a sensitivity to the forces behind culture that moves this book as much as its characters'ridiculous predicaments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny as hell","review":"Every so often, you stumble across a true literary gem that keeps you giggling as you read it, and thinking about it long after you've returned it to the library. \\"Fear and loathing in Las Vegas\\" is one such book. The characters are hapless bozos that made me chuckle, riding across the country in a stolen car stock-piled with drugs in search of the \\"american dream\\".

The Wood Brothers are fine songwriters, and this release is another fine example of their earthy, sparse, acoustic style, with a format that is more \\"unplugged\\" than Loaded.

It does have some really nice illustrations (that you may have seen around the internet) that detail the skinhead fashion particular to the year. It is the best source I've seen yet on the early skinhead style.The unfortunate thing is that contrary to the illustrations, the photos seem to be more often of the mid 70's and early 80's, and rarely of the earlier 60's skinhead fashion that I had hoped for. Most of the skins in these photos are in jeans, and not a lot of the dressier \\"hard mod\\" side of things. As mentioned in another review there are unfortunately several racist \\"sieg heil\\" photos, and only one black skinhead photo.

The musicians can play, but the lyrics and vocals are just embarrasing and they ruin any kind of vibe that could have been achieved. To compare these guys to Yes, Genesis, etc., at their peak is to have missed a lot of what was cool about those bands. It really sounds like the singer is the wimpy hippie teacher from Beavis and Butthead.

Bands like Yes, King Crimson, Genesis (with Peter Gabriel), Gentle Giant, ELP and others. One of the best, although nowhere near as popular or sucessful, was Happy the Man. This group was mostly and instrumental band, but even though many considered them experimental jazz, they were indeed a progressive rock band and man could they rock.

The book follows the old 1976 Bike Centennial trail that is well described and updated at the Adventure Cycling website. I followed this route, East to West. It would have been a lot better to have gone West to East. The wind gets pretty strong and it blows West to East; so, if you are riding East to West, you have to work much harder than if go would go the other direction. While I enthusiastically recommend the route, I suggest that it would be better to start in the West; if you do, it is better if your guide book goes the same direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential, such disappointment","review":"John Krasinski is definitely the only redeemable part of this movie.

The Pulsar is a potentially extreme tremolo using soley the main output. Using both outputs, the Pulsar becomes a panner. The manual recommends setting the depth in two o'clock position and some user complain that any more isn't musically useful. Another neat feature is the pulse width variation especially when coupled with reverb, echo, or delay effects. The only thing that could possibly make this cooler would be to add inputs for expression pedals to manually modulate the controls while playing (like that Jim Dunlop that looks like a wah)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly, unmusical, dark-sound trem.","review":"On a whim, I bought a Stereo Pulsar and was extremely disappointed to plug it in.

I have all of their CD's and I would put this in the top third. If anything, because of the first two songs (Blackened Blue Eyes & NYC). Other favorites include Muddy Ground, the Architect and Road to Paradise. The songs do tend to be slower than on past releases but who is to say that is a bad thing? They are not ballads, they are just a little slower paced. My one problem is with Sunset & Vine. While definitely not a bad song, I was expecting more from an instrumental. I think this was a good example where they could have sped things up a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not You Slighty Elder Brother's Charlatans . . .","review":"There is now no trace of delight left in this band. All songs are either moderately slow and somewhat self-indulgent or frightfully slow and quite self-indulgent. I do love this band and pronounce praises upon them whenever I receive a doe-eyed look saying their name, but this CD and the CD previous (which did have 1 tune, \\"Apples,\\" with which one could smile) does, for the first time, take away any anticipation for their next collection of chopfallen tunes.First, we loose the Roses, then the Ned's disband, following that, Swervedriver breaks apart and Velocity Girl is gone forevermore. Now my Charlatans have become charlatans of the great band they once were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reggatta de...Burgess","review":"In my opionion, the first track, Blackend Blue Eyes should have been on a James Bond soundtrack. It is HUGE sounding with a backing string section, er so it sounds. NYC is dancy and funky and all around a good time. In short the rest of the album is something entirely different than the first two tracks. Something different but still very good (though not typically Charlatans). It is steeped in 1980's reggaefied new wave/punk of that era (Police, Clash, Specials, Elvis Costello etc.) Some tracks echo roots-rock from that decade as well. A very good \\"collecton\\" of music but not as much an \\"album\\" as was Up At The Lake. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not the Charlatans of yore, but enjoyable nonetheless","review":"I must be honest, the constant reinvention the Charlatans has gone through has been somewhat annoying and usually disappointing. That being said, I find this album quite listenable and actually enjoyable. \\"Blackened Blue Eyes\\", their first single, is their finest moment since, \\"Weido\\" back in 1992...that's saying a lot. There are some other fine moments on this album including: \\"Muddy Ground\\" and \\"Architect\\", as well as \\"NYC\\" and \\"For Your Entertainment\\". I don't mind the reggae dabblings, although it can annoy on a couple of tracks. All-in-all a good effort and a welcome return."},{"rating":"2","title":"so real you forget you're not actually living the story","review":"Joanna trollope has a real gift of making characters come alive.

Joanna Trollope is a GREAT writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitifully pedestrian","review":"This was the first book by Ms. Trollope I have read; it will be the last. I guess this is what might be referred to as a woman's book. But it is certainly not every woman's. The dialogue was deadly dull. There was nothing in the characters which came alive for me so I couldn't care about any of them. The subject of dysfunctional families can be handled with empathy and drama even if one hates the protagonists. I was simply bored by all of them principally because of the pedestrian writing devoid of emotion stirring descriptions. They were all cardboard figures. If you want to read about troubled familial relationships treat yourself to \\"The Correction\\", by the brilliant Jonathan Franzen. Even if you hate some of the characters they are unforgettably alive. Maeve Binchy is another gifted author who writes convincingly and with humor and sympathy about families. It's hard to understand the rave reviews for Ms. Trollope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not best","review":"Any new book by Joanna Trollope is welcome, and like her others, \\"Other People's Children\\" goes by far too fast. Here, however, she spreads herself very thin, tackling roughly 15 characters from several generations, and thereby loses the intensity and focus of \\"A Spanish Lover,\\" for example, which is surely one of her best works. If we ask ourselves at the end of the book whether we will miss the characters whose lives we are now leaving, there might be a few whose loss we feel: Elizabeth, certainly, and perhaps Rufus. But that's a small percentage of those we have been asked to care about. Still, Trollope creates some nicely complicated characters, particularly in Tom and Nadine, who present themselves so very differently from how (and who) they turn out to be. This novel is definitely worth a read and disappoints only in comparison with even better works by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"cd labels","review":"I've purchased in my country these labels, I've bought already 2 packs and they are OK, the print out comes out good and the glue is hard enough to hold after a couple of years"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"I must say I was very disappointed upon receiving this blanket.

In fact, it makes some of the recent fiction put out under the Star Trek name pale by comparison. The two Seven of Nine stories in the \\"Voyager\\" section are excellent, as are \\"I, Klingon\\" and a number of the other stories. Unfortunately, Deep Space Nine has been treated like an ugly stepchild, with a mere 30-some pages and two stories (one of which is so amateurish it should have been thrown in the rubbish bin). Then, again, maybe the quality and quantity of the entries in this category was so small, these were the only two worthy of publication. At any rate, this is a great book.

I own \\"Milagro,\\", and eagerly look forward to his next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star studded Drama","review":"The other reviews capsulate pretty much the story and the performances, and the movie will not appeal to those unfamiliar with Greek history. No one can watch this movie without misting up when the child, Astyanax, is taken from Andromache. Hecuba's big mistake is in letting Helen defend herself, although for the story she has to have her defense. I don't find it stilted, over dramatized or disjointed. Not to those of us who love the plays of Euripides. The translation is by the author Edith Hamilton and updates most of archaic phrases. The movie is unmatched in telling the story of the women left behind in any war, offensive or defensive. However, to paraphrase Cassandra, who says it best, \\"Trojans died defending their country, no glory greater\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I ever saw.

The sizing chart online was incorrect. While the first pair was beautiful, they were too small. So we sent them back, waited almost 10 days (the first pair were one-day shipping and still took three days). We were disappointed when we opened the replacement. It appears that the coveralls were folded and left in the sun. The top 2/3 were faded several shades lighter than the legs with a noticeable fold line. Since it was such a hassle to exchange the first pair, we opted not to return. But for the money, we should have received something that looked brand new and not something that was sitting somewhere fading away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good print of a forgettable film","review":"To me, it is surprising that anyone would bother to re-master this movie. Although the result is a print that looks quite first rate, the movie itself is thoroughly forgettable. It is a routine, low-key crime story with bland actors. Even the villains are non-descript. And it is marred with far too much \\"comedy relief\\", especially because the theory of comedy here is \\"idiots are funny\\". It does not even convey much sense of the time in which it was made. Except for the cars being driven, it might well be a 1950's TV production.It does have one claim to fame though: it re-unites the team of Louis J. Gasnier, George A. Hirliman, Lawrence Meade, and Sam Diege, who had pooled their mighty talents to create the immortal \\"Reefer Madness\\" in 1936!

Cochineal is a nice way of saying crushed female cactus beetles.It makes absolutely no sense for the manufacturer to add this non-nutritive, potentially dangerous substance to a product for pregnant women. Not only does adding carmine (beetle) extract render the product non-kosher and non-vegetarian , it causes severe allergic reactions in some people.

From 60 to 90 psi it begins to get REALLY hard... And after that is a pain in the ass!

The voice is his calling card, but there is so much more to him as an artist. He incorporated an orchestra into his music and this sound laid down the blueprint for disco with the use of strings and horns. He is a crisp and efficient writer who can get at your soul. Stone Gon' is still a bit of a work in progress (he would perfect the formula on Can't Get Enough) as he is feeling out his sound, but the songs are lush and beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"My wife bought me these boots as a Christmas present. She ordered them about a month before Christmas; when I opened them and tried them on I found them to be too big. Of course we couldn't exchange them for a smaller pair because they don't take returns after 30 days.So I stuffed them with insoles to make them fit. I only wore these boots for about six months before I had to throw them out. I am a police officer, so the boots get used pretty hard, but I've had Wal-mart boots that lasted longer. BOTH soles had completely worn down; it's a good thing I had the insoles in them because that's what I ended up walking on!

Much has been made of \\"clones\\" in the press lately - most people do not realize that technology now does not just make a duplicate \\"Dolly\\" - no, Dolly has to grow up - from fetal development onward. Just what does that mean for the human clone? - Just what do you do with what is left - when the liver, eyes, kidneys, heart etc are removed? -- This film attempts to answer those questions - and believe me - given the naked greed our pharmaceutical and medical industry exhibits - I do not believe this film was far off on what may really happen if technology ever permits.Excellent action adventure - with many haunting questions - I recommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Science Fiction","review":"This is an exceptional movie, great acting, and tight plot.

Don't waste money on even renting it!!","review":"Michael Bay is just not my kind of director. I hated this I hated Pearl Harbor and what i saw of Armageddon too. This was a waste of 4 bucks at Blockbuster. First of all, the plot is cool but it's boring, confusing, and just... stupid. Ewan McGregor is alright I guess and so is Scarlett Johannsen but this film really was not good. Probably the worst movie I saw all year. The action wasn't even fun in this. If you want to give this film a chance go ahead but I'm warning you, it's not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Bay's better effort","review":"This was not bad, considering Mr. Bay's track record. There were lots of explosions 'n stuff, which are his trademark; and Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johanssen had great chemistry; Steve Buscemi was, as usual, excellent in a small role. Without blabbing away the plot, I'm only wondering who would take care of the survivors. Famiy? Friends? Welfare? Enjoyable, though, and a good DVD, but the only extras are about the special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:With a much higher focus on character than the usual Michael Bay film, The Island develops people (or clones) that the audience cares about and then runs them through a series of exciting chases and action set-pieces; something of a box-office bomb, this is a nonetheless Bay's most accomplished film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pastiche of sci-fi films...","review":"The Island is a pastiche of themes and characters straight out of favorite sci-fi films dating back 30 years. Engaging camera work, motivated characters, high contrast saturated color, Scarlett Johanssen's supermodel pout and cool highway mayhem make for a fun picture, but you too will soon be counting hommages. Look for themes and actual scenes from Logan's Run, Blade Runner, Gattaca, The Terminator, Superman, Batman, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and THX1138. The nod to Life of Brian is a real hoot.

I'm happy to say that it filled all of those requirements admirably.The set-up is nicely done and engaging. The story has some humor & romance, but nothing too corny. There are some science ethics issues raised, but nothing too heavy or complicated. Once the action gets underway, it is a thrilling rollercoaster ride involving flawless special effects without obvious, overbearing cg. The story's resolution is about as satisfying as you could expect from a hollywood picture.Despite being dirivative ( Brave New World, Clonus, Logan's Run ) it still manages to be good edge-of-your-seat entertainment... car crashes and explosions be damned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise! a really good movie","review":"actually i was a bit surprised, because i didnt expected much from this movie, when i found good actors in a good storry. Its a bit to much action in it for my taste but at least its done with style and skill. So its worth at least 4 Stars.But im sorry to say the DVD is not, one pathetic little extra, that is really under average. I bet the studio bosses thought, because it didnt did that good at the box, a better DVD is not necessary, that is kind of lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY TOOOOO much product placement","review":"The plot is interesting, as well with the special effects. But I found the movie was ruined by the blatant and obvious product placement. Xbox logo in the \\"Facility\\" game room, aquafina in their bar, like the clones even know or care! What a load of crap. I enjoyed the first half of the movie, but after that the storytelling kind of fell apart. Add to the injury the fact that these idiot companies think people care if their crap is in a movie, definitley turned me off to this film. DONT waste your money, just rent it...and laugh at the commercialization of what could have been a fine film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great movie","review":"This movie has a really interesting concept of human clones being made so people can extent their life by replacing their aging body parts with cloned ones. The clones have memory imprinted in them so they are pretty stupid and just believe what they are told. But some of the clones got smart and began to question everything about their existence. Ultimately, two escaped from the facility that housed the clones. The company that makes the clones must stop them at all cost. This is where the movie falls apart with one car chase after another. At this point the whole movie turns from an intellectual and intriguing one to a mindless action junk filled with explosions and car chases. Unless you are a testosterone-filled teenager, there is not much to see here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Bay's best film and one of the best films of 2005!","review":"This is one of my personal favorite films, it is so entertaining, all the people I show it to love it. It has a lot of action in it but the plot and purpose of this movie never get lost in it, a perfect example would be and escape scene near the end of the first act. As for the plot itself, I can't really talk about it without spoiling key things but I will say that it is a dystopic thriller with an original twist. The acting is great, Ewan McGregor wonderfully plays a curious and cynical commoner and Scarlett Johansson does well portraying a bright but naive girl whose world gets turned upside down. Trust me, this movie is amazing and fun to watch and there is never a dull moment to be had here."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Win! You're Going To The Island!!!","review":"I love Ewan McGregor, his acting/films and like this one. Yes, it IS miserably like Logan's Run. They should have been more attentive of keeping away from anything to remind you of it. Like the end scene. No spoilers - unless you count that it's VERY like the ending of Logan's Run as being one. While much of it IS similar the ending is downright all but identical! The action and explosions are excessive and really for two people who supposedly no so little bordering unbelievable.

The blu-ray edition of The Island is superb. Sharp details and rich colors turn this film into total \\"eye candy.\\" The special effects are virtually seamless--it is hard to tell where the reality stops and the CGI begins.

(and I LOVE those movies) Back then, however, these conceptions of futuristic dystopia were relevant to the times. i.e. They were extrapolations of Communism, or technologies that were new then. What would be interesting is a dystopia based on trends occurring in our society today. How about a population kept in a continual state of war against some vague threat or concept. A time when one megacorporation has swallowed up all the others and we're left with one company that sells all products, makes all the food, controls all the media, and we all work for them in a world of saturation commercialism and brainwashing. Of course since these movies are made by such megacorporations and are filled with product placements, it would be against their interests to make such a movie.

The reason easily is the story.Others have elaborated on the story here so I need not give another summary. What I did feel while watching this film was that whoever wrote the script borrowed heavily from \\"logan's Run\\" and 80's thriller \\"Coma\\" with just a dash of Lucas'\\"THX\\" to create a convoluted, heavy-handed, cheesy hollywood mess about the dangers of cloning and the individual.The actors gave it their best to save this film and Michael Bay blew up everything to get the male audience in the seats.

How on earth Michael Bay managed to harness such star power for this schlock is beyond me. If there were any justice in this world (there's not), his pyrotechnics crew would receive a bigger billing than McGregor, Johansson, and Buscemi.Plot synopsis: things explode, a handheld camera jerks about, McGregor or Johansson shout \\"Go!\\", \\"Run!\\", or \\"No!\\", and then the token black dude turns out not to be evil at all.I imagine that Michael Bay often has lunch with Brett Rattner to discuss the nuances of explosions and how a beautifully choreographed car chase lends itself to storytelling. Shudder. I would spend good money to send these guys to The Island."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap with heart.","review":"If I was 14, I'd be in heaven. Potentially good story. Too much chasing/shooting/blowing up. If anyone hasn't noticed lately. Isn't action getting boring?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Many Fine Actors","review":"The very fact that this film has received so many positive ratings indicates how starved American movie audiences are for anything that even attempts to make them think. Despite a fascinating premise and an extraordinary cast (including not only Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson but Sean Bean, Steve Buscemi, and the always superb Djimon Hounsou), The Island falls terribly flat. Once again, Michael Bay seems convinced that a movie's quality is directly proportionate to the number of explosions, flipping cars, and, of course, crashing helicopters. The Island is, without question, his best film, which makes it almost worthy of the discount rack.Sadly, many directors believe they can dress up another mind-numbing action movie in pretentious, but trite, metaphysical ponderings (see The Matrix I, II, & III). I can only shudder to think what this extraordinary cast thought when they saw the final cut. I guess every actor needs an Ishtar on his or her resume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Bay is a B-Grade director hiding behind a large buck","review":"Im sure when film companies have a large amount of money to spend and dont want to risk losing it, they call up Michael Bay. He is a sure thing for the cookie cutter movie type and is a blatent thief stealing other peoples ideas from other more original films. The highway chase scene in \\"The Island\\" is a blatent ripoff the the latest Matrix movie. \\"Bad Boyz\\" is a blatent rip-off of \\"Beverly Hills cop\\". \\"Armageddon\\" and \\"Pearl Harbor\\" make me want to throw-up with the wishy-washy sentiments wrapped up in the flag where you just know, someone is gonna be saluting in the last scene of the film. There is nothing wrong with b-grade pictures when they are honest about what they are, but not when they pretend to be quality cinema with originality. Michael Bay would not know original if it bit him on the %@#&^*%$#!(* and anyone that pays to see his movies deserves them."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"People inside cocoons - you saw it in The Matrix.People on tables unaware of themselves - you saw it in Coma.Cities with transports overhead - you saw it in Blade Runner and The 5th Element.Cars fliping on a car chase on a highway - Matrix once again.And so on.As I said... nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor packaging","review":"I received this product in a box loosely packed with other creams. 2 of the bottles were completely empty because they leaked out.

The makers of this calendar left out the Simpson's episode sources for the pictures and quotes, which is something I enjoyed checking out with last year's calendar.

I'm sure he lost alot of fans because of this, but I'm gonna wait til the next one to see what happens on this 'musical adventure' he's going on. I've seen this cd for twenty dollars or more elsewhere and I laugh because I know someone will but it and be disappointed. If you like the way it sounds you're better off buying it used here!

Don't bother with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's different, but then again ALL their albums are different","review":"I just wanted to address the people who are complaining about APB's sound changing. They mention Welcome to Earth and Harmonizer. Imagine the shock when their sound changed from Soli Deo Gloria to Welcome to Earth - maybe you were too young for that. Long-time fans will tell you that their sound has ALWAYS changed, from album to album. That is the beauty of the band. They are older now, probably less angsty. Why make angry music if that's not how you really feel.That said, this album is poppy. If you listen to it with an open mind, not expecting more of the old sound (define old sound anyway!) you might like it. If you want gritty, dark, clangy stuff, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointed...","review":"I have loved this band for years. When I first heard their \\"Welcome to Earth\\" Album in college I was entranced by the ethereal melodies and philosophical lyrics, along with the harder, more danceable tracks. I also really liked Harmonizer.However, even though I respect any musicians' desire to experiment and break out of \\"their norm,\\" I really felt like this album didn't showcase their talents at all. I found a lot of lyrics to be trite, and teenage-angsty, combined with uninteresting music. The one track I did like was \\"Tuning In to the Frequency of Your Soul.\\"Maybe this 80s-pop style will never be a favorite of mine with ANY band and is just a matter of personal preference, but I thought what they did best was the darkwave electric/EBM/Synthpop that they did on their other albums. It really doesn't even sound like APB in my opinion. I really miss their old style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS is the BEST of the '70's, '80's and '90's.","review":"KISS is just the ULTIMATE!

It contains classic hits, as well as a few new songs.If you are a long-time fan of the band, then I need not say much because you already know that what's on here is all good. If you are less familiar with the group, just pick up this CD and it will give you a taste of this legendary rock band. If you love this, then go out and get yourself a box set or any of their many original recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good song choices, but.....","review":"I'm not really thrilled with the remastered versions. I don't like the drums on Shout It Out Loud or on Rock & Roll All Nite. The 2 new songs are great, but I believe it was blasphemous for them to re-do Beth with Eric Carr on vocals. Good song choice like I said (maybe 1 or 2 other older ones), but this would be the 2nd (Double Platinum-1st) of 50 greatest hits compilations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kiss off","review":"A lot of us used to be Kiss fans, even me once, but it's time for them to go away now. If you really want Kiss, then Smashes, Thrashes is all you need to get since it contains all of their good songs (Both of them). This album has a half a dozen songs or so that I can stand and a bunch more songs that have been more overplayed than a twenty year old VCR. This is a collection for all those old stubborn yuppies who refuse to acknowledge newer or more progressive rock. By the way, I hate that song 'Beth'. BOOOOOORING. Was that a song for a baby record? If rock stars want to have a bad boy image then their music needs to match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashes Trashes and Horrible Songs","review":"KISS are a VERY overrated band that are simply worse than a circus act.The first 2 tracks are wirtten by men who simply carn't stop playing with themselves.The rest is simply boring as h/w.Songs that any MINDLESS LOSER would take for granted.Me i'll stick to Metallica 'Master of Puppets' and Live 'Throwing Copper for my taste in music."},{"rating":"1","title":"way overated","review":"this band is one long joke.aside from three songs this is spinal taps warm up band.i can't believe all the love they get."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Anothering","review":"This is the best book on how to start or revive a small group.

I live in So Cal, so haven't had it subjected to rain at all, but does great with the sunshine. It has a built in storage bag, and honestly, it is really difficult to roll it back into it's own bag.

One of my best reads ever...","review":"This is a must read for anyone who is somewhat interested in the spirtual realm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast moving paper thin characters, worse than TV","review":"Frank Peretti tries to emphasize the importance of prayer in thechristian experience by weaving a fast moving tale of satanic conspiracy.A noble motive. A terrible novel.Characters are either good or bad. All good characters are saintlike. Allbad characters are demon possessed. You can find more plausiblecharacters on television. To make up for such thin characters the plot moves very quickly. So quickly that many people miss thepoint that the novel departs bible based theology.Great book if you cannotfind it in yourself to criticize anything labeled \\"christian\\", an experience similarto having a tooth filled for those more discerning.Read \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, it is better than the 1st one","review":"Peretti gets his spiritual message across very well, thats about all he does though. It reminds me of the Roadrunner cartoons(which everyone beggins to hate after 2 or 3 episodes). Demon vs angel, angel kills demon, demon really wasnt as powerful as ypu thought or Peretti made out to be. The \\"mystery\\" part of this book was pretty neat, but please not another impossibly hard-to-get-out of situation that keeps the reader glued, and then destroys him when the captive is freed within a matter of seconds. Really, what trained assasin would stab himself in the ribs while holding a knife to somones neck?...The demon vs angel fights are boring, we already know what is going to happen (just like the roadrunner cartoons)..face it, these demons are going to be extinct if they try to take over one more town..maybe then I wont have to read these for my Bible class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches Fear, Self Righteousness; Poorly Written","review":"Initially I found this book far-fetched - not just in its treatment of Spirituality but in its knowledge of physical reality and human character. The characterization was poor and one dimensional. There is even a scene where a youth \\"hopped up on marijuana\\" robs a store to get money for more pot. I don't think Peretti has ever even met a stoner!Beyond the quality of writing issues, this book reinforces the fundamentalist belief that anything that we don't know is to be feared or hated. It speaks with the arrogance of self-righteous insulated Christian (not Christ-like) culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I just don't see how you people have rated this book so highly. It seems almost as if a high school student had a crazy idea for a short story, then was prodded on by their teacher to turn it into a several hundred page book. I can barely even get through the first few chapters, much less finish the book. It seems to me that Peretti has a loser in this one. The Visitation, alse by Peretti, is a MUCH better book, and is MUCH more interesting.I guess you could read this book at night if you need help falling asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerant, bigoted, paranoid anti-cult garbage","review":"I read this book just to see what all the hype was about. I've seen the book everywhere. It started out Ok and pretty exciting with cool scenes of angels fighting demons. Where it got me mad was when the author trots out his real intolerant, bigoted, paranoid anti-cult agenda. I went ballistic. I really wanted to throw this book out the window. It panders to the narrow-minded fundamentalist, inciting them in their self-righteous (and un-Godly) hatred of others.The author uses old fasioned hell-fire and brimstone tactics to scare modern Christians away from anything labeled \\"New-Age\\". This is the kind of metallity gave brought us witch burnings in Salem, where innocent people were executed at the whims of hysterical adolescent girls.Discernment is a two edged sword. Use it with care. Just because something is labeled \\"Christian\\" doesn't make it good. (Matt. 7:21-23)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, false, narrow-minded, and dangerous!","review":"I found it highly ironic that the place where poor \\"lost soul\\" Sally finally communicated with God was in a park among the green leaves lying face-down on Mother Earth.

Maybe there's hope for the world yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged version!!!","review":"I searched everywhere on the description of this to determine if it was abridged or not and did not see this info. Upon getting the CD's, it is in small print on the label that it is abridged. I returned them without problem to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piercing the Darkness: Angels are REAL","review":"As with the book before this- This Present Darkness, I was completely spellbound. I loved this book. If ever there were any doubts about the existance of angels, this should make it very clear that they do exist, and we should thank God for them. The book slowly pulled me in, but just a couple of pages into it and I was glad to see the familiar characters from Frank Peretti's last story. I was drawn to the plight of the girl, who seemed to be mentally handicapped in some way, but was really just hounded by the demons who have followed her through life. In the end, she conquers the demons with the help of Angels through Gods guidance. It was very spiritually uplifting and definately recommended to all those who like the writings of Frank Peretti."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner!","review":"Perretti overdoes himself again. Peircing the Darkness is another great book about spiritual warfare. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. With some of the same characters as the first, This Present Darkness, you'll read all day and night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but could have been a lot better","review":"This book has an exciting plot that will change your picture of spiritual warfare. That said, it raised a lot of big philosophical issues without giving answers. One is vouchers and government interference in Christian schools, a very timely topic, that eventually goes nowhere. The book also slams a number of different New Age and spiritual practices, but often without explanation. That was confusing to me, who as a liberal Christian, doesn't have moral qualms about visualization or relaxation exercises or many of the other techniques that the book considers to be openings for demonic activity. All considered, it was a very good read, but I think it more represents one person's opinion than what the Bible actually teaches on spiritual warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Read","review":"I tried and tried to read this book, but it was confusing, too many characters, very slow start and just plain not worth a person's time and effort. This book was chosen by my book club, otherwise, I would never have given it so many chances before finally tossing it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have loved this book for years","review":"In an effort to Put together a List of my Favorite 25 books I turn to: Piercing the Darkness. I am not a big fan of \\"redemption chapters\\" but this book held a deeper theme. It allowed me to consider in greater detail the idea of an unseen world surrounding us at all time. Peretti dove into issues like abortion, and secular organizations in a way \\"not to take away from the story\\". It makes you wonder how a simple piece of paper falling behind a cabinet can change the course of a person's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Present Darkness Was Better","review":"It's alot like the first book only this story is faster and darker. Instead of talking about God's love and the power of prayer it focuses on satanic cults and demon possesion. The ending was somewhat confusing and sort of a let down, however Peretti does once again paint a vivid picture of the spiritual battle of good versus evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was awesome!!","review":"In his second book, Piercing the Darkness, Frank Peretti hits a proverbial home run. He easily exceeds his first work, This Present Darkness, which was great in itself. The characters are developed more fully than they were in This Present Darkness and the plot reads like many of today's headlines. Rarely does a sequel exceed the original. But, Piercing The Darkness does just that. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is either concerned with the spiritual battles going on in the world today or who is looking for a suspense ride like few books deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real clifhanger","review":"Is a must read page turner. The battle scenes are handled excellently and the characters are depicted very relisticly. The spiritual part adds an irrisistable touch to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Nice product, I think it's a little overpriced for what you are getting, about $30 with shipping and there's not much to it.

However, there are more wasted bytes on between-track banter. That's not the worst thing about the album though. One would expect such an excellent rock classic as \\"My Woman....\\" to receive its full due, but it doesn't. Somewhere after a few bars, the song is abandoned for a senseless lonesome take-off on Buddy Holly. Go figure. Deep Purple has much better stuff out than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good selection of songs -- still not much good though","review":"I like Deep Purple and the majority of the songs covered on this album but I did not care for this album for some reason.

The lyrics are not nearly as deep and personal as those found on Moondance and Astral Weeks. His voice has obviously aged as well. When examined critically, Van Morrison's voice is not why we enjoy his music (at least for me anyway). It is the spirit and the feelings that his music engenders. His voice is just good enough to not take away from these things. He is in the same league as a Stevie Ray Vaughn, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin in that regard. These guys would probably not sell many acapella albums but would win poetry contests or instrumental competitions for days. When Van Morrison's aged voice is coupled with lyrics written to say \\"I am a Christian\\" and not \\"I am Van Morrison (who happens to be a Christian)\\" you get only 2 - 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rod Stewart did nothing for \\"Have I told you lately\\"","review":"Van is a magician with words and lyrics - his songs touch, move and bring back many memories - Grab a glass of wine, turn the lights down low and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"While I have other Van Morrison albums I have worshipped more, there are a few gems on this one, for sure. Shortly after I bought this one I went to see Tom Petty in concert. I was stunned and gratefully amazed when the band walked off the stage, leaving Tom all alone out there, and he sat with his acoustic guitar and sang \\"I'm tired Joey boy\\", which has turned out to be my favorite on this album. The way Tom Petty sang it made it evident that he too has great respect for Van Morrison's music. And rightfully so. I've been a fan of his since I was 16, back in the sixties, when he made \\"Gloria\\". While my favorites are his classics like \\"Tupelo Honey\\" and \\"Into the Mystic\\", I really like the songs on this album, and his version of \\"Have I told you Lately\\" is so superior to Rod Stewart's version, it still amazes me why I never hear it on the radio. I hope he goes on for another 40 years, and gives us more of his amazing music to fall in love with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love a shimmy","review":"Terrific workout.

David Gray, however, is not one of these. He has so much passion for what he does, as a listener, you can almost feel his emotion. The DVD \\"Live at the point\\" is a great compliment to his music. You can see the feelng that he puts behind each individual song allowing you, the viewer to experience the concert that was out on In Dublin. This DVD is exciting. If you are a David Gray fan, this is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought that Sartre could make you cry?","review":"Then you need to read this book. It is Simone de Beauvoir's first-person account of the last ten years of Sartre's life, and it is heartbreaking to read in several places. Her descriptions in particular of his final few days are wrenching, and I did actually cry as she described Sartre's death. The prose is characteristic of de Beauvoir: deeply and intimately detailed, meticulous, and dense in some places. But the reading is ultimately rewarding as it gives the reader an even more thorough understanding of the devoted side of de Beauvoir--and the very human and mortal side of the great philosopher Sartre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Started with a zip, and just zapped out.

This is the third in the series...and it was not worth keeping for me. On a romance meter....it was very low.However, on a different note....if you are looking for a book that makes you hunger for sex...this is it!!! The heroine shatters and screams many times.

I honestly couldn't wait for Charles's story, I thought it would be my favorite. But Ms. Laurens didn't even try to make these characters remotely likable, to me. I had a hard time empathizing with them and their love. I am so sick of romance novelists thinking that if they add enough blatant sexuality it makes a good novel! What happened to the ROMANCE??? It really is despairing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long","review":"I found this latest title in the Bastion Club series way too long. It was full of longeurs and gratuitous sex.

The hero was not as dashing and delicious as in other books. To me it felt like she was not up to it or didn't want to write this book and just put words together to produce a novel. It's as if she was pressured into writing this one. I starting reading historical romance novels reading Stephanie Lauren books, she is the standard I use (along with Lisa Kleypas) to select a novel; they are so-o-o romantic, with men you could fall in love with, but not this book.

The story dragged from the beginning and I could not feel any interest in the main characters. The mystery was poorly plotted and very slow. There was little if any romantic tension or suspense.

The author arrived in the Americas in 1502, participated in the conquest of Cuba, and eventually took holy orders as a Dominican priest. He wrote this work in 1542 after his return to Spain, dedicated it to Philip II, and published it a decade later.De las Casas, a fierce critic of colonialism, describes cruelty and wickedness visited on natives, and warns it will ultimately corrupt Europeans. Allowing for the authors distinct point of view, this is a rare and valuable glimpse into early colonialism in the Americas that in many respects anticipates 19C anti-slavery treatises.Also recommended: Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca's \`Relacion' (a chronicle of a remarkable journey in the Southwest 1528-36) and The Jesuit Relations (a journal of French - Native interaction 1610-1791)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless version of a classic","review":"I ordered this book thinking it would be a usable version of the work of Fray Bartolome de las Casas.

Since I am a Spanish speaker, I was able to compare this version with the Spanish version online, and was sorely disappointed.

The book is the source of the oft-quoted figure of 20 million Native-Americans killed by conquistadors, including 3 million on Hispaniola (modern day Haiti and Dominican Republic) alone. Most modern historians agree that the island could have only supported a small fraction of that population. Extremely interesting book from the perspective of studying the history of public relations.

Written with the same depth as all her others, I was totally consumed with Nathaniel and Charlotte. How romantic to have a one night affair that both were so emotionally involved with and not know if the other knows who they were with. That truly begins this story in quite a romantic mystery. These two were such strong characters that often did not even get along. No one would think they could become romantic, but was their antagonism always hiding much stronger feelings? The mystery of the Mardenford family and how it will impact her life, is key. and Nathaniel trying to deal with truth and justice and also his new found love for Lady Charlotte would put this emotional read into some rough waters until true love prevails.

Avoid unless avid.","review":"After a decade of fantastic music, of maturing into an accomplished artist capable of both singles and full-length LPs, Mellencamp makes the mistake of too many other \\"mature\\" singer-songwriters: he gets @#%#ing boring. Aside from \\"Pop Singer\\", which still stings with sarcasm, every song on this disc is an overblown attempt at pontificating the obvious.This would be the only time in his career that I doubted JCM's talent. It did galvanize him, though. To his credit, he came back hard with his heaviest CD after this country-fied tripe--\\"Whenever We Wanted\\" is a gem. Listening to this CD compared to Uh-Huh shows the obvious fault with the music on Big Daddy; it's just dull and unorganized. JCM is a wonderful gift to the world of music, but this disc is worthless drivel. Give it a wide berth."},{"rating":"2","title":"His best!!!","review":"When I first bought this CD the year it was released, I listened to it once, and hated it. As the years went by, it has become my favorite. It is very different from anything he has done before. It is pretty close to a country sound. This CD has grew on me so much, it is the first I grab out of his collection. 'Jackie Brown' is an excellent, sweet song. One of his best. From the start to the end, this is Mellencamp's finest work. Let's not forget about the band. As always, they are underrated. Wanchic, Meyers, York, and Aronoff are incredibly talented, and deserve much more recognition."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Sneaks Up On You","review":"Scarecrow, Lonesome Jubilee and Big Daddy form a trilogy of socially conscious, folky, earthbound music ... but this is the album I go back to.

This is all fine and dandy if you're using it for one keyboard (which since it's by Casio I guess the target audience would), but my keyboard and synth rack are on opposite sides of my workspace. You can rip the glue apart to seperate them but it makes the cables feel very flimsy.Connecting the cable to the Joystick port on my sound card would have been a lot easier if the connector had thumbscrews. Instead, it has mini-flathead screws.The MIDI OUT jack seems very flimsy. Every so often I have to check on it to make sure it's in all the way. This was quite frustrating as all my synths would be playing one minute, then nothing would be playing.Look for something better, or make it work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for Cathy","review":"These cables require you to switch the output end of the cord to the input port on your keyboard, and vice versa.

For the default device, choose 'MPU-401' from the drop down and choose 'apply' then 'ok'. Set the keyboard gm mode to 'on', and play any MIDI through media player or real one player.

He does not aim to tell about everything that happened, only give us a broad look at the period. Islamic literature, law and customs are all included.My biggest problem here is with the introduction, which takes up about a fifth of the book. Hodgson feels compelled to justify his entire branch of study in this chapter, as if the subject were somehow unimportant. Again and again he points out that that what we know is not the full truth. Islam and the Arabs are too complex for that. I have never liked this approach both because it is obvious and unworkable.

It's a fictional \\"docudrama\\" about the beliefs and struggles of certain Hopi traditionalists, however the actors are blatantly white people, and the plot and dialogue of the film is painfully contrived - especially when the producer attempts to convey Hopi wisdom and prophecy. It all comes across as a white man's fantasy, certainly not representing the voice of aboriginal people, or the dignity of their histories and struggles. I ordered this film hoping for archival footage of Hopi elders speaking, which the name and vague description alludes to. Don't be fooled -- if you are interested in authenticity, look elsewhere.

The tome is impenetrable, dense with turgid and unhelpful examples, burdened with the authors' pathetic attempts at humor, and manages to make the most basic of financial concepts (such as CAPM, the dividend controversy, and optimal capital structure) incomprehensible to all but the most steely Wall Street veterans. No wonder the street loves it---it makes the discipline seem completely beyond the ken of mere mortals (and first year MBAs).

However, then they seem to jump from that of a very basic level to a high level. Formulas are given without thorough explanations, which make it difficult for those who have had limited finance/accounting experiences. There are other concepts that are explained in more detail but they tend to be the ones that are very basic to begin with. Finally, as the chapters progress, there is more ambiguity. Illustrations don't seem to be very helpful. The study guide (which does not seem to be offered through Amazon yet) helps summarize these chapters.

You cannot study the topics in the field of finance by relying solely on your intuition and avoiding concepts as trivial as random variables or basic calculus. Since the book is said to be used in the MBA programmes, I believe the title of my review becomes even more relevant. 2. I agree with the reader who claims the authors have a lousy sense of humour. 3. The book is simply too fat. The authors want to speak about everything and manage to analyse - nothing.

There are absolutely no footnotes for Bacon's difficult and labyrinthine prose, no translations of his Latin quotations, as well as plain typographical errors. For instance, one of the more famous lines in essay 11 runs, \\"All rising to great place is by a winding stair\\" which this edition renders, \\"All rising to great place is by a winding star.\\" A small error which completely obfuscates the sense of the passage.

It was a Jukebox Studio 20 from Archos. I wrote to them as I was experiencing some problems with charging the batteries and told them I used an Apple computer. They gave me a return authorization, I shipped it in, they charged me a fee for the fix, shipped it back. I wrote back saying I couldn't get the unit to work with an Apple and they simply replied that Apple's OS wasn't supported. I wrote back saying that I had specifically told them I used a Mac but never got a reply again... Maybe I should have reported them with the Better Business Bureau.

I can't beleive that something I bought for hundreds of dollars 2 years ago that needs a battery should be tossed.They said if I found a battery that I would still need to find someone handy with solder.

However, after another year or so, I went out and bought 2112, and what can I say about it that you don't already know? Followed by, Power Windows because of Mystic Rythms, another favorite of mine. and finally Moving Pictures, for the comercial aspect of it, and Caress of Steel, which is quickly becoming another favorite in my collection.Neil Peart is the second reason I started to buy Rush albums, his technical abilities and lyrical preciseness just left me in awe.

Just try to get it to play one CD then move on to the next one. When you play a disc, at the end it just stops. You MUST change to the next disc by pressing a button on the unit or the remote. The tech support admits that the unit was not designed to move from disc to disc except manually. You can do random play and get it to move from one disc to another, but that is the only way. In addition, you MUST have this unit connected to a TV at all times in order for anything to make sense. The cursor buttons do double duty, so for some functions you must press the menu button before pausing or stopping a CD in play. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. Just buy a single disc player, and you are better off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last","review":"I bought this DVD player 1 year ago and the laser tracking went out, meaning that no disc can be read - CD or DVD. This is the main component to a DVD player and to repair it costs more than it would to purchase a new machine. I called Toshiba to complain as I believe anything of quality should last more than 1 year. The would not replace the item or even cover the cost of repair. I will not purchase Toshiba again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big waste of time and money.","review":"I initially bought this player specifically for my Buffy/Angel addiction. Big mistake - it won't access the scripts on some seasons via the chapter skip keys, and the lack of shuttle keys on the remote doesn't offer the usual alternative. This will matter to people who watch any dvd series proiduced by TCFHE, as their in-house production values continue to fall.That was just the start of what's wrong with this player. It won't play my homemade VCDs or DVDs (which all of my other players handled without trouble until they crapped out). It has no resume feature, and many times the carosel returns to disc 1 after shutting off. The carosel loads backwards, from disc 5 to disc 1, which is annoying when trying to retrieve discs to put away.On the plus side, it does play mp3 data discs which aren't finalized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"The component outputs on my SD-6915 don't work.

The menu setup is obnoxious.On the plus side, it's just fine for playing SACDs.

The firmware upgrade doesn't fix either of the two problems I've listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst purchase I have ever made.","review":"This player is the biggest piece of CRUD I have ever seen. It locks up, the picture goes in and out and the remote is a train wreck! We had another Toshiba player for years and it was a workhorse, but it finally met its match (my 2 year old) so we bought this model and we hate it! There has to be a better model and Toshiba usually makes such great stuff, so this is a bit of a disappointment.It is not easy to operate and the reaction time is really slow. Pay more money and get a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only turns on at Sunset, does not turn off at Sunrise","review":"What was not clear to me when I bought this product was that it does not turn off at Sunrise. Basically the way it works is that it will turn on at Sunset. You then have to tell it how many hours you want it to stay on after Sunset. This means the lights are either staying on too long or not long enough. It does not have the ability to turn off at Sunrise. I wish I knew this before I purchased. I would recommend if you want something that turns off at Sunrise to get the Aube by Honeywell TI044/U Solar Programmable Timer. The only plus for the Sylvania is that you only need to enter in your area code.

For me, they were the only ones who equaled The Beatles in quality (if not quantity) of brilliant songs. I was hoping for a recording in a more intimate setting befitting their music. From the moment I heard the rowdy audience reception for \\"Old friends,\\" I knew this wasn't to be. It's Simon and Garfunkle, people, not ACDC! One reviewer claimed this DVD is better than the \\"Central Park\\" concert, but I disagree. I don't know if it was editing and production or a more respectful audience, but the \\"Central Park\\" concert seems vastly more intimate and satisfying. Don't get me wrong, if you're a fan you should purchase this DVD. S&G perform brilliantly, and it's a joy for this old timer to see them again 40 years later. I just think the rowdy audience spoils the mood of the music, and I wish a more appropriate venue had been chosen as a record of this historic reunion."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music","review":"Another American music treasure, \\"Gatemouth\\" is a great musician and his blend of of musical genres is something he performs with grace and professionalism.

Amazon.com is an authorized Monster retailer, many/most of the retailers on here are not and there is no warranty coverage for purchases from non-authorized dealers.

In fact, I see it is an even better price now than when I bought it! I was at Beast Buy yesterday, and didn't see this model, so it is probably on its way out. I had to surf around to check whether it had any power conditioning features, because the product description just has a generic blurb about Monster Power. Yes, it does have their Stage 1 filter.

Brody does all of the ventriliquism himself and Jovovich does all of her own singing and both are impressive and funny! Jovovich is one of the few supermodels who is actually talented enough to carry herself as an actress (take note Angie Harmon)and she is always a joy to watch. The only downside of this film is the quality of the DVD. The picture is grainy and it's a little distracting. I've got much older movies of much better quality so this copy was disappointing.

In a world that seems to be slipping into darkness this book is a beacon of intellectual light! The same is true for The Blind Watchmaker (Richard Dawkins, ISBN-10: 0393304485).Required reading for all science teachers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babbling Towers of Creationism","review":"Pennock's book is one of the most important studies of the Creationist movement written to date. The history of how evolution even became a topic of debate opens the book, followed by basic information illustrating why evolution is sound science. Noting the semantic games played by Creationists to cast doubt on evolution, Pennock demonstrates how these linguistic foibles contain no substance. In what is likely the most important part of the study, Pennock clearly documents the origins, tactics, and movements of the founders of the Creationist school. The efforts of Creationists to run \\"stealth candidates\\" in local school board elections is revealed to be a effort by design. For any reader concerned with not only the state of science education, but educational integrity as a whole, this book should be given most serious consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Enough to Wish More Dogmatic Darwinists Would Praise It","review":"Try a simple excercise. Write a book in your discipline. Cite the key people in your discipline who have written on the topic from the other point of view. Ignore their arguments. See if a special interest group (secularists) will praise it. Sadly, most anti-creationist books are just agit-prop for the choir.That is what this book does without end. Pennock cites philosophers Moreland and Plantinga (whose publication records are far more distinguished than his own), but never once deals with their pro-creationist arguments. Instead, he deals with parodies of the arguments of weaker opponents. My honor undergraduates would flunk if they handed in such arguments. Final assignment: any philosophers in the audience should try to formalize the author's take on the God of the Gaps argument. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straining to accommodate believers","review":"I have read the book and I suppose it will help die-hard materialists sleep at night, but frankly why would a true believer want to engage in this discussion at the level he pitches it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tower of Babel","review":"I didn't understand what he was talking about. Didn't he misspell babble? Did I misspell misspell?...Oh! Now I get it. Tower of Babel! I see. He's clever. But, now that I think about it, it doesn't exactly work. Oh well, it doesn't have to -- his field is philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial","review":"I bought this book expecting to find state of the art arguments supporting evolution and demolishing the opposition. But the arguments are weak and have been made repeatedly by others. Does the author really expect a computer program that supposedly simulates biological evolution to be acceptable evidence? Analogies with linguistics are very poorly explained - I was interested but so little solid information is given.Overall it is a straightforward polemic - the book could have been written in 50 pages, there is nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent refutation of the new creationism","review":"In response to court rulings that the teaching of creationism in public school science classes is unconstitutional, creationists have tried to tone down the religious aspects of creationism. They have even given creationism a new name: the so-called 'intelligent design' (ID) hypothesis. In TOWER OF BABEL, Robert T. Pennock refutes ID'ers and shows that creationism still has no business in a science classroom. In particular, Pennock provides a devastating refutation of the misguided arguments of Phillip Johnson, one of the leaders of the ID movement. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This was a fun to read book--in fact, I couldn't put it down. This book gives great insights, great ideas, and hope for our families! I will highly recommend this book to my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gave me renewed hope in parenting my teen!","review":"Thank you for giving parents new ideas in parenting their teenagers! It was witty, encouraging and sometimes heartbreaking. I would love to know more about Joe White and his summer camps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says foreigners can't rock?","review":"I first heard Thumb's \\"Break Me\\" on an old snowboard movie I bought a while ago. I would watch the video just to get to the part where Thumb played. Their music flows like nothing I've heard before, all while maintaining enough hardcore vocals, guitar chords, and intense drum beats that meet or exceed most (if not all) of the mainstream stuff out there. It's a wonder these guys aren't touring with big-name bands on big-name tours (Vans Warped Tour maybe?). Buy this album--you won't be disappointed. Also check out their premiere called \\"Exposure\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is very good","review":"This CD is very good. I first heard of Thumb in Germany, and i bought the CD and i was impressed. The songs are all very original and they do a good job of combining all the music and it sounds great! I highly recommend buying this CD if you are into heavy/hard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band","review":"I have been into these guys for years and i think they are great. They do the rap/metal thing well, not like limp bizkit who does it very poorly. They have a hard rock sound with turntables and an good vocalist. Sometimes the lyrical content is a little depressing but they balance it out with up lifting songs like \\"confidence.\\" Overall one of my favorite bands and definitly one of my favorite cd's and well worth checking out if your into hardrock/hardcore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"I was getting some feedback over my subwoofer, so after trial and error with the manufacturer, we determined it was a power problem. This was supposed to 'clean' the power to reduce interference. This, however, was not the case. It did a little in reducing the buzz, but by no means did it eliminate it. I ended up plugging the sub into my APC power strip and it works fine.If someone just needs surge protection or a minor power interference, I'm sure this would work well for them. In my case, it did not fit the bill"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real monster","review":"I plugged it in and the surge audible beeper instantly sounded off. I unplugged it and plugged it into a different recepticle with the same result. I called monster and the tech support guy assured me that there had been a surge through my wiring and the SW200 had sacrificed itself to protect my subwoofer, I hung up laughing. I never had a chance to plug the subwoofer in."},{"rating":"1","title":"product faikure","review":"Product failed(beeping) after being plugged in for 30 minutes. I returned product for credit.

Returning item and going to Best Buy,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wash, rince, repeat","review":"I don't quite understand the point of a surge protector that has to be discarded after it's tripped? There are so many reasons a circuit might trip other than a dangerous surge, but there's no way to reset the PowerCenter SW 200 once it trips. On the Monster website they tell you to stop using the device and contact your dealer. Why not build it with a replaceable fuse or a reset switch?

These fit the bill and so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"8-24-68","review":"Boy, a lot of us were happy when when this first show first was released on cd way back in '92. This was, after all, only the second archive cd release and still a year and a half before the first Dick's Picks. 1968 is one of my favorite years for the band and the sound quality here is very good for the most part. However, Some of the performances on the disc are only a little fair considering what circulates from this era. Schoolgirl is good but there are better versions out there. Dark Star is very young here and doesn't get \\"out there\\" at this point in time. Saint Stephen picks up up nicely in a hyperdrive way and goes into a good Death Don't Have No Mercy. The main reason to get this release is for the That's It For The Other One->New Potato Caboose which is the best version I've ever heard. Turn On Your Lovelight is okay and is on it's way to turning into the ones in 1969. Morning Dew is good but suffers at the end by having the sound system turned off on the band due to a cerfew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with digital Piano","review":"It doesn't work with digital piano. When you play piano you need to hit the keys hard which causes the stand and the piano on top of it to shake a LOT, especially when you hit the keys near two ends of it.
