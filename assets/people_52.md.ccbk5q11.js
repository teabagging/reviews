Although it is nice to see some of the characters that die in the above series alive again, this is played more as a parody. Don't get me wrong, I love parodies, but this one just isn't that funny.

The depth of his guitar has been destroyed; background music has been added to produce a sound somewhere between the music of Gene Autry and Bob Wills; there is the unmistakable sound of steel guitar (i.e. distinguishably NOT dobro). It is just awful. I was so disappointed and this is not, I think, typical of Bear Family Records. I have every Bear production of the music of Hank Snow and those are absolutely faithful to the originals.

If you can't tell by the amount of reviews, this is a good album. I don't think there is a better MCee out there than Gift Of Gab. Not to mention Cheif Xcel, who I think is probably the best producer in hip hop. This CD is good from start to finish. All you need is your back button on your CD deck, so you can listen to the tracks again and again. This CD is probably like no other hip-hop album you've heard. Even rock n roll kats I know can't get enough of this album. The way Gift of Gab switches up his rhyme styles between tracks and even albums is mind blowing. The Gift Of Gab lives up to his name.These two blend together seamlessly. Gift didn't wake up one morning and decide he could rhyme. He has worked at his style, and it shows...the same with Chief.

There are a few tracks that stand out - the track with Gil Scott Heron is nice. The rest are weak attempts at R&B influenced hip hop. Track 5-7, 9 and 11 are disgusting examples of how good hip hop units use R&B to dominate songs.Frankly, I have seen enough good hip hop groups sell out - Tribe, Mos Def, Outkast.

Why talented lyricists feel the need to ruin a decent track with some chick bleating indecipherable whines is beyond me.Stand out tracks Blazing Arrow and Chemical Calisthenics drag this album out of the mire of one star and into the less-than-respectable bog of two stars.Don't bother buying the album, just buy Blazing Arrow and Chemical Calisthenics and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont let money change ya...","review":"blackalicious,very disapointing record. i have been a fan for years and been to many, many shows. picked it up only to hear another independent act conform to major label quotas. when was quannum synonomous to jiggy pop? if nia was the purpose and this is the path, where are you headed? what happened?please do not deny your blatant decision to sell out. yes, there are 3 really nice tracks. however, xcel no longer excells and gift of gab now sings? i guess your arrow is pointing in the same direction as mos def's. i'll watch you on the next mtv hip hopera.get your money blackalicious. i was hoping you could resurrect a dying genre. remember:so if you're blessed with the talentutilize it to the fullestbe true to yourselfand stay humble.mca picked you up to continue what you firmly and unanimously held down for years. please bring it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classical Dressage at It's Best","review":"Classical dressage explained in a clear manner to help rider and horse be their best. Excellent read! 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"With all of the great reviews and the author's reputation, I was expecting a lot more. I just don't see anything new here, to me it reads like a dictionary on dressage. Fine, but not too interesting. I guess what really put me off straight away, was the the author's claim that horses are not very intelligent, and if they were we would be afraid to be near them at all. And \\"A horse will never do anything on purpose\\". I think that anyone who has spent a lot of time around horses would disagree with that statement. For example, if you have ever seen a horse work open a stall latch, I think you might agree that they are capable of doing things on purpose and with planning. From someone who supposedly stresses love for the horse during training, I found these statements quite inaccurate and somewhat cold. I've got loads of books on dressage, and this one would be at the bottom of my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dressage In Harmony","review":"I believe that Dressage In Harmony is a must have for anyone who is seriously interested in dressage.

I use it regularly as a reference guide each time I move up to a new level of dressage, so I bought another copy and will never lend it out again. Needless to say, I highly recommend this book. It explains, in fairly detailed but clear language, the aids for each dressage movement. In addition, it outlines what not to do, and mistakes to watch for. I also use this book as a refresher for movements I've already \\"mastered\\" and regularly discover something I missed the first time through.

The best part about this book is the language. It just sparkles with wit and humor. Even the cliches are used in fresh ways. The story is complex enough that you stay interested in the characters. The focus however is on the heroine and not the story. She (the heroine) is somewhat tarted up, and sex-hungry, probably because the author believes that gratitous and anonymous sex makes a book sell better and not beacuse it fits the character. This part of the heroine's personality does not ring true. It would have been more believable if the heroine lusted after the CEO with whom she has regular contact. But I think the writing makes it a worthwhile read, much better than higher rated Jennifer Crusie books in the same genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly enjoyable.","review":"I grabbed this CD because I saw them open at a concert.

When I upgraded to 4.0, I found it somewhat different than 3.0, but once I get used to it, I found it very useful.The support is excellent and it is free via email. I have yet to find any company does as well. They response through email in a day or two. They have never failed me. Once I lost my CD during a move, I called and they replaced the CD for $10 (S&H;). Very professional. Good company, good service, good product.Of course, I want more features. This is the only reason I don't give it a 5-start rating. Can't wait to see what's in 5.0 in Sept, 2002.

It also features \\"You're the One\\", his duet with Naire Brennan off the \\"Circle of Friends\\". Another incentive to fork over the dough is \\"Rake at the Gates of Hell\\" a rarity from STAIGHT TO HELL, Shane's acting debut(if you want to call it that).So, splurge.

It's hardly a substitute for new material, old MacGowan is better than no MacGowan. About half of the album consists of tracks from THE SNAKE and CROCK OF GOLD. The other half are B-sides from singles and other rarities. Of those, \\"Rake at the Gates of Hell\\" is worth the price of the CD if you can't find the track elsewhere.

I rate rock and roll by its ability to send shivers up and down my spine. The Surfers send them up and down with a mega-volt shock. I like all their albums, but this one seems the most refined and demonstrates, I think, the true scope of their abilities. The very fist song grabs you and swings you around the ceiling fan and then sends you flying. But then in the next song they start out gently and accoustically and work up to the pummeling.

If I was stuck on a desert island with only 10 albums of my choice, this would definitely be one. The songs are consistently well written, performed and produced. Paul Leary is probably my favorite guitarist next to Hendrix. He's got this distinctive, psychedelic style with an obvious ear for music (which is exactly why he produces these days).Nearly every song is truly fantastic. \\"The Wooden Song\\" is my favorite with \\"Goofy's Concern\\" a close 2nd.I also highly recommend their album \\"The Hole Truth...and Nothing Butt\\". It is a compilation of their earlier stuff which is much more raw, but also very entertaining.

It is a very good hard rock record, I suppose, but the Buttholes existed to make your jaw drop and your ear hurt, and I'm too desensitized to their brand of brutality to not be all that impressed with this. And, if you want a better cut of Gibby throwing up than \\"Clean It Up\\", I suggest you check 'Cream Corn From The Socket of Davis' \\"Comb\\" circa 1985.

I found it 4 years ago as an Japanese import. (apparently many other folks bought it too). While I was excited to finally own this music on a Cd, the quality of the transfer work pretty much ruined the recording. Either by over-compressing, or misusing Dolby noise reduction - the songs came out muffled - with a \\"halting\\" quality - missing the smooth musical stream intended.

That is not a complaint but a warning.For someone looking for more diversity, don't start here, look for a compilation like the David Byrne ones. And for a taste of classic samba, check out the wonderful nostalgic Todo Azul of Velha Guarda de Portela.P.S. There's a bonus CD with sambas from each school but from previous years.

You're ready to point and shoot in 1.5 seconds, and this camera takes amazing pictures.For those who have said that the flash is alittle dim, you can change the flash brightness via the menu and you might also want to play around with the white balance to tweak the indoor settings too.I've read that some are annoyed about the pictures being blurred... did you accidently leave your camera on MACRO mode? That's my only problem with the W1, is that it is really easy to accidently depress the MACRO button.On battery life... I'm up to about 300 pictures with the included Sony rechargable batteries. I'm really happy with the battery life compared to what Sony used to offer before with the other \\"S\\" type batteries.One thing I need to do is to switch the camera to 3x2 ratio (2592x1728) so that it comes out without being cropped on 4x6 photo printers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super camera","review":"This is an extraordinary camera. It's better than a larger Sony digital I have. The LCD screen is a pleasure to use. . . So far no complaints and I complain a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"At first the camera worked great. It broke within 6 months. Fortunately, the warrenty paided for the repair the first time - but it took 2 months! It was sent back to me still broken the first time. At 13 months, right after the 1 year warrenty expired, the LCD screen went out. What's the point of owning a digital camera if you can't see the photo? The cover for the batteries is also failing and the shutter no longer closes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagued with mechanical problems.","review":"Loved the camera at first. But then I noticed that the problems listed below were also the problems many other owners on the internet were having.1. Battery door tabs break. Must buy entire compartment from Sony.2. Lens won't retract.3. Dust specs on the inner lens (inside camera housing). Repair manual will cost money if requested from Sony.4. Movie-mode will continually go in and out of focus even if aimed at stationary object while on tri-pod.Get a service plan cause you'll be sending this guy off within a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry no matter what I do","review":"I read the reviews for this camera in several places online before purchase. I have to say I am quite disappointed. Two out of three images are blurry no matter what and in low light conditions that jumps to five out of six or worse. I have tried every setting, spoken with Sony support, and the only way to get a clear picture is to use a tripod with the timer. When it does take a clear picture they are very nice, you can see a lot of detail and the color rendering is quite good. But what is the point. I have to take several pictures of everything and even then I might not get a clear one. Also, the memory stick that comes with it will not support the highest video resolution - you need a memory stick pro for that. The next time I buy a digital camera I am getting one with image stabilization. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAME PROBLEM THAN LAST REVIEWER","review":"Exactly the same happened to me. After less than 2 years of use, the lens mechanism broke and had to pay around $200 for repair. After that repair, the batteries lasts enough for 5 or 6 pictures then goes dead, no matter how charged they are. To make it worst, now the flash is dead and there is no available replacements for it, so pretty much it is garbage now.Otherwise, before it broke the pictures were pretty good, but honestly I prefer the quality and colors of my 2 megapixels Olympus.I will never buy a Sony camera again, this was a terrible experience, I will try a Canon now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Hold Up Over Time","review":"After less than three years of use, and after $300 in additional lenses, my DSC-W1 was inoperable most of the time. After one year of flawless performance, the cheapness of the camera began to show.First the lens transport mechanism failed, so I sent it in for $180 worth of repairs. Now less than a year later, the camera does not recognize battery levels in any photo/movie mode. It will display a full battery icon, but only after just one photo, it thinks the battery is dead and shuts off. I'd be an idiot to send it for service again for another $180.Bottom Line: If you are looking for a simple, good, compact point-and-shoot camera that will last you a year, Sony's Cybershots will do the trick.But if you are careful with your equipment and are used to getting three to five years out of your electronic devices, then don't buy a Sony Cybershot. They just don't last."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to LOVE this camera BUT...","review":"I wanted to love this camera, but it was not to be. I researched for about a month and was sold on all of it's features; 5.1 mega pixels, 2.5\\" LCD, loads of manuel controls and effects and the ability to attach telephoto and wide angle lens and filters. One problem, every picture I took over the course of 3 days was VERY soft/fuzzy. I tried adjusting all the manuel settings, nothing, just fuzzy pictures. I even did a picture for picture comparison with my old 2.0 megapixel Canon s100 and the Canon was sharper . I took the camera back and got a Canon Powershot A80, loads of features, attachable lens,$100 bucks less...GREAT pictures. One last thing, be careful who you buy from, I purchased from a company that likes to say their a 'best buy', and had a nightmarish time trying to return the sony, good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great camera; But not built to last","review":"This camera will take amazing pictures, and the 2.5 inch LCD is quite impressive.However, I definately would not buy it again.After 13 months of having the dscw1, it malfunctioned beyond personal repair, and Sony customer service is a joke.The warrenty ran out a month ago. And sony wants $171 to fix a camera that I paid $350 for.I am quite upset with the situation, but there's not much that I can do. Just take my advice, and go don't buy this camera; it was not meant to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good pictures, lousy software","review":"I just bought this camera a week ago and it takes excellent pictures (not good for sports or action shots). The problem I have is the movie mode. It's great for being compact and taking short little clips. Unfortunately, it's only compatible with the software that Sony includes. I can't burn to DVD or create a memento CD with editing or music. Which is what the salesperson told me I could do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy Pictures Galore!","review":"Don't be fooled by all these 5-star reviews, I am at my wit's end with this camera. It take horrendously underdeveloped or fuzzy pictures well over half of the time. I have tried changing the speed, I've tried holding the camera differently, I've tried everything and still bad pictures are taken. DO NOT get this camera if you don't use a tri-pod ALL of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not for moms with young children!","review":"I've had my camera for almost and year and I will admit I have not even looked at the manual. My husband encouraged me to buy this camera because he was issued one by his employer and we could share information and some things like memory sticks etc.My biggest gripe about the camera is the delay in taking some pictures. It's mostly an indoor problem. In low lighting situations it has over a 4 second delay. With three year olds that's too long! I miss my shot almost 70% of the time! Sometimes it takes so long I'll move the camera to see if it's on or in the right selection and then the camera goes off taking a blurred picture of the ceiling. Other people who have used my camera had the same problem.I can't make comments about the picture quality because I'm really behind in printing my pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Camera","review":"A bargain 5.0 mp camera. I would never buy anything other than a Sony camera and this was too sweet a deal to pass up on. I got it for $250.00. It real easy to use, the batteries last a long time before needing to recharge. Lots of great features, I'm still learning to use, takes excellent color photos. and the LCD screen is pretty big so you can get a good preview of what the photos look like before you save them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Cybershot DSC-W1 Digital Camera Review","review":"I own this digital camera and I really like it. It has 5 megapixels which means it has 5 million pixels in this tiny device. 3x Optical Zoom isn't too good but most digtal camera providers make this zoom standard. It has a 2.5\\" screen which is perfect for viewing and if you compare that with a 1.5\\" you can really see the difference. I like the silver color on this camera and I think it looks sleek. It takes memory stick which is somewhat of a hassle to get but I like that it's really small. I would recommend 1GB Memory Stick rather than te 32MB it comes with. You can really take this on your vacation and take beautiful images and when you come home you can edit them, burn them onto a disk or e-mail them to friends and family. A definite recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cool tool, shoddy product, lousy support","review":"I purchased this as a x-mas gift for my busband. We both thought it was pretty cool and useful. . BUT within 6 months the remote sensor stopped working (it was telling us that it was 138 degrees F). Silly me I figured that something at this price point would still be covered under warantee. Not so. OSI is saying we need to buy another remote sensor.

The different areas of the puzzle, though very distinguishable when viewed as a whole, are frustratingly similar in their various parts.

For those who want a challenge and are tired of the all too easily assembled puzzles out there, this one will prove your mettle as a puzzle person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging, almost annoying","review":"Definitely a difficult puzzle, because there are very few parts of the puzzle that are obviously \\"unique.\\" Even the EDGE was hard to get together correctly. Once we had assembled perhaps 75% of the puzzle, we started getting almost annoyed at trying to finish it. The last 20 pieces were just as hard! I would recommend this for the hardcore puzzle-lover, but it's not a good pick for a family activity or for people looking for some puzzle-relaxtion. Quality of the puzzle pieces is good and it held together well once we got it finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly frustrating, but fun","review":"This is probably one of the hardest puzzles I've put together. When I began working on the tree and the castle, I had to go by shape instead of color because everything looked exactly the same.

Although I read it a little while ago I remember it to be a very engaging novel. It was highly recommended by my english teacher, but he would not make it required reading because of some lewd context. So I decided to read it for just that reason. It was a little shocking to me when I read it but it was highly enjoyable. It is about a man reflecting on his life growing up in a jewish family, by describing it as you would when speaking to a psychiatrist. It is just hilarious both in its context and the way that it is written in the tone of worrisome and frantic person. It gives a very vivid picture of his childhood. It was wonderful. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portnoy's Complaint","review":"I cant believe I payed for this book! I am not a prude, but I sure could not find any reason for the raunchy sexual writing in this book. I can write a book this good. Would not recommened this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to read","review":"Phillip Roth's 1969 novel or perhaps it would be more accurate to say \`tirade' actually holds up remarkably well after three decades. The novel is a prolonged rant to the narrator's analyst about growing up Jewish in New Jersey during the 1940's; it has all of the stereotypes one would expect; an overprotective/overbearing mother and father, alienation, humiliation, sexual frustration, the conflict between assimilation and modernity, and so on and so forth. The novel also has a nearly endless cascade of vulgar humor, often quite hilarious and smacking of reality. Roth has managed to concoct a brilliant pseudo-memoir; it's the literary Woody Allen dressed up with impressive verbiage and a razor-like ability to employ allusions. This is a slim work, but it is impossible not to devour. The jokes will leave you in tears and the narration is wonderfully composed. It is acerbic, real, and touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty funny, thought provoking","review":"This book is incredible. It is pretty funny, although sometimes I had to remind myself to laugh since it is presented in such a dark way: a psychitrist's office!

Hey, if you like Woody Allen, imagine him reading the whole thing--that's what I did!Hey, here's my chance to vent--I really hate it when a book becomes a best seller and every jerk on the street reads it and half of them don't get it! They end up saying dumb stuff like \\"it was boring\\" or \\"it didn't make since\\". I sometimes call it the \\"Salman Rushdie Complex\\", referring to all the numb-skulls who bought Satanic Verses when it hit the charts big,thinking it would be some easy read.Pooee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Interesting","review":"This novel was an excellent piece of what happens with adolescents to achieve their desires. He battles Sexual Repression the most. This is confirmed by interesting forms of masturbation, fetishism, and voyuerism. His immoral actions lead up to a suprising ending. Not for the weak-stomached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!","review":"I resisted reading this piece of trash when it was first released in a blaze of controversy some 50 years ago but in a moment of weakness, out of sheer curiosity, I recently purchased it for my Kindle because it was dirt cheap.Now, half a century later, 'Dirt' and 'cheap' are still two very appropriate words to apply to this book.

I could only read it in little bits, the story is packed with humorous crude snippets of Jewish life ,and overloads your senses with exaggerated caricature..When I finally finished it last week, I guess I ended up liking the book..as a definitive book about Jewish American culture of the period, I think it is sadly lacking..Funny in parts, outrageously lewd throughout, some of the family scenes read like my own Jewish childhood in London..Either I missed the profound statement behind the book or there isn't one really..not focussed enough for my liking, but definitely interesing reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summer Reading Book, Not at All anti-Semitic","review":"I picked Philip Roth for my AP English Research Report. In the end, I was glad I did. Portnoy's Complaint and his other novels and short stories were hilarious.

The beauty of Roth is that he can achieve this voice. All AP English students, especially those at LMHS should read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I missed something.","review":"I picked up Portnoy's Complaint expecting that it would not disappoint. More than one reader whom I respect a great deal told me that I should not neglect Portnoy's Complaint in my quest to understand how highly Roth is regarded in the literary world. For the most part, I loved Roth's American Pastoral. Save for one passage that made me laugh out loud and one passage about a neighborhood softball game, Portnoy's Complaint was a 287-page rant (I defy you to shuffle through the book randomly and find a page that isn't peppered with exclamation marks) that I suppose carried a great deal of shock value when it was published in the late sixties. Roth's Afterword is immensely more interesting than the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiney Jewish New Yorkers","review":"I found this book to be racist. Maybe Jewish people might enjoy it.

But outside of that narrow zone of reference, \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" is fatally shrill, a hard, thin mat on which to lie. The streaky \\"humor\\" of the book - and here is where it severely disappoints - is conceived entirely in the author's imagination of self, and wholly for his benefit, not ours. The great lesson I learned from this novel is the inescapable danger writers wade into when they affix self-deprecation to vainglory.

The main character, Alexander Portnoy, simply recounts a series of sexual encounters - with women, glass milk bottles, pieces of raw meat - the whole book just turned into a farce, needling in on the same obsession over and over. Does everyone with an overbearing mother sexually assault raw animal flesh?If this is definitive Jewish-American literature, something is seriously wrong and a re-assessment should be in order.

The graphic on the felt is of high quality (not faded, discolored, etc.) and the accurate size as listed."},{"rating":"2","title":"craps on a budget","review":"nice layout could be better felt but not bad fun to do when you don't want to go to the casino"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good full sized felt craps layout","review":"There isn't anything particularly unique to say about this item. It is essentially a WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) product since it is the craps table layout on a large piece of felt. That said, I am happy with this item. It is essentially a full size craps layout at 72x36 inches and is great to have several people around to play craps. Delivery was fast and the product was just as I expected it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the home craps game","review":"This is a very good craps felt. Does everything you need it to do. Can't wait to use it to build my home craps table. The markings are clear, although the red is more burgundy than fire-truck red.

We are looking into now buying Noah the other toy to go with it for his 1st birthday. Great Sounds, Great colors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING!","review":"This toy is probably the single most annoying toy my son has owned. It is so loud, and there is no way to cover a speaker with tape to muffle the sound. Even worse, the toy keeps imploring \\"press the little bear button to play with me\\" long after my kid has moved on. I did appreciate it teaching animal sounds, names, and colors, but it was too obnoxious to keep in the house for my younger daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic toy","review":"So far I've purchased 3 of them (one on Amazon.com) as birthday presents (for 1st birthday) and all three children (two boys and one girl - not related) adore this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My grandson loves it","review":"I haven't personally interacted with this item but my bilingual daughter tells me that her 20 month old loves it and often plays with it. He is especially drawn to toys that respond to his touch. This one is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"entertain me junk","review":"This is a bells and whistles toy, that is totally worthless without its batteries. While it does have the redeeming factor of a bilingual presentation of animals and numbers, it is a big dud. The kids do like it, and push the buttons, but they mostly use the button for lights and music. If you want to train your child into an entertainment junkie with a very short attention span, this toy would be a good start. But then that is my opinion on most battery operated toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Dean's best cd","review":"Billy Dean is such a talented singer and should've recived more recognition and accolade for his music than he has. This 1993 release is one of his best.

I received and played my DVD today. The singing was lousy. In fact, it was horrible. It was so bad until I was unable to watch the entire DVD.As you can imagine, I was very disappointed and would like to advise everyone to SAVE YOUR MONEY. If the DVD were free, it still would not be worth watching. I truly believe I could have done a better job singing/performing with Alvin and the chipmunks as my backup singers. If I could rate this a zero I would.This is truly a group that sounds much better on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too bad","review":"i thought with william harts age he is doing ok, we can't really expect him to hit the same notes he did back in the day but he still sounds pretty good. my problem is that the delfonics are a group, i really like to watch the choreography and on this dvd a lot of the camera is on william hart who as i know is the leader but i think their award winning dance routines are a big part of their act and should be shown also. That was my biggest problem with the 70's soul jam concert dvd too much camera time on the audience and the violin players not enough focus on the main performers especally wilberts harts delfonics and the whispers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste","review":"This DVD is awful.

The Gate of Paradise explores the Andean teachings of ageless wisdom which lays dormant in the heart of all wayfarers who journey within. The knowledge in this book is so potent and inspiring that its hard to put it down until you've soaked it all up. The teachings breathe life into the reader and causes a retrieval of innocence, along with an aire of care for the entire earth kingdom. All becomes mystic, all is mystic, all of life is a wonder once the shamanic teachings are absorbed and experienced. As Chamalu states, live in the poetic dimension. This is an author that lucidly transmits the sacred message worthy of all times and spaces(try Chamalu, another title).

He found it fun the first couple of days, but quickly lost interest. I don't blame him, there's not a lot of stuff you can do with it. There's the head that when pressed, plays one song. then there are 4 things on the shell, each makes exactly one different sound when turned/pressed/spun. While I don't argue the educational value and the cuteness and durability of this toy, it just doesn't seem like a good value. Of course, that was from a grown-ups perspective, my kid probably just doesn't like turtles.It does work right out of the box, which is always nice, no need to install batteries and stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new medical mystery!!","review":"I love medical mysteries and am always looking for new authors-and this one is great!!

There were some challenges in tying together a few pieces of the book, and I stretched to make some storylines work. However, I really enjoyed the personalities of Marie-Laure and Joseph, and their love did prevail through very trying circumstances. I also felt that the author's style of writing and the flashbacks were interesting to read and kept the book flowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Ridiculous and Clich��","review":"I was sorely disappointed...I'm not sure what I expected...something believable perhaps. Unfortunately this novel reads like a sexually explicit episode of The Young and the Restless.The characters are flat, the clich��s are many and the murder mystery portion of the novel seems like a complete after thought. I have to admit that Rosenthal did a nice job with the backdrop, France 1783-1789.But this story was overly focused on the explicit sex scenes between the main characters and falls flat with nearly every other aspect of the storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I read her first book *Almost a Gentleman* and liked it..The story was fun and different, but as soon as the sex comes into the book, it just goes downhill for me.This book was exactly the same way. Pam Rosenthal is gifted; I just do not know why her books become so nasty, and sexual.. and unromantic.. half way through them.This is truly, what people call a trashy romance. I just do not like them. I love sex in my books, but when it gets so descriptive and the words become porn and not romantic. It just turns me off. I threw this away in the trash half way in the book.I do love the exotic, and Pam Rosenthal is truly exotic. I just do not like trashy. Take the F words out and every position known to have sex in and there is no story anymore. It starts out wonderful and just come to a complete halt.. When the sex starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Case","review":"This case was perfect for our 7-Inch Coby DVD player. Plenty of room for the DVD player and cords. We used it on the headrest for the back seat and also hung it between the two headrests so both children could watch it. It worked perfectly and was easy to install. Great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"OS Best Product So Far...","review":"I have owned several Oregon Scientific products in the past, including 2 'wired' weather monitors. The unit provides fairly good forecasting, but I use it more for a 'heads-up' idea of the conditions. When in doubt I use the Weather Channel or the local paper. But it certainly helps to know before I open the front door in the morning if it is too cold to get the paper without shoes. Good buy when it is on sale, and the atomic clock updating is a real plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly a return","review":"I received what was clearly a piece of returned merchandise. There were no instructions in the box, the box was worn as if it had been opened multiple times and the batteries were already installed, and dead, in the base unit. Since I live in a rural location I opted to give it a try and fresh batteries seem to see it working OK. We'll see if the date/time updates before I decide to keep it. Fortunately the controls are fairly intuitive but a lack of instructions is a dissapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect present for a curious senior!","review":"I bought this as a birthday present for my elderly mother who has always been fascinated by the weather. Unfortunately, these days, she can't read her outdoor thermometer from any distance.

Homestead is one of my all-time favorites, a brilliant book. I can hardly believe that Tied to the Tracks was written by the same person. I found it silly and predictable.

Christie so turned her talents of genius and sheer horror up to full speed that I would consider this one of her very best works.Don't be disappointed because you know Poirot dies in this one. There is much more bite to the story than that. The reason that he dies, the method of the murderer, and the ways a few of the victims die are clearly a combination between the genius and craftmanship seen in 10 Little Indians and the creativity and shock effect known so well in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. This book will reaffirm your admiration and acceptance of just how complex and INCREDIBLE Agatha Christie was."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this if you like Agatha Christie","review":"It is a fitting finale to the great career of one of the best known sluths in the world.

Agatha Christie has an incredible ability to draw the reader in to her story.

A shocking and yet stunning book, so perfectly executed at Styles Court, where we first met the dapper Poirot. Now he is less than dapper but is all as it seems?

Despite this I can not fail but to give it full marks for a top story line and enough twists to keep anyone going."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"This book was really sad! After reading a lot of books about Hercule, it can really bring a tear to your eye. I think this is probably the first book you should read about Hercule Poirot.Anyway, the plot was really good, and the murder was surprising, but I was a bit disappointed with it, since it was Hercule Poirot's last case, and I think Agatha Christie should have made it a bit more twisting and complicated, but it was still really good, and I definately think it is worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 'Curtain' to true","review":"A nice one.

The translation is clear and accurate, the selection of tests is appropraite and accurately reflects what I would consider to be essential.

The development of good study skills is a challenge that is among the toughest of all parenting efforts. It's not easy to know how to react, how to encourage, where to draw the lines, etc. And knowing how to provide the proper direction without alienation is extremely tricky.

(They can accept the TARDIS is bigger on the inside, but not travelling in time?) They become caught up with some pirates, who are searching for buried treasure.Probably this story would have benefited from a less traditional adaptation. It tells the story well enough, but lacks any real spark. It also fails in the original mission for Doctor Who historicals, which was to educate the viewers.

It's still working as an atomic clock, but the projector is useless!Oh, and the alarm buzzer is really obnoxious and gets faster and faster the longer it takes you to get to it to turn it off. If you want to wake up in a frenzy, then this is a clock for you :oO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good click if you are not in Alaska Time Zone","review":"Clock does all that is claimed, EXCEPT, it will not accept anything farther west than Pacific Time. SO, if you are anywhere but in the lower 48 time zones, you are SOL."},{"rating":"2","title":"My gift, or my boyfriends?","review":"This is a fun and useful clock! My boyfriend got me this for Christmas, and now I know why. He plays with it every chance he gets. The first night, he must have hit the illuminate button 15 times in 5 minutes.Now some serious comments:For those who worry that the projection on the ceiling will bother you - don't worry, it doesn't. I'm an extremely light sleeper who needs complete darkness, but the projection of the clock doesn't bother me at all.I agree that the projection should rotate based on where you position the clock.Also, the only way to see the clock in the dark is to push the illumination button which lasts for 5 seconds. So if you're trying to set the alarm in the dark, you have to keep pushing the button, kind of a pain.For me the clock synchronized in about 10 minutes, so that was no problem.Again - well worth the low price, and one of the more useful gimmicks I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't be without this clock","review":"Had one of these for several years. Very accurate time, of course. At night I simply look at the ceiling to determent the time, I don't have to pick myself up to check. This newer model has LED's that project a more vivid red color which is very visible at night. I'm very satisfied with this clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"works great for the price, projection is hard to see with the lights onbut works good at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This is a fantastic clock!

She said that she could handle that and used it for a few days. But then she played iwth it and got it to work correctly without reading the instructions (which is usually a guy thing). When she showed it to me I saw that there was a USA map in the upper right hand corner where you select which time zone you are in. Go figured :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as we hoped","review":"Bought this for my 11 year old son mainly to see the time on his ceiling. The projected time is very clear and large. The clock itself is small so while it could sit on a table, he props it up on his bedside chair to aim the time on the ceiling just the way he likes it. It's not the best quality of materials but comparable to what else is out there, it's as good as it can get. Cute design for his hands and he finds it easy to use. He really likes it and so do we."},{"rating":"2","title":"Volume","review":"I am very pleased with the product. It is exactly as promised and delivery was so quick! My only complaint is that the alarm is too soft and is not loud enough to wake me. I have not yet contacted the manufacturer, But I feel certain they will help me with this problem. The transparency of that blue is pretty cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading Product, cust service refunded","review":"This product was incredibly disappointing and misleading! I'm not sure how this product ever earned the stars it earned already.1) The clock is incredibly small. This was not a problem, so long as the clock itself was back lit. In order to see the time at night, you have to push the button EVERY SINGLE TIME to see what time it is. When my clock is out of reach, it is problematic to have to nearly get out of bed just to see what time it is.2) The projector does work, but ONLY if the clock is pointing away from you and only points in one direction. It is not adjustable. Just like the issue with the back lit display, you can only see the time projected if you push the button. AND only with the clock facing away from you.What sense does this make? I did contact the seller and they not only refunded my money but also paid to have it shipped back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! 2nd one for us.","review":"My wife got one of these for a Christmas gift at work several years ago. It's been a fine clock with a small footprint and clearly visible time projection. I found I was having to roll over to see the time on the ceiling so since it was in the Gold Box I decided to order another. This newer version has temperature (not sure how valuable it is as it seems to be affected by the clock's operating heat - it's stayed within 1F of 68F since I installed it), and the projected time numerals are a larger font and a bit brighter. All-in-all a great clock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"small and good, I wish I could change the angle of the projection.","review":"Good clock. automatically sets it self. It is nice to know the exact time with out worry. I wish I couold change the angle of the projection. it seems to be set up to be put on a headboard. I put my alarm (normally) across the room but then the time is up side down on the ceiling. To diffivult to read that way for a tiered brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plan to lose sleep","review":"Bought this for my boyfriend last year, and he loves it. The only problem is that he gets too fascinated by the time display and tries to project it everywhere, especially on the walls and ceilings. So the days that I sleep over his place usually mean I won't be getting much sleep at all. He likes it best projected on the ceiling, and then spends the entire night staring up at it. Imagine as you are lying down to sleep, a giant projected red light on the wall. Granted, you will probably have to cover up this alarm clock every night. In any case, this clock is a lot of fun, but I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it needs batteries to operate certain aspects. Also, sometimes I wonder if I should have just bought my boyfriend a more... manly type of clock... this one resonates more of a kiddie type of feeling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute!","review":"I bought this for my niece. I open the box and when I hold this in hand, it is so cute, light weight and so cheap. They even include 2 AA batteries. I am sure she is going to LOVE this... I would recommend for any kids.This is so cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, works as advertised, minor setup snafu","review":"This product looks good, works well thus far (2 days) and both my kids think the red digits on the ceiling are really cool.I ran into a minor snag during the setup: after 10 minutes of being first plugged into the wall, the time had not yet synchronized to the atomic clock. So, I had to read the manual :-(It turns out that if the \\"low battery\\" ==/== sign is flashing, and it was, the battery needs to be replaced and the time will not synchronize when that's the case. Apparently, by the time I received this unit the two installed AA batteries were dead. As soon as I replaced them - within seconds - the clock displayed the correct time.This is probably the issue that caused some other reviewers to conclude the unit was defective. The manufacturer should really ship the AA batteries separate and sealed, not installed. This is the only reason why 4 stars and not 5.Otherwise, so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Family Loves the Projection Feature - Buying More","review":"I gave one to my nephew for Christmas and he and everyone else has liked it so well that everybody in the family tried it out and I now have to order one for his mother and also one for my husband.The projection feature is great and the projection display is actually larger and brighter than I thought it would be.To be honest I have to mention the drawback - the display on the clock itself is so small and not backlit so you have to be pretty close to it to see the time during the day.Until someone puts a projection feature on a larger size CD/alarm clock, we will continue to keep our old alarm clock and put this one on the other side of the bed and use it mainly for the projection feature.Even with the drawback mentioned, we all love the clock.

Clear, large display that was bright enough to read but not so bright it was distracting at night. It takes up little space on a night table, which is great.However, if it's on your night table you'll have to angle it so that the clock face is nearly toward the wall, as you can't adjust the projection. If you face the clock out toward the far wall, the projection will be diplayed upside down.Still, I was okay with this, as the projection was what I was interested in. And that worked great until it accidentally got knocked off the nightstand onto the carpet. One mishap and the projection was broken. Nothing could fix it; you can't even open the clock to explore the mechanics of it. Without the projection, it's simply a procey bed-side alarm clock. It's my fault for knocking it over, but I would think a clokc of this caliber should be a bit sturdier."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only alarm clock you will ever need","review":"I bought this alarm clock and that wow this is great. It shines the time on the ceiling, if you are a light sleeper that needs complete darkness (like me) then you can turn this off. This feature only works when plugged into the wall. When alarm goes off or just want to see time when in bed, hit the snooze button on top and time is shone on ceiling. Since the projector is attached to the clock, if you want to look at the display you have to turn the clock or otherwise your time will be on the ceiling sideways. I leave it sideways. But this is the only alarm, since the frequency of the alarm and the volume get persistently louder, that will wake me up. I have tried a ton of clocks before this and this is the one. I have had it for 3 months now and now I wake up before it gets to loud. It is such a great way to wake up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I was very disappointed when I received this clock after reading all the reviews about it and seeing it was a top seller.

It had a much more powerful projector, able to swivel, spin it, had HUGE nite glow numbers, also a radio and auto time set.... This junky little thing from Oregon Research is tiny...cheap construction and tiny buttons. It also has a tiny projection feature with no flexibility in viewing angles, and of course it doesn't have a radio. I can't believe this is a top seller on Amazon. I would buy the Emerson (sold at Target) for the same price hands down. (Oh by the way, the satellite time setting feature of the Oregon unit didn't work either). I have returned the unit.

I originally bought it because the large projection numbers on the ceiling were the only numbers of a clock that I could read at night after taking out my contacts. Now, after Lasik surgery I no longer am blind at night and can see just about any clock, but I prefer my projection and love being able to read the time on the ceiling. For 12 years I have left the time projected on the ceiling 24/7 and I am happy to report it is still working, although the projection numbers are admittedly less strong than they used to be.

There are no dedicated hour/minute buttons -- and the buttons that are there are poorly labeled. So you'd better keep the instructions handy.The projector on mine finally died, so I bought the Philips AJ3600 and am so much happier with it.

I would have liked to see photos of the shows through the years, diagrams, layouts and photos illustrating what it takes to set up this immense show. The interviews with show stalwarts such as Lee Radon, were great, but just not enough. The show has been in existence for 175 years.

The rest of the album is filled with funky grooves, wild samples, and a dash of punk rock, almost on the \\"alternative edge\\"(for lack of a better word). This is an album for anyone whose a fan of progressive hip-hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Whatcha Want?","review":"The best of the Beasties' IMHO. Simply amazing! Punk/funk/hip-hop with a little bit of flavor that only the B-Boys can add. I love all Beasties' up through \\"Ill Communication\\" but this album takes the cake.

Based on two hygrometers I have, it only covers a small area, mostly above the unit. It does not significantly reduce the humidity in a small bedroom, but perhaps keeps it in a steady level. The heat it produces will also heat up a room by 5-10 degrees F, which is great for cold winters, yet terrible for the hot summer. It may have help reduce the growth of mold and mildew, but does not entirely \\"zap\\" it as it claims. The positive thing is that is very quiet and does not have any moving parts that need frequent cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a simple item does such a Terrific job!","review":"We bought a new home with a 8 x 12 ft. storage room in the basement.

I am returning it and hopefully they will replace it with another one. Stay tuned as I will update this review. It should last longer than 4 1/2 months especially since it has been well taken care of.UPDATE: Had to call Sony for instructions since the Amazon return policy is only 90 days. Product has a year warranty, but only 90 days on labor. So, for $29 I can return the item to get a refurbished one, which is what I will do. The year warranty is for parts only!

I can't remember having a radio, modern or old, with a worse tuner. In a crowded FM market like Chicago's, the ability to select between close frequencies is critical: this tuner can't do it. It's noisy, and imprecise rendering the radio almost useless. If you're playing CDs only this may not be important; but if you're in the trades or like to play at the trades, look elsewhere. Unless you drag along CDs or an iPod (and why no dock, just a mini plug?) everywhere, this is not the unit for you. I should also note the clunky transformer, that doesn't conveniently store anywhere; it's halfway down the length of the power cord and doesn't stow nicely in the compartment at the back of the boombox. Since this box is no lightweight or compact unit to start with, I'm not sure why the transformer wasn't integrated into the box in the first place. Nice idea, lousy execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Father's Day Gift","review":"I got this for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it!

Cripes. . . . it's REALLY big!The sound is outstanding~~good radio reception, too. What's missing, besides easy portability, is a protected spot to place an iPod when it's hooked up. And the CD player top seems flimsy. Although the unit itself has a nice rubbery coating, it just doesn't seem like it could take much outdoor exposure, unless it's somewhat protected from the elements.I have a small Tivo radio that can stand up to this puppy any day.

This is great for farm work when you are moving around a lot. Also, we've hauled this thing from the garage to the wood shop to the garden.

The sound is adequate and I like the aux input feature; as I write this I am home with my SanDisk Sensa 8GB Fuze plugged in and running my MP3 collection. However, I would hesitate to use the ZS-H10CP's aux input out on a boat, camping or anywhere else where my Fuze or the boombox's aux input port could be damaged.This brings us to my only issue for CD players that are capable of playing MP3 files, they should be updated to run MP3 DVDs. Yeah I know then they wouldn't be called CD players but semantics aside let's get real, the cost difference between making a player that reads MP3s off of a DVD can't be that much more than a player that can read MP3 CDs and if need be who wouldn't spend a few bucks more to have a player that plays six to seven times more MP3s?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value - has everything","review":"This boombox arrived quicker than the music CD's ordered at the same time.

It sounds no better than the others, and I think it really is mostly the same thing but in a MUCH LARGER package. It is so much larger as to be unwieldy.

Sony deserves major credit for the rugged heavy duty design here. Unfortunately the low power of the amp and the lack of a subwoofer makes the unit inferior to some of Sony's previous models for the purpose of listening to hip-hop, dance, and other bass heavy music. To its credit the unit sounds great in general, and gets fairly loud without distortion. When you compare the sound of this boombox to one with even a 4 watt subwoofer, it just does not hold up. Based on the amount of modern music I listen to that utilizes extremely low frequencies, I find this unit unacceptable. For most people this is a great heavy duty unit with quality sound. If you want a subwoofer equipped boombox at almost the same price as this, look for the Sony CFDG505.

The common events described in the book are clearly from the era in which it was written (1950's, US), but the presentation could be considered post-modern in style, were it written now. My husband and I find ourselves quoting lines from this book to each other as they seem to describe our daily life as well.

It is the stuff anyone could write.The drawings--all of the drawings--are classic Americana but not pretty just....quaint. This book in particular has some truly wierd looking sketches, which make you wonder if Hurd finally succumbed to whatever troubled Brown.Good Night Moon is better, but the Big Red Barn is the best of her work, still not very good, but decent.Russell Hoban is my favorite children's author, and The Little Brute family is my daughter's favorite (along with the Two Sillies--a brilliant piece)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stick with Goodnight moon","review":"I was a bit disappointed with this one.

I wouldn't even check it out from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Enduring Masterpiece","review":"My son can listen to and look at \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and \\"Runaway Bunny\\" ten times each time we sit down with them. We barely got through \\"My World\\" once.The rhymes simply don't click and the story is not interesting enough to make up for it. I believe the illustration that made my son ask the most questions was one of toothbrushes hanging by strings on nails in the wall. He had never seen such a thing, but seemed interested in the prospect of putting his toothbrush on the wall.I suppose that was the reason he really didn't get interested in the book: he didn't identify with it. His daddy doesn't go fishing or sit on the front porch smoking his pipe. Now, he's never become a sailboat as the bunny in \\"Runaway Bunny\\" did either, but he was interested in the idea; it captured his imagination. \\"My World\\" didn't.Perhaps there are some children who might enjoy this, but definitely take it out of the library first before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A simple look at life from a toddlers perspective","review":"I liked this story for its' simple look at daily life routines and lyrical writing. At first I thought it was a little hard to find the rhythm of the writing but now we love reading it to our 2 year old son. The story shows a daddy bunny putting a baby to sleep (not many baby books show the dad's role so prominently), the mommy bunny in the room when the baby wakes up, a family eating breakfast, a dad going to work in the city & a dad and baby working on cars in the garage etc. It is a nice story for the toddlers starting to get a handle on the rhythm of family life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Travesty","review":"For children who love \\"Goodnight Moon\\" and \\"The Runaway Bunny,\\"this book is a huge disappointment. The pictures by Clement Hurd are enticing, reminding one of the previous books. But the text makes no sense at all. One expects rhyme but doesn't get it. Next there is an attempt at rhyme which doesn't make sense. Any attempt at a theme or continuity is a mess. Don't buy this book! The publishers are simply pawning this off as a companion to \\"Goodnight Moon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get unless bundled with Goodnight Moon and Runaway Bunny","review":"Not soothing like Goodnight Moon, nor whimsical like the Runaway Bunny. There is no \\"rhyme or reason\\" to this book; no flow from page to page and often even from line to line. It is almost like an attempt at haiku mishmashed with very random wordplay. Honestly, anyone with a little creativity and a high school degree could write a better book in an hour. My 20 month old daughter doesn't seem to totally hate it, but on the other hand, we'll read many of her other books almost every night. And from the adult point of view, I'd almost rather have my teeth drilled than to have to read from this book. It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed, don't read, just make up your own story","review":"My child loves to read Goodnight Moon, so I was delighted to see there was a continuation. The reviews were mixed here, so I decided to go for it and see for myself. I was very disappointed. The story is choppy to read and doesn't flow well at all. The illustrations don't always match (the text refers to items not even on the page) so if you actually read the text while your child tries to find the object there is a problem. I've started making up my own story. My child does like the connection between Goodnight Moon (same bunny, same balloon) but that is about it. I also find the fly on the bathroom shelf (next to the toothbrushes) a bit distasteful. If you liked Goodnight Moon I would recommend looking at Goodnight Gorilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rhythm - awful","review":"I probably have to read this book 5-6 times a day to my 1 year old son. (Actually, I have to read most of his books 5-6 times a day. That's part of the joy of having a toddler!) I dread each time he comes to me with \\"My World\\" held high. The beauty of \\"Goodnight, Moon\\" is in its rhythm - it is pleasant to read out loud. Brown's \\"The Big Red Barn\\" also has a fairly good rhythm. This book is jarring and discordant, almost as if Brown wanted to display the English language at its clumsiest. The illustrations are decent, but not great. Do yourself a favor. Your toddler will listen to anything. Buy him/her some Sandra Boynton books, or something from the \\"Tender Mercies\\" series. Buy \\"Goodnight Moon\\". Buy Dr. Seuss, (especially \\"In a People House\\"!) Don't buy \\"My World\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly disappointing","review":"After marveling at the sublime beauty of Goodnight Moon, we were extremely disappointed in My World. The illustrations are passable, but the writing is unforgivably bad. The elegant diction and serene rhythm of Goodnight moon are no where to be found. The writing in My World is insipid and lacks all the qualities that made Goodnight Moon so good. I can't believe the same author wrote both books. It's no Godfather II."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"My daughter loves her \\"Good Night, Moon\\" book and I thought, since that book was so good, that this one would be, too. It is not. The flow of the book is non-existent. You are never given the ability to get into a reading rhythm. Besides being disjointed the illustrations are not nearly as good as in the other book. There are a couple of well illustrated pages but those particular pages have little or no text. My child has not taken to this book the same way and is currently not interested in having it read to her. Maybe, when she is older, she will like it more, but I am not impressed or pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Substance over Style","review":"This is both fascinating and educational, so much to be digested and pondered within the context of a long-lived samurai and his hard-won advice. There isn't much else to say except to give it a hearty recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abstraction of conflict","review":"This book is an abstraction of conflict. Its designed to be the manual for any Samurai wanting to learn Musashi's style of life. Since his life was filled with one on one conflicts, he's a natural person to explain how to confront another skilled opponent and win.This book is often pushed as a business book in the United States and the entire meaning and motivation for that is lost on almost any business person who reads it. In Japan however, its the manual for business. Its a matter of understanding the underlying meaning instead of the surface. The surface is about hand to hand combat, but every single one of its descriptions can be abstracted into any type of conflict.Overall, if you're looking for a book that has depth, then this is your book. It's in my list of books that deserve to be chewed and digested."},{"rating":"2","title":"The point of a swordfight...","review":"...is to kill your opponent.The Book of Five Rings was recommended to me as a young martial artist and it changed my life. This classic is a must for anyone who has an interest in the martial arts, business, or how to address the problems of life. Musashi's wisdom and clarity ring down through the ages. His insights are thoroughly modern and applicable to the issues of today.I have been a martial artist for 15 years and management consultant for 10 and recommend this book to either audience. It is required reading for my clients.The Shambala edition is simply the finest translation of the Book of Five Rings that I have found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading along with the movie","review":"I found this book worth reading at the same time I watched Hiroshi Inagaki's classic samurai trilogy which is based on a Novel by Eiji Yoshikawa. According to reviews there are points in both the novel and movie that may not match Musashi's actual life, especially with respect his relationship with Otsu.This book gets down to his basic philosophy which ends with words that leave you thinking about the meaning of life: \\"In emptiness there is good but no evil. Wisdom exists, logic exists, the Way exists, mind is empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong info is posted","review":"you listed : \\"Yagyu Munenori (Translator) \\" He had nothing to do with this book, I think it must be a typo.FYI JD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting.

I strongly recommend this book to anyone who runs a business, is a martial artist or wants a clearer focus on how to deal with energy of all kinds."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARRIORS BIBLE","review":"Musashi, like every great warrior, knew that strategy was as important as tactics and techniques in combat. This book will teach you things that were learned in combat and will enhance your survival potential on the battlefield, street and life.It is not the easiest book to interpret and understand, but that hardly matters, as for the information in this book is worth your time and effort. One good book is worth a hundred crummy ones, and this book is one outstanding book. This book is divided into various distinct sections, and the serious and professional warrior should extract as much information as possible from each section. Every time I pick this book up I learn something new. This is the warrior's bible.I highly recommend this book to all readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"wild book","review":"crazy wild book, got it for my brothers b-day and read it after he did...very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mile-Marker Along the Way","review":"Was it the eighties when everyone ran out to buy this book to use as a business tool? Admirable, perhaps, but one might miss the point. Whether you are a butcher, a baker, or a candlestick maker, this book can help illuminate the Way for you. There are no easy answers in life. You have to find them for yourself. This book is an excellent map along the road to greater understanding of all things. If you are looking for a quick fix to your business woes, take a class at a community college. If you want to learn something about life and yourself, buy this book. Read it. Go away and think about. Come back and read it again. Understanding will happen somewhere along the Way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Any guy who is the least bit interested in warrior culture should have this book. This is a classic that you can pull from your kindle or bookshelf and always learn something new from it. It's not an easy read so don't expect to plow through the book.

If you buy this book be prepared for extremly onfusing lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"This is a really good book if you can really read into the lines and figure out what Miyamoto Musashi is saying. Because of course, we do not have many sword martial artists in this day and age. So you must look for more meanings in the book. And life styles and philosophies that he held.Its amazing how to find how similar things are now as they were back then, in many concepts, just in different shapes and forms.Really a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent me the wrong book","review":"Well i chose the rating because The book to the left in the imagine is the one i expected to get a nice hardcover of it. written by thomas clearly instead ive received a book writtin by a different author half the size of that book and cheap little paper book. i looked at the back of the book and i over paid for it by 6 dollars. Not the book i want and i think its disgusting people try to get away with making money like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is good, the translation is not...","review":"Musashi's words are great but the translation is not so good. There are misinterpretations of the meaning of the text because it is not translated from any experience with Japanese swordsmanship and the special technical vocabulary of swordsmanship. Plus the author includes part of Yagyu Munenori's (another master swordsman) text in it. It is not focused but rather confused. It includes both to make the book more marketable. There are better and more accurate translations out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have.","review":"I have read this book twice, once looking at it from a martial artist's view, and second as a businessman. It is a must have for not only businessmen and martial artists, but for all. Strategies for life and all its aspects can be interpreted from this book, though it may be difficult to do so. A philosophical and deep view on the gears of life and how to run it with ease."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I wanted to read the Japanese classic with some commentary, but mostly the Japanese classic. What I got with this book was \\"The Book of The Five Rings Greatest Hits\\" or \\"How to use Old Books to Make a Killing on Wall Street.\\" I'm very disappointed in the book and if you are looking for Asian classics, read the description very carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"mind developes the body","review":"This book help me practice and also teach my students. for the practicioner of the ARTS this book helps you develope your mind for everyday problems fighting or not.

Although I will be the first to admit that some sections are more obscure and difficult to process than others, all in all, this is a great book to have and read periodically, if not to improve oneself, then at least it is a great mental excercise just trying to ponder and garner the meanings behind the teachings of Musashi. A worthwhile read if you have the mental stamina for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"Interesting as a document from the Edo period, but dated and awkward as a book targeted in translation for modern Western businesspeople dealing in Japan. Fascinating as a straightforward historical first person account of the life and personal philosophy of a warrior from Shogunate Japan, but almost silly to the extent that it attempts to be more. The commentary is can be skipped entirely, as it attempts to read far to much into the text (not much of which feels relevant today); but it leaves the reader suspicious of the translation iteslf, which seems strained in several places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rings","review":"I still have not finished the book.

It is a guide in focused self-discipline. It is also a guide to successful navigation of conflict.This translation is the best I've read. It is free of superfluous footnotes and pedantic commentary.

I wore that camera out and replaced it with the same model with a greater zoom ratio.When I decided it was time to invest in a digital, there was no question of the brand, only the model. I chose the V50 (it had just been introduced) and I am still getting raves about my photos. Again, I am convinced it is the Schneider lens, but the camera is easy to use.

It sounds like Joan is singing karaoke...Idiot...The music is so cool that it gets 5 stars no question, but I would hope that eventually this gets a proper release.Till then this will have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic punk hybrid","review":"this was the first album i ever heard by these classy ladies of rock.from the first song,little sister,i was hooked.they were truly ahead of their time.if this album had been released 10 years later it would have sold double platinum.great hybrid of punk and metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed","review":"I read other reviews of this book and literally rushed over to the bookstore in anticipation.

No matter how much we visualize our own vision while reading, you cannot help but to wonder or figure out what the author was trying to do by putting these 2 people on the cover., it's totally misleading. Furthermore, the book was really boring, it was nothing exciting nor did anticipation make me want to read this book. I will credit the author for having such wonderful writing skills.

It presents God not as a task master, revengefull and ready to punish God but as a friend who prefers ill treatment and even death rather than your condemnation. One who die so that you may live.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide through the Sermon on the Mount","review":"I read an older edition of this book that was titled Christian counter culture, but I'm sure that the content is largely the same. John Stott shares his insights as he guides us through the Sermon on the Mount. He calls us to radical devotion to Christ and His principles outlined in this famous portion of Scripture. He gives good historical meanings of many of the words in Greek and unlocks his mainly orthodox interpretation of the passage. He also sites historical comments from Calvin, Tolstoy, and Bonhoeffer as well as others. Although this is not an exegetical commentary in the strictest sense, it is readable and quite insightful into Christ's words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contrast to Modern Ethics and Morals","review":"What are we called on to do to be Citizens of the Kingdom?

A friend and me bought one each and both units have the same problems.

I think it is a great device. The old unit and the new unit sitting side by side track room temperature within 1/2 degree.The radio controlled clock can be tempermental in some locations. I live in a condo with a lot of steel but I found that if I put the unit near a window for the first day and let the clock latch onto the time I can move the unit to where I want to set it and it will continue to keep accurate time. Mainly, it does this by searching at the right time of day when the signal is boosted by the Naval Observatory. (I have six radio controlled clocks and one watch that is radio controlled.)Battery life is very good. On the old outside unit I changed the batteries once a year (each summer).This would be a five star product if I could see the internal and external temperature and humidity without pressing a button."},{"rating":"1","title":"No atomic time, bad wireless reception","review":"[...], we were unable to ever get the ExactSet clock to work.

None of the stories ring true. None of the stories have that uncomfortable fumbling of first encounters, the nervousness of being caught. It reads like straight out porn. Fine. This \\"gets the job done\\" if you are looking for a literary Viagra but in no way are any of these stories any more than out and out fiction. Not a single word jumps off the page with any ounce of authenticity. They all seem plausible, but the manner in which they are written (and in some cases exagerated) made me feel completely manipulated. No one I know has ever had a first encounter with a \\"straight guy\\" that ever sounded like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Porn","review":"I bought this book thinking that it was going to be a collection of well written, thought provoking, true stories of encounters between gay and straight men. What a mistake! It is pure porn and, in my opinion, most of the stories are fantasies rather than reality. On top of that, the stories are poorly written. It took me 10 minutes to read this book because I've read it all before. Total junk and a total waste of money.

Well the atomic part worked -- after about 13mins the radio transmission worked -- but I could not get the backlight or snooze alarm to work at all. I returned it for full refund and bought the larger Atomic Clock. Just got back from a restful relaxing vacation where I did NOT have to mess with the travel clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly thought out design.","review":"Initially, I loved this clock. However, it's flaws soon became apparent. The snooze/backlight control is the stand which proved to be very fragile and broke within a couple of months. The buttons are difficult to manipulate and require steady pressure to activate the setting changes. With only a 90 day warranty, it's not worth the price paid because the buyer pays the price for inadequate design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"The third unit of this clock I've owned in the last five years died today.

I thought I \\"knew\\" what the term \\"prophecy\\" meant, especially since her book, The Path, has had such a positive influence on my life. But this book opened my mind to the true meaning - and the impact - of prophecy. Laurie Beth Jones has such a talent for combining wisdom, humor and personal stories in all her work, and this book is the best example of that so far! I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to parents of young children and to teachers. That said, get this book now and be prepared to stay up all night reading - that is what I did, and then spent the next morning going over it again. This book is a great companion to The Path (by Laurie Beth Jones), but certainly would be a perfect \\"1st choice\\" if you are a newcomer to her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It brings to Life the True meaning of Living your Destiny","review":"WOW! What an incredible book. If your looking to fullfill the destiny of your life, if your looking for what that destiny is, read this book.

Additionally, i think it to be of a poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mask for allergies!","review":"I only have two issues with this mask. First is the strong smell which was easily solved by taking out the filter and valves and washing the neoprene. Second is the fit. I must put the straps over my ears for a good seal. Wearing a hat keeps the straps from sliding down. Other than that, this is a good mask that looks cool while protecting your lungs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No chance to select Size.","review":"Although the product is a good product, You are not able to select size.

Both of these carry a Hepa-type filter which is used for the removal of sub-micron particulates.\\"I did go ahead and purchase the mask (medium) and I am a petite person. Unfortunately, I found that the mask did NOT filter out the cigarette smells. I am typically walking down the streets in NYC where people are smoking outside. Not once did this work. That is the main reason why I purchased this mask. So, if you are looking for a mask to filter out cig. smoke, I would not recommend the Respro Sportspa for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"check your size","review":"like several other reviews here, i'm pointing out two things: a) this seller does not give you the option to select size and b) they have a no return policy on masks. the reason i bought this mask is because i have heard great first hand reviews from those who have used it. my rating is based on the seller, not the item itself.would suggest buying your mask from respro themselves, as they will ship anywhere and have the best selection of sizes and styles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size matters!","review":"This isn't a bad product, but my experience with this reseller was the reverse of one of the other reviewers: I assumed I would receive a larger size and instead received a medium-small.

I own this one, the Sportsta, and the only issue I had with it is that its \\"large\\" size is too small for men with larger than average sized heads (i.e., if \\"one size fits all\\" hats don't fit you, this mask probably won't, either). I wound up buying the one Respro mask that comes in an XL size: their model FB-1, available on the Respro site. It fits me (size 7 3/4\\" head, lower face to match) pretty well, and it does a good job. It's also the only mask I can wear that doesn't interfere with the positioning of my glasses. Though like any neoprene mask, it quickly gets uncomfortable during vigourous exercise or in hot weather.On the other hand, those of you whose heads are NOT the size of basketballs will find that this model, the Sportsta, or any of the other Respro masks will do an excellent job for you.-- Ed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've found","review":"I use this mask for fighting allergies while riding a motorcycle.

And there are some other buried nuggets here, like the Electricity jam and a Sugar Mama that is reminiscent of Trout Mask's China Pig.But the sound, which is from audience recordings, is dreadful. The last 6 tracks from Liverpool are from a soundboard tape, but they have already been released as Merseytrout Live 1980 - why repeat them here? Surely whomever made the audience tape of the several shows represented here had more than two or three songs from each show? You don't get much for your money here.

It worked, if only for the short term. The single \\"Ordinary World\\" is a compelling ballad about the willingness to move on from a broken relationship, while the catchy \\"Come Undone\\" works as a mid-tempo dance number. \\"Too Much Information\\" is a scathing commentary on selling your soul to fame, while \\"None of the Above\\" is a funky number that vaguely recalls Chic. Yes, there are clunkers: \\"UHF\\" and the dubious cover of \\"Femme Fatale.\\" But these are small gripes. \\"Duran Duran\\" was ample proof to the masses that they weren't just an 1980s band and featured some of the group's strongest material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great One","review":"The Wedding Album is superb! It moves more toward '90's grooves and synthesizers while maintaining the Duran Duran style. The best and most listenable tracks are \\"Too Much Info\\", \\"None of the Above\\", \\"Come Undone\\", the best song and most inspiring song \\"Ordinary World\\", and \\"UMF\\" takes you in with it's funky beats.

All the tracks are strong with some of Simon LeBon's least ridiculous lyrics [always a weakness for the band]. Whoever said they should do a duet with Milton Nascimiento [\\"Breath After Breath\\"] is a genius! This is one of their most beautiful tracks ever and normally I hate it when artists I like go \\"World Music,\\" but more songs like this I'd gladly pay for! One of their best albums. Diverse and accomplished, this one plays to their strengths. Namely their strong sense of melody and arrangement. Simon LeBon is singing better here with age and experience under his belt, and again, his lyrics are a far cry from the howlers that he usually delivers. Just compare these songs to -shudder- \\"Venice Drowning\\" from their previous (awful) album, \\"Liberty.\\" It's hard to believe these lyrics were from the same pen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Time Duranie","review":"I've been a fan of Duran Duran since the early 80's.

But \\"Drowning Man\\" and \\"Shotgun\\" do ruin the flow of this album. But I'd like to add that \\"Drowning Man\\" does hurt my feelings. After all I am a U.S. citizen and I do love my country and feel that this is the best country in the world. Duran has a handful of songs putting down this country, such as \\"Edge of America.\\" I understand that most Europeans don't like th U.S., but does Duran need to insult my love of country?

I don't know what I was expecting when I bought this album, other than a document of an earlier day, but I was quickly put in my place. The Flonzaley are not merely one of the first string quartets to make a living playing music, they are amazing technicians and their artistry is impressive. These are notable performances. While the sound is not stellar, it is surprisingly decent and I have relished listening to these pieces as they flashed by, played with enthusiasm, passion and dash.

The rivers are the Yampa and the San Juan in Colorado and Utah and the rafting details are accurate. The trajectory of the romance feels accurate too, with the sense of regret and relief that it is over. The detail in these stories is wonderful, and the humor is warm and subtle. If this story were a movie it would be a chick-flick, but I liked it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"Even if you are an art illiterate you will understand the art and the artists reviewed in this series.

I loved learning about Caravaggio and Bernini and yes, their private lives were shared but not overtly so. Not so with Van Gogh and Picasso. The focus of the art is lost with the jarring vocabulary (yes, the f-word is used at least three times), and the continuous dialogue about the sex lives of these artists. Information I did not need to know to appreciate their art. THIS VIDEO SHOULD BE LABELED EXPLICIT. Everything else is labeled so we are warned, why not this? Because it is art? Call me old fashioned, some things are just better left unsaid. Look for a cleaned up version. Public television did not air Van Gogh (I wonder why).

Mounting the charger on the wall was easy and the unit sets in the charger with no difficulty.

Being a bit of a cynic the first few times it rained, I kept my manual graduated stick in the ground rain gauge out as well, and the measurement of each was so close I can only assume I misread the manual type by .o1 inches. The automatic emptying is a great feature and it appears to measue in .01 inch increments, which is close enough for anyone.The only drawback is a somewhat stuborn 'reset switch' which is described incorrectly in the manual. Telephone suppport was timely and helpful when I called about this, and have had no problems since. I would recommend highly for those of us with this penchant or any one who has a need for an accurate reading of rain fall.

Not thinking about the manual issues, a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unreliable","review":"I have had this unit for 2 years. It works pretty good until it rains hard. The inside unit will lose the signal from the outside unit. It will not be able to pick it up again until a day or so after the rain stops, no matter how many times I tell the indoor unit to search for the outdoor unit. I guess that in heavy rain, the insides get wet (circuit board is exposed to the inside of the unit, and there is water in there!) and the unit does not transmit reliably. After it dries out inside, it goes back to working. Comments about hard to install batteries and terrible manual are accurate as well.So, if you can use a rain gauge that measures light rains well, this is it. But for the occasional thunderstorm? You just have to be satisfied knowing that it is raining, you won't know how much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely, there's something better than this","review":"I've had this installed for a little over 2 years. It's a poorly conceived unit. Interested in measuring the rainfall over a year? Good luck as when you have to replace the batteries in the indoor unit, the rain gauge resets. If you have to replace the batteries in the outdoor unit, eventually you'll find the info on pressing the reset button on both units in order for them to communicate again. When you do that - guess what? The rain gauge resets! You'll get a lot more accurate reading, and your measuring equipment will last much longer if you forget this device and buy a nice clear plastic rain gauge and place it where you can see it from indoors. Write down the rainfall every now and then, and in the end you'll be much better off. And - you won't have to replace any batteries. Or, maybe the competition has a unit that works better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product - accurate rain gauge","review":"I purchased this product a couple of months ago and have been very happy with it.Pros:-Rain gauge is accurate (I confirmed it's accuracy by comparing it's totals with other manual gauges - they were all within 5% for each of the three storms that I checked).-Easy to set up.Cons:-Changing the batteries in the rain gauge is alot of work (make sure that you don't loose the very small screws).-Barometer displayed weather prediction is not very useful.If you want an inexpesive wireless rain gauge, this is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"instructions???","review":"Oh wow...I consider myself very savvy with electronic items but the instructions that come with this item leave me wondering, uh, now what?

I could not get it to work and finally after reading the reviews here, I got it to work...but not at first. It took several reset sequences. I'm not looking forward to changing the batteries and going through it all over again. Once up and running, I really like this product. I've had many chances to see it operate since it has rained just about every day since I installed it. It indeed is inaccurate compared to a low-tech-but-accurate rain gauge. It consistently reads low. So, I'm now in the process of moving the factory preset calibration screws inside until it reads close to the manual gauge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work.","review":"After several hours of trying, I couldn't get the two units to communicate.After I removed the strip from the batteries, the display unit came alive and began giving a temperature reading and the rainfall display began flashing.

Reset both units sevaral more times (bucket first, then the other way) and set all the display unit stuff but no joy. VOM says the batteries are good but put fresh alkalines into the rain bucket anyway, reset both units again, tipped the bucket back and forth, waited, reset both again, etc., etc. Still flashing.This was all with both units two feet apart on the dining room table but I even tried them in another room in case something was interfering with the RF link between them.

And those moments are few and far between on this disc. But we all knew we were getting Son of Believe anyway. This one is a lot better. Cher is singing in a higher range these days (she said recently she actually went back to the studio to rerecord some of these tunes, because she was singing at too low a pitch). The result: her voice has never been better. And the material is pretty good, certainly better than the Believe tracks; still, the potential for club remixes is almost endless.It's hard to create a dance track with some heart, but Cher does it on Alive Again, Song for the Lonely, Different Kind of Love Song.

Great dance music, I thought \\"Believe\\" was awesome but this one is far more superior. Tracks such as \\"A Different kind of Love song\\", \\"Real Love\\" and \\"When the Money's Gone\\" is so infectious and makes u want to dance. Cher even tries to interpret a little R&b/Pop with \\"Rain, Rain\\". Very nice track and vocal arrangements are good too. The only problem I have with this cd is the recurring \\"L\\" word in every song and some of the lyrics are a little elementary. But Cher's voice, the beats, and the more grown-up lyrics (like on \\"When You Walk Away\\") sways me to give this album a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen of Pop","review":"I have to admit I am still listening to the British version of Cher's grossly underrated \\"It's A Man's World,\\" while \\"Believe\\" despite its stick-in-your-brain ear-candy smash single was, to this listener, a fairly generic forgettable album and a vast letdown. \\"Living Proof\\" is a far more cohesive CD than its predecessor. Though I'm still not partial to its Euro-techno thump-thump production, most of these songs are undeniable pop perfection -- and in the case of \\"Song for the Lonely\\" and \\"Rain Rain\\" there's even emotional depth. This album certainly will be a smash, and single after single will blare from the radio and shops and car windows for the rest of the year. If not exactly a testament to the great pop singer Cher has become, and the range of material she can pull off, it is still a record that hits the bullseye on the pop culture meter. Let the guilty pleasures begin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Production!!","review":"You know it's a rare production when you can buy a cd, put it in the player, and listen to EVERY song again and again. Cher's new cd, Living Proof, has to be one of the best cd's ever produced. It has enough power to blow Believe right out of the water. Every song has a dance beat that will leave you craving more. Cher has an amazing voice that is stronger than ever before. This isn't another teen pop album, this is the real diva...I mean deal! Living Proof has a futuristic sound that can't be missed.

Other note-worthy's include the hot \\"Body To Body\\", the 70's feel of \\"Love Is A Lonely Place\\", the anthemic \\"Alive Again,\\" a great cover of Amber's \\"Love One Another\\", and \\"Song For The Lonely.\\"Acutally, the only cut that sounds like it should've been on \\"Believe\\" is \\"You Take It All. Simply put - she's back and she rocks. If you don't own anything else from Cher, this is it!Cherglamour"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice comeback!","review":"Cher has returned to the music industy at her early fifties with this dance album. The first single off LIVING PROOF, \\"Song for the Lonely,\\" attempts to pick up where her mega-hit \\"Believe\\" left off, as a simultaneously anthemic and danceable pop confection with an emotional, reach-out message, which we can truly see in the video of that song. Similarly, \\"A Different Kind of Love Song\\" makes use of the quirky vocal effects that made \\"Believe\\" so popular. But amid all the dance material, there's the sorrowful R&B balladry of \\"Rain, Rain\\" and the Latin pop flavor of \\"Body to Body, Heart to Heart\\" ensuring that LIVING PROOF never becomes monochromatic. But we can say this is a dance album, though... with some other great songs: \\"Music's no good without you\\", \\"Alive Again\\", etc...I would say this album is even better than believe, though it didn't had as much success as it.

Her outfit was simply horrifying! What in the name of Prada was she wearing? The only place I know of where you can buy something like that is at The Cat of Nine Tails in San Francisco (or so I've heard). But even more terrifying was the music. Egad! \\"Believe\\" was a nice return to form, but I was seriously hoping to hear a modern \\"Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves\\". Instead we find another vapid skunk pile that reminds me more of my cousin Yekyl's bah mitzvah karaoke competition. Cher's music needs a facelift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Cher's best work to date","review":"If you even remotely enjoyed Cher's last major U.S. studio album \\"Believe,\\" then you will love her latest cd \\"Living Proof.\\" The cd is full of feel good dance anthems that are sure to hit a club near you in the not-so-distant future.The best songs on the cd are probably \\"The Music's No Good Without You,\\" \\"Rain, Rain,\\" and \\"Song for the Lonely.\\" As always, Cher is back again with that sentimental defiance we all adore her for.

This is truly evidence that rather than letting her more mature years slow her down, she continues developing. Purists can say all they jolly well want about her voice quality deteriorating, but it just isn't so. She's working with it and singing songs that reflect much of her perennial dramatic past, but mellower and upbeat.No, there's no song titled \\"Living Proof\\" here. But that title is a reference to the most outstanding song on the CD, \\"A Different Kind Of Love Song\\".As a follow-up to \\"Believe\\", Cher is establishing herself as one of the musical legends with a lengthy career which keeps going. Hopefully, more is on the way...."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy a different book","review":"the book is outdated and some trailheads don't exist anymore. you spend more time looking for trail heads on some of the trails that the authors seemed to have invented themselves.

Enormous photographs of Anna Kournikova hiking up the panties up her tennis outfit and a Brazilian female beach volleyball player bent forward with her butt pointing at the camera contribute a different sense of unwholesomeness to the proceedings.I suppose younger readers would like all of the above; perhaps Guinness is aiming this book at them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a little graphic","review":"This book was O.K.

And it really was, with the awesome coral formations and various undersea creatures, and of course the floating sharks. And it lights up, which makes it even cooler. BUT, when we put water in it, it leaked all over the counter. So, with heavy heart, I packed it up and sent it back. I didn't dare to order a replacement tank, thinking it might do the same thing. Instead, we went to the pet store, and spent many more dollars for a 10 gallon tank, light, filter, heater, coral reef decorations, SCUBA diver, plastic plants, gravel. . . . Oh, and of course, the fish, still a work in progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fish Killer Under Any Brand Name","review":"Shark Reef, Uncle Milton, or Discovery Kids, it appears to be the same tank with the same deadly outcome for the fish. We followed the setup directions and within 48 hours had two near-dead goldfish. Moved them to a small glass bowl, where they quickly recovered. Flushed and cleaned the shark tank, ran it without fish for a while, changed the water a few times in hopes that it would rinse away any contaminants. Returned the goldfish to the shark tank, and they were again near death overnight. Water tests good for ammonia, pH, etc., would like to know what exactly is killing so many fish in these tanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool idea but many difficulties!","review":"We purchased this for my son last Christmas to upgrade from his simple one gallon Beta tank which we had great success with. It's a cool idea, but we've been disappointed with it and will likely replace it before too long.The problems we've had:*Batteries are difficult to change and seem to run down quickly even though we try not to leave the lights on much.*Even with fresh batteries, the lights are not very bright.*The air bubblers have fouled over quickly*The sharks no longer float although they've been thoroughly scrubbed to make sure they have no growth on them.*And last but not least, we cannot keep fish alive. We have two large tanks in the house as well as two other beta tanks. We are familiar with fish. We've tried Bettas, molly's, and guppies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kills Fish","review":"There's another listing for this product with 9 reviews, all saying the aquarium kills fish, and yes it does. We conditioned the water and tested for chlorine, ph, alkalinity, hardness, nitrate and nitrite, all tests were fine. Within a few hours the fish were swimming upside down, after a day they were lying on their sides gasping at the bottom of the tank. I read the Amazon reviews in the nick of time and scooped them out and they're recovering nicely in a $2 bowl. We rinsed out the tank quite well before using it, so there may be some machine oil or something that leaches from the numerous and varied plastic parts. If you care about fish and you care about your children's reactions, do not buy this tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"This screw was perfect for the task - free shipping","review":"I needed something like 92 cents to get over $25 and get free shipping.

Just plug and play...literally. Also very durable. It will take a beating through crashes and dusty conditions and keep functioning without any glitches. Be careful not to expose it to moisture though. It's not water proof.Overall, this is a great speed controller. Just be sure to have it hooked up to a good battery (eg.

The delicate tech-breaks of \\"Find Yourself\\" seem to indicate a new direction, but track by track, we get deeper and harder. The Detroitian \\"Now You're Mine\\" lead to the tech-house thump of \\"Club X.\\" \\"Time to Jack\\" and \\"Casiotone\\" get back into breaks, but when we reach \\"Afterplan,\\" we're back into pure techno. The more things change... \\"On a Day\\" is dark and deep, and the title track itself just storms onto the stage, unrelenting. And \\"Inbox,\\" the final track, crashes down like a wicked strike of thunder. From sweet to pounding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charles Dickens Audio CD Review","review":"This CD was terrible.

Openoffice opens PowerPoint files, does lots of slide type features, and unless you need to do really spectacular effects, you should be fine with the FREE OpenOffice suite.You can try StarOffice too; it costs a little more than free but way less than PowerPoint.OpenOffice has some pretty cool three D drawing effects included, plus all the standard slide effects and object effects for sucking in bullet points from the side, etc. You can print handouts, notes, all that stuff.Try OpenOffice.org before you spend your car payment on PowerPoint!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but StarOffice Impress is as good or better","review":"I've been using Ppt for a while but not anymore.

This book is just not very good. The matte pages are an unnecessary affectation and they tend to make the photos look like old postcards. The author drops names of boats and celebrities, but some of the pictures are blurred or show their subjects from the back. Surely these folks didn't pose for these obviously quick fan snaps. Not the quality one would hope for from a professional photographer. Oh, by the way, the romance of this book also escapes me. Please think twice before spending so much money on such a slapdash enterprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL DONE!!","review":"I am a resident of Martha's Vineyard and I find Nancy Ellison's book the best photography book ever done on the island.

It is a book no lover of the Vineyard can be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragile State - Voices From The Dust Bowl","review":"I loved Fragile State's debut, _The Facts and the Dreams_, so much that I was afraid their follow up, _Voices of the Dust Bowl_, might suffer from raised expectations. Well, yes and no. The mellow dreaminess is still wholly evident from the first track, \\"Four-Four-Four,\\" but what weakens this album in comparison to the first one is a touch of self-indulgence. \\"Four-Four-Four,\\" for example, would have been perfect at half its length. That's not to say, of course, that I dislike the album. It has a good number of excellent tracks, like the descending jazz of \\"600 Bliss\\" or the ambience of \\"Paper Smile.\\" Fragile State excels, in addition, at integrating curlicues of world music without seeming patronizing: the mysterious vocals and didgeridoo in the melancholy \\"Cleo\\" add to the atmosphere; the recycled vocal of \\"Overcurrent\\" blends into the jazzy breaks. A completely enjoyable experience, despite my own expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the new edition","review":"The photo is of the older edition.

To manage to create a complete story which packs a punch with limited word count is a wondrous task- and everyone in this collection is a knock out.King at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"King's best book","review":"Ive been reading alot of King lately and I must say this book packs the most for your dollar. I like King writing shorter storys rather then a whole novel dedicated to one subject, I guess you can say I have ADD. The only problem I had was the first story sucked and so did the last one, but the rest of the book is on par with some of the best horror writing of all time. I highly recommend this book for a good scare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruthless!","review":"Night Shift is a prime example of Stephen King really pushing the limits. Many gruesome stories, many gut wrenching events, and all in all many scares and thrills! Most of the stories in here are good, some are REALLY good, and a few are weak-ish. For this review i will list my three favorite and least favorite stories.My favs-One for the Road, The Ledge, Sometimes They Come Back, I Know What you Need...oops...that's four....sorry :)My least faves-The Woman in the Room(which wasn't as deep as it intended to be in my opnion), Battleground(which was just silly), and Night Surf(which was just too short to be good for me)Overall, this was a really good collection, and is just inches below Nightmares and Dreamscapes, which is the only other short story collection that i've read from King, thus far of course. Definitley worth the read for King/horror fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birth of an Obsession","review":"Some twenty years ago I received my introduction to Stephen King through this collection of short stories, Night Shift. King brought a variety of topics to bear, ranging from objects with minds and agendas of their own (Trucks, The Mangler and Battleground) to a twisted program for smoking cessation (Quitters, Inc.). Stephen King gets it. There is horror in the mundane, the usual, the everyday and King knows how to draw it out. Night Shift is both a terrific entry work for those who have never experienced King's writing as well as a continually solid read for those who have enjoyed his full offering. This is a fabulous book that set me on a path of pleasure; twenty years of King's storytelling later and I can still smile and remember the first time he made me shiver. Years from now he may finally get the credit he deserves as one of this generation's most engaging novelists. Until then he'll have to be content with rabid, loyal fans and huge commercial success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"For the sake of continuity I'm putting something like this at the beginning of all these reviews. I've taken it upon myself to read the entire King library in chronological order.This collection was fantastic. I can honestly see why a lot of people long for King's 'classic style'. Personally, I'm a huge fan of monsters. Specifically, non-cliched monsters, or cliched monsters that are being examined in a new life. This book was filled with monsters of all kinds and was extremely satisfying.The stories ranged from absurd to awesome to frightening to downright grim. The grim ones weren't horror of fantastic sort but more of a real-life sort, almost serving as a prelude to what would eventually come along in Full Dark, No Stars.A definite read for anyone considering King for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I like Stephen King and I like short stories. These are older stories. Some have been adapted to film.

I suggest first time readers read some of these stories and you can decide if King is a good writer for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK ONE OF KING'S BEST.","review":"I'm not yet done with the book but most of what I'v read is good (with a few exceptions like Night Surf and The Man Who Loved Flowers) my favorites where The Boogieman (A man is haunted by a monster from the closet, had me scared for days) and Battleground (a box of army men comes alive and gets revenge)and other great story's like Gray Matter Jeruasalem's Lot and The Mangler. A must read if you like King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Horror","review":"This is one of my favorite SK books. Not every story is good: watch out for Jerusalem's Lot it is an homage to Lovecraft and gothic novels but is just dull and boring, also look out for Night Surf, it lacks definition and is a waste of time, but other than these scant two tales the book seriously is a great read! The best stories in it are \\"I Am the Doorway\\" \\"The Boogeyman\\" \\"The Mangler\\" \\"Strawberry Spring\\" and \\"one for the road\\". I read this book a few years ago, but these stories stick in my mind, and I reread them frequently. They are really original and scary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Short Story Book","review":"If I'm not mistaken, this is the book that put Stephen King on the map.

Some great horror stories that only Stephen King is capable of writing, while also including a few non-horror stories. Also enjoyed how he went back to 'Salem's Lot a couple of times. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kindle Rocks!","review":"I love it! I wish I had used the audio download but hey I got what I wanted. I have in book form but the Kindle makes it easy to carry. I'll always love hard back and paperback books but the Kindle will keep my love of read going. One thing, I never take it out the house. There are too many lazy people in the world that will take it from me instead of building up their credit rating and getting a credit card. I am one pleased person!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"This is one of my favorite--the favorite--collection of Stephen King. I read it a long time ago and it doesn't hold up as well now thirty years later, but still, a good read if you are a Stephen King fan. Better than his other collections, for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Great Early Works","review":"Many Great stories, some bad ones. These are Stephen King's early works. Jerusalems Lot is one of his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mix from the '70s","review":"This is an interesting mix of stories, since they date from the early '70s. There are a couple of real stinkers; stories that are just plain bad and make you wonder how they ever got published. But there are even more really good stories, and a couple that are just excellent. You'll also see the seeds for a couple of his later novels in here, too. I completely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent collection of short stories","review":"To start things off, I was really pleased with this particular book. I don't usually like to read a book of short stories, probably because there isn't nearly enough detail. As a matter of fact, one of the only reasons I actually picked it up is because of the stories that were listed...Children of the Corn, Graveyard Shift, and Sometimes They Come Back might sound a bit familiar (i.e.-movies that have been made). Nevetheless, I wholly approved of The Night Shift, and I recommend it to anyone that likes to read King's works. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogged Down","review":"I couldn't get into the story as most of the sentences were gussied up with fancy prepositions and the gratuitous use of \\"Jimmy Choos.\\" With 380 pages to go, I wrote my $$$ as a loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Cho Review","review":"Margaret Cho was absolutely fantastic this is a great CD that was never released on video so this is your only place to enjoy some of the best comedy genius this woman has to offer the world!!

Buy 'The Complete Bob Marley & the Wailers 1967-1972', parts 2 and 3 (from JAD Records) or Bob Marley & The Wailers albums from Trojan Records instead, if you want to have the songs on this album. JAD's and Trojan's releases are legal, and the sound quality is often much better on their albums.

The songs \\"Have You Never Been Mellow\\", \\"Deeper Than A River\\", and \\"Twist of Fate\\" are the best on this CD, however, there is not a single track that is bad. They are all really, really good. Olivia Newton-john is my favorite singer. I highly reccomend this CD to any others who like her music as much as I do.

Whilst sceptical of capitalism and government by inclination, the degree to which capitalism has been accepted as truth in my generation meant any arguments I entered inevitably ended with me being shouted down with cries of \\"where's your facts?\\" Here are the facts. On East Timor, on Burma, Australia and Liverpool, Pilger is brilliant. He is, if anything, better than Chomsky, more rigourous, less inclined to resort to rhetorical polemic, more disposed to back up his arguments with hard facts.

Long story short, I obliterated these gloves after just a couple weeks. The stitching is all ripped up, the thumb is about to come off of the left glove, and the stuffing is coming out. Plus, they have a terrible synthetic smell that I get to enjoy every time I get in my car.Basically, no one should by these gloves. Everlast should do a better job and not make junk like this.

After a little over a month, they were busted. The outer layer is a cheap material; just a flimsy paper thin plastic (vinyl?) cover. It burst open and exposed the cheap foam inside after standard use. The product really feels like a toy. The Title gloves are only a few bucks more and feels really sturdy. I purchased those after this Neverlast crapped out on me. Don't waste your money on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"These gloves offer no protection.

Also the gloves were a really tight fit for a 16 oz gloves, I ended up re-purchasing from Amazon and got the Protex2 Training Gloves for $18 more but they fit much better.

Wrist straps are simple and hold well. Breathe surprisingly well for the design.Cons: Even with hand wraps on, I found my right glove to fit too poorly to absorb punches well; the design makes it hard to form a proper fist without trying to grip the glove into a proper position to do so. The left I have no problem with for some reason, maybe just have a bad pair? The padding makes blows glance off of the bag to a degree that it made me feel like I was risking injury when using them for actual impact punches. Grips make my hands feel too open when punching, can't grip a tight fist... my hands would be bruised or very sore after even a modest workout with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gloves...do the job..but they're toxic smelly","review":"I bought these gloves to hit the heavy bag and practice my Krav Maga when I'm not using my Harbinger MMA style gloves. I can't speak to the durability of these gloves because I've had them a week and only used them once but they seem decent. They do the job with protection and the mesh ventiliation allows for some cooling (if that's possible with wraps). I would recommend these gloves. I like the velcro because I can use my teeth to get the second glove on. As others have mentioned, the only downside is the smell. Holy smokes they smell like they were forged by mutants in a radioactive toxic waste dump and have the ability to easily stink up a small non-ventilated space, even when not in use. I'm hoping that fades over time and my better smelling BO takes over. Put these gloves on, wear your three wolf shirt to the gym, and don't be surprised when the ladies start throwing their phone numbers at you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than 4 weeks and the lining is torn","review":"The inside of the right glove began to shred within a matter of weeks.

They are ventilated in the palm which of course offers obvious benefits.There is a thread holding the thumb to the glove for proper thumb position.Side note - if you've never boxed and curious about the sport, it is the best workout i've had since HS football.

Unfortunately, the motherboard I bought (MSI) had the SATA ports coming off of the side instead of straight up, and they ended up being oriented directly toward the hard drive bay. To remedy the situation, I had to cut a slot in the HD bay enclosure to allow clearance for the SATA cables, rendering one of the HD slots useless. I called Ultra's customer service to alert them of the issue, and it was a complete waste of my time.

I could command my teammate almost as easily as I could control myself. Zooming in and out was easy. Aiming was easy. Weapon selection was easy. But here is the problem. The game is easy. The single player game hardley ramps up with any difficulty. Even when you drastically change the dificulty level. The graphics could possibly even be called poor. Finally, there is no major creativity here. Over and over again you do a very similar thing. Go in and take out the bad guys, or go in and save a good guy. Though this is fun, creativity is appreciated. All of that said. This game does have online multiplayer in a big way, and yes it does support voice chat and microphone headset use. Incredible that a PSP game can do this.Bottom Line: Great game with minor drawbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"Socom Fireteam Bravo is an good game for the PSP. not as good as Socom 2 or 3, but its the only one i like.

Pretty much the same sound as Socom 3Controls 4/5 This is the lowpoint for this game. Since there is less buttons on the PSP it is harder to control your character.

This is a great buy to add to your PSP collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, boring.","review":"SOCOM Fireteam Bravo was the first game I got for my PSP. I figured it would be a great FPS game to get my hands dirty. The action was semi interesting, but the firefights I did get into seemed short and uninteresting. I almost always won a gunfight, even on admiral, unless an enemy appeared behind me randomly. None of the missions ever really sparked my interest, and I beat all of the story missions in two days. The additional Instant Action missions seemed thrown together and a waste of time. Guns seemed unrealistic, and they all basically did the same thing. I used little tactics beyond run in and kill all the enemies, or snipe them from a distance. Team commands were sometimes difficult to issue, and Lonestar would not always follow my commands well. I was uninterested in the story and action, and that is why I have rated this game poorly. The game simply does not compare to Siphon Filter- Dark Mirror, which is an excellent FPS. I would suggest Siphon Filter over SOCOM any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Socom you'll hate this.","review":"I got this for Christmas and have played it a few times. The concept is totally different than the previous games. If you loved the traditional SOCOM games you will ot like this one. In this game all you do is give the team instructions, that's it.

I will be giving it away or putting it on ebay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I like to play the PSP when I am stuck at airports and flying on planes.

She is already starting to use the potty on occasion and has given all signs that she is ready for the next step. I felt that the characters in this DVD were annoying and hard to relate to, and I think she agreed! On top of that, the songs are very amateur and annoying. My daughter usually jumps up and starts acting silly and dancing with any kind of music, and with this she looked at me like \\"what is this?\\" Ha!The DVD itself was poorly formatted and hard to use, like kept taking us back to the menu after each segment. It felt like a first draft for what might one day be something you could market and sell. Oh- and I did buy a new DVD, wasn't used or anything.I am glad that this video has been helpful for some moms & tots, but I must be the devil's advocate and reveal that I did not have such a positive experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I have a 22 month old. This video is useless. They discuss where ducks and lambs go potty, then they spend 5 minutes talking about Page and Parker Panda picking out their favorate pair of underwear so they can march in the big kid parade. I think children learn from watching other children using the potty and this is all about cartoon animals. Then they have the panda testing the kids and he's asking \\"is this a potty chair? No its a wagon! Is this a potty chair? No its a beach pale!\\" I mean,can this be any more ridiculous? and the voice is so condescending, which would be ok if they actually taught children something. Don't waste your money. I have heard that Potty Power shows real children and I am going to try that video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase- REALLY bad decision on my part.....","review":"I am so mad at myself for buying this dvd. It is pretty much pointless.... there's almost no showing of potty use! There are kids swinging on swings, babies in cribs, a COUPLE of short scenes of cartoons using the potty, but that's it. The songs are ok for little ones, but that's not why I bought it. I bought it in the hopes that it would help me (even a little) in the potty-training process, and it definitely didn't do that. Toddlers need more imagery I think- how are they supposed to understand about using the potty if you're singing about it, but showing images of kids playing on a playground? What does that have anything to do with toilet training, I ask you? ARRGG! Very frustrating. Oh well, lesson learned, I guess. I hope you the reader will benefit from my misfortunte and think twice before buying this flick for your little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst PT tool out there.","review":"This DVD is a fiasco. Crappy animation and annoying songs...I can put up with. But this product has terrible educational content.PT is about teaching a child a few key concepts: 1) listen to your body (and basic bathroom anatomy), 2) when you get \\"the feeling\\", use the potty, 3) basic hygiene (wipe, flush and wash hands), 4) accidents are ok, 5) you are a good kid and we are proud of you...no matter what. This dvd has animals and vague references to potty use, but no clear organized focus on the potty themes and way too obtuse for a toddler! Plus, the derogatory and mean-spirited theme song about diapers being for babies is NOT helpful...confusing for the beginning of potty training, when the kid is still in diapers and not really ready for underwear, and also for the reluctant trainee, who is conflicted about giving up babyhood.Basically, this seems to have been designed by someone who has never potty trained a kid. A complete mess. Buy Elmo's Potty Time instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Husband was right","review":"When we were in the store and I picked this up my husband said \\"Really, a potty dvd, we don't need that.\\" I should have listen to him at least for choosing this one!

I honestly feel that it is disorganized and simply Purdy writing whatever came into his head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purdy Does it Again","review":"I picked this book up in Borders and sat with it for about an hour. It is worse than For Common Things, which was Purdy's over-hyped first work. Purdy quotes from Thoreau, he quotes from Burke, and he quotes some Egyptian girls he ran into in Egypt, yet he never contributes anything himself which is quotable. He'd like to be Jefferson, or de Tocqueville, but he is a victim of the liberal elite's contemporary educational system which razes men of passion and cannonizes indifferent men of quiet desperation. What does Purdy think? Everything and nothing. He is the grand eyeball. He stands squarely in the postmodern gray, telling us that Admam Smith was right and wrong, that capitalism is good and bad, that it is the best of times and the worst of times. How true it is, and how vastly intelligent he must be, to be so far above and indifferent to the deaths of 3,000 Americans on American soil."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bells.","review":"They just rattle a little.

She loves to do them but they are very hard to find in the stores. We have bought the Little People books several times and they are very colorful. Since she had already done 3 of those books we wanted something different and bought the Blue's Clues paint with water book when we saw it. I was very disappointed because the colors were very bland and gray. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"I bought this paint with water book because they are so hard to come by in my area. I had a few others (Care Bears) that were wonderful. This one is simply terrible. The colors disappear as soon as the water hits the paper.

When I recieved them I was disappointed but showed them to her anyways so I could see if they passed her inspection. She pretty much said what I said. Yes she occasionly likes to wair dainty earings but we both found these to look to close to costume jewlery. Also the thickness of the silver wasn't just dainty but plain thin and had an apperance of being stamped to a very thin gauge. I'm not a jewlery expert but we agreed that the \\"crystal\\" looked more like a plastic bead. We would have returned them but were lazy and decided to give them to a friends 3yr old daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this Carly Smithson from American Idol!?!?!","review":"Different last name might be because she married?

Not like my favorites Against the Wind and Stranger in Town; but it is a very good showing nonetheless. The hooks in songs like It's a Mystery, Rites of Passage, and especially Manhattan are very catchy. Lock and Load, in my opinion the best tune on the album and it rocks. On the slower side, By the River, and West of the Moon are enjoyable. Now, if I had Against the Wind, The Distance, Stranger in Town and Night Moves this is the album to choose next (outside of his real early Seger System albums-a particular sound I do not care for as much)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Righteous Rocker Plows On Through The 90s In Style","review":"With IT'S A MYSTERY, Bob Seger continues the good fight for traditional rock & roll values in the face of musical trends (grunge, punk, etc.) coming and going. On \\"Lock And Load\\", Seger speaks of the need to make amends for past shortcomings, a theme present on many episodes of TV's THE GHOST WHISPERER. Other songs take aim at the darker side of human nature, including \\"Manhattan\\", which is about a drug deal (or some other kind of pact) gone severely wrong; the lyrics of that song have inspired me to hang up pictures of pretty celebrities on my wall as a deterrent to getting myself into a bad situation that I might be unable to get out of later. Seger's support of sanctions on Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up May 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Bob but....","review":"the aptly titled \\"It's a mystery\\", suffers from many problems, but lack of decent material tops the list. His voice is fantastic though, and you want him to deliver. unfortunately, he doesn't, and your left with an album that runs out of gas before it ever starts going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"I heard Seger san music when watching a movie on TV in Tokyo. I'm so impressed that the next day I purchased first Seger CD I saw : \\"It's a Mystery\\". Unfortunately CD should be called : \\"It's Damn Dissapointing\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I do not understand the negative reviews. Personally, I have never really liked typical 80's music, but I never really thought that Bob Seeger fit into that stereotype--the make-up, the tight plastic pants, the weird \\"do.\\" His music reminded me of many different things I listened to when I was young in the 60's, and I like this CD. And I do not regret owning it.Some of the reviews speak about earlier CD's like they represent Bob's \\"Golden Age,\\" but I do not see it. A few of the older CD's--in my opinion--do not hold up as well as this one, although I enjoy listening to them as well.Again, in my opinion it is sad that the recording is no longer available.It is well worth a listen if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Disappointed","review":"I thought I had missed the opportunity to see Seger in concert - then came the \\"Mystery\\" tour. Great show! Classic Seger! Bought the CD on the way in and listened to it on the way home. Then one or two more times in the years since, skipping around looking for another song as good as Lock & Load. This CD is very \\"unfinished\\". It seems as though he had a bunch of ideas for songs that were simply made into full-length songs by use of repetition. As a die-hard Seger fan it pains me to be so honest, but no one's going to fight over this CD in divorce court!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Collectables Version","review":"Once again Collectables have messed up another re-issue.

For Christ's sake, eh? Do Jews shy away from saying that Jesus was not the Messiah, or Muslims from claiming that Jesus was (but) a prophet and not the Son of God?Why then must professional Christians, paid to teach Christianity, at a Christian school, shrink away from the most fundamental claim of Christianity, i.e. that Jesus is the Christ who so changed the world that time is divided into an 'after' and a 'Before' Christ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!","review":"I like Carol Deacon's designs but was very disappointed with this book because a lot of the designs were repeats from other Carol Deacon books that I already had.

Running Word 2002 on a desktop (1.5 P4, 52 MB RAM, Windows XP), I find the program to be fast, stable, and able to help me in any document-related task I need to get done.

The shooting, music, and Artsy techniques are a bit overdone for what is a slight, very vague S.E. Hinton storyline, making the film feel rather over-Angsty and pretentious at times. And Micky Rourke's spaciness, shuffling and \\"poetic\\" mumbling wouldn't be confused for Profound by anyone but a 14-year-old. But I was 14-ish when I first saw it, and I loved the hell out of it.I love Stewart Copeland's score, (got it on CD, still listen to it), always like seeing Matt Dillon, who sold this mush with conviction, still think Diane Lane is the hottest gal ever to hit high school, and Tom Waits as Benny, the counter-guy at the greasy-spoon (\\"watch the languange, watch the language...\\") still cracks me up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Delivered!","review":"One of my favorite movies!

Not only does he poke fun of every one of us by poking fun at himself, he does it in a way that makes us glad to be humans on his planet. Brian uses everyday occurances as the basis for the most hilarious bits, and does it without taking you to places you wouldn't want your parents to see you. He manages to bring you to your knees in hysterical laughter without once bringing sex, profanity or raunchy behavior into his act. It might not sound cool to most people, but Brian Regan is without a doubt the only comic on the circuit that the whole family can enjoy... and enjoy you will! I got the chance to see Brian at a Comedy Club in Dallas back in '96- so funny the first night, I bought tickets for the remaning nights of his engagement!

Many times you laugh not just because of what he says, but also how he says it.It's hard to compare Brian Regan to anyone else because he really has his own style. I don't want to ruin any punchlines, so I'll just give you one of his throwaway lines, \\"My friend told me he wears glasses only when he drives. How does that work? He steps out of his car and goes... I CAN SEE!! IT'S BEAUTIFUL!\\"It really doesn't matter what your tastes are, Brian Regan is one of the few comedians who can crack everyone up. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD now! You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD almost killed me....","review":"I listened to this CD in the car, and I found myself laughing so hard that tears were running down my face, and I almost wrecked the car. Brian's comedy reminds us of how the simple things in life are usually the most funny. Bryan Regan's Live CD is a must for anyone needing a good hearty laugh. Take Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Soulful Talent","review":"We had the wonderful opportunity to not only see Brian Regan live at the DC Improv (9-02-2001), but also meet Brian and his brother. His delightful ability to study and comment on the human condition in a fun loving way is only matched by his sincere generosity. He did not have to spend time with those who wanted to meet and take pictures with him, but the brothers Regan did. Do yourself a favor and buy the CD. Do an even bigger favor and see him live. His mannerisms make it even more entertaining and you get to learn what whales say, what Evel Knievil was thinking as he crashed, how to eat a \\"lazy\\" peanut butter & jelly sandwich, and what makes for a \\"good\\" writer on a fishing program. Sorry, but I have to \\"Shut'r down\\". Take Luck.Ps, you know what whales can communicate over 300 miles away. Know what they say? \\"Caaan you still hearrrrrr meeeeee?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!","review":"I purchased this CD for my 13 year old.

A+++, skippy magee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy?","review":"I hope this wasn't meant to be in the comedy. That's what I purchased it for, and was VERY disappointed.

Brian Regan has taken the world by storm... At least the world that knows about him. Tell all of your friends to listen to this cd because it is the most hilarious comedy on the market. Brian uses everyday things that most of us don't even think about to propagate the most gut busting laughter that there ever was. If you like good clean jokes and can appretiate some really goofy humor, then by all means buy this cd. Even after listening to it eleventy billion times I still laugh at ever spin of the shiny disc. So you too should join me and my comedic friend, and turn your stereo into the jokester of the night, sure to please everyone at the party.

Buy one for yourself and one for a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy sound quality","review":"Watch out for this album: you have to look carefully at the fine print to see that this was recorded with a handheld microphone. In fact, several times during the recording, somebody whacks the microphone. There is always the constant din of people in the club talking and eating in the background. The piano sounds so chinsy that it sounds like a toy. It's really an awful recording, and you can't even focus on the music to enjoy it. Don't buy this - you can find other much better quality recordings of just as good of performances by Monk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uninhibited Monk/Coltrane brilliance","review":"Forget the poor quality recording, just listen to the music. This live concert shows Monk and Coltrane totall uninhibited, free to impose their visions onto the canvas of the music. Coltrane's solos are amazing, especially on 'I mean you'. There's also, among other things, a short and snappy version of 'Epistrophy.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"greatly helpful","review":"Listening to this CD multiple times substantially added to my enjoymentof the live opera performance that I later attended.Despite being trained in classical piano, I am a novice when it comes to opera.I followed the story much better than I would have without the CD.The CD is filled with faccinating information about Rossini and this particular opera.The only downside was that I was later disappointed with the university orchestra in the perfomance I attended,as the professional orchestra on the CD is such a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"chronology of cliffy","review":"ward being 1of top4 highest songwriters this cd must be included in any serious music room rare stuff & perfect interpretation"},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Jeni is a very funny man","review":"Richard Jeni is one of the funniest comedians you will ever hear and this CD has a nice collection of his bits.

It revolved around a guy who had a live cable cooking show, on which Jeni was heard to say lines like, \\"You know it's time to change the box of Arm and Hammer in your refrigerator when, if you reach for the broccoli, it reaches back....the hand on the Arm and Hammer box is giving you the finger.....,\\" etc. What a shame that he killed himself! He was truly a funny man, and this CD proves it. One of my favorite lines is in \\"Something You Never Hear.\\" Then there's the shoe salesman story, and Jacques Cousteau.....uproariously funny. Get your hands on a copy of this CD before it's too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious bits","review":"Richard Jeni was one of the funniest guys i've ever heard. Without foul language and swearing (a couple of 4-letter words is in there allright) he really gives you a new perspective on some matters in life. the \\"Yest infection\\" piece is really good to listen to and especially the \\"exploding scrotum syndrom\\" bit. He is deeply missed by a lot of people all over. R.I.P. Mr. Jeni wherever you are"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Jeni Fun","review":"This is a compilation of all of Richard's greatest bits from Platipus man, Boy from NY & Crazy from the Heat. It has been modified a bit to fuse together the jokes and it is great fun; but no now material, so if you've seen the other videos, none of it will be a surprise. Good for friends to listen to"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant comic, but why not put entire show on CD?","review":"I am always suspicious about Best Bits or Greatest Hits, especially when we talk about comedy. Even more than a musical studio album, a stand-up comedy recording tends to suffer when you remove the crucial element of a continuous show. A stand-up comedian interacts with the public very closely, and any compilation destroys the integrity of this fabric.It is a shame, because Ricard Jedi is an excellent comedian with a sense of rhytm which puts him in the same league with Seinfeld. Delivery is extremely polished and the amount of effort that Jedi puts into his act reminded me of Elvira Kurt, another delivery grandmaster whose lines cannot be delivered by just anyone.\\"Bill The Belching Gourmet\\" (a spoof TV cooking show) is an obvious highlight for me on this CD. Also note the bit about women smoking cigars. Extraordinary. These two tracks alone would justify buying this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Wilco album yet.","review":"I own every Wilco album, and I really think they are all GREAT....but this one is clearly the best.

The first half of the story (and film) really works. The sad/funny relationship of the depressed, pajama clad student (Jacob Wysocki) and the well-meaning vice principal and counselor (a spot on John C. Reilly) is full of promise, but that thread unravels with a longish, sexual coming of age sequence that seems forced and motivated only by an attempt at politically correctness.

But there is a major problem with the new version. While running a VBA macro program that I have used daily for over five years, it is SLOWER on a 2 GHz machine with XP that with a 300 MHz machine and WIN98. The reason is excess security that can not be turned off like in Excel97. At first it was ok, a little faster than the old machine and then I suppose a critcal upgeade with XP has now slowed the program to a crawl. Microsoft has both a security problem and a hangup about security. But running a virus scan on my old and proven macros everytime they run is not the answer.

There are re-enactments of Viking invasions as well as maps showing Norse routes to England, Ireland, France, the eastern Mediterranean, and even the northeastern coast of the American continent. While discussing the Viking world view, the video does a good job of explaining Valhalla, an after-life that looks a bit like Dante's vision of hell, it turns out.

D'Onofrio gets tackled and Hawke ends up dragging around a man on his ankle like a little kid on hanging on their mother. Ok, I'll watch anything with Vincent D'Onofrio, but the movie is still great besides the fact that he, my favorite actor, is in it. The movie is telling the true story, like it says in the opening ...DUH..., so why are you expecting soapy dramatizations and sex scenes when it's about them robbing banks and how they did it? I could watch it again and again, unlike most of these hyped-up garbage movies coming out of Hollywood now.

The Newton Boys is really a period piece, the true story of the most successful bank robbers in U.S. history. They didn't gain the notoriety of Bonnie and Clyde because they didn't kill anyone, but they did make off with huge sums of money. The film is an interesting look at an era, with strong performances from most of the cast.

You will not be disappointed; this collection is a musical masterpiece. With arrangements from Nelson Riddle and Billy May, Sinatra's voice has never been better.These albums represent what have been referred to as the first \\"concept albums\\". Rather than a miscellaneous collection of songs, the albums have been carefully constructed to set a certain \\"mood\\". The collection consists of upbeat \\"swing\\" albums as well as records featuring the ballad or, in the words of the Chairman, the \\"saloon\\" songs. A Christmas album as well as an instrumental album is also featured in this set.If you seriously love \\"the Voice\\", you'll love this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Investment","review":"I bought this collection of Sinatra for my 90 year old blind father. It has brought back so many memories for him: I have heard stories about the courtship of him and mom, stories of his military service, and many more stories about his life . . . all sparked by hearing \\"Blue Eyes\\" sing a certain song. A family friend came over and upon hearing some of the music, told a story of going into NYC on the subway when she was 11 years old to see Sinatra perform live. In reliving some of these memories, I have been able to glean some very key information in my geneology research.

And let's make one of them a lesbian and the other bisexual. If their sexual preferences had anything to do with the plot, that would be one thing. But like so much else in this novel, the sex scenes between the main characters seemed added to the novel to add shock value.The serial killer is a doctor who does gross things and eludes capture, but you never get a sense of the character as being clever. You're told he's clever. He's as close to Hannibal Lecter as a lightning bug is to lightning.The publisher showed the care and concern they had for this book when the author's name on the cover didn't match the one on the title page.

With an intense focus on Madison's proteges, McCoy seems to lose sight of Madison and seems to see that statesman solely in the light of the coming storm over slavery and the power of the federal government. This is somewhat troubling though it must be said that McCoy's excellent sketches of Edward Coles, Nicholas Trist (if the name means anything, Trist was a diplomat who helped negotiate the end of the War with Mexico) and, best of all, William C. Rives (who really needs a modern biography) makes up for the problems. If you want a solid take on Madison's influence after his passing, \\"The Last of the Fathers\\" does well though it highlights some issues (slavery, federalism) while ignoring others (democracy, modern industrial capitalism vs. agrarianism, foreign policy)."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like to laugh at bad movies, you'll love this.","review":"So funny I about pee'd myself.

Funny stuff.I found the book to be empowering. I felt as a parent, I was just a little better than she was. That is her gift.

But it is also the best. That's why reading Rachel Cusk's book, A Life's Work, was distressing to me, to say the least....But to present the dark without the bright is to do motherhood an injustice. There certainly is no doubt that Rachel Cusk can write. I will not dispute that. But it is clear to me that her problems have more to do with her own character, and less to do with motherhood.This book can serve as a warning to those women out there of similar attitude and outlook--who perhaps should think twice before they bring a little one into the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Properly Genius","review":"My good friend is pregnant with her first child and I wouldn't, couldn't, send her this book.

It's a definitive work for mothers. I will read this book many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coping with motherhood","review":"I was drawn to this book at first glance, having struggled with the isolation and dramatic identity shifts that new motherhood brings. I quickly found myself annoyed with how Rachel Cusk's intelligence, education and ability to articulate gave her a voice to express these feelings, but no way to cope. Life forces us to deal with things we hadn't anticipated; we DON'T have control over our lives if we want to live among others, be they friends, parents, siblings, spouses, or children.The balance between dependence and independence was the first lesson I learned in marriage, and it has served me well in coping with the sometimes painful aspects of being a mother. Cusk's shock at the demands of parenthood shows that she's never learned to live for/with anyone but herself. It seems a rather sad life for her and for her family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catholic girl goes bad","review":"Teaser review of Aftermath, sequel to A Life's Work (out August)Everyone says she writes like an angel.

I found the book somewhat disjointed, and felt like she was writing in a stream of consciousness form sometimes. However-I have never read someone so accurately describe the intense feelings of bewilderment that life with a baby can induce in you (speaking for myself). The combination of devoted love and attachment one feels for a child & at the same time longing for freedom lost, resentment at times too; Rachel Cusk conveys this conflict successfully, especially in the last few chapters. I do not think anyone who is not a mother should read this-I would think it sound too scary. Ms Cusk even says in the intro that this book is mainly for people who are already mothers-as the description of parenting \\"loses something in the translation\\" to non parents. I couldn't agree more."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I found this book very interesting to read, especially since I've never had a baby and was curious about what motherhood is really like.

Unfortunately I found this book first. Hundreds of pages about the distress of losing one's identity, and almost nothing about joy, discovery, love.

I would not recommend it for pregnant women or cheerful people who are intent on only seeing the best in a situation. This is mothering at its worst, though infused with love. The section on men who blow the cover on women who hide the difficulties in mothering is very humorous and worth reading. For those who wonder why the author couldn't cope better, this section describes the sort of conspiracy among mothers that prevents total honesty.

The author served with the famed 17th Indian 'Black Cat' Division at the capture and siege of Meiktila, through the battle of Pyawbwe and saw a final skirmish with remnents of Japanese forces at the Sittang Bend. His description of the life and attitudes (much of which would now be termed politically incorrect) of the average British soldier fighting in Burma is priceless. What I found particularly enjoyable is how he kept the conversation of his fellow soldiers in the vernacular of their home in Cumberland. Some may find it difficult to follow but it lends a definite air of authenticity. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Burma campaign or wanting to read a great war memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Read","review":"Quartered Safe Out Here was far from the best personal accounts of participation in WWII.

A must read for all the Flashman addicts scattered profusely across the globe, but a very good read in its own right. One of the best personal memoirs from the war I've read, especially from a junior enlisted man. Quite a bit of humor, but a fair amount of fear and fatigue as well. Fraser's comments on his view of Hiroshima, from the point of view of a soldier who would have continued to soldier on had Japan not surrendered are worth reflecting on, but are more convoluted than one might think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quartered Safe Out Here","review":"A frank and totally absorbing account of Britain's WWII Burma campaign from the perspective of a buck private (and later, lance corporal). Although this was essentially a side show to the war, the fear, the terror, the privations, the ferocity of fighting were as great here as in any theater--and are very convincingly described.Fraser's skill as a writer (he is the author of the Flashman series and a serious history of the Scotch/English border strife) is abundantly on display; this book is a real page turner. In fact, I enjoyed it so much I immediately ordered those Fraser books I don't already own."},{"rating":"2","title":"War in Burma","review":"The author of the Flashman chronicles has produced a vivid account of what it was actually like to be a young soldier in Burma in the later stages of World War II.

I have textured tile floors that are a bear to clean. You can easily clean the surface, but it is very difficult to get into the textures. Usually I have to use a scrub brush and get on my hands and knees.Not with this. It did the job it said it would, really got into the ground in dirt. The solution dispenser is handy, but a spray bottle would work just as well. The scrub brush really works great, if slow.The mop is only \\"okay\\".Over all, this is a good buy for quick clean ups. For a big job, like doing the whole floor on a weekly basis, I'd look for a corded model.

I was hesistant to buy it at first since it's a little pricy compared to other mops. Easy to follow instructions on the assembly of this product. But at first, I had a hard time making the mop work. It took me days to figure out which button to push when you want the scrubber or the pad. But after a while, I find the product very useful. I use Chlorox pads on this mop and put drops of PineSol in the water bottle. It's very effective in cleaning the floor. I usually use 2-3 Chlorox pads to clean my floor. At the last pad, I could hardly see any dirt. I also use it when I wax my floor. It is a little heavy which is good because you don't have to add pressure when you want to scrub/mop.

The mop pads are a joke, they don't just come off when you turn the knob which i can't even do that. It does not take any mop pads because the swiffer wet jet mop pads are my fave and I had to put velro on the bottom so that they would work on it. And most of all the thing is so heavy. You have to have some upper body streanth just to move it. The scrubber head is no were near how big it look on Tv. It was a very big dissapointment not to mention it was my Xmas present to my self.

Friedrich's friend was very helpful to the story. Because Friedrich was jewish and his friend was not. This book was interesting because instead of starting during the holocaust it leads up to it and goes past when Friedrich was living after the holocaust. This book was easier to read rather than another book which made my book a better choice for lite readers. I think it is more of a choice for younger readers rather than me.

The story is easy for kids to read, yet it doesn't seem like the \\"young adult\\" literature they often give to Middle School students.The story begins in Germany in the mid-1920's; the narrator is a German Christian and his buddy Friedrich is a German Jew. The narrator's family is poor and Friedrich's family is well-off, yet they are never selfish or vain. As the years pass it seems like their community is getting hostile toward Jewish people, and while the narrator doesn't seem to understand what's happening, it looks like his Jewish friend is probably more aware. Friedrich gets blamed for all sorts of things, and while they try to do the stuff kids do (see the chapters \\"The Ball\\" and \\"The Pool\\") he finds that Friedrich is seen more and more as an intruder than a customer.The last few chapters are more and more unpleasnat, the ending of which I will not reveal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friedrich- the worst Holocaust book I've read","review":"Being a Jew, the Holocaust is one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, this book really disappointed me. The first person style (told by Friedrich's best friend, who is a non-jew) is meant to show the two different effects of the uprising Nazi Germany. However, the book turns out to be a trite and annoying explanation of Jewish culture. The overall story also lacks a smooth plot and tries too hard to make each new Nazi law effect Friedrich directly.

What were this guy and his cronies doing, holding a beauty pagent in prisons around the country? If you can suspend disbelief a little and get past this initial problem, you're actually going to find a very unusual and sweet romance. I particularly liked the heroine. This was a woman who admittedly made some very poor choices in her life, but she was smart enough to realize her mistakes and take advantage of an opportunity to change her life around.

The justification for this didn't ring true: lots of women in those days lost their families at a young age and grew up on a farm doing hard labor and still managed to live respectable lives without turning into jail bait. And the hero wasn't such a great guy either, allowing his friend to conjure up so many lies--all in the name of ambition and political power.

These were a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and tangy","review":"I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo. Unfortunately, every bag I received in that case was over cooked! They were very dark and only a few golden brown chips in each bag. They definitely need to improve that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expired stock","review":"I Was sent 3 week past \\"Fresh by date\\" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.Very bad form amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The chip with a kiss of salt","review":"These chips are delectably delicious. I am on a low sodium diet. I didn't have to give up totally something that I truely love to snack. These chips are bursting with flavor, and you can't really tell they are missing all that salt. There is just a kiss worth on a chip, but beleive me, it is a total makeout!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great strong flavor","review":"I agree with the company motto \\"A Natural Obsession\\". I tried a small bag at the local store and immediately bought in bulk online to save about 30 percent. The flavor of these is very strong, so they are best paired with a food that has a very mild flavor, like steamed vegetables or plain whole grain bread. Otherwise they compete or clash with the other food."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY awful because SOMETIMES they are awful","review":"and THAT is the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Chips Out There!","review":"These are my new favorite! I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one! They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.Price wise...I do not see that they are that much of a deal here. I purchased them for $2.99 at the grocery with no shipping. I would have given the product 5 stars (easily) had it not been for the price. The taste is fabulous -- you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"chips","review":"Nice and thick and kettle style, however, the vinegar taste was bot the best I've had.

The bags are very strong - much thicker than, say, Lay's potato chip bags. Inside are very tasty kettle cooked chips, salted just right. Because these appear to be cooked in an actual kettle fashion, some are cooked more than others, which gives it a more authentic, non-manufactured feel. Some people may not like that.I reccomend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious as always!","review":"Oh, I love these chips! And they're so hard to find where I am, and when I do find them, they're usually $1-2 more per bag for less. Great that these are so cheap here at Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly addicitive chips","review":"I have to admit that those chips are so good that they are highly addictive. I can't stop eating them!!! It's crunchy and seasoned at the right amount of flavor and salt. Just perfect!!! Believe me, some chips are so salty, I can't finish a small bag. But this one... I just keep on eating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These chips are awesome if not best but....","review":"I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces."},{"rating":"2","title":"kettle chips","review":"This kettle chips taste \\"Good , Crispy & Crunchy \\" too ! U will enjoy it also!

Great chips otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like them.","review":"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is \\"I like it.\\" That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips. These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor. The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag. Really? Who can eat half and save the rest for later??? Not me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great chips with very low sodium","review":"Only 5mg sodium per serving, chips are crisp. I sometimes will dip in a low salt ketchup and that adds a bit to the flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bags were damaged with holes and stains.","review":"The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kettle Chips Make Great Mouse Food","review":"After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for my case of 15 5oz bags to arrive, upon opening the box noticed that every bag had been chewed open by a mouse. Don't know if it is still in the box, but it is outside on the porch. When my son gets home, I'm going to have pictures taken and email to Amazon. The outside Amazon box was intact, so it had to be either from the Kettle Chips people or the Amazon warehouse, don't know which. I will never buy these again from Amazon. I cannot tell you how disgusted I am with this purchase. It makes me sick to think about it!I included pictures at the top of the page. Poor little mousie must have high cholesterol now.Update: I forgot to mention that I offered to email the above pictures of the mouse damage to Amazon but was told they didn't want them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-fried","review":"I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same.

I live in TX and I can tell you I've tried ALL S/V chips I can get ahold of. The best of the best are HEB (storebrand) and World Market. Bob's and Zapp's Aren't bad.

These ones made by Kettle were very tasty and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"What I like about them:1) Very thick chips.2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing.4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.Cons:As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible. I didn't expect much when I bought these. But after I tasted them I was amazed. I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these. They have a natural potato flavor with thick, crunchy chips. The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open. Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation."},{"rating":"1","title":"burns the skin off your lips","review":"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far.

No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had better \\"Jalapeno Kettle Chips\\"","review":"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.

I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst chips ever.","review":"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case \\"& Chive\\") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise 1 It's different...","review":"Kettle chips now look, feel and taste like Lays.

I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly. There was a sale at the end of the summer and I received a few cases/boxes for just over $10.00. The chips were fresh and very hard to eat just one bag. I hid them in the garage and only remembered them when I went out there; that way I didn't eat them all. As far as the pictures, if the person contacted Amazon, he made out ok. Amazon is great with handling complaints and this person was given perfect customer service if he called Amazon. Thanks for a great tasting product, good price and quick shipping. I'll buy these again...soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kettle Chips, Sea Salt","review":"There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again.

If you take a closer look at the photo, you'll see the man in the picture actually holding the leg area in the background so this short will look more attractive to the buyers. (I know i need to look at at measurement but i also need to look at photo to see how it's going to look). That's why he is holding his hand in the back of his leg(to hold the short to make it looks more slim). Second the quality is not as good as \\"new balance 5-inch short\\" When you wear New balance, it's feel as if you have no short on. It's very soft and nice and unlike this one, it has 3 pockets.

Her writing style and everything has become more sparse, but at the same time more concrete.

Sad to say, I was very disappointed. This book reminded me of nothing so much as poorly written fanfic. The characters are sweet and engaging but their dialogue is wooden and artificial sounding. Whereas the jacket promised an in depth look at the \\"pirate crew\\" culture of the restaurant world, I felt that I was getting a mere glimpse. Overall it seemed like this was \\"Poppy-lite\\", nothing dark, nothing dangerous. It felt like it was written for adolescents. Maybe that's because she was trying to capture the mindset of her young protaganists but I think she did a much better job with Nothing, Steve, Ghost, Tran and my favorites, Zach and Trev. I'll definitely still read anything new of Poppy's but have my fingers crossed that it'll be a lot better than \\"X\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"a kickin' prequel!","review":"The liquor series is a fair bit different from poppy's earlier, horror work- but every bit as enthralling! i highly suggest reading liquor first, since this is the prequel. even if you're not already in love with ricky and g-man, you'll adore all the back history this suplies for the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering 1966","review":"For those of us who were alive and paying attention when this album came out, it was deja vu when \\"Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" came out in June 1967. I know that Paul McCartney credits The Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" as a major influence; but, he must have been listening to \\"Face to Face\\" on the other turn table. Ray Davies paens to a deteriorating British middle class while using skiffle, rock and ballads to tell the tale was a preview of coming attractions by The Beatles.

However, in the past 12 months or so I have started listening to it a lot again and now prefer it to 'Heaven'. I would say that it is the best CT album, it does grow on you the more you listen. Liz's voice seems more emotional on this album and you can even understand what she is singing about a lot of the time. This album also contains one of my favourite songs ever in 'Pur'. I can't get enough of this song and it was a good idea to put it at the end of the CD as it makes you want to put it on again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearls covered in dirt...","review":"That's what you'll find on Four Calendar Cafe. Make sure you have the patience to survive pure boredom and lack of soul until you reach the divine Squeeze-Wax, which in reality is one of the two only true Cocteau-spirited songs on this album.The Cocteau Twins were always masters at creating sweet, atmospheric, romantic and meaningful music without ever getting soppy or too pathetic (the wonderful Aikea-Guinea will attest to that), but on this record, all that is sweet is revolting. Honestly. Save for aforementioned Squeeze-Wax and Summerhead, this one belongs in the bin.Thank god they recovered before their last effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stagnant","review":"Though most of the elements of good music are there, and Elizabeth Fraser's vocals are truly amazing (making this album at least listenable) nothing here is going anywhere. You are always left expecting somthing to happen, (it never does) and though it definately trys, it fails to invoke any sort of real feeling or aptmosphere. I recommend you check out some of this bands earlier stuff, or better yet, Fraser's appearences in Massive Attacks \\"Mezzanane\\" which have to be some of the best sound ever to grace my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothless","review":"This music has no bite. I purchased this album after hearing \\"Mezzanine\\" by Massive Attack; a Cocteau Twins vocalist appeared on that album and sounded gorgeous. Well, the vocals on this recording (which are competent) are wasted by goofy, less-than-ordinary attempts at \\"atmospheric\\" melodies. The lyrics are awful. Background music? I can think of no activity for which this horrid record would serve as a suitable companion.

The only song I ever liked by them is \\"It Must Have Been Love\\", but I LOVE that song, so it would have been worth it just to have that song. That would have made the whole album 2 stars. Unfortunately, it is NOT what you hear on the radio... in fact, it's almost NOTHING like you hear on the radio... they've turned this regular song into a country song! AAUUGGHH! WHY did they make this song country! That just ruined the song for me. Now, I like some country, but I didn't like this country version of this song. Why did they do it? In fact, if anyone DOES know an album with that song (REGULAR version), please e-mail me and tell me the album.

That's why I consider Pablo a Comedy God. I was driving the 405 freeway when I first heard Pablo, singing \\"Who owns the video store?\\" I laughed so hard I almost crashed; I couldn't see the road through the tears in my eyes and it was hard to breathe. I grabbed this CD as soon as I could and shared it with all my friends. This guy is just hilarious.

Not funny at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"Sorry, I bought this based upon the other recommendations and was sorely disappointed. Best I can say is that it is relatively clean. Laughed a couple times. Most of the CD is an exercise in Pablo's impersonation abilities -- which aren't bad. Most of it is poking harmless fun at other cultures, mixed with his singing. If you want to laugh, I suggest Brian Regan. He's clean and hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleeting...","review":"Great comedy, like any great art, is great because it endures. George Carlin's material, for example, has endured for decades, and it will continue to endure; it will be as poignant fifty years from now as it is today.The problem with the comics who do impressions---comics like Francisco---is that their material has a shelf-life of about twelve minutes. Sixty years ago, if you did a good impression of Humphrey Bogart, you'd probably get a lot of laughs. But today, the same impression would be met with blank stares.The guy who does the movie preview voice today will not be the one who does them in the future, and likewise, in the future, that impression will have lost all its value, as no one will be familiar with the reference.Look ahead to the future: a new comic, doing a new impression of the new movie preview guy, getting a lot of laughs.

This compilation is just excellent, and contains four original remix versions, including the two hits I mentioned earlier at 6:23 and 7:27 respectively. I bought four of these albums to give to friends. Am I glad I discovered it. If you're familar with Mike Francis, you must have this CD.

The thing that really bothered me was that it started in the 1980's and acted like they were the same age when we left them in the first book, in the 1960's. It made no sense. It might have been better if it picked up in the 1960's. This book really lost all the fun of the first. The glamour of the \\"Hollywood\\" lifestyle that existed in those times was the heart of the first book. Bringing the storyline into the modern age made it like any other Jackie Collins novel. It lost all of the Jacquline Susann Magic. I would have rather wondered what happened in the future than think of it the way Shadow of the Dolls portrays it.Bottomo line: If you are in the mood for more Jacqueline Susann, buy the other books that she actually wrote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick, I need a better Doll!","review":"In 2002, can we really shock anybody anymore? This sequel tries to be as much trashy fun as the original and leaves the reader unimpressed. Nothing is shocking in this book. No twists come completely out of nowhere. Still to compare this book with the orginal is doing this book a great injustice. Still the \\"shadow\\" of Jacqueline Susann lingers and it is very hard not to compare the two works.Neely is still my favorite ... character and I love all the chapters with her. The contemporary setting didn't brother me, but why didn't the author leave the book in the orginal time period and work through the sexual haze of the 70's and the sobering early 80's? Did she feel it wouldn't sell? I felt sorry for the character of Anne Wells and her quest for love and in the end the book left me wondering if we can ever find a faithful true love? Do we ever have a second chance at true love? Near the end, I though \\"Yes\\" but by the end I'm questioning that answer. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the Shadow of the Valley","review":"When I finished Valley of the Dolls, I wasn't particularly hungry for a sequel, but I was a little curious about Lawrence's attempt at a follow-up. But why oh why did she have to fool with the time period? What may have been shocking left set in the sixties is pretty tame by today's standards. The whole charm of the original \\"Dolls\\" was directly related to the period in which it was set. Lawrence's \\"Shadow\\" is has nothing new to say, nothing you wouldn't find in any Jackie Collins novel. Stick to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed Opportunity","review":"This could have been a great follow on. Characters we all love, story already developed. So what happened? The best plot turns were glazed over and the characters were never shown with any emotion. The author should have re-read the first novel a few more times and gotten the cadence and the plot turns and characters reactions to the turns down. This just came out as a poor poor follow up that left me wondering, why bother... If you need a beach book, go for the new Jackie Collins...this just does not cut it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake me up when it's over","review":"What a bore. This book isn't a shadow of VOD. It's more like a cloudy, gray day to VOD's midnight neon lights. Yes, Anne and Neely took their modern-day dolls, and, yes, Lyon went back and forth to Neely, but who gives a flying leap? The original VOD had meat. This sequel has only empty calories. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she even read the first book","review":"Okay, I had some MAJOR problems with this book. It's over 20 years since the first book ended and Anne, Neely, and Lyon haven't aged a bit? They've regressed in age? Jennifer is now 7? And that's just the start of it.She may have been using a manuscript that Susann put together for a sequel but this falls WELL below the mark. It was a wholly unsatisfying read with an ending that made me go....WHAT? Some scenes were just not set up well enough and other scenes just fell flat on their face. Yes, it was nice to revisit these characters but when they aren't in the hands of a gifted storyteller like Susann then it's not worth the visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Afternoon","review":"Of course it isn't Jackie...probably no one will ever even come close...but it was a kick just the same. Like visiting old friends with whom you've completely lost touch... Ms. Lawrence has managed to remain very true to the tone and style of the original, even with the liberties taken with the time frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to take some dolls just to get through this book","review":"I will start my review by saying I thoroughly enjoyed VOTD and was looking forward to seeing what happened to Anne, Neely, Lyon, and the rest of the gang. First off, there is an unexplained change in time. VOTD ended in 1964 with Anne Welles approaching 40 years old. SOTD begins in the late '80s with Anne in her mid-30s. What happened to 1964-1987? Anne as well as the other characters should have been 23 years older, not five years younger.Besides the errors in time, there are also name errors (Kevin Gillmore is now referred to as Kevin Gillian) and storylines that just don't ring true for any of the characters.A few devoted VOTD fans should have read this book first and offered their critiques to the author. At least some of the errors could have been corrected. I am not sure if anyone could have saved the plotlines. Overall a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"I spent $... for this book at a wholesale club -- $... too much! The plot is fragmented, but what can one expect when the lives of the characters are as disfunctional as they are. What a waste of time to read about people who consistently mess up when there is a world of great literature to choose from. I just selected this title as a relaxing break between some quality titles. What a colossal bore! I did not find it the page turner some readers claim it to be. Just finished the last page, so this afternoon this book goes to the local used book store as a donation. Can't wait to get rid of it. And, by the way, I read \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" when it was published in 1966. This book is certainly a poor excuse for a sequel. Like I say -- save your time; save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close, but no cigar.","review":"While I appreciate that Rae Lawrence sought to warm the hearts of a public who missed Susann's original characters, this book (like \\"Scarlet\\", the \\"sequel\\" to \\"Gone With the Wind\\") is proof that some things are indeed best left alone. The characters in this work seem very flat, lacking the emotion, depth and vibrancy that made \\"Valley of the Dolls\\" such an enjoyable work.Anne, Neely, Lyon are all relegated to plots that are the fodder for typical romance novels that aspire to be good beach reading: adultery, Hollywood, death, a genre well done by someone like Jackie Collins. However, in Lawrence's text they seem only to be placed in these situations. The reader is given very little insight into any character's motivation or emotional reaction.And then there is the unfortunate \\"second generation\\" sub-plot.If you feel this is something you must read, please check it out of your local library. Your money will definitely be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it!","review":"Considering the slamming other reviewers have been giving this book I am almost ashamed to admit that I think I like Shadow of the Dolls better than Valley of the Dolls.Yes the timeline is off, but that is explained away before Chapter 1 even starts. This a modern \\"what if\\" and the characters are put in current times and situations. I thought Neely and Anne's characters in this book were a perfect extension of themselves in the orginal. I could definately see Anne relaxing in the Hamptons and reinventing herself and her career in a Martha Stewart-ish way. Neely was the same money grubbing social climber as she was in the original; Lyon the same womanizer. To me all the parts fit. My only complaint is that it wasn't longer and that the characters of Anne and Neely's children weren't fleshed out more, but who knows that could lend itself to a third book, couldn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzero stars. Even more boring than an Oprah book.","review":"I'm a big Jacqueline Susann fan, so I was excited when I first heard about this book. I got the audio edition and listened to it while I drove to work each day. I tell you, it's a wonder I didn't careen off the road in a deep sleep while listening to it! Although it doesn't suffer from the twisted, gnarly phrasing of modern \\"litahdeddy\\" fiction, it, however, lacks the ballsy punches of its prequel.First it jerks around with the timeline, hacking twenty years off the characters' ages, and then it delivers a story with the impact of a 1962 Frigidaire commercial cowering under the scrutiny of a rigid TV censor!I mean, what was it afraid of? It had all the background it needed--the original VD!--to deliver a truly dishy and still insightful story. And, yet, the author chose not to do that. Huh?!The book brought me to tears, because it BORED me to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Rotten? This \\"novel!\\"","review":"When we read the original VALLEY OF THE DOLLS(sometimes even sneak reading it), we knew we were reading trash. But it was enjoyable trash, with a storyline that just didn't quit. Supposidly Susann spent months writing the outline for this sequel. Did author Lawrence read it? Don't think so. The writing itself isn't bad, sometimes even admirable, but the story is just so bad it isn't even funny. And, the entire book covers 14 years continuously....yet it is just a few pages over 300 and lots of space and large type there. Think the \\"novelist\\" knew it was a loser and wanted to get back to her own, more resonable, writings so she dashed this out...saving anything good for her own books. Save your money on this one. It purports to be a sequel to VALLEY, but, in reality, it's not.....just bad is all. For a much better read, try LONELY JUNCTIONS by R C Lemos.

It seems that only a handful of flavors have regular accidents and get discarded to the Belly Flop pile. I received about 5 flavors in the entire 2lb bag.

I would just as soon buy the normal 2.2lb bag of assorted flavors for twice the price and receive all the flavors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"Belly Flops are supposed to be misshapen Jelly Bellys, but just as good, as they come from exactly the same production line as \\"perfect\\" Jelly Bellies. The quality of the flops doesn't seem to be an issue, just the quality of the assortment. The manufacturer doesn't seem, in my opinion, to put much effort in creating a good assortment of flavors, they just bag whatever flops are produced at the time. My two bags of mostly root beer and coffee had only about 200 beans of another flavor. I don't like root beer at all, and only slightly like coffee, so about a pound of each bag went in the trash. This means I paid about $16/pound for what I actually ate. Sometimes you get what you pay for, not what's advertised. What I'd really like to see is Jelly Belly offer quantities of Jelly Bellies and/or Belly Flops in single flavors you could pick. I'd place my order for 5 pounds of licorice now.

I hold one in my fingers and he takes it gently from my hand. We agree that they are great and, cost effective.

If she is unhappy with the progress and direction the country is taking she should buy a one way ticket back to he homeland. This country was built upon the idea that we are blessed compared to all other countries. The measures she is promoting we introduce into our society are in opposition to the views and ideals shared by the majority of the citizens of this country. She argues that we abandon our values and replace them with her heretical beliefs and standards. What a self-centered, empty person who is bereft of any sense of values.

Ricketts was no insider in his industry: he was an academic outcast who was at once a beach bum, a philanderer, and an ecologist whose early warnings about over-fishing in California and Alaska fell on deaf ears in the 1930s.

He returned with John Smiley's <u> Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6</u>. I took a brief look through the book... and just didn't see enough charts and tables to keep me interested. The book looked as if it had been written by a 13-year-old for his \\"teacher for a day\\" class. I'm sure the content provided was ample, but I didn't feel like wading through the fluff and commentary to find the actual lessons embedded deep within. That's the last time I send my brother out book-hunting. :) I admit that I didn't give this one much of a chance, but for those casually browsing in a bookstore, an initial hint of \\"first impression charm\\" was extremely lacking in this publication.

It should be called 'Programming in Visual Basic for beginners'. The point of this book is to teach you to program in VB6, not to teach you the basics of programming using VB as an example language. While I can understand that the verbose classroom approach may appeal to some, I found it patronising and time wasting. I eventually bought 'Sams Teach Yourself Beginning Programming in 24 Hours' by Greg Perry which gives a concise summary of programming basics, an overview of the most common languages, and exercises to drive home the lessons.

Since I already had a (rusty) background in programming I was able to skim through parts of the book and finish it in a week. The descriptions of the coding and theory are in layman's terms and easy to understand. No programming experience is required for this book.Since I was using this book as a refresher and to bring me up to speed, I didn't enjoy the \\"class room\\" feel of the book (he wrote the book as if he was conducting a college class).

I found the stride of this book too slow. The narrative of each student was laborious for me. I'm not to sure I like the way the book was written (like a story), partly because I've used VB6 at a friends house. Smiley intended to have every question answered as you where thinking about it, but for me that only happened 1 time when Linda (smartest person in class) asked something. I guess I just expected to be the only person in the class, but Smiley had to tend to people of various IQ levels, so, many of my complex (Linda) questions where left unanswered.The missing stars are for the Quotation Marks, that should have been Question Marks, but where left out due to Classroom over crowding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy!","review":"It's a horrible book!

Mr. Smiley has the uncanny knack of unlocking all the unmarked doors to Visual Basic that so many authors assume we already know. If you would like to learn Visual Basic in a step by step, practical and easy to relate style then \\"Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6\\" is a must.By the way if your library is short on space this book will take you to the critical stage due to the fact that one book from John Smiley will lead to the rest of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier than college, but still just as good","review":"I loved this book.

The classroom style of the book appealed to me until I read the first chapter. No class that I have been in was ever like that. It sounded like a VB6 class in Mayberry. That aside I think beginning programmers would be better served with a book that spent more time telling you about the features and how to's of VB6 instead of endless he said, she said, excellent point Billy, etc. Just get to the point and give the readers of the book a little credit.

Smiley never got beyond the most basic concepts.The convention of being a student in a programming class may have made for an entertaining read for some, but for me it was like talking on the phone with someone who stutters: I wanted to reach through the pages and get him to spit out something meaningful without having to read through 25 pages to cover a minute quantity of information. These 700+ pages of, \\"There were no other questions, so I said that prior to taking a break I wanted to talk about the flower box I had displayed on the classroom projector,\\" drove me nuts.This book was a complete waste of money!The SAMS Visual Basic in 21 Days was no picnic, but I learned more in the first 100 pages than I did in Smiley's entire 5 pound book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one and only TRUE beginners book!","review":"This book reads like a novel. I am in the process of re-reading the book for the second time. I started a VB course at the local college this summer, and while \\"cruisin'the web\\", I saw the review of this book. I have not looked back at the purchase of this book. If you have never even seen VB then this book is for you. I will purchase the rest of Smiley's book series for the duration of school as a supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks!!!","review":"This book is NOT boring, its not like reading a bunch of techno babble that makes no sense. He actually explains everything with real-world words and secnarios. It makes me feel like a real student in his class!!! I never thought I could ever learn how to program but this book makes it feel like learning how to ride a bike! Definitly buy this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beginners, go for it","review":"I have read many other programming books for beginners (C++, Java, Perl) and they always start with higly technical, and confusing stuff. With this one, it was quite simple to grab teh ideas and concepts. The layout of the book (a university VBasic class) makes the hole thing smooth. After 2 weeks of reading the book, I made my first application (simple, but it works nice)..this didn't happen with the other languages. SO if you are a beginner of VBasic, don't even think....get this one...it's really worth buying this book. Ciao"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most logical beginning programming book I have ever read","review":"This book is amazing! I've never before read a programming book written in a narrative fashion. John Smiley takes you directly into his classroom where you learn Visual Basic, along with other 'classmates'. Just as in the real world your fellow students ask questions of the instructor, get lost on screens, and need to be explained concepts in different ways to really understand them, all while you are working on a legitimate project. A perfect introduction to VB for the complete novice, and an excellent guide for anyone who would like to see how a subject this complex should really be taught. AND, THE BOOK COMES WITH A WORKING MODEL OF VISUAL BASIC!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tutorial to keep you interested","review":"I wanted to learn some Visual Basic programming skills and have tried several books over the past couple of years. The problem was that the format was always similar to a 1950's maths text book; very difficult to work through and boring.Then I discovered John Smiley's excellent book \\"Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6\\". This held my interest because no preknowledge is assumed and it is quite honestly the best text book that I have ever come across. There are far too many authors out there who could follow John Smiley's example and consider the fact that not every student has an immense IQ able to soak up every item of information like a sponge. A good teacher has to be a great communicator.Well done John and thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superior approach","review":"This is a by far the best beginner programming book I have ever read. The first chapter alone is worth the price of admission. Many books discuss the theory of the software development method but none come close to explaining how to implement it in a real project. Mr. Smiley explains it step-by-step in a clear and concise manner in a language anyone can understand. The use of a story to teach Visual Basic 6 is a superior approach and keeps this book from being just another dry introduction to the world of programming. If you want to learn to program, and that includes any language, then start with this book. The fundamentals that you learn from this book can be utilized for any programming language you wish to learn in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly Padded","review":"It is not that the author doesn't know his subject -- the trouble with this book is that fouyr-fifths is padding. There are unbelievable questions from imaginary students, internal thinking of the teacher, and endless dopey conversations. All of the padding is no help, and blows the book up to 774 pages from a useful 150. The claim is that the book is for absolute beginners, but unless your idea is beginning by reading conversations that never did and never will take place, buy something shorter and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Instructional Book I've ever read!","review":"If you are new to programming or Visual Basic, this book is this place to start. John Smileys approach to teaching Visual Basic makes learning to program seem almost effortless. The classroom setting of the book does actually give the \\"feel\\" of being instucted in a classroom! The questions the students in the book \\"asked\\" were more times than not the ones I would have asked. I also liked the fact that the book just did'nt dive into coding but instead covers the entire process of creating a real-world application from design to implementation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book a non-programmer needs to get started in VB","review":"I went through several different books that claimed they would teach me VB prior to reading this one. None of them did much more than confuse me, as they assumed knowledge that I didn't have. John Smiley's approach to this book is quite simply, spectacular. The instruction reads like a novel set in his classroom, and the students ask every stupid question that pops into your head while trying to grip the lesson. This approach makes the reader feel like maybe he can learn this, and makes it fun. I wish John Smiley would write a book on Java!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a WASTE!!!","review":"This book is not worth the paper it is printed on.Its information value is ZERO.Looks like all those 5 stars reviews are written either by people, who try to convince themselves that they did not throw away their money, or by Smiley's students for extra credit.It is written by a charlatan.DO NOT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning VB6, but not just....","review":"I am not aware of any other author using Mr. Smiley's teaching technique, at least in medical textbooks. I was so impressed by it that I am not sure if I am learning VB6, or concentrating in capturing the didactic tools he uses, in order to apply them in medical teaching. It's an extraordinary approach to explain difficult subjects (that do not lack in my specialty). And of course, the \\"feeling\\" and understanding I am getting of VB6 I didn't get from any other book about the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, though falls short on topics that pros employ","review":"As the book says, learning to program Visual Basic 6 with this book is easy. The \\"in the classroom\\" method that Smiley employs teaches the reader a lot of aspects to VB programming. Though, as a C/C++ programmer, the book has a lot to be desired. I'll guaratee that it can teach any beginner how to program VB (I read this in one week). If you want to expand farther, you may need to buy more advanced books since it stops short from using advanced techniques like database access (ADO), combo boxes, pull down menus, paint commands, etc. Though overall, the book achieves what it promises and that's why I give it 5 stars. If you want more out of this book, you may have to look elsewhere, though none would be easier than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it -- Very Readable","review":"This is probably the best book I have seen for entry level VB programming. It offers solid background information before presenting a topic, which is then followed by meaningful examples. The project in the book is a good practical application of the techniques presented. Many books designed to present material at this level are often too dry, but not this one. The classroom style in this book allows common questions to be asked and answered in a very readable style. I am currently reading both of Professor Smiley's other books as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found this book to be very easy to work with.","review":"Being a main frame programmer for years, learning to program VB6 was having to have a change in thinking. I found this book and it's narrative approach very easy to make the transition. I was really impressed that when emailing Mr. Smiley with a question he responded right away. I would suggest that anyone that wants a straight forward approach to learning VB6 to try this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book! A Must Buy!","review":"I really did not like all the classroom talk of the book and to me it was a waste of reading. That's the only reason I give it 4 star and not 5 star. But despite this I have found this to be a excellent book to learn VB6. I understood everything the author was saying and the content is superb. You will need more than a couple of books to learn Visual Basic 6 - just make sure this book is one of them. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We ALL have an inner brat!","review":"This book was great. If you have problems with self-discipline, in any area of your life, this book is for you. Not only is it helpful, it is interesting. The world, in general, seems to be getting \\"brattier\\". This book offers great insight to explain how and why this is happening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Basic","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer who said \\"The author scratches surfaces, without really covering anything in any depth.\\" This book is more of a beach-read. Lots of fluff and very little depth. You can find most information just by doing an internet search."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource!","review":"I really enjoyed this book and its insights into the norms and mores of the time when Jesus walked the earth. Being American, most of the material regarding everyday life in the Middle East at that time is somewhat foreign to me, my way of thinking and my upbringing. This book will help clear up difficulties encountered in the Gospels in the areas of: honor and shame, individual versus group, social status, kinship and marriage and what is considered clean and unclean. It is written in a relaxed, easy style and is a great resource for studying the life and times of Jesus. I have made room for this fine work on my shelves so that it will be at my fingertips when I need a first century reality check. -- Moza"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"This is the best album out of all David Foster's album. Very romantic song. Tend to be a bit sad, though. Recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love at Second Sight not included. BIG MISTAKE!","review":"This album can be called a re-released from David Foster's first album with the same title. Most songs are instrumental and IMHO his best work ever. Originally only released and distributed in Japan, this album included all songs except Love At Second Sight (duet with Vikki Moss). This song has a remarkable tune. Perhaps his best composition and arrangement. Very differ than all his later works with vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too bad.., satisfactory , just okay","review":"... whats the difference between the new and old version of this album?

Guess what! Foods get stuck to this pan so easily, I would have thrown it away if it was a cheap one. I wouldn't recommend it to others. I've been using this for two months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and informative.","review":"I really like this helpful/hintful book. Many books of this type are arcane in nature or full of *hints* that most everybody knows by now. However, this book is worth twice the price. This well written and organized book lets you be creative with Windows 9x, but, helps trouble shoot as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have !","review":"This is an incredible book. I have a gateway with XP home edition now but, with this book I turned my sorry Compaq with 98SE on it into an actuall computer. I cant say enough about this book. If you have windows 98 and you want it a lot better, buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice shape, smooth action, great build quality","review":"Bought a whole bunch of these to replace aging handles for the downstairs of my house. I love the shape of these handles and the smoothness of the action. Happy with quality and finish too. Would recommend if you like the oval shape vs round."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packing problems--cheated on weight","review":"The product is good--I have had three orders so far. The problem is with the manufacturer's credibility. One box was much lighter when I picked it up even though it was closed when I examined it. It was about 200g instead of 500g with sugar cubes freely moving on a bottom of the box. I have no idea what happened and it is impossible to report it to Amazon--missing links, circular instruction, no phone numbers, no customer support links. The buttons on most pages, even on Returns page are \\"Continue Shopping\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price Gouging","review":"I started buying these about 6 years ago, the price was always around $4 a box. Now they want over $6!! My most recent order was early in 2011, and it will be my LAST. There are plenty of other Demerara sugar brands out there selling for far less. Save your hard earned money and buy one of those brands. Paying $2 more per box just to have square cubes is insane in this economy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sugar Cubes","review":"I've been ordering this quite a bit - always a good product.

I decided to judge the DVD by it's cover and while it looked like it would be awesomely cheesy, it wasn't. It was just weird and kinda boring.

I wouldn't waste my time with this if i were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"amusement","review":"Just poor quality and I just didn't like it.Really couldn't pay attention because it was terrible, awful movie I wouldn't recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original cover of the film: Amusement","review":"This is the original cover of the film: Amusement. This cover is the one with the clown verses the newer one with Kathryn's face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great actresses, sub-par material...","review":"This is a slick production with three actresses who deserve a better film. The villain is fairly benign and doesn't incite fear in the viewer. Distinguished only by his evil laugh, there is nothing that is terribly frightening about him. However, strong production value and the filmmakers' sense of style and plotting lend itself to this entertaining flick, even though there are many plot holes and incongruous scenes. Check it out if you want a movie to burn an hour and a half of your time. But don't expect a brilliant piece of horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haha, it's funny right?...","review":"A great movie to just sit back and don't think about much and put yourself in the movie and you'll find that the past 80 some odd minutes was well spent. You won't be sorry for watching this...creepy, suspenseful, with just enough blood for the average horror fan. A great movie, a little pricey still, but find it on sale or at a good price and I recommend a good watch...Amusement, it's funny right???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"What a yawn this movie is! A total bore!Is this supposed to be a horror movie? A thriller?Don't be fooled by the cover art on the DVD cover.All the serial killer does is laugh like a lunatic anddons makeup to fool his victims. No suspense, nothingthat can match other horror movies.The plot drags on and on like a long-winded afternoon soap opera.Made me sleepy during the first 30 mins!Let me reveal how it all ends so that you can save timewatching this DVD:Only 1 kidnapped female victim survives.The blonde pokes the male serial killer with his own weaponwhen he tries to peep at her.End of story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good - in select parts","review":"I'm a firm believer that a movie does not have to be gauged by the sum of its parts. An absolutely incredible scene alone can make a movie for me. With the DVD, we can enjoy just that scene and move onto the next movie to avoid the ennui. That said, there is a clown scene in this movie that is very well done. It parallels the infamous Poltergeist clown scene to some degree, but takes on a great life of its own. If you enjoy horror, and let yourself be scared, this scene will certainly do it for you. The rest of the movie is pretty good though; some neat twists and generally spooky atmosphere make the entire movie a fun watch. And the Blu-ray is high quality, worth the spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afraid of clowns?","review":"This film started off with a wholoe new approach I'd never seen before, and I liked it. It took the story of all three girls in depth, and the villan in the film made the tactics dreadful.The highway scene with the character Shelby had a great twist-turn at the end when you find out about the trucker.The house scene with Tabitha kept me at the edge of my seat- I absolutly hate - really hate! - clowns. You kind of knew what was going to happen with the clown dummy sitting in the rocker, but I could still imagine that happening to any new babysitter.The sequence where it introduced Lisa seemed to take to long to get to the end and to the capture, but it was still creepy.As for the end, I think that the writer could have made it more revealing about what actually happened to the little boy, but it seemed to be too sloppy.Overall: the beginning was great, the middle was pretty good, and the end could've used some work.I would still recommend"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover drew me in but the film didn't deliver","review":"This movie is not about killer clowns! I like those type movies and thats why I bought this. I then thought it would be like saw, which I do not like those, but it was not 100% like that, it is about a killer who kill the people whom made fun of him as a child. The first scenes with the Car/Convoy was good, and the part with the Clown/Baby sitter (although done before) was good, but the rest was just ok. One thing i will say is that the scene where the women are tied up and spread open I said to myself 'ok,this is ridiculous, but then I got a cool surprise' ! 2.5 / 5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT TOO BAD, SCARY CLOWN, KATHERYN WINNICK IS GORGEOUS!!:)","review":"I LOVE CANADIAN ACTRESSES!!

All four of my boys have loved this book, especially between ages 5-9. The illustrations are super real, and the popups are cleverly engineered in descending layers of a sandwich. My boys love to squeal at each disgusting tiny vermin that has been added to the sandwich Sam is making for his annoying sis. We have Sam's Snack, and Sam's Cake, also, but this is our favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny book","review":"I remember this book from when I was little and liked the details of how Sam tricked his sister with the sandwich.

The book was one of my son's favorites when he was a child. The sellers description let me know it was the exact book I had for my children. It arrived in perfect condition. I wish the seller had had more than one as I would have like to have gotten two more additional books for when my other two children have children of their own. A great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam's Sandwich","review":"This is a GREAT read aloud story for elementary age kids. It teaches rhyming, prediction, advanced vocabulary, etc... I attended a Readers Workshop for struggling readers a couple years ago and they showed us how to shred some paper in your hands before you read the story and at the end, after you've \\"unfolded\\" the story, pretend to take a bite. After a few chews, cough into your hand blowing shredded paper all over the kids. I wasn't sure how that would go over on a live audience so I tried it out on my son's 4th grade class... They LOVED it and asked me to do it again! I ordered this book to present to the teacher and class ~ the kids will be able to take it home and share it with their families.

Simon Kirke and Andy Fraser hold down a brisk rhythm section, Paul Kossoff nudges forth the kind of tightly-wound blues licks for which he became legend, and vocalist Paul Rodgers matures from the band's promising but somewhat nervous debut (\\"Tobs of Sobs\\") into a strong front man with genuine command of his material. In retrospect, it was a warm-up for their biggest success, but taken in its own right, \\"Free\\" was a bright keeper, though the occasionally weak recording docks a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"The latest Tooth and Nail hype machine is Neon Horse, another so-called mystery band where people don't know who the members of the band is. Those into Stavesacre will immediately recognize Mark Salomon as 1/2 of the vocal duo. And it isn't too hard to imagine Jason Martin of Starflyer 59 doing guitars. Beyond that things are a bit murkier, member wise.The music is fairly rock and roll, throwing back to the hey-dey of rock music. However, rather than being a simple clone (unlike a fair number of the current throwbacks), Neon Horse is captivating for the simple reason that the choruses are huge. Salomon's voice is gripping in this role and context.The album feels a bit short and could have stretched some of the songs out farther, in my opinion. However, it is definitely worthwhile picking up for the music, and not simply as an acknowledgment of the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Granted, this album may be an acquired taste for some, but it is very well done. The vocals might put off some people too, but give 'em a chance! I was iffy at first but this band quickly rose to my top four favorites. Definitely worth it.

It's hard telling the female leads apart since they all looked alike, it's hard finding out what era the first segment is taking place in. It's not even close to scary, the coolest thing about the DVD is the menu art and box art. Everything was so predicable, and oh, did I mention confusing?This movie was given to me by my friend who didn't even want it on his shelf in his house.

I mean they don't sound like Blink 182, Fenix TX, they don't sound like the other pop rock or whatever. But this is not Punk. This doesn't really sound like rock music to me. Reading the lyrics, it's kind of a sappy, heart ache feeling. I thought there would be other things to sing about than love and all that. At least Blink 182 and Fenix TX expand themselves and don't just sing about \\"girls.\\" Jordan's voice is alright - just different. But every song sounds like you could insert into a book of depressing teenage poetry. A New Found Glory could be a borderline boy band. Anyways, I'm not cutting them up I just don't prefer this emo to other punk. If you're a female and you want to shed tears get it. If you're a guy, pretend you're Jordan and all the chicks want you.

I suggest picking up this album, and if possible find their website cause it rocks! I can't really compare them to any other band specifically.

Very rad band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain good music. A must album for any real punk fan!","review":"Forget about what the critics say with their big words about this album. As a musician and a hardcore fan of punk/emo I would say that Nothing Gold Can Stay is just plain good music. Not all the songs are the greatest, but most of them are really good. In my opinion this is NFGs best album. Their new self-titled album has a lot of talent in it, but I wouldn't recommend it cause most of the bands new stuff is pretty poppy and is sounding like sell-out material."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the best I have heard but still pretty good","review":"I got this cd just the other day and I think it is an ok cd. Hit or miss is simply the best song that I have ever heard. 2s and 3s and 3rd and long are good too but all the other songs sound exactly alike. some songs I thought were the same track. the good thing is that the song that they all sound like is a extreamly great song. so in conclusion 1 star for hit or miss, 1 star for 2s and 3s, 1 star for 3rd and long, and 1 for all the rest"},{"rating":"2","title":"the wait was worth it","review":"after 30 years Dollar$ has made it to CD and the wait was worth it.

That missing information was noticable in its absence from the fold-out CD poster/notes. Cute idea for an art department, but woefully lacking details that us fans like to have. Anyway, as for the music, most of is very entertaining. I love the two vocal cuts with Little Richard gleefully belting his heart away; \\"Money Is\\" and \\"Do it to it.\\" Powerful stuff. Plus, most of the instrumental passages by Quincy are very well composed and played. I particularly like Doug (\\"The Ragin' Cajun\\") Kershaw's fiddle contribution on one track. Less successful, I thought, was Robert Flack singing that tired old tune \\"When You're Smiling.\\" Just not my cup of tea. Fairly short album in length (and nothing in the way of bonus cuts or unreleased material to pad this CD reissue) but still a very interesting recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Source For Scanpan Accessories","review":"Great service, Price & very fast delivery.

Ned Beatty turns in a decent performance as the prosecuting attorney, but nothing else about this movie makes any sense. The plot is convoluted and silly, the writing is poor, and Theresa Russell is beautiful but unconvincing. The role of the obviously framed cop could have been played by anyone, and Burt Reynolds phones in his performance from another planet. There is no suspense, no urgency. Reynolds doesn't seem to care that he is about to be convicted for a crime he didn't committed; for that matter, no one else does either.What is amazing is that this totally forgettable dreck made it to DVD, whereas Russell's much better performance in \\"Impulse\\" remains only on VHS."},{"rating":"1","title":"burt scores as a set-up cop,but this turkey needs more help","review":"i have to say i think burt looks good here and is very good as the hard drinking cop,it's just that the rest of the movie is so bad that burt's acting gets lost!a sleeze ball crook is found dead(in a most origanl way,the only other good thing in the movie) and everything points to burt. theresa russell(lost and very poor as a lawyer) takes his case and they set out to find the killer. michael crichton directs this mess with out any real fire except for the opening scenes. and yet another nail in the coffin of burt's career!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dressage arena, yeah right","review":"Do not buy this book if you are looking for ideas concerning dressage arena construction. It is ridiculous that \\"dressage arenas\\" is in the title. In a 71 page book, five pages involve dressage arenas. Most of that space discusses measuring out an arena. I was looking for a serious discussion about the constuction options available: wood, pvc, temporary, portable, etc. Our riding club needs to replace the barrier on two sand rings this year.

This book explains very clearly what equipment is needed, what supplies to buy, construction details, and dimensions of each component of a jump. It has clear photos and excellent line drawings. The weak points of the book is that it does not explain what design details makes a jump safe or inviting. It is also vague on color choices that are tradtional for hunter and jumper jumps. The author does mention in the back of the book what books to go to for additional information though. As a basic reference it is terrific and money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"We recently purchased this book to help us make jumps for our pasture. Initially, it looks and sounds great. The shopping lists are great also. However,the instructions for cutting and constructing most of the jumps are very vague, ie, \\"cut 2x4's to size.\\" There would be no mention of angles or length and sometimes the picture does not match what is happening in the instructions. Plan on doing a lot of figuring out as you go. It would be helpful if angles were specified and more detailed correct sketches were given. Also, sometimes the jump would be listed as a 2 foot jump, but the picture is 2'6\\" and the instructions weren't clear. Some of the jumps, especially the brush box, for safety, needs to be able to be tipped over and the feet required reworking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with purchase","review":"I purchased this item based on the description that it was \\"Vinyl\\".

Having lived/worked in Manahattan I can appreciate the size of the Twin Towers and what Mr. Petit was able to overcome to perform his highwire act. Amazing. Also a great tribute to the Twin Towers now that they have been brought down. A wonderful reading book.

What an appealing person Petit is! Daring, ingenious, and courageous to an insane degree, he pulled off the greatest feat of street theater in the history of the world. He makes the phrase 'the impossible dream' stand up and dance. What I didn't appreciate until I read this book was what a fine engineering coup it was - all the rigging done clandestinely in the dead of night, so that at first light he was ready to step into the air.And what a nail biting read! He re-creates the months long drama, keeping you right there with him all the way to the exhilarating end. What I also wasn't prepared for was how agile and graceful a writer he is and what a benevolent, endearing spirit.You think you're facing a daunting challenge? Read this book and put yours into perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highwire Artist Tells All.......","review":"This book captures the tension and excitement of an event that took the world by surprise.

Filled with good photos and illustrations...Petit spells out the whole process of what went into the 6 months of planning and preparation that culminated in the incredible WTC walk. At times we sense a bit of his ego but it is tempered with charm and fearlessness of making a dream come true..In this time of possibe war it is refreshing to read about someone who has dreams and makes them not only come true but also makes history."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring, and intimate","review":"mr. petit's memoirs of his high wire walkwas, for me, an escape to a place where dreams do come true........by inviting me on his journey, through his mind, and ultimately across the wire,he has reminded me about the preciousness of time,the beauty of detail and the rewards ofpassion.thank you mr petit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping stuff!!","review":"I have just finished reading this book.

This book is the best sort of 'caper' account: although the reader knows the ending, the writing style and personality of the author are so engaging that it is completely engrossing. I don't know what reviewer RRiis has against Petit (it sounds personal to me...) but his/hers is the only review I've seen (among dozens published) that is negative. Petit is a gifted writer, and this book is a wonderful gift. DON'T MISS IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre fighting movie","review":"A friend told me about this movie and how good the fighting is in it. The fighting is ok, it is the dialogue and the story that isn't. The movie overall is just lame, there are only a few scenes that are decent but other than that I found it hard to watch. I can see if your into this sport how you might like the film. But if your just watching it for watching it, you might not like it. The movie is almost like a combination of a bad JCVD or Seagul movie. Bad acting, bad story, fighting 3/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dino Dig","review":"Santa got this for our 7 year old daughter who loves dinosaurs. While the concept is essentially the same as the game \\"Battleship\\", it is actually more strategically involved than that as the fossil points you have to find aren't lined up like a battleship. So it is actually harder. We'll see how she catches on but it is going to take some time. Otherwise, great game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pop gem sleeper. Absolutely and simply stunning!","review":"I was absolutely stunned by brilliance of Baaba Maal's unheralded single. This single genuinely deserved much more airplay than it got. Without question, it deserves to be ranked among the top 25 singles released in 1999. From the joyous, uplifting, Afro-Caribean beat of the opening radio mix to the hauntingly beautiful, ambient treatment by Fila Brazilia (one of my favorite smooth cuts of all time), the EP shines like a rare diamond amidst the rough of most of the pop single offerings. All five mixes are eminently danceable. Especially notable are the dub-heavy, jazz-tinged Thievery mix and the beautifully ethereal Fila Brazilia reconstruction. And don't forget the sultry and soothing female sub-vocals at the intro and conclusion of the wonderful afrobeat radio mix! Do yourself a favor - treat yourself to this single. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"hidden humor","review":"While searching for new work by DB I came across a trailer for this movie.

Then I read all the other reviews and reconsidered. Editors often pan movies I end up liking, so I thought I'd try it. I'm actually somewhat surprised that I didn't just give up halfway through. This movie was terrible. The plot was idiotic, the three girls annoying, and it wasn't worth watching even to just see David on the screen. Go with the editor's review and stay away - especially if your a Boreanaz fan! What bet did he lose to be forced to do this role?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea: I think yes, I need more","review":"Overall a surprisingly funny movie that I did not expect, especially with the cheesy opening credits and relatively unknown cast in a Canadian film.The story follows three high school friends, during their last summer before going off to college or other adventures. Enter stage left, the local hot married guy who they all end up bedding. And well, things get sort of complicated.And yes, if you like David Boreanaz, you do get an ass shot, though he is not naked the entire film, contrary to misleading rumors. David did a good job with this part as well, and wasn't just a pretty face.The story was different, good writing, excellent comedy, and acting. Throw in some nice directing and viola, a good movie!All and all, I was impressed. A good movie from the kanucks, no less!I would totally buy this for my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential read to understand the world airline industry","review":"Robert Daley has written a concise and captivating history of Juan Trippe and PanAm, and in the process explained much of the world airline industry development and the colorful context of new commercial airplane launches.I knew much of this history be have never seen it encapsulated in such an entertaining way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"A very informative and complete description of the emergence of Pan American Airline, and it's aircraft, along with it's place in world history.

His vision of the ins and outs of building a transportation empire thru his use of seaplanes and his skill to perceive the perfect solutions to all the problems facing the early aviation pioneering was so mastering to witness thru the reading by the author. Highly recommend this book to really understand the perils of flying during that era of flight and the solutions to overcome them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Story","review":"I bought this just to read about the Clippers, but the story of Juan Tippe and how he created Pan Am is amazing reading. He had an incredible mind, and a lot of aviation innovation we take for granted sprung from his ideas and the people he brought around him. I always associated Lindbergh with TWA, but his association with PanAm was enduring. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested commercial aviation, or anyone who wants to read about a true pioneer and a brilliant business mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gran calidad en su tipo","review":"Samsung me sorprende con esta maquina, pues reune caracter��sticas ��ptimas para un modelo de camara digital para no profesionales, siendo muy f��cil de usar y con calidad de imagenes y video acorde al precio.

This tycoon game had nice graphics and music (when we found a computer that had an adequately equipped video card) but that was about it for positive qualities. The manual is horrible, the online tutorial is useless, and gameplay is not intuitive when it comes to figuring out what the player should be doing as far as building and the business end of running an airport. The money runs out way too fast and the contracts come in way too slow - not a lot of action or fun. One of my biggest pet peeves about this program is that there are spelling and grammar errors throughout the program. It is almost like the person who wrote it doesn't speak English as his/her first language. Not a good example for kids unless you want to teach them how NOT to check their work...This is one tycoon game I would suggest avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some promise, needs to be improved","review":"I LOVED the original Airport Tycoon and got hooked on it.

The graphics are decent, and a lot of problems with Airport Tycoon 2 (i.e. lack of terminal interiors) were fixed. But some things leave a lot to be desired. For one thing, where are the security areas in the terminal? You can't build your own custom terminals. And China Int'l serving Chicago to Indianapolis?????

It could be an amazing game, but it is impossible to play. First, when building a new airport the camera angle is soooooooooooo bad that you will never even be able to see what your building.

He choose Airport Tycoon 3. I must say, compared to Zoo Tycoon, this game is just plain boring! He kept at it, and needed a lot of help from me to even figure it out, and finally built himself a thriving airport, but there really is no action. I'm not sure what age bracket they are targeting, because it's not fun for kids, and I myself wouldn't bother with it.In addition to this game, he got Sim City 3000 which he is now addicted to.

The dialogs between characters are pitiful and the movement and control of the character and objects is too complicated to make it fun. If you like a challenge then you might like this, but if you just like to have fun (like with CSI) then it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Not one for many words, but bottom line an excellent book. Well written, and gives a very clear portrayal of DOwns' unit. Men like him deserve the utmost respect. And in my eyes he was a true hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening account of the Vietnam War","review":"I read this book quite some time ago, not long after I had the pleasure of meeting the author at a school function on the Vietnam War. I have been fascinated by the Vietnam War ever since meeting the author (who happened to grow up in my hometown). I found the book eye-opening and easy to read, especially for those of us who do not have a military background. I felt his platoon's pain, as well as their excitement. All in all, what this man, and thousands like him went through is something that each American should appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!!","review":"The book was very detailed!! The author really tries to give you a deep sense of understanding of the situation he was in and what he was there to do. The very beginning of the book is a little upsetting, knowing how the public treated him upon his return. I really liked the book! Good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"Once I started reading this book I couldn't stop, the author really makes you feel as though you are right there with him.

A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make you understand","review":"Very good reading of what the Nam war was like and the people that were in it facing the real thing"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"This book is very good. I'm trying to learn about vietnam, as the son and nephew (x2!) of nam vets. Written well, relatively mild (e.g., relative to Rumor of War) but not at all subdued imagery. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tells It Like It Was.....","review":"An outstanding story of a young Army lieutenant who pretty much saw it all. And in less than six months. From the time he arrived, through his harrowing and agonizing encounters with Charlie, he tells it like it was. Anyone can write war fiction, but he was there. He wrote it as only a true vet could write it. You could feel his relief, after surviving a horrible fire fight. You could feel his joy when he was on a 3-day pass. And you could feel his pain when he was nearly blown to pieces by what every 'Nam vet knows of - a bouncing betty.Cinch your helmet, grab your web gear, lock and load, and prepare for Viet Nam the way it was. I was there too. As we used to say, \\"there it is.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GatorOne","review":"I have never and likely will never know the experience of combat. I read personal accounts of our veterans to gain perspective on what they have done for us. Some of the most trying situations lead me to wonder, \\"What would I do?\\" It happened over and over for me in this book. The author is faced with the responsibility of leading and protecting men, as well as making decisions to fire upon seemingly innocent civilians that are actually a threat to his men or other americans. One of the best, and most humble accounts I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"no limits, no censorship","review":"Its a simple, yet eloquent book. Its beginning is a little slow, but makes up for it throughout the book. The stories throught the book give the chilling details and dont hold any punches. You want a short version of Vietnam and its realities, read this book. If not, then read it anyway. Good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book very much.","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was well written and well worth reading in the context of the world in 2010 and the current conflicts around the globe. I have not been in the military myself, but I felt like it was portraying the thoughts and emotions of joining the service, training, and serving fairly and accurately as far as I could tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a terrific read !","review":"If you're interested in getting an idea of what a typical army officer's life in an operational area was like ..... read this book. The descriptions by the author are incredible especially those of his own experiences. His injuries and efforts to overcome adversity are edifying. THIS is an interesting book"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent account of a soldier in NAM","review":"This is my second book on Vietnam War and it worth it. I know that very young people fought this war, but it still surprise me the age of this lieutenant, in charged of many lives. Reading the day to day living, you realize the reasons why USA didn't win this war.I was delighted with this book because it gave a glimpse of military strategy, leadership and the true reality when you have to fight for your life and the lives of your group. You become aware that, despite the excellent skills as a soldier that someone might have, there is always a considerable percentage that is just lottery, whether you become a wounded or death man (peanut)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood / Guts","review":"I couldn't wait until I finished this boring book on His bio of the war.Tho I'm sure he experienced all those conditions.I came away disappointed in the story.Where were all the enemy snipers ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"this book is not exciting at all.

The author, a green Lieutenant, takes charge in Vietnam, and is candid, revealing just how innocent and trusting he was. It is difficult to read because of all the (I apologize) foolish things he does as a leader. If you are used to reading combat books, where the author is savvy and tough, this read will set you back a bit. It is sobering, for the reasons pointed to above."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are much, much better","review":"I am quite frankly shocked that this account has reached a 4.5 star rating. Boring narrative, lacking any vividness or insight harnessed by other writers in this genre, makes this an especially ordinary read.If you want to read amazing Vietnam War novels (both fiction and non-fiction), begin with:1.Close Quarters: A NovelLarry Heinemann2.Dispatches.

It is one of the most beautiful watches that I have seen for a man, and he always received compliments on it. However, 10 months into owning it, there were serious cracks on the underside of the band on both sides simply from forming it around his wrist to wear. This resulted in the rubber on the band snapping and making it totally unwearable. I called the Invicta corporate office in FL and found out that there is NO warranty on the band, and that it would cost $57 to replace the band, which includes flat rate shipping. Also, it could take up to 90 days to replace, which is not a big deal, but I thought I would disclose that too. This is my husbands favorite watch, but it makes no sense to replace a band with no warranty that couldn't last for a year with normal wear."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is excellent.","review":"I have been a fan of Rahsaan's since the first CD dropped, and I have to admit that Love In Stereo lives up to, and exceeds my expectations. With each lyric sung, you can hear Rahsaan's passion. Passion for his music, for his subject matter, and the art in general. He has a unique style that is evident in his poetic lyricism, and apt vocal abilities. Talent like his is NOT-OF-THIS-WORLD. I am glad he decided to share it with us anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent CD!","review":"This is an excellent CD. Lyrically, it's some of the best stuff I've heard in years.

I love every last cut on here including,\\"It Ain't Love\\". For years I pondered the idea of getting into the recording business, because of the lack of grooves that aren't being touched by alot of artist. And somehow, I feel like Rahsaan has been eavesdropping in on my brain and using these grooves and vibes that only I can visualize. And \\"It Ain't Love\\",\\"So Right\\" and \\"Any Other Love\\" are perfect example of brain vibing. This album is a masterpiece and anyone with a good ear for soul music must pick it up. \\"It's Alright Now\\" should be reason enough. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Alright Now!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Thank you Rahsaan Pattersonand Randy Jackson for producing this extraordinary CD of Love InStereo.I have been eagerly anticipating this release from the phenominal RahsaanPatterson.I can truly say \\"it's alright now\\".Thank you for returning with the blazing cuts that I have grown accustomed to hearingfrom you.Rahsaan Patterson's sophmore release is as good, if not better than his last CD. This CD is laced with hits.I love track numbers 2,3,4,5....,well all of them, really.I do have to say that my all time favorite is track number 11,Any Other Love,OHHHEEEE. This song reminds me of the '70's.With it's strong lyrics and instruments blaring.The bridge has an \\"Earth,Wind,and Fire'esque\\"kind of feel to it.Thank you Mr.Patterson for reminding us what real music ought to sound like.

Rahsaan sings with a soulful sound that many artist today just do not have. Each song is different and you can tell by listening he put his heart and soul into each note and each word. I have not taken this CD out of my player yet. Keep your eye on Rahsaan because he's about to blow up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Slept On - Hands Down!!!","review":"It is funny that I once saw Rahsaan Patterson opening for Meshell Ndegeocello at the Metro in Chicago, because these are two of the most slept on artist in the music industry. \\"Love In Stereo\\" is one of the greatest albums I have heard in who knows how long. Rahsaan is an exceptionally talented singer, songwriter, and performer. I've been spreading the word on this brother since his debut album and have not stopped. I just cannot believe all the nodding that's going on out there. Everyone that I play this album for falls in love with it. I have hooked so many heads to Rahsaan and will continue to. It just doesn't get any better than Mr. Patterson. The vocals, instrumentation, production, everything is TIGHT!!! You must purchase this CD as well as his first one. Also get your hands on his cover of the Crusaders' classic \\"Streetlife\\" from the \\"Hoodlum\\" soundtrack and \\"So Hot\\" from the \\"Two Can Play That Game\\" soundtrack. Rahsaan is the hit that won't quit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love in Stereo","review":"I was floored by this cd and angry that I had heard NOTHING about this talented man until I was checking out cds on Amazon and saw so many positive comments about his music.I finally bought both his first cd and this one (haven't gotten to the first one since this one is in continuous play) but I can't understand how the music industry hypes non-talented pretty boys/girls who scream well while creating absolutely no buzz about truly talented soulful singers.I'm not trying to influence anybody but if you like r&b;/soul music, you must have this disc in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Rah!","review":"Rahsaan Patterson, to me, is one of the most underrated male vocalists out there. I took a chance in 1997 and purchased his first album. The result: pure satisfaction! If you haven't purchased the first album, go and cop it now! His follow-up album Love In Stereo, offers more of the same vocal abilities as well as his funk-based rhythms that the first album produced. Songs #11,10, and 8 are sure to get you open. Rahsaan's albums are phat! He deserves to be up there ranking with Maxwell and D'Angelo for real!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazzy...","review":"Soulful, pop, rock and more rolled up into one. There is nothing more I can say about Rahsaan Patterson's work other than if you don't have his CD's you are missing out on some great music. Ten stars, change the rating system.M.Cobbs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Millenium Soul","review":"Love in Stereo might be ideal for that \\"put-on-a-hot-soul-track-and-she's-mine\\" ploy, but Rahsaan Patterson is one artist to eschew the hot 'n' sweaty sexual soundtrack trivialization of soul, and give it back some of its original features. A closer listen and a look at the video \\"Treat You Like a Queen\\" reveal his interest in issues of human rights. His activities for the National Association of Abused Women and Children, as well as his non-profit organization \\"Soul Survivors\\" put his money where his music is, smack bang in the Harlem neighbourhood where he grew up. Musically Patterson's sound resembles the laid-back but intense atmosphere of '70s Stevie Wonder records with a tendency, especially in the second half of the album, to gear up to funk and swing. Remarkable also is the cover of The Blow Monkey's '80s hit \\"Diggin' Your Scene\\" on the Japanese edition. By the way Rahsaan celebrated his 27th birthday on January the 1st, 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sophmore Jinx Here","review":"Rahsaan Patterson has laid it done once again with meaningful lyrics and excellent music. He has proven himself to be a quality artist. When the first album came out, I could not get enough of it. Now, I cannot get enough of this one. It's unfortunate that he doesn't get the airplay that he deserves, but then again quality music is rarely played on the radio. Rahsaan Patterson keep up the excellent work. There are those of us who are always waiting for new music from you.

I was rewarded with a great honest r'n'b album and eagerly awaited his follow-up. It doesn't disappoint. While it doesn't have any of the fantastic string arrangements that were a highlight of the first album, it's probably a bit tighter and funkier overall. And while it is steeped in traditional r'n'b, the album avoids an obvious retro feel. Here's an album full of strong songs, well played and well sung. Unfortunately that's not what's fashionable in what passes for r'n'b these days and that, coupled with his record company's apparent unwillingness to promote him, means that Rahsaan Patterson doesn't sell anywhere near the numbers he deserves to."},{"rating":"2","title":"You wont skip a track","review":"Forget everything you've heard this album and his first album are probably,in my opinion, the best soul albums I've heard.Besides the obvious legends of soul music,if you want an album you will listen to over and over again and never get tired of and never have to skip a track,this is it.THE BEST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Important","review":"These plugs are too long for the 97 tercel 5efe motor.

After some research, I found this card and like that it comes with both the standard bracket and the low-profile bracket. You just have to remove the screws where the VGA port is to get the bracket off and put them back in once the other bracket is installed.Another plus is there is no separate video power cable needed for this card you can just pop it in and it goes.The only con at all is it seems to increase my system temperature a bit.

I thought that it might be due to my location, so I tried it from home. There, I got 2 stations.

What I wanted to do was to tune in our wonderful local classical radio station (KQAC) and stream it around the house to my Logitech Squeezebox devices and computers. Linux recognizes the audio part of the device \\"out-of-the-box\\" and there's a simple program available to set the tuning. It took maybe 10 minutes to get it set up such that my Linux server is streaming the radio onto my local network (using darkice and icecast2). Here in Portland, OR radio reception on the device is very good - maybe not quite up to my Denon TU-1500, but vastly superior to the low-bandwidth stream available on the internet. Be aware, the device does have an antenna-port and an included antenna (length of wire) and it *does* make a difference to the reception.I can't speak to the included software since I haven't even tried it out under either Windows or Mac OSX, but for what I wanted it to do, it works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"it might work for you, it might not","review":"the software, the way it looks: great. the reception: awful. major broadcast stations often don't come in at all, and i live in a big city where reception is never a problem. moving the device around, and using its external antenna, you can improve the quality of the signal, but for some stations, no amount of shifting and relocating can deliver sound that is not washed over with static.based on the reviews i've read, in some areas the reception is fine, in others it is terrible. in principle, this is a great little gizmo, but in practice, much depends on your specific location. to sum up, if you want to digitally record radio shows, this could be the right thing, but it might be utterly useless. only buy it if you don't mind risking the hassle of having to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor AM reception","review":"The reception ranges from OK to barely able to listen. 2 other cheap and old clock radios have near perfect reception in the exact same spot.

The only issue I have is am reception, not the fault of shark radio, its just computers, wireless internet, corless phones and all that jazz tend to mess with am frequency reception!

When I contacted tech support they had no encouraging words. Just told me to keep checking their web site. But I fiddled around with it and got it to work. Sort of. The AM reception is poor, at best. FM is OK. But Windows Media Center does not see this device, so you can forget about using it with that.

Every radio I've ever owned can pick up the station well - it's very strong and we are close to the tower. The RadioShark can barely pick it up and there is far too much static to be useful. It works reasonably well for FM, but it is absolutely useless for AM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unacceptable reception","review":"I was hoping to use this for my favorite talk radio station at 570 AM. Reception was completely unacceptable while a battery operated radio in the same spot was completely acceptable. I will be posting a photo soon.

I was not able to receive many stations which are within a 20-30 mile radius. When I did manage to receive stations, the sound quality was below average due to static noise. Overall, the device works for some stations, but for the most part, fails as a radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item works well","review":"I only use it for AM radio, so I can't comment on the FM reception. It receives strong signals well and weaker signals poorly, about equivalent to other radios in the same locations. If the station you want has a good signal where it is located it should be fine.The software works fine w/iTunes and uploads the recorded radio into iTunes and onto an iPod seamlessly.If you want to capture radio that is not broadcast over the internet and listen to it as you would an internet podcast, it should work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"RadioShark2","review":"Product does not work with Windows Vista.

However, as others have noted, the AM reception is essentially nonexistent, for both the \\"1\\" and the \\"2\\". The device might work if the radio station's commercial antenna were poking in your window and zapping this thing directly with a few thousand watts, maybe making it glow a bit. But not otherwise.

There are two Glorias - the better known RV589 and the RV562, both beautifully performed, Salve Regina RV 616 and Stabat Mater RY621, and two Concertos - RV581 and part of RV562.

Her accounts of those she interviewed as well those she felt benefitted from Yale's secret society is nothing new to many of us. I felt she had not broken through the \\"wall of confidentiality\\" from those she interviewed. That is why she spent so much time on boring history from the 1700-1800's and William Russell and his admiration of a German secret society. What makes me laugh the most about Robbin's accounts of the Skull and Bones is, as a Yale graduate and member of a secret society herself, she has benefitted from Yale's elitist entitlement to power and prestige.

Robbins' reportorial skills dig up a trove of insider stories and fascinating anecdotes about the power elite.

This book, however, was useless. It was endlessly boring and gave very little new insight. Like one reviewer mentioned, she just barely scratched the surface and she seemed to have no interest in delving any deeper.Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash, verbose trash at that.","review":"This book promises to unearth the secrets of on of the most well known of secret society. Instead it mentions rumors, causally glances over facts, and quotes a few uninteresting sources. All of this is delivered with the air of a policeman at a crime scene muttering \\"Nothing to see here, move along, move along.\\" The only true \`facts' consist of very long detailed connections between the members of Skull and Bones and their careers. There is an entire chapter devoted to George W and his business investments, ending with dollar amounts donated to his presidential campaign by other SaB members. At the end of over 208 pages of dull writing, punctuated with endless quotes from Yale journals in the 1800s, you are left with only one amazing fact.Naples Pizza has a dance floor? Stunning!And now I'm left with one additional mystery. Why did I waste my time reading this book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Reading","review":"Alexandra Robbins has written an excellent primer on the lore behind one of the legendary secret societies of Yale. It ought to be required reading for the entering Freshman class as well as for anyone curious about who some of the boys in the Old Boys' network are. It probably won't satisfy those looking for a grand conspiracy of Illuminati behind the scenes trying to rule the world since it gives a much more plausible explanation of the benefits of being a member of such an organization (mainly networking), but those people are going to believe what they want to believe, no matter how improbable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"The book is incredibly dry, seems she spends more time cutting and pasting sources than actually putting any of her own thoughts into the book. If you want to get the good stuff out of this book, go to the library and read chapters four and five.Avoid reading anything else unless you have nothing but time on your hands. I was very upset that she fails to turn an accusing eye on her own secret society - hypocrite.You can thank me for saving you 15 bucks now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skull and Bones ala Peggy Lee : Is That All There Is?","review":"If Skull and Bones is truly THAT anti-climactic a triumph, why do students want to join? The Club seems a big elite snooze,complete with intellectual hijincks and hi-brow cutting up that only those in-the-know could relish. Even Eulogia would fall asleep enduring the banal revels of the \\"Future Stuffed Shirts of America Club.\\" I finished the book feeling that a lot of REAL inside information MUST have been omitted.I ask you---of Skull and Bones,is that truly ALL THERE IS??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enlightening","review":"While I wasn't looking for this book to reveal major secrets and conspiracies, the cover and introduction lead one to believe that's exactly what would happen. If that's what you're looking for, try looking elsewhere.The author extends hardly more effort in this book than she likely did for term papers at Yale. You can't get through a few pages without long verbatim quotes from other sources, which becomes annoying.Finally, at the end, after dispelling the \\"myth\\" (which she never adequately sets down) of Skull & Bones, she proposes that people believe in it because they \\"need\\" to believe. I found that more than patronizing.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really excited to read this book, especially since the author is from Yale herself. The book reads like a dry dissertation--not very entertaining. Also, it takes forever to get down to what Skull and Bones is all about, first you have to get through a few chapters that deal with secret societies in general. Ultimately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writer","review":"The book spends too much time on the history of Yale. The book is poorly written and goes on to explain the obvious. Skull and Bones is a social club, made up of rich and elite individuals. For some reason they gave the author access that had always been prohibited in the past. Why? To tell their story through the words and name of an anonymous person, not associated with the club. How can I believe what the author is saying when so many others have said different. A cleverly written book may have been more convincing, even with the same thesis. Try other books on the same topic if this stuff interests you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark greatly","review":"If you have always been fascinated by secret societies, then this book is a cheap thrill, as long as you skip through some of the tedious chapters on Yale.Rather than offering substantial insights on Skull and Bones, the author goes on and on about the greatest of Yale itself for \\"context.\\" The author presents a thesis that secret societies are a natural outgrowth of Yale's own tradition in producing great leaders.While I agree that Yale has produced many political leaders (just look at the current Presidential candidates), it has never crossed my mind in my wildest imagination, that somehow Yale was a hotbed for leadership. (Once again, just look at the Presidential candidates.....yes they have been in leadership positions....but can anyone honestly say that they have been \\"great\\" leaders?)Clearly the thesis of the book is a product of a naive, young writer, herself a Yale graduate and Secret Society member, who is too enamored with Yale to provide an objective view."},{"rating":"1","title":"POORLY EDITED","review":"POORLY EDITED. The writer clearly did her research, but, like other reviewers, I ended up skipping whole sections and skimming others, hoping to get the the \\"good stuff.\\" This book could have been a FASCINATING 50-75 pages, but as it stands, it's 208 pages of draft research.Again, not the author's fault. The editor was asleep at the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING HISTORY OF YALE. NO MEAT ON THE BONES","review":"The author is a member of a \\"sister organization\\" to S&B.; How much do you really think she really knows and was allowed to print?Total waste of money unless you want an agonizingly boring lesson on the history of Yale. Wish I had my money back. Sorry I put even a penny in the author's pocket. I feel so duped. I should have known better than to invest in a book like this.

Maureen Charron-Shea, a speech-language pathologist, organized this important project to allow students to have a better understanding about the nature of disabilities. Professionally shot and edited, this DVD features multiple viewpoints and insightful interviews with students who have disabilities. This film forces the viewer to rethink any preconceived notions about disabilities and in the process helps to erase the social stigmas that have long plagued the term \\"disability.\\" The end result is an emphasis on the fact that everyone has challenges, but more importantly everyone has strengths to contribute to the world.

I hate the ditty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do the Ditty","review":"I haven't heard anything off of this cd, but ditty is a classic hip-hop song. Ditty manages to blend the elements of old school rap with elements of zap & roger and more modern rap(Snoop, Dre, the old Death Row sound). The production of Ditty blends everything together in such a way that it manages to produce one sound; I still don't know any of the lyrics and i've heard this song too many times to not know any lyrics. Every hip-hop enthusiast deserves to hear this song, so buy the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked.......","review":"This cd basically was not good rap.....Ditty is pretty good though, but that is the only good trait of this album.

I lost the tape 8=( a few years back and I also lost the tape I had with the \\"Radio re-mix\\" on it. The re-mix was just soooo awesome (one of the few mixes that was even better than the original, better than \\"Ditty\\" if you can believe that).

I was very annoyed & angry that I had gotten them a toy(that was NOT cheap by any means!) that they had so looked forward to and were so disappointed in.If your child just wants the doll for the doll itself, great.

That being said, my daughters' birthdays are coming up, and I thought for sure they'd love to have this product.Unfortunately, it isn't compatible with Mac, so that means neither sets of grandparents can buy it as well as us, and other relatives. So \\"thumbs down\\" to MGA for being so discriminating against Mac users!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is that album","review":"This was the most anticipated album for me ever. I have never looked more foward to a CD than this one. People thought I was crazy how much I wanted this cd and how excited I was to first hear the Retail Date and the single. This CD for me is everything. It gives me songs for any mood I can ever be in.I looked most foward to this CD because of how different I knew it would be. Tonedeff shows a tremendous amount of versatility on this cd, from his singing on Porcelain to his incredible fast rapping on Heavyweightn and Case Closed. To me, he is a true definition of an artist. The CD shows how talented he is when it comes to music. he displays everything you could imagineThis is not a CD where you pop it in and be like \\"wtf is he talkin about\\" This is a CD anybody can relate to and respect.Overall this cd is everything I'd want from a CD. It fills up damn near 70 minutes of great music. Out of the hundreds of CDs I own, this one stays in my cd player and on my MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Hip Hop","review":"If you're looking for an album that actually plays like an album from front to back, \\"Archetype\\" by Tonedeff is a great buy. The ability to have flow throughout an entire album is a lost art and Tonedeff has to be the most underrated artist in hip hop today. He uses many elements from other genres of music such as singing and live orchestration. This album is great not only for hip hop fans but also for music fans in general.Tonedeff truly showcases his talent as an artist and displays what an artist should try and do. That is to push the boundaries and standards in an attempt to bring about something better. As you'll hear from him soon enough, \\"Change is good...it will not kill you.\\" If you want to experience something different (in addition to being amazing music as opposed to being different for the sake of being different) for a change, pick up a copy of \\"Archetype.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Archetype","review":"I feel that Archetype is well worth the wait, it displays how versatile of an artist Tonedeff is, with diverse tracks Archetype doesn't have me ever wanting to push \\"skip\\". Archetype doesn't have \\"fillers\\" and \\"hits\\"; all of the tracks have a message that will inspire you in many ways, whether or not you're getting pumped or contemplating life, you're definately feeling the songs. Archetype is an album you can relate to, with tracks like \\"Gathered\\" and \\"Children\\" I found that I can identify with Tonedeff. There is also something to be said about the DVD Archetexture, it adds another dimension to this already amazing album. Archetype is definately an album I'm proud to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Archetypical Perfection","review":"The title says it all, but I guess I can elaborate. This Album is something that was direly needed in Hip Hop. There will definitely be more albums like this in the future. And I don't mean there will be more \\"Archetypes\\" per say...I mean there will be more Records with the philosophy of this one. If you wanna know the philosophy you'll have to get it. So why are you still reading this....BUY IT ALREADY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only five pounds. Finally a vacuum I can carry!","review":"I love this vacuum. It's lightweight and powerful. Although it cannot replace an upright or a canister, it makes vacuuming everything I used to do with clumsy attachments a breeze. The cord is LONG, and I can get everything from floor to ceiling with the set of lightweight attachments included. I also like the vacuum bag. No more emptying a dirty canister. I'm going 100% Oreck. Next I am buying the upright. After going through four bagless vacuums that weigh too much for me to carry up and down stairs, I'll be using Oreck's six-pound upright. I tried it at a friend's house. It was fantastic! I'll never go back to the other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely thorough and valuable information.","review":"I used this book along with many other books and scholarly articles to complete my doctoral examination. I found O'Donohue's book to be the best among those that I read. Each chapter contains unique and interesting information from some of the foremost researchers on sexual harassment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Better","review":"I anxiously ran out and bought the new CD the day it was released. I have to tell you, I was quite disappointed for the first few listens. What happened to the jumpin' licks from the outstanding first album? It seemed ludicrous to change styles after such a hot debut. A much slowed tempo and TOO MANY LYRICS. But, as I have continued to listen, I am really beginning to like it. Technically, it is very sound. I would still rather listen to these incredibly talented musicians than listen to Scotty sing. So, although it is not on par with their debut CD, it is still worth owning. Here's hoping we will someday be reviewing their 10th or 11th CD. Long Live Swing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Bad Doo-doo, Daddy","review":"This is my first BBVD disc. On a whim, I decided to try out these guys. I've liked some songs from the Brian Setzer Orchestra and Indigo Swing, and especially the Swing songs from the original masters like Duke Ellington and Bennie Goodman.All I can say about this disc is that it just HAS to be some sort of joke. This is some tongue-in-cheek parody, right? Well, actually, it's not even good enough to be good parody. It's just a weak, lifeless, sad attempt at imitating \\"real\\" Swing and jump blues. The lead singer is as dull as they come. Yeesh, avoid this sorry excuse for Swing like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Swing","review":"The group sounds like they've heard a couple of early R&B sides and with a dab of mid '40's New York style Dixieland called themselves a swing band. But they don't swing. As a Rock off shoot they arent bad. But no one should confuse what they are doing with Swing. Swing is what Basie did, What Kenton even did,and Herman and Dizzie and Goodman, etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm quite a fan of big-band swing music, both classic and recent. After their self-titled first album, I considered Big Bad Voodoo Daddy to be among the greatest swing bands of modern times. I'm forced to rethink that by this album. The musical and vocal talent remains, but the fire of their first album is gone. Except for \\"Just Like You,\\" this album feels more like slow jazz than swing. Unless you're a devoted BBVD fan, you're better off buying the first album and waiting for the third."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comparitavly, it's worth no stars","review":"Compared to their first album, BBVD has gone WAY downhill. Morris's vocals are worse than useul, the band has NO music songs (everything is a lyrical rock) and the swing is gone. It's really sad. The only reason I give this the stars it has are because of the three good songs on it (Big and Bad, I'm not sleeping and What's Next) which actually sound a little like swing. Hopefully the boys will pull it together for thier next album and go back to what worked in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dudes what's up?","review":"People please why do you have to go and put these guys down, they rock. You guys have to get out the the mindset that all swing has to be the same. They mix it up a bit, add a little bit of a punk rock edge and it sounds good They make swing fun to blast on your stereo while riding down the road in your car. To be honest I am in a swing band myself, and I can tell you first hand that the swing scene was getting somewhat mondain, and if you ask me Swing needs a good shot in the balls. And these guys are the ones to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indigo Voodoo","review":"The new Big Bad Voodoo Daddy albumn isn't that bad, its actually got some nice tracks. I thought it was sweet with the differnt sorts of songs but that was sort of the problem too, while they retained their sound the music selection.. well sounds like Indigo swing to me, with sort of a balled,rockabilly,fast jump sorta pattern..but i'm not going to put them down i really like this crew, they were great live and still are one of the best out there so let's enjoy \\"This Beautiful Life\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT a DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"I have waited for BBVD's new album for months, and I have never been more disappointed in an album than I was when I listened to this one. I kept waiting for the SWING, the GOOD TIMES which their debut album had. -- Maybe the next song --but no...another dud. Goofball rhymes, odd rhythms, no swing. eeIeeI-oh. Scotty, listen up. You are not a song writer. This album sounds like a huge vanity trip for you, and you haven't earned it yet. Go back to your roots, and put out a real swing album before all is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can only rate as low as one star?","review":"After listening to their first album, I too eagerly awaited their first encore. Could these guys actually top that great first effort? Not! \\"This Beautiful Life\\" is totally flat and devoid of energy -- track after track after ... So if you are a BBVD fan based on their first album, avoid the disappointment. Skip \\"This Beautiful Life\\" and lets hope they can recapture the magic on the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not bad, but it is big.","review":"This CD was great, a nice opening song. I agree with most people on this one, it's difficult to tell which BBVD CD is better. I thought this one was great with the songs Big And Bad, I Wanna Be Like You, I'm Not Sleeping, Who's That Creeping, and Big Time Operator. The only downside of this CD is the last song, #11-Sleep Tight, it's not the horns blaring ending they should have had, but they compensate by adding an unlisted #12, Ol' MacDonald, the another great swing cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Bad Voodoo Daddy not as good second time around.","review":"As a big fan of swing, and of this band, I was very excited to make my purchase. I got the cd, went out to my car, and popped it in. It was downhill from there. I'm sad to say that Big Bad's new release hardly lives up to their first cd, which I think is just awesome. I found only one catchy tune on the new album; Number eight, \\"Big Time Operator,\\" is a pretty good song, but in no way comes close to \\"You and Me...\\" or \\"Mr. Pinstripe Suit.\\". I wanted to love this cd, but instead am pretty disappointed. Maybe this is a sign of things to come, and that swing is dying out... I hope not. Or maybe Scotty and the boys are just having a tough sophomore year."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fantastic Swing CD","review":"Big Bad Voodoo Dads ROCK the house again!! This CD offers fast & slow swings with a small lullabye thrown in. This CD is so good, I think it might even be better than their first! I strongly reccommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"This CD is swingin, but it doesn't match up to the first one. There are too many slow, sappy songs, and they really slow the album down. The songs just aren't up to the quality of a Mr. Pinstripe Suit, Jumpin' Jack or Go Daddy-O. Don't get me wrong, this CD swings. The horn solos are great, Karl's tenor is amazing, and there's more keyboard and guitar solos, but it appears as if BBVD has mellowed out somewhat, as indicated by the songs Who's That Creepin'?, When It Comes To Love, Some Things, Still In Love With You, and Sleep Tight. The softer half of the CD is good, but it's just not BBVD's forte. The lack of more jump-swing hurts. The best tracks are Big Time Operator, What's Next?, and I'm Not Sleepin'. The first CD had the perfect mix of hot jazz, fast swing, and mellow jive. This one tends to drag, but it's still worth getting for any swing fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but good","review":"For fans of the fast-paced swing of BBVD's first album, it may take a few listens to really get into This Beautiful Life. Scotty seems to want to croon and play the guitar a bit more, and I think the lack of brass (the trombonist left the band) also makes quite a difference. All in all, the songs are a bit slower, the lyrics more simplistic (perhaps because there are fewer covers), and the whole record feels less jazzed.However, enough of the negatives: this is a good album. BBVD is branching out from covering swing classics to finding their own sound. Fans of music that harks back to the swing era won't be dissapointed as long as they're willing to hear some new sounds. Scotty's voice even grows on you after a while. Plus, BBVD was smart to hold their Jungle Book cover to this album. It's worth the price by itslef."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do you get when you cross...","review":"...Frank Sanatra with Benny Goodman? You get 'This Beautiful Life'. It's almost as if Scotty Morris and Harry Connic Jr got too cozy with each other in a hotel room somewhere on tour. If you need solid swing tunes to dance to, or if you're looking for a copycat of their first album, you might be disappointed with BBVD's latest offering. This album departs from its self-titled jump-swing predecessor, and puts some southern jazz emphasis in its music. 'Ol' MacDonald' in particular sound so much like Harry Connic Jr. that it fooled my wife. I like it though, the jazz influence is good, and BBVD makes it work. The music is upbeat, there is good tension in the chords, and the technical performance is outstanding. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!","review":"These guys are ABSOLUTELY incredible if you're into the new age swing scene. I was fortunate enough to see them live in San Diego, and they performed half the tracks on this CD there, which was PHENOMENAL. If you like jazz/swing and Jump Blues/Jump swing, these guys are a DEFINITE must for your collection. They DO tend to play a lot of cover tracks of old Louis Prima, Cab Calloway, etc...But they revive the old tunes and throw new hits of their own in to bring swing into the new millennium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This was a great product. I gave it as a gift and we have had it at every family function since."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good, But Different","review":"I believe that Big Bad VooDoo Daddy is a great band. I loved their first disc, and I love this disc, but for different reasons. Where the first disc was fast, hard swing music, based more on the instrumentals than the vocals, this disc is a bit slower, a bit more jazz than swing, and concentrates on the vocals. However, don't get me wrong, I thought this was still a great disc. All the songs are great and still serve a great serving of some great jazz music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Many of the other people reviewing this CD cut it down, saying it is not as hip as the previous. Well, their change in style is one for the better. Scotty has an excellent voice and had little part in the first CD. I can understand also why they wanted to give the lead singer more lines; he is a fabulous entertainer. I saw them live and he led the show. While he plays little on his guitar, he dances around, involves the audience, and sings his lyrics with ease and a coolness no one else has. This CD may not compare to their previous, but I must say it is still a worthy competitor. I recommend it highly to all swing fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Beautiful Life","review":"I would recommend to people who like this style to try \\"Bravo\\" - it is a Russian group which sounds very much like Swing (no practical joke)(look for 1996-1998).

Seriously, you have to wonder if they need to take a break from the road or something. Even the attempts to rock it up just sound tired. Hang in there, guys.

Like the Dead, this is most interesting when it's creative and experimental (Watkins Glen Soundcheck Jam), sweet and melancholy (Beautiful Jam/To Lay Me Down), tough and bluesy (The Same Thing), or congenial and relaxed (Whiskey in the Jar). Make sure to check out the gorgeous Days Between and So Many Roads towards the end of the last disc; two of Jerry's last and most poignant ever performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"With Proper Expectations, This Set Completely Satisfies","review":"....however, if you enjoy the dead, and recognize that any band with a 30+ yr history will be difficult to capture completelty on 5 cds, pick this set up.this album is not the final word on the grateful dead, nor could it be. it is a collection of snapshots from 30 years of having fun, experimenting, and most of all, playing good music. as such, it provides some wonderful filler to the dick's picks series.the outtakes, the jams and the 'right-on' live recordings, pieced together, provide a good picture of this phenemenol band at various moments spread all across their broad spectrum of expression.to get a strong sense of what this band was about, without trying to totally encapsulate them in 5 discs, BUY THIS SET. it'a a lot of fun and will only make you want to track down more recordings..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ol' Grateful Dead","review":"From the begining to the end the cds run smoothly the songs are well picked and the only thing wrong with this set (or better with the Grateful Dead) is that it is not enough.

Anyway a great starter and a good begining for a long career in listening to Grateful Dead music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you loved the aimless jams","review":"If this were a concert it would not even be in my top twenty. The editors of this collection spent way too much time on obscure jams, interminable breaks, soundchecks, and even some pretty horrible vocals which (admit it Deadheads, we all heard them) we used to put up with in the occasional bad show. I looked forward to \\"The Wheel\\" as there aren't too many good published recordings of it. Unfortunatley, Donna and Jerry both sounded like they had been hit by a bus before the show. Phil's \\"The Phil Zone\\" actually had more memorable Dead moments on it - and it was only two CDs! A retrospective may sell well, but no one needs this many unremarkable jams and mindless soundchecks in their collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many roads for me","review":"30 years of works is what this compilation represents, and yet it only scratches the surface of this mediocre band at best.I think the fact that they only had what I consider to be a few real hits over all those years [SUGAR MAGNOLIA, UNCLE JOHN'S BAND, FIRE ON THE MOUNTAIN, TOUCH OF GREY] sums up their main weakness-- quantity over quality.This collection might make good background music for an elevator or bookstore, but not for serious listening. It certainly lacks depth on any level, missing some key songs along the way.Perhaps that is why this band was so heavily followed. No need to understand words or grip deep thoughts, just pass the time with some free-for-all lyrics and instrumentals. Nothing really matters, just be happy.Well, this one doesn't make me happy for the price, as I could have cut it down to four or five songs at best.One star for this is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Zesty","review":"The Dead's music did change over the years. If you want a sampling of their music from each period, here you go. I think there are better CDs to have in your collection: studio efforts, Dick's Picks, and the various other compilations, such as Phil Zone.The booklet that comes with the boxed set uses a type size that makes it difficult to read, not that it matters because it's just essays from music critics. The pictures are nice, though.I was disappointed with So Many Roads. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT NOW","review":"This compilation of songs is the closest you can get to a comprehensive collection of the Grateful Dead.

I read the liner notes and realized Bob Clearmountain had remixed the original songs. There is a real \\"elevator\\" music quality to the finished product. Personally I am very disappointed.

This time, he opens his collection of photographs of the band to a representative fan, Dan Smith, who helped choose which images would tell the story of Genesis from their beginnings to circa 1983/84 tour. Gallo is a professional photographer for a reason and his appreciation for the band is apparent in these lovely images, many are quite rare. The only downside is that the text is kept minimal, with a few sentences extracted from his earlier book, meaning casual fans won't get the whole story, but rather just the highlights. But for a photobook, this is just beautiful! There's also a few pages of photos from another amateur photographer, who happens to be a grandmother from Colorado!Apparently quite rare (mine was published in Japan by a d.i.y. company), but if you can find it, this is a beauty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Used Book","review":"The book was in condition described, the price was very reasonable and it arrived promptly.

In the introduction of this CD, it is explained that they simply were not capable of it, in other words they were not good enough musicians to pull it off. I'm not sure how many of the original band members other than the lead singer are encluded in this live verson, recorded some 30 years after the original's release ( David Gilmour, of Pink floyd, is featured in the line up). This was recorded live at Abbey road in the same studio that the original was recorded in. The audience seems to be rather small. I don't know if they actualy sold tickets for this, or simply invited friends and realitives. I do wonder why they didn't just put on a regular concert and record it, like Arthur Lee did for the, Forever Changes Concert. Perhaps they were affraid that no one would show up?

My favorite story is early in the book setting the tone for a great and helpful read. Early on, the author is clear that the process is out of control for many parents. As the Admissions Director for MIT, she makes it clear not to worry about college until it is time, rather than picking your preschool with intent to head to the IVYies....This book really tells us there is much more to learn on this road and truly this book is all about that journey in a healthier way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less Stress, More Success: A New approach to Guiding Your Teen Through College Admissions and Beyond","review":"Really grounded for both parents and teens.

Let me save you the lost time and money - don't rent this one.

Quite literally at times he'll say, \\"I can't do that. I'd get dirty.\\" What is this, the Teletubbies? Also, the characters pause for huge periods of time when speaking to each other and move in a weirdly robotic slow way during cutscenes.Finally, while much of the puzzle solving might be fun during the middle of the game, as it moves to its conclusion it rushes, stops making sense, and finally ends with the absolute worst conclusion of any game I've ever seen.If I were you, I'd buy Runaway instead, or Conspiracies, or The Longest Journey, or Syberia, or that downloadable adventure which is excellent called Agon (go to Agongame.com).But if you value your free time DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I must say that I am a little suprised that this only has three stars.

The fact that it explained almost nothing leading up to the conclusion is irksome. The clues are blatant and I knew who the killer was halfway through the game. I think I would have enjoyed this game a lot more had it pieced the plot and subplots together. As it is, I ended the game with a lot more questions than answers and an unsatifactory feeling that I wasted my time. The ending was entirely too quick, and honestly I was expecting much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE LET DOWN","review":"After all the hype about how great the game was, the reality was such a disappointment. The graphics were fine, but the colors were very drab and not crisp enough to convey anything unique. The hardest thing was that I actually found myself bored halfway through the game....you have to waste your time going back and forth to places with no reason to be there just to get information to get further in the game. The characters were boring, there were tons of unuseable items that were a distraction. And after all the time you waste, the ending is the biggest let down. They should have just wrote on the final screen \\"thanks for your money sucker\\". Just like with movies that have really bad endings, I have even less appreciation and respect for games like this that stink due to the fact that you have to work harder to get to the end.Unless you have the time to waste on this sleeper, I would save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad....","review":"The only hangup in the game comes when you have to wait for someone to give you information.

I had high hopes for this because there were \\"numerous characters\\" to interact with and \\"several locations\\" to explore. Halfway through I got tired of the pointless dialogue, the need to travel back and forth between locations to get one item to advance the game. The ending was so anti-climactic I wondered if that was really supposed to be the end of the game. I expected there to at least be some degree of difficulty for the end. I wouldn't recommend buying this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but scary to me......","review":"The graphics, like everyone else has said, are gorgeous. The acting is terrible. The game definitely should keep its horror rating. It is gory. There's a ton of action that happens in a morgue! There's also a very scary scene in which you're talking to a man in a mental ward through a peep hole in an adjacent cell. But the worst part of this game, and the part that makes it able to keep the horror rating, is the satanic stuff at the end. Very creepy and very unnecessary. They could have ended the game without all of that. Not a game for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't use the game because of errors","review":"I uploaded the game and when I tried to play I received error messages.

Glad it was under $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Puzzles Take Away the Fun","review":"I liked playing this game, until I got to some of the puzzles. I like puzzles in games, but some of the puzzles are a little too much for a couple reasons. First, the game designers assume you have certain knowledge or have books or an internet connection to look things up. I don't want to have to do research while I'm playing a game. Second, some of the puzzle start points are random so it is possible that you end up with one that isn't solvable and you have to restart from a save file. But it's hard to know if something is actually unsolvable or if you just haven't figured out how to solve it yet. It stalls the game completely and is really frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Payne","review":"The games not bad but for Dreamcatcher the grapics are pretty lame.

I am looking forward to Cypher and hope it is not as disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money ....","review":"I love adventure games ... but this one was stunningly boring. As another reviewer commented, even if you know what your next move should be, the game will require you to go away and come back. Some of the puzzles were annoyingly esoteric. For example, your knowledge of the signs of the Zodiac would be useful. Finally, the ending was a complete let down and didn't, on some levels, even make sense. The graphics were nice but I've seen at least this quality in more interesting games. The \\"map\\" was only marginally time saving.

The truth is that I just wasn't interested in the characters or the story. Also I think that the game is poorly designed and one point there was no way to continue. I had to get save from further on from a cheat site. Gloomy sets, morbid characters, no jokes and no female under 60.

Still, I found it fascinating, and Krich skillfully connects the many interconnected pieces of the puzzle involving Dr. Lisa Brockman and her colleagues (including her fiance), the murdered egg donor, and the anxious recipients of those eggs who now wonder whose child they are really carrying. The suspense builds up quickly, as the stakes for Dr. Lisa Brockman become life-or-death unless she gets to the bottom of the crimes at her clinic.

The main plot--involving the switching of donor eggs, embezzlement, controversial medical experimentation and murder--promises much. However, far too much time is spent on the minutiae of infertility treatment procedures and, especially, on a subplot involving the main protagonist's doubts about her own religious beliefs (who cares?). Nor is there enough of that essential thriller ingredient: sex. By the middle of the story, only the most dedicated reader will care to continue reading.

Her intelligence and energy do shine through, but she goes off on long, book-reportish tangents about nearly every title she comes across (and she works in a bookstore, remember), without even going into more depth than the back cover blurbs. There is no logical organization or progression of ideas, personalities or events; it's a lot like listening to random breakroom chatter. News flash; it's not so very uncommon for authors to work (or to have worked) in bookstores. This type of environment draws literary types.

To the tossers who want to somehow question the \\"punk\\" of this, give it a rest. This is a return, and homage, to one of the roots of punk.

I love Rancid. I bought Boxcar Racer and the Transplants because he was on them. But don't expect anything even close to any of that. It's a slow, boring mixture of reggae, steel drums, horns, and more reggae. I think 6 of the 10 songs start out exactly the same, the other 4 begin and you wonder if its going to be a Billy Joel song.

Great reggae and ska inspired tunes, reminiscent of Op IVY. I can even overlook that Tim is singing with a pop punk teenager on \\"into action\\" and enjoy the tune. What I can't over look is that the album really falls apart after the first three songs. The rest of the album sound like demos...or transplants outtakes. Pretty disappointing. I love ska, punk, and reggae, but these are dull tunes. The only song I can stand on the rest of the album is \\"among the dead\\" and that's because it hints at an OP Ivy reunion.

You can tell that the had a part of every funky song on this CD. My favourite is by Atari Teenage Riot. They are hard core like usual but the brothers added some James Brown to it to make it funky.

The most interesting aspect of the book is its depiction of the mixture of cultures and nationalities in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. However, perhaps precisely because of the author's effort to capture a whole social milieu, the individual characters remain somewhat undeveloped and the plot is strangely disjointed.

He holds the Prelature hostage to practices based on their rule of half a century ago. What if someone's only view of America's south was a snapshot of 1954? While it may be true that Escriva was slow to embrace the liturgical changes of the Second Vatican Council, so were thousands of clerics ordained before 1969. Opus influence in anti-Marxist dictatorships is frequently cited, yet there exists no apology for Jesuits holding state positions in Ortega's Sandanista Cabinet! He concludes that Opus is \\"less Christian\\" than those who practice Liberation Theology. Ironically, it was a member of Walsh's former Order that was a US Congressman with a Pro-Abortion voting record."},{"rating":"2","title":"brainwashing","review":"Michael Walsh discusses systemic aspects of Opus Dei that achieve a regime of thought control within the organization, rightly describing Opus Dei as a \\"hothouse.\\"By Maria del Carmen Tapia, Beyond the Threshold, 1998:Opus Dei silences critical minds. Monsignor Escriva used to say, \\"I don't want great brains in the Work, because they turn into swelled heads. Average intelligences, if they are docile and faithful, are very effective.\\" An engineer, banker, or scientist tends to have fewer problems with superiors in the Work than humanists, philosophers, or theologians, who are almost always frustrated within the Work. As soon as someone--who may even be a priest--is outstanding in the field of philosophy or theology, Opus Dei will almost certainly end by silencing him....He frequently ends up by leaving the institution or becomes the patient of a psychiatrist. Opus Dei does not let you think nor engage in speculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely uninformed","review":"There are times when one must not speak if one does not know the subject. I believe that this is one of those times. Walsh has no relative idea of the meaning behind the Opus Dei. His concepts and his rationale are very contradicting to the spirit of the Opus Dei. It is pertinent to respect others opinions - even those like Walsh's. But it is also pertinent to make it clear when someone attacks or criticizes something that they clearly do not understand. I would definetly NOT recommend this book. Try reading The Man from Villa Tevere or The Way or It is Christ Passing... those can give you a better idea of what the Opus Dei is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balanced Opinion?","review":"Does this reader even understand Opus Dei?For starters, it is not a religious order--a mistake that would allude to his misunderstanding of the most basic aspects of Opus Dei.

Throughout no alternatives are offered - why? Because the alternatives are horrific. Whining about a lack of \\"social cohesion\\" Gray damns the future wherein people can *choose* to have relations which are revocable and provisional. That sounds ideal to me, anything less is a step closer to slavery - and that is why Gray rails against free markets but cowers from offering the alternative; a controlled market where you are servant and a self serving political elite is your master."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on economics I've read.","review":"Wow, what a great read! Informative, well-written and entertaining from first to last page. I'm surprised its american premier hasn't been roundly trashed by those who put free-market capitalism up there on the same level as divine revelation. Because, not only is this a fine, mind-sharpening read, but it's also juicily subversive, which makes it even better - a slightly evil pleasure in this age of media trivia and conformity.

Rachael is attempting to break the record for the highest balloon flight by a woman, so she is in the news, which causes Charlie to worry even more about her safety. Besides Rachael's father there are several other suspects who would have a reason to harm her. Charlie reluctantly leaves her husband Drake in order to travel to Albuquerque and carry on an investigation with her brother Ron.

From what I understand, DW4 Empires will be somewhat of a combination between a regular DW game and Dynasty Tactics. You will be able to chose where you want to move an army like in Dynasty Tactics and fight the battles like you would in Dynasty Warriors. You will also be able to form a treaty with whomever you like, and go to war with whomever you'd like as well, but with an overall objective. That's pretty much all that I know for sure, but I speculate that you could do everything else that you could do in Dynasty Tactics or Warriors. With the best of both worlds, this is a promissing game for DW fans and newcomers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynastywarriors4:empires","review":"This is one of the coolest Dynasty games I have ever seen.Y ou cammand your own Empire and use Edited charactes in your empire.Overall its a great game, I just Pre-ordered it today.The only downside is that you can only have two players in versusmode.But that just means that Dynasty Warriors 5 will be even better.So even though co-op stinks,B_U_Y_ T_H_I_S_ G_A_M_E_Period.........................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps early, but certain review","review":"I know that one generally waits until the game has come out before reviewing, but I am so certain that Dynasty Warriors: Empires is going to be a great game that I am giving it 5 stars all the way down the board before I even play it. Every single Dynasty warriors game that I have ever played has been awesome. The KOEI company has never let me down and I have no doubt that this will be another battlefield-addictive addition to DW4. I will be buying this game on the first day that it comes out and I recommend that everyone do the same. Even if you have never played Dynasty warriors before, Buy the original DW4 and the Empires expansion. You'll be glad you did. I have never seen a more fun and expansive battlefield game and I would say to the KOEI company: \\"Keep up the God-like work.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a PS2 game worthy for a 4 star rating","review":"Well, I thought I had wasted my money buying the PS2 system....until this game came along.Game play and graphics are very well done, as are cut scenes to vocal displays.Graphics are smooth,fighting and dueling one on one is a pleasure for the ears and the eyes.Has with most hack and slash games this one will not wear you out and you will go on for hours. Although some parts may seem to repeat over and over the game play value is still worth the price you pay for admission.It is easy to handle with lots of in game features.If you like to fight and build up a huge army to conquer your neigbour this is the game for you.I don't think you'll be disappointed.Good luck and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless - Doesn't change Gender!","review":"This doesn't change the gender of a VGA cable at all.

The authors started with a brilliant idea - what would happen to a world that never saw night if the sun should set?In the world of this novel, the world orbits six suns (luckily you never have to examine the astronomy of this, it would be ludicrous) which means a sun always shines in the sky. Because of this, the inhabitants of the world have a great fear of darkness - an amusement park ride consisting of nothing more than a boatride in darkness causes some of its riders to go insane.When a group of scientists piece some clues together, showing that there will be a period of darkness, an eclipse on a day when only one sun crosses the sky, they try to warn society.

Other than that, it seemed a predictable potboiler filled with basic science lectures.

Scientists find out that on the 19th of Theptar their planet Kalgash will become darkened by another invisible planet. This only happens every 2049 years because only then one sun - Dovim - will be shining. That's why some scientists, archeologists and maths students as well as psychologists and journalists start to work together.

It would really hurt their business. I am going to add some of the vitamins to my daily regiman. Thank you Mr. Quinn for sharing your story. It's a shame the FDA had to stop you from advertising. Anyone that is a threat to Big Business and Drug companies usually have advantageous treatments snuffed because they would help and take a big cut from their business.

Not her best work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"quick read, not a lot of substance","review":"Mount Vernon Love Story is actually Mary Higgins Clark's first book, and after I read the book, I could tell that it was, indeed, her first book. I was rather surprised by the renown author's first writings because they reflect little of her current best selling books. Mount Vernon Love Story is about George Washington, the United States' first President and his growing up in Virginia. He serves in the French and Indian War and later becomes general in the American Revolution. He loves another man's wife, but eventually he finds Martha \\"Patsy\\" Washington and loves her for her matronly self. There's not much of a love story because he is at war most of the time, and even when they are together, the couple goes through very routine movements. I still do not know a whole lot about the relationship between Washington and his beloved wife, and his own character remains a bit of a mystery. This is a very forgettable book of Mary Higgins Clark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead....A History Book","review":"I've read all her novels and expected a mistery, I was mislead its a war/history novel and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mount Vernon Love Story","review":"This book is wonderfully written.

This book focuses on the love story of George and Martha Washington. The book takes palce in two timelines. It begins with President Washington preparing to leave public office and return to Mount Vernon with his wife Martha, who liked to be called Patsy. And quickly jumps back to periods of Geroge Washinton's youth. Trying to give us some insight on the man and his relation ship with Martha.A lot of research went into this book. And I learned a lot about one of the founding fathers of the USA. The book is a charming and quick read. You almost are left with the thought of yearning for a few more chapters. It made me want to look further into George Washington's life and career."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to enjoy","review":"The musicians in the JIB, to include Jason himself are all talented.

I bought this dictionary to help teach myself to read/translate the written Chinese in several books I brought home from my recent adventures in China. It has both extensive english-Chinese and Chinese-english sections. The radical index and radical chart are great, and the basics section is clear, comprehensive and easy to understand.

I found it easy to slip the phone in and reasonably easy to get it back out at the end of a run or workout. However, the armband was always insecure on my arm, slipping down unless I kept it tight. There is a metal \\"buckle\\" through which the velcro strap runs to fold back on itself and hold the armband in place. This metal buckle bent immediately, and within 5 uses of this armband it broke completely.

Very very disappointed at this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be ok for a child's arm.","review":"I bought the item, got it on a Friday, used it Saturday and it came apart. The main problem is the armband is way too small. I am not a big armed person by any stretch of the imagination and I had a hard time getting it to fit so it would not slide off during a workout.Because the strap is too small for me, I have to pull it a bit so the velcro catches. That looked ok at first, but by the end of my very first time using it, the plastic facing had started to detach from the backing (its merely glued on and the glue separated).Once the facing is loose, I was concerned about dropping my iPhone and bearing the expense of a new one.Belkin could do better if they added a couple inches to the strap. But, the plastic facing glued to the backing still leaves a bit of concern.If you have very small arms (child-like arms) then perhaps this will work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Positively the worst....","review":"I frankly can't believe they even attempted to sell this. It is clearly defective. Firstly, it won't even fit around an average size arm comfortably. Secondly, even when it does, it rips in short order. In my case, it fell apart after two workouts.

The glue holding the plastic face onto the armband gave out after only a month. Now, it is completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy build quality, otherwise a 4-star item","review":"Used this case sparingly over a year. The first issue I had was that the velcro is just glued onto the armband. When trying to feed the armband through the metal loop, the velcro would often get caught, which was a pain to deal with. Eventually, the velcro came completely unglued -- and not from the front where it was catching on the metal loop. In addition, I was trying to tighten it after slipping it on today and the metal loop broke, leaving me with a useless arm band that is falling apart.If they stitched the velcro down and used a sturdier metal loop ...

I find that it stays in place on my arm and secures my iphone with no problems with it falling out during work outs. The side pocket (for keys) is helpful but I don't use it that often because it only fits one or two keys at a time. The one thing that is not exceptional is the volume control area. Because it's a soft armband I find that I have to push pretty hard to make contact with my volume controls and my volume controls don't always correspond with the armband's designated control indicators due to some iphone movement inside it's sleeve. Overall, pretty good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"lasted 1 week","review":"Wish I could give it 0 stars. The cover started coming off after about a week of use.

I used Belkin's lifetime warranty and they sent me a new one. However, there seems to be a huge design flaw in the newest batch of these armbands.On my second day of use, the screen protector separated from the armband and my iPhone fell out onto the floor. The first Belkin armband I had must have used a stronger adhesive because I had exercised the same way hundreds of times with the old one without the screen ever peeling off.Buyer beware that any amount of stress, no matter how minimal, will render this armband useless. However, Belkin does make getting a replacement pretty easy. Just check out their site for info on making a warranty claim.

The game play combines elements of side scrolling beat-em-ups and old school shooter elements. And here they're messed together in a very polished way. I'm still big on old school gaming, think its a shame they've gone wayside; so this tastes even sweeter. Level designs will be varied also.3 characters are playable in the final product. Of the 2 in the demo, each look to be really different, and just as importantly, fun to play.I hope that the demo level is pretty easy compared to later ones.

The animals and buildings are well drawn. The people generally are not. Dracula, for example, is a face with fangs and a sort of Mardi Gras mask. Rather disappointing. The best designs I thought were animals (especially from Australia) and the nesting dolls and buildings from Russia. I was disappointed in Scandanavia, which was all crowded together with no outstanding designs. The USA I thought had the best overall designs. Overall the color choices are not exciting but you can liven them up yourself.So buy this book if for fun and to a wide representation of deisgns, but don't expect any masterpiece of cross stitch designs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends and Lovers","review":"Sally Stowe and Colin Foster went to collage together.

Also the company has a responsibility to its customers to be responsive to communications from its customers. Based on my experience, my advice would be for Amazon to discontinue advertising a product manufactured by a company that has no intentions to satisfy or even cares about the satisfaction of their customers.

Even things as simple as pointing out how to create an em dash will make all your documents look better. Robin Williams has an excellent writing style that lends itself to repeated readings. She has written many books since, many of which elaborate on the points in this book, but this is still the one I recommend to people who want to know more about type. I gave this book to someone who was producing a school newsletter, and the publication went from ransom note to cohesive publication overnight!

I was stunned to see most of the students putting two spaces after periods in a book they were making in my class. I explained why this was uneccessary (and in fact wrong) with most typefaces available on the computer, and they said they had all learned this in computer classes in the various high schools they had attended.I unearthed my copy of this book (from 1990!) and brought it in the next week.

If she were to produce a second edition, a 'The Computer is Not a Typewriter' junking the out-of-date technical detail, but retaining the no-nonsense advise, I would hail her as the Saviour of Civilisation!

The vocals are amazing, and Igor does a superb job on drums! If you have never listened to Sepultura, this is the first album you should buy and trust me , you will love it. Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good Sepultura album","review":"I'll be honest, I'm new to Sepultura, but not to Soulfly or Max Calvara, I haven't even heard old Sepultura with Max that much, just a little bit. But from what I heard, I thought the band was a little better with Max. Though, since Max branched out we now have the pleasure to listen to two great bands....Soulfly, AND Sepultura. Derrick Green I think does a good job on filling Calvara's shoes and thats a tough job, and he does it better than anyone else could. But about the album....this album is very good and opens with the best song...\\"Sepulnation\\", goes into a brutal \\"Revolt\\", then follows into other brutal and very good songs like \\"Border Wars\\", \\"Vox Populi\\", \\"One Man Army\\", \\"Tribe To A Nation\\" etc...I also think \\"Politricks\\" with the guest vocals is a cool song. Overall this is a good album that I suggest buying...better than old Sepultura? Probably not, not with Max in the band, but a very impressing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not Sepultura without Max Cavalera","review":"Max Cavalera was the heart and soul of Sepultura, without him the remainded of the band has lost an irreplacible piece of the puzzle. Derrick Green is not a bad vocalist in fact his voice is probably better than Max's. But the intensity and urgency (and overall message in the music) is no longer present. Andres, Paulo, and Igor are still fantastic musicians but Max's neo-fanatacism anchored Sepultura. Nation sounds like both a rehash of old Sepultura riffs ala Chaos AD and a meld of Nu-Metal. Sepultura is still one of my favorite metal bands just not this incarnation. Beneath the Remains and Arise are the two must have albums from the Real Sepultura, this cd is just riding the Sepultura name into the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal to sleep by....","review":"Sepultura was one of the first heavy bands I ever listened too, I first picked up roots and was blown away by the innovative mix of tribal and metal. I listened to Against and could tell something was missing, recently I picked up Nation and was not impressed and sorely let down by this album. Sepultura has gone soft and lost all creativity and innovation since Max left after roots. The songs are slow and tame with some flare ups every now and then, nothing like the sepultura of the past. (especially if you have been listening to them since their first albums) Roots probably was and will be sepultura's last good album for a long time to come. Even the artwork on this album lacks creativity, it's done in a similar style to the artwork of KMFDM.If you're looking for the sound of the older sepultura, look elsewhere, it's not here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sepulnation - Harder than the first","review":"A very good second album after the exit of Max. Plenty of tribal sounds introing songs and then great songs follow. Sounds different than Against and all of the Max - Sepultura songs. 'Revolt'(track 2) sounds like old \\"Beneath The Remains\\" songs, quick riffs and crazy drums.Not the best Sepultura album ever made but very good! Give it a try!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good songs.....","review":"see, by now i really dig AGAINST...It's in the same vein of ROOTS...but NATION is the SEP album that i really don't care much....Must be the less inspired album from SEPULTURA...well, it's my opinion....after NATION and ROORBACK, the band lost the attention from the masses....DANTE and A-LEX are so great!!!!! Unfortunatelly, the best thing from Brazil, SEPULTURA recorded NATION and ROORBACK before DANTE and A-LEX.....this one got some good songs, but check DANTE and A-LEX!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The boys from Brazil make a welcome return!","review":"'Against' was not all that promising. This, however IS! Almost combining elements from 'Roots' and 'Chaos A.D' the band has achieved a more comfortable sound. The problem with 'Against' is that Sepultura tried too hard to emulate what they had with Max. Now, it is clear that a medium has been reached. Derrick Green does not sound so out of place as he did before. And instead of engulfing the listener with tribal exerts, the band have concentrated on what they do best, producing exellent tracks. The percussion and world music elements are kept at a slight distance now, and so a more refreshing sound has been achieved. This is a welcome return, and a clear note that the boys are finding their feet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great musicians... poor music","review":"I bought this album with about 8 other albums of all styles (Napalm Death, Toadies, Nile, etc...) After an 11 hour drive in my car and much music playing this album fell to the bottom of the pile and never made it back. This thing just falls short of doing anything for me. Only two songs here that cover any new ground... the rest is just filler/rehash/boring. I know it's tough to not buy a new Sepultura album, but if your favorite one is Beneath The Remains.... do yourself a favor and leave this one alone. I wish I had. I even have a Sepultura tattoo and I wish I hadn't bought this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HERE COMES THE NATION","review":"This is it .

Our music","review":"Sepultura still rules even without Max, and this album proves it. Although not nearly as fast or brutal as previous efforts such as \\"Schizophrenia\\", \\"Beneath the Remains\\", or \\"Arise\\" this album is still Sepultura all the way. The song \\"Sepulnation\\" is probably the most laid back song on this disc but is already a fan favorite. It tells everything that Sepultura stands for. The best songs on this CD would be \\"Sepulnation\\", \\"Border Wars\\", and \\"Who Must Die?\\". If you are still skeptical about Slayer being any good without Max I would suggest downloading those songs first then deciding if you want to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops \\"Against\\" in every way","review":"Many longtime Sepultura fans didn't (and some still haven't) taken a liking to Derrick Green: the new voice of Sepultura replacing Max Cavalera. Sepultura's first album with Green, \\"Against\\", saw the band struggling with Green, but their second album with him, 2001's \\"Nation\\", finds the group more closely molded together and Green finally cleansing himself of the title \\"Max Cavalera's replacement\\". Green's barking, roaring voice sounds great, and the Igor Cavalera's drums haven't sounded this good in years. Standout tracks include \\"Sepulnation\\", \\"Revolt\\", \\"One Man Army\\", \\"Tribe to a Nation\\", \\"Reject\\", and \\"Water\\"; all of which are better than many of the songs found on \\"Against\\". The only real flaw with \\"Nation\\" is the same flaw that plagued \\"Against\\": the rhythm section suffers without Max Cavalera's guitar, but other than that, this is solid. All in all, if you were disappointed with \\"Against\\", then checkout \\"Nation\\" or they're latest \\"Roorback\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville","review":"I guess if I wanted sub-Slayer thrash with a deeper vocals, muddy guitar lines and a production that reeks of utter modern mediocrity, I might buy this.But that's not what I want.

It's not absolute junk, but it's very, very sub-par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antipop","review":"After Brown Album ( I liked 3 songs on that) and Rhinoplasty (which I thought was an ok album, though many fans did not get because they didn't know it existed) I was ecstatic to hear Primus go back to their roots. Brain is becoming the pseudo-Herb (who by the way has a knew band with the lead singer of Tool, Maynard) and Les with some screamin vocals makes this album truly stand out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the Nostalgic Primus fan","review":"Primus has been around for a while, and those hardcore fans that were digusted by the Brown album will find this one to be no better, but face it, until Herb comes to his senses and drums for them agian, it ain't gonna be the same. Those of you (like me) who say Primus still sucks as great as they have for years will see this as an interesting exploration into waters touched on in Rinoplasty. It has a much harder edge, and by the looks of it, Les has been able to cange and yet stay the same at the same time. It isn't the best and isn't the worst. For real Primus action, get Sailing the Seas of Cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way you always wanted Primus to sound.","review":"Herb is king, but Brain has certainly shown himself to be a very close second on this CD. Primus' last couple of offerings were a bit weak and I had reservations about buying this album, but from my first listen I was hooked. Primus retain their unmistakable sound but now with a RHCP/RATM groove. To be honest, I find it hard to believe that some Primus fans don't like this album - it's almost everything you could ever want from a Primus album...if only Herb was still there, sniff."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt live up to primus's high standards!","review":"Okay so as much as i love primus, i was really dissapointed when i got this cd! get it if you really want, but id recommend one of thier other cd's instead. brown album is their best!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meh.","review":"Even as a huge Primus/Les Claypool fan, I can't bring myself to say that this is a great album. There are some incredible cuts here that are on par with anything from their earlier albums (especially Antipop and Final Voyage of the Liquid Sky), but much of this album hardly even sounds like Primus due to the huge number of outside producers and musicians. Granted, they do make for a highly varied album, but a lot of it sounds unfocused (even by Primus standards) and uninspired. There is a generous helping of guitar thanks to Tom Morello, and Lalonde's guitar takes a more prominent role than on any Primus album. That alone isn't necesarrily bad, but overall, it gets boring in the end, and you're left feeling like, \\"That's it?\\". Most songs here deserve little more than a few listens, though once again, there are some great cuts. I'd recommend this to people who like the new wave of metal bands, or to hardcore Primus fans, but everyone else is advised to pick one of the band's earlier albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good - don't waste your money","review":"Antipop is Primus trying to be something else. As the title indicates, they wanted nothing to do with pop - like every band in 1999. The guitar is more present here than on earlier albums, which doesn't come as a suprise because that was the sound back then - loud, simple guitarwork (see Limp Bizkit). Les is still an amazing bassist on Antipop, though. The problem is, everything besides the basslines sound too simple and boring. This album is faceless compared to albums like Pork Soda. My advice - buy an earlier album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Side Of Primus","review":"Well, what can I say. I feel in love with this album as soon as I put it in my Cd player and turned up Electric Uncle Sam. However, compared to earlier primus albums, AntiPop takes on a heavier more serious side. For the most part Les Claypool's voice is not as squeaky and fun as it is in say the brown Album or Pork Soda. Still, the bass is enough to shake the cd player right out of your hand, and this is classic Primus. The band lashes out on \\"Electric Electric\\" feauturing Metallica's James Hetfield, who I require you turn up your headphones for on his solo midway through the song. The \\"Antipop\\" is another brilliant song. \\"Mama didn't raise no fool\\" has Morello from Rage let lose riffs as Claypool repeats \\"mama didn't raise no fool\\" in his typical Les Claypool voice. Overall, this is a new side of Primus, and I really like it. I'm looking forward to their next album, and can't imagine what that will sound like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primus comes full circle","review":"Wow! A real refreshing progression. I was blow away. Love the new heavier egde. A must have for any Primus fan or not. It must be good if riff master Hetfield lends his talents. Good move for Primus. Les Claypool has never been more refined, and at the same time very agressive. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Primus is Out of Ideas","review":"The boys must be out of ideas for new songs. Instead of writing REAL Primus stuff, they've apparently decided to abandon their dedicated long-time fans by writing stuff to appeal to Korn and Limp Bizkit fans. They've done this by bringing in various individuals to help them produce songs. Aside from Tom Waits, this was generally a bad idea.Granted there are four really cool songs on here (The Antipop, Final Voyage of the Liquid Sky, Coattails of a Dead Man, and the secret song (a studio version of The Heckler)), it's not Primus at the peak of their existence as many reviews made this out to be.Bottom line: If you're a new Primus fan (got in to Primus during or after the Punchbowl years), you'll probably dig this album. If you've been in with Primus for the long haul as I have, this is just an album to keep Tales from the Punchbowl and The Brown Album company in the mediocre catagory."},{"rating":"2","title":"of course its good...","review":"This is there best since Sailing. What I want to say in particular concerns Brain. I hear a lot about how he \\"gets the job done.\\" First, his style is completely different than Herb. Second-Brain takes the prize for the sickest drummer who hardly ever shows off. He's heavier and more understated than Herb, and listen closely, people--styles aside, he might be better than Herb. Listen to Praxis, really listen to what he's doing with Primus. Ask a good drummer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best since Frizzle Fry","review":"Primus has done it again. Claypool stands out in today's music scene once again with this new album. Every song is great. It has been a long time since I have listened to an album and enjoyed every song. Any Primus fan needs this album to his/her collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allstar cast of guest talent but lacks creativity","review":"I like Tom, some of you like Fred, and everyone likes Les, but nothing really unique materializes with this album. THe cool stuff that primus is recognized for (Les crazy bass in particular) is not in here. When compared to Hamburger Train and the Kalamazoo hand spasm, this newfound sanity on the part of Les is not working. Anywho, Ler is still a stud, Brain isn't Herb but he gets the job done, and Les remains abnormal. I was expecting more but hey, its Primus... 4 is as low i can go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is More Better?","review":"This is a great cd. It is different from the others becausethey worked with countless other artists instead of doing the independent thing. I have to say that the the songs featuring other artists are good, but they aren't Primus style. I'm not saying it is bad, but if you are looking for a purly Primus cd, this isn't it. There are great Primus songs, but the ones with Tom Morello really sound like \\"Rage Against the Primus\\". So more is variety, but it isn't better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can i say","review":"As far as comparing this to other Primus albums, i wouldnt dare. The idea of comparing Primus albums is like comparing Tarantino movies. They all leave you thinking how could this get any better, then they do. Antipop definitely shows a lot more of Les's darker, more intense side, with a more driven lead bass than we've seen with previous releases such as Sailing The Seas or Punchbowl, but Primus still retains their hauntingly beautiful quirk metal that has set them apart from mainstream since Frizzle Fry. As always, Lers schreeching guitar perfectly supplements the nasal psychotic vocals/purely awe-inspiring bass of Les Claypool and Brains flawless sense of offbeat rythym. Primus is one of those bands that ou can rest assured will just keep getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Primus Yet","review":"Les, you are the man! As a fellow bass player, i can say that what you do is amazing. this album was primus's best yet. with guest's like tom morello, guitarist of Rage Against The Machine, this is definetly a cd that any primus fan needs to buy. and for all of you don't who like primus, you can go to hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISHONEST TITLE ? - CAVEAT EMPTOR","review":"Greenwood Press advertises this as \\"more than 400 books published\\" on Elvis Presley.

While it doesn't include any cuts from her Columbia albums, it contains just about all the songs off of \\"Fool Around\\" and \\"Protect the Innocent\\" (superior albums in my opinion anyway). As an added bonus, it contains Rachel's take on \\"Be Stiff\\".Since the \\"Protect the Innocent\\" and her previous Rhino compilation (which was basically \\"Fool Around\\" plus a couple songs) are no longer available on CD, this CD is a good buy for any Rachel fan. It includes her slow songs plus her country songs (both of which are my preference), but it has her new wave songs as well...a good cross section.Rachel, if you're out there...how about recording again...or at least coming back to Akron, Ohio for a concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a MAJOR omission","review":"I am an old curmudgeon, and I bought the import version of \\"Fool Around\\" when it first came over the pond, pressed on \\"virgin\\" white vinyl.

I bought Hailstones & Halibut Bones when I was teaching third grade, and no other poetry book touched my students like this one did. After reading it aloud slowly, in order to savor each color, children wrote verses to express their feelings about their favorite color. We used watercolor to explore a gradient wash on paper.

It will not grow.The package looked enticing and I bought into it. There were only 3 seeds in my pack (even though the kit claims that 4-5 would be included). They were very tiny black dots similar to poppy seeds, but much smaller and more oval. I had to make sure my hands were completely dry before handling these to prevent \\"sticking\\" and so they could be dropped easily into the soil.But alas, after much waiting, watching and hoping, nothing has grown.

Nothing is a better example of this than the false picture of 9/11 and the war on Iraq beamed into America's living rooms by CBS, NBC, ABC and so on during the last year and a half..I am not surprised this book is selling so well even though it doesn't have big budget advertising behind it. The average American senses they are not getting the whole story and are reaching out for alternative explantions to those offered by the Halliburtons and the Texacos. Lots of them are discovering Amy Goodman's book and her remarkable radio news show Democracy Now.

This book does a great job of describing the elements and attitudes currently at work which are placing the United States and the world in great peril. Amy Goodman is clear and succinct in her delivery and avoids the appearance of liberal fanaticism which triggers blindness in many people. She has carried over this style from the Democracy Now! radio program that so effectively broadens the view of world news which has been sadly and horribly narrowed by the established media."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Exception to the Rulers: Exposing Oily Politicians, War Profiteers, and the Media that Love Them","review":"goooood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amy Goodman: Left gatekeeper/ fake rebel","review":"Ms. Goodman spends a lot of time and effort speaking out against the corporate media, but when one stops and considers that her publisher is Hyperion, it becomes difficult to figure out what she is complaining about.After all, Hyperion is a division of Walt Disney, so the great rabble rouser is in fact published by Mickey Mouse. Also, Democracy now is funded primarily by the right leaning Ford Foundation, so why is Ms. Goodman speaking out against the corporate media?faced with these 2 facts there are only 2 possible answers..either...A. Amy Goodmans thesis that the 'mainstream media' is owned and operated by corporations who have their own agenda and distort the news is deeply flawed.or...B. Amy Goodman is part of the mainstream media and might not be giving us the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost tolerable","review":"Goodman claims to be independent but she is largely just parroting the talking points of the Democrats.

I bought her book after I heard her speak recently while I was in Southern California and her book is just plain shrill. In fact, it isn't much of a book at all. It seems a bunch of conspiracy theory thrown together to cash in on all the anti-Bush publishing bonanza of the moment. The intellectual level of the book was suprisingly low. It was much more like a pamphlet than a serious read. Also, her main point that we are all kept in the dark by the corporate media just doesn't hold up. Look at the world of hurt that Bush and Rumsfield are currently in-- and that's from the networks, not from Amy's show. I'd spend my next twenty-five bucks on something more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blahblahblahblahblah","review":"So the media ignored East Timor during the 90s? Well, I don't recall the Nation or MotherJones or NPR saying much about East Timor when Indonesia invaded the place either. The war in Afghanistan??

Valve is schrader only, no presta. This isn't a bicycle pump, much less a floor pump. Worst of all, for $10 you'll just toss it out, because it isn't worth the time or effort to get a refund.

None of the other songs had any redeeming qualities, just a bunch of noise. The inventiveness and varied music from Iron Butterfly, et al is totally missing.

The entire book repeats the theory over and over, and doesn't add any new information beyond what you read in the first few pages.It's amazing to me that this wasn't just written as an article in some psychology magazine.

Some were riviting (Luncheon of the Boat Party). Some were silly (Paris Hangover). Some were a hard read (France: A History). None of them were boring. Until now. This was an indescribably minute and rambling remembrance of every American journalist that was in Paris during the Fabulous Twenties, the time of the Lost Generation, debauchery, and fine writing. I had hoped to read something as illuminating as Malcom Crowley's \\"Exile's Return.\\" Instead I read a phone book listing of journalists, with a few tidbits along the way.

I found TaxCut 2002 to be polished and mostly easy to use, so I was more than happy to pick it up again this year. What a mistake! The difference is night and day. TaxCut 2003 has an unfinished look about it, and I ran in to bugs at nearly every step, both state and federal. I will certainly be going back to TurboTax next year, copy protection or no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Software","review":"The software is confusing and full of bugs. I can't even complete my taxes because it won't let me enter the amount of tax I had withheld from the previous year - so it says I owe money. The final print-out (form to send in) shows the line item to include taxes withheld. I spent about an hour completing my state (incorrectly) and 5 hours going thru each question and each form in Taxcut trying to get it to work correctly.It has other flaws - but my basic advice is that it's a waste of money unless your taxes are perfectly straight forward. Then I suggest doing them by hand - which is what I have to do - and I bought the software."},{"rating":"1","title":"CA program incorrectly DOUBLES the refund - certain audit","review":"I'm shocked to find an error in the program as late as April 4 that would have gotten me audited by the IRA. Line 49, the estimated tax paid (in other words, an optional amount you have separately paid upfront not including W2 witholding), is equal to line 47, the tax withheld. Yup, it's a formula, not a hard plug. The total refund is calculated by adding the 2 amounts together. This results in DOUBLE the refund you're actually supposed to get. I feel sorry for the people that have already filed using TaxCut state - they will certainly be audited by the IRS - it's an obvious error. I will never use this program again. Even if they fix this in the next few days, how can I trust a company that would miss such an obvious error with about a week left before the tax deadline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save money and do taxes the old way","review":"I am so glad that I didn't depend on the numbers Tax-Cut state gave me. I saved another $100 in taxes by just doing it by hand. I don't know where the software botched up.

Even though TaxCut had an offer with MS Money (which I often use), TurboTax works far more smoothly with Money. I also had to hunt around for where to include deductions - for example, I have a college saving fund that is deductible for my state taxes. I was never asked about this in the \\"Interview\\" and had to hunt around the many deduction screens to find and check \\"Other deductions.\\" This is a fairly common and fairly new deduction, and should have been specifically mentioned.

Be careful to look closely at how TaxCut handles direct IRA rollovers. It pulled the rollover amount (instead of the taxable rollover amount -- $0) in as taxable on my state form.

I have no idea (aside from completing the form by hand) how I'm going to file my state taxes. TaxCut's web help (and online help) are NO HELP in resolving these issues. On the plus side, the software offers a 100% money-back satisfaction guarantee -- I'll be using it. If you want software you can trust, skip TaxCut and find something else.

This holiday CD is sure to become a Christmas classic and is certainly the most fun and uplifting holiday CD in my collection. Sure, everybody loves the standard Christmas music of entertainers from Johnny Mathis to The Carpenters to Mannheim Steamroller (all excellent in their own categories); but, for something a little different to liven up your holiday parties, invite Ringo to your festivities with this CD. It contains not only rocking holiday originals and new compositions, but some moving and thought-provoking lyrical work, as well.

Ringo rocks out on a mixture of original songs & Christmas standards, including \\"The Little Drummer Boy\\" (a natural song for him to cover) and \\"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer\\" (one of the hightlights of the album for me). It was also nice to hear his remake of \\"Christmas Time is Here Again,\\" a song originally recorded by the Beatles years ago for the Christmas album distributed to their fan club members (how I wish someone would release THAT on CD!).

The only good thing is the extended album version, the reason why it bought it in the first place. I heard better remixes by Axwell before, the same can be said about Sanchez. Too bad that [Paul Oakenfold] didn't remix this song. I liked his version of \\"Sorry\\" a lot and was hoping the same here. Or an [Above & Beyond Remix] like \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", those are both real good dance trax.

So much better than the white iPod headphones.Pros:- Plenty of bass- Nice middle range and overall sound- Small physical size- Cool cord/cable- NO LEAKING SOUND - I turn up my music all the way and nobody in public places can hear what Im listening to.- Good included accessories in the package - extra size buds, case, and bigger line-in adapter- REALLY expensive for headphones in their divisionCons:Honestly I really can't think of any"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome packaging, terrible sound","review":"I was so excited when I got these earphones - they look great, they seem really well made, they are beautifully presented in their box and come with some awesome accessories like the carry case. Then I put them on, plugged them into my ipod and.... no bass. And I'm not exactly a base-fiend, I don't turn up the volume all the way or anything. But I expect to be able to hear drums and bass guitars. It's like they're completely hollow.

A one star rating is too generous for this product but that's as low as this review format allows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing sound","review":"After doing some extensive browsing, reading reviews here and elsewhere, and having had many high quality products from JBL all my life, I decided on these headphones to replace my current iPod ones with a superior quality than the average $5 headphones, yet the sound quality is absolutely terrible, very dissapointing given that JBL has a reputation for high volume, high quality sound, perhaps not audiophile level, but definitely always above average. The bass is simply not existent, overall the sound is distorted with an iPod or even to a CD player. I gave this product 2 stars because the fit, look and finish is really great, but the sound was truly awful. I ended up getting much better sound from a set of Philips headphones I found at $10 at my local Walgreen's. Hopefully my next JBL product will restore my faith in the brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one ear that worked was nice, but...","review":"If I were deaf in my left ear these might have been just the perfect earbuds, but, nope, that isn't the situation.

However, this item has a short lifespan.The first time I charged it, I used the car charger, and it charged nicely and the battery lasted a reasonably long time (considering the light output of the thing).The second time I charged it, the car charger would no longer work at all, and I had to plug it into a wall outlet. This worked, though, and the spotlight again worked well.The third time I tried to charge it, the wall plug is no longer working either. It's not imparting any charge at all, even though the little red/green LEDs make it seem like it's trying to charge.These halogen spotlights seem to be generally low quality across the board, but I'd still expect it to last more than 2 charge cycles. Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!!!!","review":"What a piece of junk! B&D should be ashamed. Will not charge even after 30 hrs. Replaced it and same thing! Stay away!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy piece of JUNK!","review":"I charged this 24 hours before use like the instructions said and the green light never went on but the spot was bright for a very short time. I've recharged it several times since and the spot is yellow and dims fast. The 2 LED's work very well and last. I found it takes over 30 hours to charge before the green LED goes on. Unfortunately I didn't test it before the time limit ran out on being able to return it. Black & Decker used to be one of the more trusted tool companies. I will not trust them based on their name anymore. Have to just take it as a loss. Bought a cheapo $10 light to replace it at one third of the cost and it works 500 percent better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA - Dead on Arrival, Won't Hold a Charge","review":"Couldn't get it to charge. I followed the directions for 1st time charge, letting the unit charge for 24 hours, and only the two red lights were on. I then charged an extra 6 hours to the maximum (as stated in the instructions) of 30 hours. All three lights (the two red & the green) were on, but the green light never blinked to show that the unit was charged. Tried to use it - no go. Am returning this spotlight and will get another brand / model. Unfortunate, as I really like my other Black & Decker products - and I own quite a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used twice then would not recharge","review":"Not reliable...used this spotlight twice and then would not recharge. Still works with car cigarette lighter adapter, but the cord is very short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you..BD","review":"Like many other reviewers, I had problems with charging. Everything worked fine the first time or two. But, then the problems started. Now, it's as if it will not fully charge. If I let it charge (household AC) for 30 hours, I can get a weak/yellow light which will quickly discharge. All in all, I'd say I got about 10 minutes use out of the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotlight for Professionals","review":"This is very heavy and has a very short light life. Not good for home use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I received my light is perfect shape. I charged it as per the owners manual. It was bright for about 10 minutes before going dim. The next time I charged it, it stayed bright for about 5 minutes before going dim. The third time I charged it, it stayed bright for about 1 minute before going dim. I have had the light for only about 4 months now and the battery will not hold a charge now. I called Black and Decker and they told me they could no longer help me as they sold that part of their business. I will never buy another Black and Decker light and I would suggest that you do the same and look somewhere else for a light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy - I had three","review":"I bought and returned three of these in less than a month - don't waste your time - THey all kicked the bucket after only a few uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails after a year","review":"I got the model SL102B high power spot light (the smaller bother of the 2 Million Power light) last Christmas. By this Christmas it won't take a charge anymore. I didn't even use it all that much. I called the manufacturer listed on the label and they said they don't guarantee the battery and they don't sell a replacement. I would not recommend this spot light. Stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS IN AN EMERGENCY","review":"Bought this flashlight to keep around the house and vehicle for emergencies. It has been turned on maybe three times in the last year and a half since its purchase. When I finally needed it to fix a flat tire on the highway, it wouldn't charge from the vehicle. I took it home hoping a wall outlet would provide the power to charge, but no such luck. Even after 3 days of charging (checking it every few hours) it didn't work. All I got was a very slow turn on and just enough light to find a $1.99 flashlight from 7-11 to do the job. Thanks 7-11! It was great the three times that I did use it, 2 million candlepower is more than enough for any job. It was well taken care of and still looks brand new. So if you need a light for daytime use only and only plan on using it a few times, then this is the flashlight for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 minutes of light, maybe, on a full charge","review":"Black & Decker was once a proud American company whose products were always solid, and whose name you could rely on.

I used this sparingly and by the 4th time after fully charging it, it did not last long enough to make it across the room. Tried charging it for 24 hours again and same thing, probably lasted 15 seconds, not exaggerating. Wish I would have used it more within the 30 days return policy to realize there was an issue. Now I will also have to pay to have this properly e-recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"I see some reviews that say run it all the way down before re-charging...that's NOT a problem, if our power goes out and I am dumb enough to grab this thing I MIGHT make it to the bath-room before it goes out, coming back you use your furniture finders (shins) I love Black and Decker but they need to watch who uses there name."},{"rating":"1","title":"As other noted, it is junk","review":"I only charged and used it 3 or 4 times.

After a couple years of never knowing if it will work or not I decided to open it up and see what I can find. The first thing I discovered is the blade connector to the positive battery terminal was lose. This explains why it finally quit working. Then I discovered the blade connector to the negative terminal did not fit tightly and was only holding on by the tension of the wire. This could explain the intermittent trouble also. By now the battery is ruined from 'abuse' and while not impossible to find a replacement it is not economically practical to replace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I read reviews and often take them with a grain of salt. I hope someone reads this and believes it 100%. This is junk, and unless you buy it as a disposable light, it's a waste. I used it a few times just to try it out when I got it 2 years ago. Worked as I expected it to. Now I try to charge it to have available for hurricane Irene and it's completely useless. I don't have any suggestions other than don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Battery life","review":"This product lasted about 3 years with intermittent use. The problem is that B&D choose the wrong type of battery which has low life span due to memory effect.

Like other say, it's scary how B&D could actually sell this complete garbage. The first use was excellent. But, unfortunately, there was only one use.

I won't purchase any B&D product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker 2 mil light","review":"This BD light is one of the best for it feature. Even though the life on the battery is limited in time. This unit you can plug in the cig lighter and continue to use it. I have seen the bigger one. But. You have only 25 minutes before it drains.

Most of the time it is pretty unmelodic and kind of disturbing in some passages. On the contrary, his cd called \\"A Blessing of tears\\" is a beautiful, soothing soundscape, made with electric guitar and a load of loops and effects.

The director has them drifting through a hallucinatory story line in the apparent belief that, if no one can actually understand what is going on whenever Genevieve Bujold pops up looking like bag-lady and spouting some nonsense, they will assume the story has Deep Meaning. Throw in some hopelessly incompetent protagonists who are pretty much just murdering thieves and the hopefully unintended stereotyping of every ethnic character who appears. Then top it off with a villain who looks, dresses and acts like Ben Stiller in an Oscar Show send-up and you can understand why all the whiskey was gone by the end of the movie. The cast and crew drank it when they realized what this project might do to their careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the music, but............","review":"the music and the beautiful scenery are the only good things about this movie. i can't even imagine that people even like this movie. besides the fact that it was completely confusing, the characters show no emotion. they were extremely too laid back. they were like oh, ho hum, that's ok that happened, we can just go over here and do this. it was like they were all on dope! i just wish i could show how it was instead of writing it. i was so disapointed in this movie that i expected it to have some of the worst reviews ever. there's just so much i want to say about this movie that i can't even write it down. i'm starting to make less sence now. errrg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where to begin?","review":"I suffered through this mystic-backwoods mess so that you don't have to!

I buy it. Boy, am I disapointed. What a bunch of crap! This is the most contrived, unmelodic, earnest bands trying to be late-80's U2 in the late 90's I have ever heard! BEWARE: before you buy, listen to the sound samples on here and ask yourself if you really need this flakiness in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"The Mollys arena friendly alternative missed mass acceptance by just a hair, they're bland enough, to be sure, but not big enough.

I was not impressed. The CD does not change my opinion. The vocals are weak, the lyrics are sappy and lame, and the songs are difficult to tell apart. I'm surprised this wasn't a hit..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a contemporary christian disc in disguise?","review":"I have listened to this cd about 12 times now and I have to say, it's 11 times too many. These guys sound a lot like a contemporary christian band. The failed attempts to emulate some kind of neo 80's U2 meets comercial Peter Gabrial meets Backstreet Boys puffed up by ego induced spirituality are very sad. The only real shining moment is the VERY pop song Sugar. I hope these guys are prepared to be compared to a host of 80's bands because that is exactly what they sound like. It reminds me of a number of bands in the midwest that have spent years playing covers of U2 and Peter Gabrial songs in the name of art. The singer has a good voice but the guitars sound like keyboards and the drums sound like a drum machine, such a shame. Can't recomend this one. That's just my opinion, I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Follow Up!","review":"If you already have Bass Hit's first album \\"Bass Is Loaded\\", then you will want this one as it is a fairly good follow up. Half of the songs fall close within the same street bass category with more techno mixed in. The other cuts start to get far out there which gives clues to what direction the third album will be like. Still not too bad, but I wouldn't go further than Bass Sub-Mission as far as collecting Bass Hit's albums unless you prefer the heavy techno/rave sound.There's several must have cuts so don't discredit it too much, although I did find Bass Is Loaded to have more cleaner sound on the street bass songs. Some of the beats is a bit demanding with transients and low end extension so if your system doesn't have good accuracy or lacks power down low it will be exposed with this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"the chocolate arrives fast enough, regretably this is the only thing good about this purchase.condition is bad. pieces are smallish and many look chipped and rough, probably due to the transportation process. some are wrapped in cheap looking red and green foils. they also taste a bit stale. i don't know how long they have stayed in the warehouse.taste is disappointing. predominate taste is sugar--with a gritty texture, not the smooth, rich taste expected of a luxury chocolate.two thumbs down. not worth the money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big name, mediocre product","review":"Another reviewer summed it up nicely: \\"The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike.\\" Additionally, the company itself is not customer friendly.

Phony dance artists and compilations all claiming their part in the acid jazz revolution in the 80s. This disk is nothing more than the slop off SoulTrain's soundtrack. Acid Jazz is supposed to entail an authentic ensemble of fast moving horns and percussion, not synthesized beat garbage. Acid Jazz is Grover T. Washington and Jazzmatazz. This disk is nothing close to acid jazz. The misnomer of a title tricked me, so felt the need to warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid fits poorly","review":"I bought this small can to use in the bathroom, and it is a pretty good size, maybe a little small, but my big problem with it is that the lid is constantly falling off- the lid fits poorly. I would return it but it is too much of a hassle. If you're considering this I would suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIMITED UTILITY with HIGH PRICE","review":"Size, design, and price are negatives; otherwise okay. The size would be appropriate for a kid's play house or maybe a kid's room. The design of the lid has two flaws: the lid does not fit snugly on the base and the swing top does not swing freely and rarely returns to close on its own. A couple of inches added to the diameter and several inches in height would make this trash can about right for an adult bathroom or a kitchen. I bought a slightly smaller one at a Dollar Tree store (yes, for one $) and somehow the manufacturer had figured out how to make the top fit snugly, design the swing top to return to neutral consistently and, appropriate for its size, render it in kids' (McD) colors. I also saw two other of \\"our\\" Umbras (in blue and black) at a thrift store each for 99cents. Both of these suffered the same design defects as the one we purchased on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Remarque","review":"I will start by stating that this is my favorite book by my favorite author Remarque. I read All Quiet on the Western Front when I was 13 and loved it so I began to delve into Remarque's less famous works. The first of these was The Road Back.The Road Back tells the story of the remains of Paul's unit from All Quiet on the Western Front. That said it is not really a sequel to the much more well known work. It begins with the final days of WWI and how the soldiers all make their way home and try to rebuild their lives. The story covers the armistice, the march back to Germany, homecoming, and the revolts that rocked postwar Germany.Remarque's style reaches its forte in this wonderful masterpiece that engages the reader. He tells of joy and sorrow, gloom and hope. At times the book is depressing but in the next scene hilarious.All in all this is a great book by a great author, and the only book by Remarque that I have read that has something approaching a \\"happy\\" ending"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tradic story","review":"This book is part two in the story that begins with \\"All quiet on the western front\\".

The book has everything that was covered in class and more. By practicing with the methods outlined in the book, it transformed my dog from a pain-in-the-neck to an excellent companion. We recently got a new puppy, and we are going to be using \\"Dog Talk\\" again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Great product and great service! Every dog owner would benefit from ownig this book. It helps in every aspect of raising my ZuChon propely! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and helpful","review":"We bought this book with two others and it was one that we referred to often. In our house we referred to the author as \\"The Arrogant One\\" as in \\"The Arrogant One says...\\" But putting that aside, it was well written and gives great descriptions and instructions. After going about raising our dog this way (and buying three or more books was the suggestion of the Monks from New Skete who raise German Shepherds), we are convinced that folks like John Ross and Barbara McKinney are essential in helping new pet owners make informed decisions. They really helped us gain a good perspective for raising our dog. Highly suggest this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT HURTS. MAKE IT STOP MOMMY!","review":"A plane's engine is on fire. The pilot opts to cut off the fuel in flight to stop the fire, however the engine doesn't restart and the plane crashes. The operator was blamed for \\"human error\\" even though the black box (never mentioned) would have exonerated the pilot. Brad Dourif plays the evil capitalist wanting to exploit the accident to promote his new CD-70 automatic pilot, based on predator drone technology. Casper Van Dien is not too sure about using the M-5 eh ah CD-70. Lets see...if I was to guess they use the CD-70, it messes up and Casper must save the day by killing giant alien bugs. And the reason why I am guessing is that it became too painful to watch the film all the way through. It was bad...real bad, as in destroy your copy, don't give it away bad.The acting and script felt like a bad movie made for TV circa 1975.

She was neither in this, just old. -- Keith Vlasak"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, i'll admit it's lame","review":"I typically like Casper Van Dien's low budget stuff, but i have to admit this felt a little under cooked.Computerized plane goes out of control, passengers freak out, Casper comes to the rescue, and it's all settled in lightning speed. If i had to pinpoint a problem, it's a lack of real tension. The plot is just a little too simplistic to serve as a compelling action-adventure vehicle. Still, it's not his worst film."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLY THE CLICHED SKIES","review":"There have been some decent airplane disaster movies-- TURBULENT SKIES is not one of them.Not only is the movie dull, its script is ludicrous, the direction by the infamous Fred Olen Ray is flaccid, and the acting community theatre level.

Pitney was a successful song writer in addition to recording his own hits. Only Love Can Break a Heart, Town Without Pity, and Half Heaven Half Heartache are outstanding ballads. The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and Twenty-four Hours From Tulsa show off Pitney's energy and outstanding voice and vocal range. Yes, there are a ton of other Pitney songs not on this CD. But, what do you expect for this kind of money?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative Book!","review":"I recommend this book highly as a stock photographer. It is informative, persuasive and wonderful! As a lover of photography, I seem to enjoy it, because it tells you how to sell and resell your photos with a formula. I am only halfway through the book at the time of this writing, but I enjoy it already. The author also talks about pricing as well as how and when to contact publishers. He also talks about the '90s way to submit things if you so choose! I also recommend the 1999 Photographer's Market book to see what publications are looking for photos from you. Both books are worth it! Get them today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great style, great information!","review":"If all you want to do is make money -- lots of it -- from your photography, this book will help you a great deal. After all, there's more to photography than artsy stuff. Many photographers take photos for a living, and stock photography is one way to do that. Those who think they can sell landscapes, birds, scenics, and wildflowers probably woouldn't buy this book in any case. The rest of us, who want to make a decent living, can learn some valuable lessons herein. By the way, making money with your camera can lead to a great deal of joy and pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy money. This book will open your eyes!!!","review":"I have only gone thru the first few chapters, and already I have gained enough information about making and selling editorial stock photgraphs to pay for the book. It is apparently a reprint of previous versions, but the authors honest 20/20 hindsight into the work of stock photography is very encouraging. It may not be for everyone, but if you are interested in taking pictures of things other than dew laden petals in a rainforest you should at least check this one out!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing.","review":"In a nutshell, the only advice this author gives is to take pictures that evoke an emotion in the viewer and send it off to every company that may want it. It does include a couple of forms, most of which are available through sites like PDN Online at no charge..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Edition Is Really Outdated","review":"So much has changed in the photography world since this was written and updated in 1997. Advice how how to submit slides and why not to buy a Mac (because hardly anyone has them) seems very odd these days. Also the formulas for creating \\"great stock pictures\\" have become outdated as well. I have no doubt this would have been a great and informative book in the 80's or 90's but because of the rapid changes in digital technology this book is kind of like reading a \\"How to Operate Your BetaMax\\" manual. Perhaps the newer versions would be money better spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, Interesting and Surpising","review":"I found this book to be a wealth of information on what information tracks people, is public, or provided to anyone for a minimal fee. I was especially surpised to find information about MYSELF...which is why I bought 'Hide your assets and disappear'. I agree with another review that states that the book is interesting and helps explain how people are traced..but fails to instruct exactly HOW it is you should go about it. I would have liked to have seen a more precise, instructional book...but I still recommend this as a great read. Using the book's advice and the internet I've come across lots of information that has proved useful. It's a small investment with a big pay-off in knowledge. Perhaps he'll write a follow-up where he goes into more detail. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK and enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A teaser","review":"Apparently Mr. Pankau thinks his readers aren't savvy enough to realize his books contain just enough information to \\"make you dangerous\\", but not enough to follow through thoroughly.

I was amazed at just how quickly the lotion soothed my skin. Using it at home and at the gym made a huge difference. There is no fragrance and the lotion has very soothing effects. The SPF is an added bonus. Having very sensitive skin that is easily irritated, particularly with heat and friction, this product worked wonders.I highly recommend the Triple Protect Lotion and am in the process of placing an order so that I do not have to use anything else. Unfortunately there haven't been any packages on the clearance table over the past several months. I was a little disappointed that Santa forgot to deliver some this holiday season but the offer on Amazon for 3 tubes is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I use this as my aftershave and it also provides protection from the sun.

I didn't suspect this caused it, and went to see the dermatologist who gave me something to fix those.It took me a couple of weeks to clear out my skin, and I started using this again. Within 2 days I developed even a worse rash than before. This time I figured it was this lotion.Then I actually looked at the back of the lotion, and noticed a warning. \\"Stop using if a rash develops\\". I had no idea that using a lotion can cause such a bad rash. May be that's a standard warning on other lotions too, but I've never noticed it before. I didn't even think that's possible, but then my dermatologist said that it's probably the \\"anti aging\\" part of it that caused it.Anyway, just a warning for someone who might be trying it out for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Track List","review":"I ordered and received the Glenn Miller CD titled In The Mood, but it had different cover art and a different track list than described for this item.

I don't necessarily think that it is better or worse than Turbo Tax, which is the software that I usually use and will probably be using next year. But my question is this: Its Feb. 12, where is the state version? The PC version is out, why does it take so long to get the Mac version? I got an email saying that the State Mac Version for Virginia was available to download, only to go to their web site and find that it wasn't available except for ordering.I think this will be the first and last year I use TurboTax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-intuitive interface and functionality","review":"I found this software very strange. I have used TurboTax online in the past and things have been a breeze. My taxes changed signifigantly this year so I decided to buy Taxcut because it doesn't have Spyware. Taxcut would have skipped quite a few deductions had I not known that I could take certain deductions - I kind of had to force myself into the forms and override certain things. Also, I did my roomates' taxes and it skipped over a $3000 education deduction that she was entitled too. I don't really care for the interview style of filing - answering a series of questions and it files your taxes according to your answers - because it missed several deductions I was entitled to. All in all, I'm very dissappointed and won't be using this software again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget any support for Mac users!!","review":"Bought this program, as I have for several years, to do my taxes early. TaxCut always wishes for you to do an \\"update\\" on their software before using it. When I tried to update, I got a message that the update would not be available until mid February. When I wrote support and complained and ask about it, they said not to expect an update for the Mac until the end of February. Then, I was told later, they didn't know when it would be updated. What good is it if I can't do my taxes with it when I purchase it? The Windoz version is already complete according to their site. Save yourself the hassle and get another program for the Mac to do your taxes this year!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of an Imperfect Lot","review":"I don't find TurboTax (or anything from Intuit) to be particularly well-designed from an interface perspective, and TaxCut also has some flaws.

They said it would be ready in mid-February, but now customer support says they do not know when it will be ready for the Mac. I don't know how many other forms they are missing, so Turbotax may be a better buy even though it is overpriced for the Mac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors in the software","review":"The taxcut state version showed up. Too bad it has errors in it. In Virginia, the 529 plan is limited to a $2000 deductible per account. Would have been nice if the program has known that. I am scared to submit my taxes using this software without checking them by hand. If I have to check them by hand, I would have done them that way. Oh well, back to TurboTax and its macintosh tax. At least I never worried that my taxes were done incorrectly using that software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pay Back Time for Terrorists","review":"If you like to see the terrorists get what's coming to them, this is the book to read.

A group of 5 men stalk various terrorists on their official hit list in Europe and a couple of others thrown in for good measure. Unfortunately they don't get them all and a side story of involvement with a mafia type connection for information makes this book a real page turner. Nothing like the bad guys getting greased with their own methods. I've read it 3 times and I'm about to start again.

I like most of the selections, but at less than 40 minutes, it's just too short. There were more songs they could have added. Several \\"live\\" tracks appeared on the VSC Volume 5 disc, which was released after this one. My favorite cuts are Vanessa singing What Child is This?, Rockin' Around the Xmas Tree by Mary J. and Sheryl, Christmas Tears by Eric, O Holy Night by Tracy and S.

I have rather large hands, and I could not play for more than an hour as my hands and thumbs would cramp. With this grip, I can easily play for 5+ hours without much strain. It is an absolutely \\"must have\\".The reason for only 4 stars:I dont see this grip last longer than 2 months with active gaming. The item itself is kind of flimsy. The prongs use tension to hold the psp, so I see them break very soon, as you have to take it off to change a memory stick or UMD. I can see them break very easily after taking psp in and out a bunch of times. I am actually considering ordering another one of these as a back up, as I dont want to be stuck without one when it breaks. But the item is so cheap, that it is probably worth it.A must buy for any psp owner, but be careful with prongs when taking psp in and out, so this grip lasts.Good item.Thanks for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentle, and not Smelly!","review":"I really like this Sunscreen...

I loved their first CD \\"Duets,\\" but this record is horrible. There are too many comic relief numbers, which get old after, say, one listen. A lot of the production sounds very 70's cheesy.

These girls have obviously never heard of subtlety. They are singing purely from their steel lungs and not at all from the head or the heart or the gut as truly gifted song enterpreters instinctively do. Instead Emily sings jackhammer to Alices' powerdrill and the results chase my cats out of the room every time I attempt to listen to more than a song or two. \\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\\" is the easiest target since it is totally devoid of humanity, but some of the others come mighty close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuspecting Listener","review":"Very disappointed in this CD especially after reading the amazon listener reviews.

I was suspicious of this follow-up album. After Side Show and Duets, I smelled a quick-buck marketing scheme in the works. Bravo to both artists for turning in warm, heart-felt performances and giving us some great listening material as a result. Skinner and Ripley's blend cannot be beat. I've yet to hear two female performers who better compliment each other's style. And the solo material nearly eclipses the shared songs. Emily Skinner's rendition of Sondheim's \\"Miller's Son\\" made my eyes snap wide open. The liner notes are correct -- she is Petra. And Alice Ripley in \\"Losing Track of Time\\" wraps herself around the lyrics and illustrates how delicious the line between pain and joy in love can be. Don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than their first one","review":"I'm glad I didn't pay too much attention to the customer reviews that called this CD a letdown -- I enjoyed this one even more than their \\"Duets\\" CD - a couple of standouts are \\"Old Friends\\" and \\"The Last Duet/Enough is Enough\\" Just the right mix of uptempo numbers and ballads. A great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must purchase!","review":"I stumbled upon Emily Skinner and Alice Ripley after seeing them perform \\"I Will Never Leave You\\" during the Tony Awards. I immediately bought the Sideshow album and fell in love. These women have amazing voices, and such talent. It takes special talent to be sing, and it takes even more talent to be able to put emotion into voice they way they do. I read about Duets in Parade Magazine, immediately ordered, and listen to it at least once a week, if not more. And now I've stumbled upon Unsuspecting Hearts. I must say, these women get better with each recording, and this recording shines. I adore the solo songs as well as the duets. All I have to say is that I hope The Last Duet really isn't the last one. I adore these women and highly recommend their albums to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this album!!!","review":"I was fortunate enough to see the SIDE SHOW and I was blown away by Alice and Emily.

It's great. Emily redefined \\"The Miller's Son\\" for me. First time I understood the words completely! \\"Live with somebody you love\\" is a bit weak, but passable.These are rich albeit a bit schmaltzy arrangements, and if you like good women Broadway Belters, they'd fit the bill"},{"rating":"2","title":"music review first - baseball second","review":"This is a fine CD. Song selection is top notch. Arroyo's vocals are very good, even great in spots. I'm not always wild about the mix, though (that's the engineer, not Arroyo).\\"Dirty Water\\" will be the signature song of this CD, partly because of the Sox connection, but also because Arroyo's vocals go beyond technique and become (for lack of a better word) inspired. My favorite is \\"Something's Always Wrong\\" because I think he really gets into the song; the vocal is really convincing. My least favorite is \\"The Freshman\\" because it lacks the emotion it needs to succeed (although I guess the song sounds tired to me no matter who sings it.)I'd love to see him expand his repertoire more, maybe adding some blues inspiration. Have only seen short clips of live performances, but from what I've seen, he does make the material more his own than is evident on this recording.If I'd bought this CD not knowing who recorded it, I'd still be very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is garbage","review":"I can't beleive how crappy this is.

If you liked the 90's grunge sound, then you should love 'Covering the Bases.' Bronson Arroyo's deep and gutteral voice lends itself perfectly to the grunge sound. If imitation is the best form of compliment, then his cover for each song is a tribute to the original. All songs are sung with the deep emotion they were intended. And to end the album with the very upbeat and quirky 'Dirty Water' is just pure brilliance. I love the added bonus of the background vocals by Sox teammates Johnny Damon, Lenny DiNardo, and Kevin Youkilis. I can't help but smile when I hear their silly tributes to Boston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Bronson can SING! As a Red Sox fan I knew he could pitch, but this is a great surprise. I love the songs he put on the CD. His version of Everlong is amazing; the guitars WICKED!The whole CD is great; I do not skip ONE song.The addition of Stephen King and some of the Sox players makes it even more interesting for Boston fans, but anyone who loves good rock will enjoy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covering the Bases","review":"Excellent first run for a new artist. Great voice & energy in his work. I am looking forward to his future recordings as he finds his style & song types that he is attracted to perform. It is a surprise that a Red Sox player can do anything well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon Bronson!","review":"I just have to say what a terrible production this is. First of all, the covers are complete sound-a-likes to the originals. There is absolutely NO change. Except that of the vocal performance. Listen, those songs were hits because the performances were nailed (and edited) just right. It sounds like Bronson tried to do these in only a few takes...and probably with the help of Antares AutoTune (pitch corrector).In short, nothing creative, nothing great. If you love it because he's a Red Sock, well I still don't understand. I'm a huge Sox fan, but would much rather listen to the timeless originals instead of a feable attempt to recreate what need not be recreated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. CD.

Her journey there and her craftiness soon after arriving make for really engaging reading. Perhaps more compelling is the story of her fellow Venetian captive, Giorgio, whose enslavement is all the more poignant since it involves a drastic and brutal transformation that comes out at the end of the novel.

It looks great on line but in my hands it is flimsy. Rather then send back I took it to Goodwill and gave it away. Yes, it was that bad. With shipping it cost $54.00 and I blame myself as I should know better you can not get a good creeper for $30+ dollars. At least I can write it off as a charity item.

This band deserved more success than it received but failed to \\"brand\\" itself. (Forgive the marketing terminology. What can I say -- I sold out YEARS ago.) Ironically, the popularity of Frigid Pink's first hit, House of the Rising Sun, was probably the first step toward the band's undoing. It established the Pinksters as a cover band without their own identity. The best cut on this, their follow-up album, is Pain in My Heart, which seems to be incorrectly listed as Pain in My Head.

Country, bebop, rock and roll, blues, and classic ballads by Gershwin are all here and all masterfully done. It is a paradox to me that a blind man can be such a visually powerful talent. I thought the production values were very high. The sound was excellent. The selection of music great, and I found the interview with him to be both inspiring and touching.

The author was Dav Pilkey and the book is called Super Diaper Baby. It's funny and I'm sure you will love it as much as I did. So if you really like it you could read it about 4-6 times. So I went to Borders and bought that book. What are you waiting for go? Go and get Super Diaper Baby. It's a comic book. Have fun reading it. I wish you the best of luck . My favorite part was when Super Diaper Baby destroyed the Robo Ant 2000 and Deputy Doo Doo got really mad at Super Diaper Baby. It's going to make you read it over and over again. So don't miss Super Diaper Baby coming to a store near you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is hilarous!","review":"I have read this book several times, and I laugh out loud every time I read it.

When Super Diaper Baby 2 comes out, I'll be sure to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too simple...","review":"The premise of the book, our Captain Underpants heroes writing their own book is a good one, but not well-executed. The comic book style was not very engaging, and my 7 year old (a good reader, tho) was done in about 10 minutes. I missed the peals of laughter a la Professor Poopiepants, and the illustrations didn't grab him, either. This might be a good step for a reluctant reader, prior to the \\"chapter books\\" in this series. For us, though, this one was put down and forgotten, unlike others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE WORST BOOK EVER","review":"I dont know if this is because I am a girl in sixth grade...but I would LOVE to rate this book ZERO stars. I know people like it because they say \\"it encourages children to read\\" but when children read, they should be reading something good for them, that they can actually LEARN from. In other words: not this crap. Speaking of crap, that's what the story's about. It reminded me of a South Park episode and the only readers who can possibly enjoy this are anyone who really immature. I can go on and on about the pointless spelling errors and all of the offensive things in the book but I think other people who rated this book with two stars or less have said everything.

The book was read by my wife and I and then quickly confiscated. The book is completely inappropiate for children and serves no educational purpose.

I am aware of the author's and some educators' claim that such books are necessary to get some children to read. What rot!!!!The worth of reading is measured not by the number of books read but the quality of the literature. This book, and I can only assume all books in this series, is nothing but garbage.

That stated, and as my title implies, this was a missed opportunity by the producers. If they had increased the budget for state-of-the-art special effects, put in a little more details, and expanded the script by about a 1/2 an hour or more, this could have been a major summer movie or, more probably, a better-than-average made-for-TV movie.This is a good show with a good premise and your average, and sometimes better-than-average, acting by some TV actors: Micha Collins/\\"Supernatural\\", Torri Higginson/\\"Stargate: Atlantis\\", Hill Harper/\\"CSI: NY\\" etc.This is, also, one of the few efforts by the Syfy channel (I really hate that aconym) that is definitely worth a look and possibly a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded better on paper","review":"Man, what a downer. Got this because i'm a Misha Collins fan, but this is a weak film by almost any standard, with all its potential lost in bad writing, weak transition and squandered opportunities for suspense. Plot seems good in theory, with stonehenge revealed as some kind of ancient machine that is gearing up to terraform the planet...at the expense of killing mankind. But a subplot involving a cult leader is laughable, and the military response of attempting to nuke the ancient site to stop the end of the world seems straight out of a 50s black and white film.

The thumb has to be at just the right place to put enough pressure on them to close them.I pulled out the Melissa & Doug plastic scissors I already had ( a few months ago she was having trouble with them) and she quickly got the hang of them this time around.

Just wait for your kid to be able to start with regular scissors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I wanted to like these scissors for my preschooler, I really did. It seemed like such a great idea. Our pair was challenging to push together, and the blades stuck near the end. Also, the cutting edge does not reach all the way to the tip, and there's a raised edge around the outside of the scissors which makes it incredibly difficult to see the line, if you're trying to cut one. They are okay for chopping up confetti and random cutting, but no use whatsoever if you're really trying to cut something out - I have an extremely challenging time doing that myself with these (or had, anyway - we ended up throwing these out). A few months of practice and some great cutting books made regular kid scissors a much nicer investment for my daughter. At 3 1/2, she can now cut anything she wants to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for a bright 26 month old child","review":"My granddaughter frequently asks for scissors when she sees an adult using them.

I have never witnessed one scissors accident involving kids (read: kids) in my entire lifetime, nor have heard urban myth/horror rumors detailing the bloody experiences of scissors and sniffly preschoolers. Hey, it comes naturally anyway...my 3.99 year old has been cutting by herself with hobbit-sized, tot-geared, \\"regular\\" Fiskars scissors for about a year and a half now, sans hovering directional guidance due to the fact that I was just too busy and weary to offer said guidance.

This causes it to make a sound as it changes your settings. Very annoying to have to reset it back to what you had it to before2) Intermittent freezing of phone. I'm not sure if it is the phone's operating system or if it is just a defective unit. Either way, it is annoying for me to have to open and close then try to power off and power on the phone to get it to respond again.3) Slow response to buttons being pressedI am looking at other phones to buy to replace this one.

It's light and fits well in any pocket. However, the buttons (or software) don't respond quickly when pressed. My friend has an older Motorola flip phone and any time you pressed a button, it responded quickly. Not so with the V400. Sometimes it takes almost 2 full seconds before your button press gets a response. For example, to pull up the list of previously-called numbers, you press the SEND button once. That always takes over 1 second before the list is displayed. It gets annoying after a while. I'm still used to my old Nokia 3600 (?) model that responded the instant I hit any button.Also, it's annoying that you can't just turn on speakerphone prior to making a call. You have to wait for the call to be completed.Overall a good phone with tons of great features.

Over 10 months, both phones failed, and eventually Cingular gave me a V551 (which also sucks for the same reasons).Other complaints:Takes too long to load new menus or change characters when text messaging.Cheap flip hinge will make noises that makes the phone sound like it will come in two.Port on bottom will not work after you carry the phone around for a couple of weeks. Charging portion still good, but transfer port goes bad.Cliffnotes: I am done with Motorola V series phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone is good until earpiece dies","review":"I have had this phone for about ~1 year. Recently I have only barely been able to hear the person I am talking to on the phone. At first I attributed this to maybe a bad connection, but then I found out a friend was having similar problems. I looked on the internet and found people were having similar problems. This phone is WORTHLESS, it can have all the features in the world but if you cant hear the person you are talking to what is the point.I recommend not buying this phone. If you are looking to buy another motorola I would check to make sure that it doesnt have similar earpiece problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"do NOT buy this phone","review":"I have had this phone for about 5 months now and I'm getting rid of it as soon as possible.It drops calls when I have full service.It randomly just won't ring when I have service, just beeps when someone leaves me a voicemail.On a clear day, if I stand in the exact same spot the service will go from 5 bars to 0 bars and then back up to 5.I have the media text messaging and that randomly won't work.After I've fully charged the battery I'll receive a 10 min. phone call and all of the sudden the battery will go dead.My husband is on the same plan as I am and has a Nokia phone. He has never had any problems, so we know that it's not the service.My advice to you is not the buy this phone...my husband has had 2 different Nokia phones in the past few years and has never had a problem with any of them. I have had 2 Motorola phones and have had continuous problems with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Phone","review":"This is an ok phone, but needs to have more ringtones available, with a louder setting for use in noisy areas. I signed up for the Family Talk plan through Cingular, and so far it's been ok. I do have some issues with Cingular's customer service though. In short, it stinks!(unless you're lucky enough to talk to someone who actually knows what they're doing). Overall, the phone itself serves its purpose pretty well. One more thing...I tried to speak to the manufacturer (Motorola) about some of the features--bad idea. I was connected to someone in ARGENTINA!! Of course he was unable to help me. SO, it was back to Cingular. No real issues with the phone except the ringtones and the volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I ever had","review":"I am a person who has gone through a lot of different cell phones through different servers. I have never had a phone that sucked as much as the motorola v400. I had this phone for 4 months before it started acting up. My ear piece stopped working and I would constantly have to put people on speaker phone and expose my conversation to those around. I called Cingular and they sent me the same phone. Two months after having the phone guess what? Yeah the ear piece stopped working again. And then my speaker phone started to have a volume control problem. Sometimes it was loud and others it wasn't. The buttons stopped working, and the screen would go blank. I am guessing that this phone is a real piece of crap because I called Cingular and they are sending me a different motorola because this one has been discontinued. I swear, I will never buy a motorola cell phone again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for order problems","review":"Yeah the phone itself is ok, but the real problem with this whole offer is ordering through Amazon.com, as noted by another review already. I had a similar experience in which Amazon contacted me via email and explained that more info was needed to process the application....so when you try to \\"Revise the order\\" the operation times out when attempting to contact Amazon servers. In short, you can't update the order with whatever credit info that they claim is needed. I contacted Cingular directly and was approved in about 2 minutes, and after placing another order with Amazon I actually got the phone. But the other funny thing is, you can't cancel the original order because the operation keeps timing out when contacting Amazon's servers again. So I emailed them and have gotten no response as of yet. We'll see what happens on that, so caveat emptor for all ya'll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Complicated Phone and Terrible Reception","review":"I have now had my V-400 for a year.

The first one he had, the person on the other end could not hear you talking at all - it was like no one was there! The phone was brand new! He had it replaced with the same phone and this one you could not hear anything on it! He finally sent it back and just got a totally different brand of phone entirely. I don't know if we just got two bad phones or if this phone is just not a good phone. Either way, we'll never have another one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cingular service is deceptive","review":"My review is on Cingular. I bought a phone w/service and was told I could return for full refund and only charged for any air time used. THEY LIE. THE PHONE DID NOT WORK IN MY AREA AND I CANCELLED THE NEXT DAY.

Amazon will also do nothing to reimburse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola V400","review":"The Motorola V400 is a phone that combines both elegance and business into a simple easy to use device. The v400 comines with a spacious color display and VGA camera.

With mp3 ringtones, a built in song mixer, and Multimedia Messaging the v400 is the perfect phone for any person."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing mobile phone!","review":"I have just recently started using all of the features of this phone. I was tempted to get one after I saw my friend's V300 with T-Mobile. I have AT&T Service and this phone was only unlocked to Cingular Wireless so when i bought it (second hand) it had to be unlocked by a 3rd party company for $25. Other than that, this phone has been amazing. The data cable is great for getting MP3 ringtones, keeping up with my Outlook data and also sending pictures I take to my computer. All of the memory on this phone is great for storing pictures (the camera has great quality) as well as MP3 files, contacts and Microsoft Outlook calandar data. I highly reccomend this phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"webmerch","review":"1- The worst manual(documentation) i have ever seen for a cell phone2- Side-mounted buttons that make it difficult to so much as pick up the phone without inadvertently activating something3- Gave it to my kids as a toy since this is absolutley garbage.

However, one particular customer wrote out her check at the register to Rich's. The lady behind the counter reminded her that the store was now called macy's.

John Landry, in his review above, said everything I wanted to say.Enjoy this album and have a Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Amy's third Christmas CD (the 4th if you count the \\"Animals Christmas\\" collaboration with Art Garfunkel) is by far the weakest of the batch.There's little of the festive frolic or energy of the earlier releases and in fact Amy's vocal performance sounds just plain tired and melancholy on many of these songs.The project starts off with a pretty good bang with the title song and then it's all downhill from there.>The bonus track of \\"Merry Christmas Darling\\" is not on this version but it's no great loss. Amy's take on the Carpenters classic contains little of the sparkle or passion of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"hidden surprise- Merry Christmas Darling","review":"Not a bad album but not great either. First three cuts are the best, and \\"Mr. Santa\\" is fun, but the two instrumentals and the closing classical piece are overblown. Amy seems disconnected from it all. She is still a good writer, but on this disc, her vocals sound as if she is going through the motions. If you purchase this disc at Target, the bonus cut is the Carpenters classic. Certainly nice, even includes the multilayered vocal ending, but it sure made me appreciate (again) the rich uniqueness of Karen Carpenter's voice. \\"Home for Christmas\\", the 2nd Amy Christmas disc, (not counting \\"Animals Christmas\\" with Art Garfunkel) is a much better project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Christmas Feeling","review":"Our family gets into the true Christmas spirit as we listen to Christmas to Remember throughout the holidays.

And it should as this CD has a certain quality of poignancy about it although songs like Mr Santa , a take on Mr sandman spoils it but with a few listenings, the whole CD flows beautifully. Til the season comes round again is simply beeautiful and this version brings out the sadness happiness in the lyrics. This is one of the best Amy Grant interpretation I have heard and dont understand why it does not get more prominence. Can anyone reading this point me to where I can get the original studio series trax from Word for this song? I know its out of stock and was only available on cassette but I dont mind getting my hands on a used copy. The arrangements on this track is sublime and I just have to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"My husband bought this on accident.

It is always at the top of my Christmas playlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essence of Christmas warmth","review":"On first listen, I was unsure whether this cd matched the excellence of Amy Grant's \\"A Christmas Album\\" but playing it through again there was no doubt that this is her best Christmas cd. Both fun with a touch of whimsy and beautifully romantic, this album captures the essence of Christmas warmth. Perhaps only Nat King Cole (whom is referenced in the title track) could have done it better. This has become our absolute favorite Christmas album!! The dreamy anticipation captured in \\"Christmas Can't be Very Far Away\\" and the longing sentimentality of \\"'Til the Season Comes Round Again\\" touch on all that the season is and should be. Believe it or not, we have put this cd on in the middle of the summer when life seems too hectic and we are in desperate need of some spirit. I would reccomend this cd to anyone who expects beauty, grace and warmth from the Christmas season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Her Best Christmas CD Yet","review":"What a great collection for the holidays. She so well captures all aspects of the season and focuses the listener on the true reason for the season. Way To Go Amy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grant continues the Christmas tradition","review":"With her third Christmas album, Grant again shoots for the formula that seemed to work so well with her two previous Christmas albums. Like those, this one features Christmas favorites, some originals, beautiful instrumentals, and some light-hearted numbers.Listener's will remember \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\" from the motion picture \\"The Mission.\\" I didn't expect this piece on this album and so when I heard it I was genuinely caught off guard and surprised to tears. It's a very moving piece.\\"Highland Cathedral\\" is also very enjoyable, as are \\"A Christmas to Remember,\\" \\"Christmas Lullaby\\", and \\"Agnus Dei.\\"As I've mentioned in my other reviews of Grant's Christmas albums, my least favorite songs are the playful ones. This album features a couple as well - \\"Jingle Bell Rock\\" and \\"Mister Santa.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to \\"Home for Christmas\\"!","review":"Now, i have been a big fan of Amy Grant's christmas albums, since \\"home for christmas\\" which is the best christmas album ever in my opinion. it offered everything you could imagine, from the beautiful \\"Breath of Heaven\\", to classics like \\"Have yourself a merry little christmas\\". but this one falls way short. i was anxious to put it on, and i was a bit dissapointed. the first track is a bit corny and suggests \\"listening to nat king cole\\", and is not a very memorable song. the tracks are a bit bland and sometimes you dont even know the tracks are changing! the best song (and stupidest) is Mister Santa, which cries Mister Santa Bring me some Toys! We've wiped our nosies!\\" and stuff like that. its a fun song. its an alright christmas album, but i would DEFINATELY go with Home for Christmas. this one doesnt measure up at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Giant Snooze","review":"I have probably 30 Christmas CD's by various artists, including Amy Grant's first X-mas album, which is the very best one in my entire collection.

I'll sell it to you REAL Cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No One Sings Christmas Like Carpenter","review":"I was pleased to hear Merry Christmas Darling at the end of this album, as I think it is such a great Christmas song. But it only made me want to hear Karen's magical voice again. Amy does an alright job, but Karen blows it away. The rest of this album is alright, but not worth a fuss over. If you have either of Grant's other two Christmas albums, you have enough. Meanwhile, if you don't have the carpenters \\"Christmas Collection\\" look it up on Amazon, read the reviews and buy it quick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Christmas to forget","review":"Verrrrrry disappointing. I loved Grant's first two Christmas offerings and looked forward to listening to her 3rd. I was so bummed by this cd that I had to run to the store and pick up a few other new Christmas records (A Christmas Story by fellow christian singers Point of Grace and the new wavish \\"Happy Christmas Vol. 2,\\" both of which I loved) to erase the pain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Christmas CD","review":"This album is Amy Grant's best Christmas CD. I believe I have all of them, and I enjoy all of them, but this CD has both old favorites and several new songs to me.

There were only a couple good songs. I love \\"Welcome to our World.\\" But on the whole, I don't care for the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Third Time is NOT a Charm","review":"I'm a longtime Amy Grant fan, but this album just doesn't cut it for me. Most of the songs are mediocre at best. Sure, there's the symphony, and sure there's some nice vocals, but the song selection is poor. Her second Christmas album is clearly superior in both quality and song selection. I'll be listening to \\"Home For Christmas\\" a lot this year, but not the new one. I guess Amy can't be expected to come through every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our #1 Christmas CD","review":"We have a large collection of Christmas CDs, including Amy's two earlier CDs.

I'll have to say I was never happy about her going main-stream and I don't like her new music that much but I still love her! The concert blew me away. The songs were so wonderful. I wasn't in the Christmas mood, being Thanksgiving weekend and all but she put on a Wonderful show w/Michael W. Smith, Point of Grace and the Katinas. But her songs were more than just Christmas songs we've heard year after year. There were some new ones which were really awesome! Overall, I have to say I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and fun and worshipful","review":"This is my FAVORITE Christmas CD! I enjoy the fun songs and connect with Christ and God through the lyrics and music of the modern and traditional Christian pieces. Grant's voice is lovely.

Even using the component video output, \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" appeared blurry and there were too many \\"jaggies\\" even when I adjusted the progressive scan playback settings. Worst of all, it couldn't seem to output in the right aspect ratio, so everything appeared squashed.

Stars And Bars finds Neil and familar Crazy Horse bandmates in top form as they rip through an inspired set of classics like Saddle Up The Palomino, Hey Babe, Hold Back The Tears, Star Of Bethlehem and the sensational Like A Hurricane.Wonderful remastering job by Warner Records, in capturing the sheer energy of this vintage recording. The sound simply jumps out at you in torrents of sonic energy like...like...well... LIKE A HURRICANE!!!! Now if Warner Records would only reissue the last remaining gem in Young's phenomal 70's output, that being Time Fades Away. This one may very well be his most underrated album of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Bout Time, Neil","review":"I remember reading an interview with Neil Young several years ago where he said he'd never allow this recording to be released on CD. I was upset because it's always been one of my favorites of his. \\"Like A Hurricane\\" is one of his standards, almost always performed in concert. \\"Star Of Bethlehem\\" is among the best songs he ever wrote and played. \\"Will To Love\\" is another jewel in Mr. Young's catalogue. I'm especially glad he realized we fans want this CD and particularly pleased with the remastering. As a bonus, it's being sold at reduced costs rather than full retail. This is a special gift from Neil to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Neil's best but still a strong album","review":"The late 60s to late 70s were a particularly strong 10 years for America's premiere singer/songwriter, Neil Young. He churned out classics disks like \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\", \\"Harvest\\", \\"Tonight's The Night\\" and \\"After The Gold Rush\\". Somewhere in there was this album, \\"American Stars N Bars\\", which doesn't quite hold up to the others, but is still powerful, in its own right.\\"Like A Hurricane\\" is an ass-kicker of a rocker. I'm not a musician, but it seems to be set to a 3/4 waltz time, which is uncommon for a blistering tune like this. \\"Will to Love\\" and \\"Star of Bethlehem\\" are gorgeous, sensitive melodies, which are among Young's best. It's the clanker tunes that cost \\"American Stars N Bars\\" the fifth star. \\"Saddle Up the Palomino\\", \\"Old Country Waltz\\" and \\"Homegrown\\" are real throwaway tunes that don't belong on any album.

It is a collection of articles from experts in a variety of different traditions.

If these girls were a bit fatter and less blond do you think they would even figure in the charts?!! The music is rehashed stuff and you'd think that second time round they would have added some creative originality to the work. However true to their lack of real musical talent and vision we have here a very mediocre CD album. I would rate the worst album by Neil Diamond a much better choice than this tripe!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitten Power","review":"It may be Euro-pop, but it is definitely some of the best Euro-pop that I have ever run across. I fell in love with \\"Whole Again\\" while vacationing in Germany, and had to have the album. Three months later, I still listen to it regularly. From the disco-inspired Right Now, Turn Me On, and I Want Your Love, to the softer tunes like You Are and Tonight & Tomorrow, there is a nice variety of sounds to listen to here. Their cover of Eternal Flame doesn't quite live up to the Bangles version, but Strangers is evocative of some of the better songs from T'Pau. Some of the lyrics are inane, but they have very pleasant voices and a good strong beat. And how can you not love a band that calls themselves Atomic Kitten? There's nothing wrong with making music fun. I highly recommend this album to any fan of pop music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked","review":"I'm a massive Atomic Kitten fan.

Mr. Dudley is a gifted author who illuminates the principles of grace in a way that will transform you, especially if you share my religious background.Mixing humor with common sense evaluations of human nature, he explains very simply and clearly how grace works from the inside out. His theology is sound, his doctrine is biblical, and he doesn't fall into the trap of excusing sin for the sake of grace. He holds to a high standard of Christian living, but explains that we have to cooperate with God in order for Him to direct our lives by trusting in His goodness, not our own.Quite funny anecdotes and kind, yet pointed advice make this a great primer for those who are frustrated with trying to improve themselves, by themselves. Dudley says \\"sit down inside\\" and let God take over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wellspring of hope for those weary of religion","review":"If one is looking for an answer on how to get off the religious treadmill, this book is for you.Mr. Hall is a gifted speaker who sees beyond the surface issues and gets to the heart of the matter with Christianity.He challenges the reader to re-examine grace as the main emphasis of the Good News that God loves people and has doneall He can to restore the relationship with sinful man. Many books are written to pass on information, but this volume is for your transformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once your a member you can't get out!!!","review":"I signed up for this magazine for my boyfriend.

I was pretty much crying by the end of the movie and I NEVER cry because of movies. The director, and producer, executed this film in one of the most perfect ways.

Almost anything that I could say, \\"well-written, compelling, a must-read\\" ring hollow and trite in view of what Wells and his fellow Jews suffered, and the story he tells. Yet, I do feel that this book is a must-read, for we must never allow this to happen again. It's amazing to me that it did, that it could. But we must never underestimate man's capacity for evil, or for apathy--this book is a lesson and a guide for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 Stars","review":"In the decades that have passed since Aslan first got on the move, readers of all ages have been fascinated by the lands of Narnia created by Clive Staples Lewis. Inevitably, analysis has been applied to the books, finding the hidden meanings in the fantasy, debating whether fantasy is appropriate for Christians to read, and so forth. Finally, someone has gone in and examined the books, particularly the first volume, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, from as close to Lewis' own perspective as an outside observer can come. We get to see how Lewis conceived his world and what his intent actually was. Though the biographical details are not predominant, it is shown how they play into the story and what influenced the final results. Each chapter has discussion questions included, making this an ideal book for small group study, especially in light of the upcoming film.Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy well made straws","review":"The Glad Flex Straws are well made, and very sturdy.

When I learned he was only 30, I was completely turned off to Jake and the story, an unrealistic, sappy tale with an \\"I'm holier-than-thou\\" vibe that is numbing. It only got worse from there.Dull and cliched, the plot plods along, but although it's a sad story, you can't get anything up for it except for a snicker here or there. There's nothing worse than obviousness and false sentimentality in writing. The worst of it is that the author continuously interjects his trite opinions about the world, such as this gem, \\"I don't like aggressive people.\\" Ugh.What really put the kabbash on it for me was the whole 9/11 tired subplot with the ex-girlfriend.

Jake and Janet meet when she backs her car into his pickup truck at a doughnut shop. Janet has cystic fibrosis and her health is deteriorating rapidly. Jake, a carpenter and an artist, is determined to do all he can for her. Despite the difficulty of the subjects, it is often quite funny. There is a scene where Jake wrestles, in anger, with the governor of Massachusetts, which is not something you see all the time. The story is told with compassion and generosity and the characters are fully realized. We see good people do bad things and bad people do good things, just like every day life. The novel is wise, heartfelt and entertaining. Everything you'd want when you buy a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I really enjoyed the book. I wanted a bit more out of the ending and it is a bit confusing - my book club is still trying to figure it out, but overall I thought the book was good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a satisfying book","review":"I was a little hesitant to read this book - it sounded too much like a run-of-the-mill disease-of-the-week story. I was very pleasantly surprised. Roland Merullo manages to avoid sappiness and maudlin sentimentality. There is a lot of warmth to the writing, and the main character is instantly likeable.It didn't take me long to be thoroughly invested in the characters, to honestly care what happens to them. As a former nurse who has cared for CF patients, I found the medical aspects handled well, but in such a way as to not draw the attention away from the personalities and relationships that form the heart of the book.All in all, a good book to read while having a nice cup of tea on a dreary winter afternoon.

Howard Kaylan places his mark on all of the songs on this album. His dominating vocals which have been the forefront of the Turtles and Flo & Eddie, hasn't lost his touch. Every song on this album shows the versatility of Kaylans' voice and the ease with which he can provide the listener with beautiful \\"Music\\". Get a copy of this album and you can also say that \\"everywhere you look....dust bunnies\\". Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"Howard Kaylan, one half of Flo and Eddie, and half of the singing voices of the Turtles, has come out with a solo album after over 40 years in the music business. And it is great. I have always loved his voice, and his choice of material on this CD is great. It would be hard to categorize exactly what kind of music it is, it's not trendy, the songs are not well known, and it's kind of an anachronism. But it sounds great, and I am hoping that another project is in the works soon, because I enjoy listening to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust Bunnies - not what I thought - Dust is right","review":"The person who sung \\"Happy Together\\" and \\"Elenore\\", I was really surprised - I didn't like the music, not even the singing.

Rising from a 17-year-old steel guitar player at Opryland, USA to becoming Shania Twain's first bandleader, road manager, and steel guitar player, Terry lets the reader in on what it's like to play on the road, be a studio musician, and to get the \\"ultimate\\" gig. From his early days of playing at Opryland to the pickin' parties he instigated on the road, Terry presents a realistic look at the Music Biz. Never one to dwell only on the triumphs, Terry gives the reader an honest look at the mistakes and tragedies. Running through the book is the one thing that kept him going through the joys and the heartaches, his faith.Any country music fan will be missing a sure bet if they pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The early days","review":"When I saw the book, I started reading.As more I red, as more I would come to the end, to see and understand.Terry took me into a world, unknown so far for me, but...with several well known names.let me tell you this, when Terry or others write books about country muic , I would be updated.Thanks Terry, Your book is a big help for me, for my radio shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible horrible and horrible","review":"I returned this extremely offensive book back to the publisher because I did not wish to have it in my home one more minute. I have never been so disgusted.Ian Brown is a disgrace, as well as a dangerous and clearly vehement anti-Catholic. I am a baptized Roman Catholic, and frankly, he scares me. He reminds me of 1930s Germany.Apparently, according to Mr. Brown, Mel Gibson was not allowed to express his obviously beloved and deeply rooted Catholic ideas and beliefs in his own film. I thank God every day he did just that.I thought of refuting all the mistakes in this book, but then decided, what's the point. Mr. Brown was born ignorant. He will die ignorant. Thank goodness I only paid a couple dollars for this trash. That's all it's worth. Good riddance to truly bad rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Exam","review":"This has to be one of the most under rated slasher flicks to have come out of the eighties. Although there were nearley 5 a week coming out back then and most were done on very limited budgets most of them have now gotten fair treatment so to speak with getting put out on dvd. Although this made it to Dvd many people still don't know about it. It is a true gem of a movie, top notch and a must watch for all slasher fans. I highley recomend this flick. Check it out.-Heath"},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Exam","review":"I was disappointed with Final Exam. However, any 80's slasher is still worth watching. This one moves at a snail's pace and is similar in blandness to Splatter University. As for the actual product my only complaint is the audio, which is at a very low level and not great in clarity. The picture quality is nice, and it features a commentary track. Check out Rush Week and The House on Sorority Row if you want to see a college slasher film done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lack of blood or sense sink this turkey","review":"this one tried for something new but failed at every turn. a lack of scares os thrills kills this before the killing begins and we never learn who or why the killings take place. just a big pile of goo that goes nowhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Movie, No Motive","review":"Really would have been nice to know why the psycho killer was psycho killing. For instance, was that his daughter or sister who killed herself the year before because she did not get accepted into a fraternity? And by the way, who really cares? Now if her boyfriend , whom she worshiped had dumped her because she was not a member of a female sibling fraternity and he has to stay in his father and gf fraternity, now that would have been a motive for the killer after she killed herself. Recognizing that this is a late 70s to early 80s film, it wasn't that bad. For Jason's first few sequels his motive was that he did not want anyone at Camp Crystal Lake. Michael Myers was hunting his sister and his neice that, in H2o , turned into a nephew. Freddy Kruger was after the children of the town that killed him when he was human. Your movie can be silly, but it has got to have a motive."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINAL EXAM SCORES AN F","review":"I am a huge slasher fan and i couldnt wait to get this movie, i love most slashers from the heydey of 1978-83. i anxiously laid down my cash and took this movie home i popped it in the player only to be heavily dissapointed, there is no blood and the killer is not scary he also is revealed during the whole thing , dont get me wrong you dont need blood to make a good slasher Black christmas for example, this is no Black christmas, the only reason i give it 2 stars is the fact somebody thinks this is classic 2 stars for building an undeserved reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst of the slashers","review":"this movie is a mess. it starts off like a collage comedy then some prankerts fake a mass shooting (this part is very hard to take after all the bad things like that witch have happened ). the the slasher takes stage. the last 45 mins. is his rampage. we never know anything about him or why he kills . if your a gore hound there isn't even any blood to get you by. a very poor movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings Back Memories","review":"This movie is a great reminder of early 80's horror, not one of the best but very good and has several jump in your seat moments.

War and Peace reads effortlessly, while Generations of Winter is clunky at best. Tolstoy can breathe more life into a character in a single line than Aksyonov managed in his entire book. Yes, both are epics, but War and Peace this is clearly not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warmed-over Tolstoy","review":"This book purports to be a 20th century analog of War & Peace. Unfortunately the author transposes entire scenes from Tolstoy's novel. Characters are one-dimensional, wearing labels such as \\"Decent Citizen Doctor,\\" \\"Starry-Eyed Young Jewish Communist\\" or \\"Cynical Careerist\\".The translation is goofy. No doubt jocular or slang terms for any manner of things sound just fine in the Russian, but using slang for the same word in English often sounds risible. Thus food is usually referred to as \\"grub,\\" clothes as \\"duds,\\" and so on.Then there are the downright errors. Polish names for example are grossly misspelled; names of major streets in Warsaw are chewed up and spit out as names for non-existent neighborhoods.Stalin and Beria were bad men and their purges were terrible events. That doesn't mean you've got to write bad books about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful focus on the Lord and His attributes!","review":"This book has a wonderful focus on the different names of Jesus, and His service to us wrapped up in each name.

The thousands his life has touched thank him, I thank him for allowing me to share in GOD's amazing grace and ability to work through any willing vessel, and we stand in awe of his humility.

There has been considerable debate about who actually performed those numbers at the festival, but one thing is known for sure, it WASN'T Alice Cooper. The rest are very early Alice Cooper recordings which were to eventually appear on Pretties For You and Easy Action.

We had to perform service on it once, and were able to replace the color wheel ourselves for $100. Not a bad service record for an eight-year old piece of electronics. The only thing about this that has aged is the lack of internet connectivity and only one HDMI port. But for gaming and the kids in the TV room, this thing is indestructible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functions well when it functions at all","review":"While I like the picture, sound and features, within 1 year the TV ceased to work. The warranty repair involved replacing nearly everything, and took nearly 2 weeks. I wasn't particularly happy dealing with Samsung service. Although I ultimately got a functioning TV back, I still deal with intermittent problems getting the TV to start. This is accompanied by apparently diagnostic sequences of flashing lights on the front. Unfortunately, the Samsung web site is not helpful decoding those lights, and I'm not interested in talking with their unpleasant support folks. I just wait for the day the thing refuses to start, at which point I'll be done with my Samsung experiment. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific service...","review":"While I rarely take the time to review products, the support that I received on my Samsung HLP5063W is forcing me to do so. I was disappointed to have a problem with the bulb/ballast of my new DLP TV (first 4 months), but these things happen. I called Samsung Support and told them of the situation. They appologized and had someone to my doorstep in 2 days. I recieved a call from their support team 5 minutes after the repair technicial left my house to ensure my satisfaction and another call 1 week later, to make sure all was still ok.This is a company that wants to take care of thier customers and one that I would absolutely buy from again.

Dealing with Samsung customer service is probably the worst in the business, i have had a better experience at the DMV (no joke). After over 30 calls to Samsung, being constantly lied to and them never calling me back they finally replaced the TV, however this took over 2 months. A year later the color wheel broke and now i am in Samsung hell, with the customer service department. It's now been a month and they still haven't managed to call me back, for my sanity I have now given up and decided to pay for the repairs for myself.

The price here is DOUBLE the science center price so they have it upside down. My dad ordered this for my son thinking it was 3-packs probably having misread the \\"3 year expiration date\\" plus seeing that they said it was half the price that you pay at the science centers (UNTRUE).This is ONE pack only. At least the one we received and nothing here says any different. Buy it at your local center.

My brother and I bought it on LP together in 1984, shortly after watching the Kids Are Alright on television, which we taped and subsequently watched 100s of times. We didn't know much about the Who before watching the movie and figured a greatest hits album was the way to go and get initiated. But as we soon discovered we would have done better to just get their normal releases right off the bat: songs are cut short, selections are sadly limited, the production quality was shoddy ..., etc.18 years later I've long since purchased more or less everything the Who's ever come out with and I was just clicking around on amazon to see if there weren't any new releases of old stuff when I saw this blast to the past posted. I would have never guessed this piece ...was still available; it's disgusting, really. Its production should be ended, permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality- Poor excuse of a CD","review":"The quality of the sound on this CD is appalling.

Also, it doesn't have my favorite song, Baba O'Reily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst greatest hits album ever","review":"I don't know what MCA was thinking when they put this tripe together. How does a band of the stature of the Who merit such an anemic greatest hits album? First of all, it should be at least 2 discs, and second of all, it should actually contain a few more well known HITS. Where's \\"Baba O' Riley\\"? \\"See Me, Feel Me\\"? \\"Bargain\\"? \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\"? \\"Join Together\\"? \\"I Can't Explain\\"? \\"I Can See For Miles\\"? \\"You Better You Bet\\"?Fortunately, this problem has been corrected with the recently released \\"The Ultimate Collection\\". Pick that up instead. Why precious resources are still wasted mass producing this disc I do not know. It should be removed from circulation immediately. This album is a downright insult to the legend that is the Who."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst greatest hits ever","review":"The computer don't allow me rate 0 star, otherwise, I will!!! This so-called greatest hits doesn't fits for it's title, anybody want to hear something better should get \\"MEATY, BEATY, BIG & BOUNCY\\". MCA did some excellent jobs sometimes, such as the releasing of \\"WHO'S MISSING\\" & \\"TWO'S MISSING\\", both are great albums for die-hard Who collectors/fans. Anyway we don't need any more compilations at all, but they just released more rubbish like \\" THE BEST OF THE WHO-THE MILLENNIUM COLLECTION\\".

So then why did they cut \\"Who are you\\" and \\"Won't get fooled again\\". Yes, both of these songs were cut, the entire song is not played on this CD. As a huge Who fan, I must tell others not to buy this CD, because you are missing out on two great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love The Who And Hate This Compilation","review":"The Who may be the greatest rock band ever. Greatest Hits is not a compilation of the best Who songs or their biggest hits. Greatest hits is a record with some good Who songs on it, though it hardly does justice to the available catalog. If you are just starting out with The Who try, The Kids Are Alright, Live @ Leeds, Who's Next, Quadrophenia, or the original \\"Greatest Hits\\"; Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy. Any of these records would be a much wiser use of your musical dollar. Your soul will thank you as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, there are better though","review":"Not the best collection of Who songs but still not bad.

This game is a good game for people who have played the other games (or atleast one of them) but it would be really hard (the controls and all) for somebody who has never played even a minute of a diff. SH game.My opion is that this is a really good buy for people who have played other SH games, not very good if you have never played a SH game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk Smash Repeat","review":"This game has a great atmosphere, but thats it.

The pace is slow, the story is twisted, or non-existant. After playing it a few days I got stuck and spent a lot of time re-playing several scenes. You'll have more fun lighting your foot on fire.

For a bad one, get this game - I'd be happy to give it to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Game","review":"Silent Hill 4: The Room is a fantastic entry in the horror series, and the copy I bought was in pristine condition. The game plays wonderfully and the style and art is beautiful. Definitely creepy and scary at night, with haunting music that amplifies the experience. My copy I received worked well, save for a graphical issue that broke up the textures of the characters' faces (but that's probably due to the game trying to work on a 360 instead of an original xbox); despite that, I enjoyed the game just as the developers intended. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silent Letdown","review":"If you're a fan of the first three SH games, save yourself some some pain and pretend that this game doesn't exist...especially if you can't find it for less that $10.00. The plot feels shoehorned into the Silent Hill universe, and you wouldn't be missing anything to just pass this game by. While this game has its (very brief) moments (for example, I genuinely cared about my next door neighbor...in a creepy \\"looking at you through a hole in the wall\\" kind of way), the gameplay falls flat, the levels are mostly crappy versions of areas from past SH games, your protagonist (who's name I can't even remember) isn't interesting at all, and about half of your enemies hurt you just by being in the same general vicinity as you...that's just cheap. Seriously, this game is a stinker...do yourself a favor and skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game Ever?","review":"In my opinion, save your money. This is the worst game I have ever played in my life! What a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Silent Hill since the first","review":"The previous installments, like the latest one, have their own sub-genre. The first and second ones were kind of murder mysteries, the third one was a religious horror, and Silent Hill 4:The Room, is a serial killer type. Henry, your average joe, starts experiencing these nightmarish dreams. As these dreams continue, his appartment starts to change. One day, he wakes up, and there is a massive hole in his bathroom wall. He travels through these worlds and ends up finding out about and meeting Walter Sullivan, a man that supposedly can't die. The concept behind the game is great, and the atmosphere is perfectly eerie. I highly reccomend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my Family","review":"The book This is my Family is about a young boy critter who explains his family to us. The book was a fun book and it taught little kids about families. I would recommend this book to anyone with a young child for a good bedtime story or a good book to enhance young children's reading skills. The book is funny and entertaining and a very well written book and I recommend reading all the Little Critter books, along with This is my Family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for pre-readers, but a lovely book","review":"Bought this for my I-Spy-loving 3 year old, for a long car trip, only to discover that you've got to be able to read to pick out the items to be found. The \\"Can You Find\\" is written out, rather than pictorially depicted; age for the book is given as Kindergarten and up, and I'm pretty sure most kindergarteners aren't reading yet, so I'd just revise the decription to 6 and up or maybe even 7 and up.

The introduction to Sydney Teague, her office colleages and the cast of characters alone is worth the price of the book. In addition, you get a page-turning, suspensful story. The author does an excellent job of capturing Charlotte, N.C.'s new south personality in a handful of well-chosen sentences.I've had the privelege of seeing an early draft of the second book in the series.

The only drawback is that it is a little more costly than the popular artificially sweetened drink powder, but when it is a matter of health, one may want to opt in favor of a healthier product if possible.

The tracks \\"I Love You\\" and \\"Back in the days\\" are the 2 ballads of this album : extremely boring. \\"Celebration\\", \\"Don't Go Away\\", \\"I Wanna Be With You\\" are more \\"euro-reggae\\". \\"Oh Yeah Yeah\\", \\"Be Good To Me\\" dance, but slow. The others are normal eurodance.BEST TRACKS : \\"Doh Wah Diddy\\" ; \\"Dreaming\\" ; \\"Oh Yeah Yeah\\" ; \\"Together 4ever\\" ; \\"Be Good To Me\\" ; \\"All for You\\" ; \\"Take Your chance\\".So, as I said, a little different album."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Close Yet So Far","review":"This game pad is almost great.

On cuts like \\"confide in me\\" and \\"put yourself in my place\\" she shows an emotion that was lacking in her previous releases. The songs on this disc are not anything like her 4 previous discs. If you were expecting upbeat/bubble gum you wont want this one. She sings alot of slower songs and the production is unbelievably American. This disc was to have been her return to the US market, but sadly, Imago records failed to pull it off and only ended up releasing the \\"confide in me\\" single stateside. This disc is well worth adding to anyone's Kylie collection. I suggest you start with \\"if i was your lover\\" and \\"time will pass you by\\" before listening to any other songs.

It sounds truly romanitic, as it should. Atlanta plays with a great Mahler sound and emotively throughout. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"I received this delightful book as a gift from a dear friend. It is one of the most wonderful gifts I have ever received. Ruth Gendler is clearly a most perceptive woman, whose descriptions of the personalities of each of the qualities are beautiful and artistic. What I find a shame is the lack of care in quality shown by the publishers - the book deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless reading!","review":"I have loved and learned from this book for 24 years!

Must be something wrong with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and topical","review":"Ms. Gendler's small title is a splendid topical read and highly recommended. I found this title quoted by Robert Sapolsky in a recent NYTs article.Ms.Gendler's use of metaphors holds the potential of creating new meanings for words that have fallen on hard times. For me, she creates new color(s) around seemingly ordinary words with extraordinary potential. The book is organized in such a way to allow the reader to \\"put in\\" wherever the book happens to open and not be disappointed, but in fact learn something. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless","review":"I was given this book several years ago by a dear friend. As is always the case when someone gives me something, it sat untouched for almost a year.When I finally picked it up... I devoured it. I plotted the relationships within the \\"community\\" and also used it to journal, hanging out with the characters in the book for a day or so and seeing how they lived in my life. Ultimately it made my understand just how life and time can affect us all. It's helped me be more tolerant of others... and myself.This year I was the person who gave it away... It's funny the look on some people face... \\"Oh... GREAT... Yeah, thanks!...\\" When they actually open the BoQ and spend some time with the characters, they'll understand.It took me longer than it should have, but it was there waiting for me when I was ready. I LOVE THIS BOOK!

Nearly incoherent plot, oafish, unlikeable main character (Dick Jones, of all the possible names you could muster -- heaven help us all), wooden dialogue, flimsy motivations, secondary characters created and discarded at will, paper tiger adversaries, an unlikely society, and just plain not interesting!

Nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Rehash","review":"The author gives vague advice, the \\"calm down\\", \\"be objective\\" cliche advice. If you don't believe me, I'm literally quoting him.Although the author tries to make his book seem original, as you can read, it's not merely about imagining yourself in positive circumstances, but mixed with the generic advice I mentioned. This is not something revolutionary, this is rehash. Save your money and go imagine yourself in a positive situation, you don't need to read hundreds of pages to do it, or spend $ on what to imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"the foundation of something great","review":"before idlewild had mastered the art of the indie rock song, they were essentially a punk band. Hope is Important is their transitional album in many ways; the songs range from the absolutely beautiful acoustic \\"I'm Happy to be Here Tonight\\" to snot-nosed punk thrashings such as \\"4 People do Good.\\" there are also many fine songs too edgy to be called pop, particularly the ever-intense \\"Film for the Future,\\" whose guitar riffs are amongst the best the band has to offer.fans not familiar with idlewild's older work might be taken aback by the style of this record; most noteably, singer roddy woomble's vocal tactics are very different from those he adapted in on later albums. however, if you are a fan of idlewild it is quite necessary that you own this album. and if you are a fan music that does justice to the punk genre, you must, in fact, own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finely tuned power pop","review":"Hyped as the next big thing across the British music press, Idlewild have proved successful as more of a slow-burn band, their insistent ear for a melody and triumphant live shows have slowly won them a large fan base.The debut full album, Hope Is Important, is a truly great album full of tuneful and satisfyingly loud punk-pop, recalling Nirvana, The Pixies and REM all at the same time - but, tellingly, sounding fresh and original. Best of all is the niggling anthem I Am A Message with one of the best fade-outs of the nineties. Buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go with Broken Windows","review":"This album is like boys playing, while Idlewild's 100 Broken Windows album is like men rocking. Idlewild made a huge quality leap from Hope is Important to 100 Broken Windows, which is why I would recommend skipping this CD and going directly to Broken Windows, an all-time favorite of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Strat","review":"I have 8 electric guitars from $65 to 4,199.00 and had been playing different kinds of guitar for more than 40 years.

It was a great indoor ball with a soft, bouncy core, wrapped in two red PVC halves held together by real stitches.This ball is much too hard for indoor use. The one I received was also red & white, not all red. The fake seam on the ball is very sharp on the fingers too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This ball is not worth the money. It worse off in just two overs. The PVC started coming off. This ball is heavier than the cricket ball, and even thought it's soft if you press on it, it's really not safe. You still need protective gear. Just buy the regular cricket ball. Or, if you're looking for a safer alternative for backyard cricket, put some electric tape on a tennis ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually really like this album","review":"I am surprised to find myself enjoying Mu-ziq's music, but it really is great. As cheesy as it sounds his best work just sounds happy, and it puts a smile on my face. The album is good for just putting in and zoning out while on a drive, though it does get noticeably weak after \\"Phiesope\\" (track 7) click on that track now for a listen, it is the highlight of In Pine Effect and really a great song, I cannot believe it has not been co-opted for a commercial yet. (Or has it???)After \\"Phiesope\\" it does get weaker, it just becomes more harsh and abrasive which I don't think is Mu-ziq's strong point. Still I can recommend this album, it is good fun. Check out his Brace Yourself EP too, good clean fun for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"sounded good","review":"It just wasn't. the book is for single people who like to party and sleep around...

I spent a half hour attempting to read the beginning and skimmed for another 1/2 (see? I tried) I'm 21 years old and its completely irrelevant to these times, the way my generation thinks and behaves. My advice, leave this one alone unless your a pathetic wallowing mess who wants to read examples of other wallowing pathetic messes ( example: Robert R. \\"I hate my life because my gf left me.\\" Susan Q. \\"My work makes me feel worthless\\" etc etc) No real advice just a bunch of bull.

I was having a rough patch, and bought 3 self help books from Amazon, I started one, it bored me, I moved to this, read it super fast, recommended it to everyone I know, and now feel like my other self help books don't even need to be read! This book is not boring like most, and it doesn't have a lot of boring and tedious exercises. It's a super easy read, entertaining and makes SO much sense!These lessons should be taught in school. I've been seeing people on the street and thinking, \\"They need to read my book!\\" It addresses esteem issues, social issues, phobias, and on and on. The stuff in the book is quite easy to apply too. It's great. Get it. Get it for everyone you know who isn't perfectly happy. It changed my life in a way that I don't think many other self help books or even therapy could."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've seen it all before...","review":"I wanted to see this movie because the subject of urban exploration fascinates me. I didn't read the reviews. BAD mistake. This movie has two major flaws. One, the godawful camera work, and two, its predictability. I realized what was going on 30 minutes into it. I believe I speak for the majority when I say the shaky handheld camera \\"effect\\" has been played to death. It's no longer original or effective. It's annoying and nauseating and belongs only in death metal music videos. Apart from that, there are some major continuity issues and total lack of coherence that will drive you up the wall if you dare seriously think about it. All in all, this movie seemed like a desperate attempt to somehow fill 90 minutes of screen time. Don't repeat my mistake, save yourself some time and money and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"I gave this movie a chance, hoping that the reviews I'd seen were wrong and that they were just missing the point. Turns out: I should trust people more often.The acting was unconvincing, and the Blair Witch style camera effects dealt the movie a bad blow. A more effective cinematography style could have granted this movie at least a \\"watch it for the pretty places\\" review, but no. The places they explore in this movie would have been so much prettier could I have had more than a split second to look at where they were.As for this being an effective portrayal of urban exploration: it isn't. It got some things right and some things so incredibly wrong.The movie was linear till about the mid point, then decided it wanted to be something else entirely, and when it finally wrapped up I felt dissapointment I rarely feel with cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"AFTER ALL, IT IS A \\"B\\" MOVIE!!!","review":"I was not expecting much when I sat down to watch this movie, and that is exactly what I got...not much. I do not want to say anything to spoil the movie in case you have not watched it yet. I will say that it was hard to follow until the end when it all comes together. Unfortunately, by that time, it was too late. The whole time you are watching this movie, you are scratching your head just trying to figure it out and when you do figure it out, it just leaves you with an unsatisfied feeling. Who knows, you might enjoy it. As for me, it just didn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly bad!!","review":"As someone else wrote the Blair witch camera work is very annoying. Even worse, when the camera is not shaky and trailing they use another gimic and the shots are over solarised and washed out to the point of invisible.Plot and premise were interesting enough. Location innovative. No matter these virtues were completely overridden by the stupid production gimicks.I found it practically unwatchable. I can't remember when a movie last annoyed me quite this much.If I could bother to remember the director and cameraman's names I would be sure to boycott them forever going forward.Flora Montgomery should shoot her agent. How does she wind up in these roles. Furthermore if you're a fan of hers.

None of those numbers made any sense since I know the water was properly balanced recently. So I went out and bought some AquaChek test strips and those showed that everything really is just fine (it just needed a little more bromine).I don't know if I just got a bad batch of test strips, but I've tried them several times now over the past month, and they still don't seem to be giving me readings that make any sense.

Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Textured pop at its finest","review":"Moose's third lp continues their string of lovingly crafted music which receives critical raves in knowledgable places and is totally ignored elsewhere. This time they include bits of parping brass and a greater concentration on loss and regret, but the recipe is still tuneful, well-crafted, beautiful pop, more consistent than Aztec Camera, more genuine than The Boo Radleys. This is a band that, as one critic has said, is \\"likely to remain a glorious cult.\\" Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and Alexandra of Spring add with their backing vocals on standout tracks \\"Play God\\" and \\"Regulo 7\\" and perhaps the loveliest Moose track yet is the curious \\"The Man Who Hanged Himself.\\" This band has yet to record a bad song or even a toss-off.

I tried using the standard Dr. Bronner's soap on my dishes before because I wanted to have something non-toxic. However the standard Dr. Bronner's is better suited as a shampoo/body/face wash because it doesn't really cut heavy cooking grease that well, it's just not what it was designer for. But this SAL-SUDS is absolutely perfect and highly effective on dishes. Just ONE nickel-to-quarter-sized squeeze on my sponge will do a sink load of dishes. No joke.

Great mild degreaser, too...doesn't leave an icky film on your stovetop.Best of all, it's totally organic, biodegradable and kind to your skin.

Five Stars for \\"Fabulous Hell\\"","review":"Having personally lived, loved, lied and lost in L.A., I believe that Fabulous Hell provides incredible insight into L.A.'s edgy gay scene. Craig Curtis is a gifted author. This is one of those exceptional books that---once I picked it up and started to read the first page---I could not set down until I had reached the last page.Some day this book will be considered a gay classic. A \\"must read\\" for anyone who wants to understand what West Coast hip (including the zingy highs and the depressing lows) is all about. Kudos to Craig Curtis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Hell Written So Well!","review":"With its sinful comicbook-like cover, Fabulous Hell is definitely one of those books that you pick up to take a peek inside and hope no one finds you looking! You can sift through any page reading it inside your mind, and Craig Curtis' narrative will quickly draw you in. It's even more fun to read out loud to yourself or to others! The one-liners in this book were meant to be jotted down in your journal and recited during those unsober moments when everyone needs a laugh! Curtis weaves a nasty little tale with \\"who cares\\" attitude that leaves you rolling your eyes and laughing out loud. You'll be thinking, \\"bitter...party of one...your table is ready,\\" but by the time you finish this book you'll want to join that party and have a great time!

After reading the other reviews, I thought this would be a fun read on the beach. WRONG! Maybe I missed the point of the book (is there really one?). The chapters are 3-4 page snippets from a snippy, unappealing narrator. Throughout the book, every once and ahwile there appeared an interesting character or two, but then they would disappear--never resolved or heard from again.

The story follows a daughter's search for her archeologist mother who goes missing in Guatemala during a hurricane. As a traveller to Guatemala, I was pleased that Murray has obviously done her research there. Her descriptions of the jungle are beautiful and accurate. At least some of the action appears to be fact, too: there really was a terrible hurricane, Mitch, that swept through Guatemala, and it really did reveal some previously undiscovered veins of blue jade. I will not spoil the ending for you. Suffice it to say that you will not see it coming, but in retrospect you will see that there were clues. This is the best adventure novel I have ever read.

He admits most of the scenes are random, much of the dialogue is improvised, and he named characters whatever popped into his head. He says the script wrote itself, so he can't explain it and doesn't believe that it needs to be explained or even understood. If anyone set out to deliberately make a terrible movie, I believe this would be the way to do it.He says that if people like it ... fine, and if they don't ... all the better.

It didn't impress anybody much; it earned $6000 (that's six thousand dollars) in its first and only week it played in selected theaters.There is a handful of reviews of this movie on the net. One that IMO best described Slipstream's content compared it to a boy in a video game store playing all the games at the same time - that's what Slipstream's endless visual effects look like.

I thought this series was shallow and failed to go underneath the surface. I also found the writing to be tedious and self-indulgent. This could have been so much better.

Not the plot. In many places the plot does not add up, and the myth of the omnipotent, omnipresent character just doesn't wash anymore.

Unfortunately what follows becomes more and more unbelievable and the film disintegrates as unrealistic characters appear in the film and it becomes another dumb wanna-be-Hollywood blockbuster kind of film.

I have had more pumps that were more than twice the price fail in two years so I guess I am ahead of the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"no durability","review":"Pump only ran 6 months in a clean fountain running 18 hours per day. Would like to find a more durable pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Expensive for 3 Months of use.","review":"Dont bother with this pump. The lip that holds the outlet housing failed afer 3 months of use rendering the pump useless. Bad design."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal","review":"this is a wonderful product for my Koi pond. Saved a lot of money verses Home depot I am thrilled with my purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enchanted Self, A Positive Therapy","review":"I am not a therapist but I think that this book is an excellent text and I have learned a great deal about my own \\"Enchanted Self\\".The process in this book delves deep into the experiences that control and make up our lives, and clearly points out that our state of well-being has an effect on how we can learn to cope. The Enchanted Self teaches you how to grow as a person and deal with problems and situations more clearly. It also teaches you how to identify the negative messages that you are carrying that make it harder to maintain your \\"Enchanted Self\\", and how positive traits can help you achieve your goals.It was refreshing to read about a process that reinforces the fact that we must concentrate on the positive (not negative) situations that we encounter. I also enjoyed reading about the experiences of other women like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"NERO (NOT WHAT I EXPECTED)","review":"DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SOFTWARE IT DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN SOME OF THE LESS EXPENSIVE ONES OUT THERE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"I just bought Nero PhotoShow Elite and I think it's an excellent program for editing and creating slideshows from my digital pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product & support fall short","review":"I purchased the software in order to be able to make a photo show and then burn it to a VCD. First the software tells me I cannot add my own music with this version, then it does not burn to make the VCD. It will burn to make a CD though. I contacted Nero for support and have had one email (which did not resolve the problem) in two weeks. I replied, but have had no response. I would look for another company who will give better support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Product!","review":"Warning - I bought this item as a Christmas gift for my father. He attempted to use the software to no avail. We had the serial number, but it required a password that we could not obtain. My father made numerous attempts to resolve this issue through Nero, however they were useless. It took days for them to reply, and the person replying had not a clue. In fact, they insuated that it was stolen, even when an amazon receipt was supplied. My father has had this software since Christmas - and he still hasn't used it. I must say Amazon.com has been great. They are going to reimburse my account and I am sending the product back to where it came from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"When you first attempt to use this software, it's great. It lets you build an impressive slide show, but then they sock it to you. They forgot to warn you that you can't burn your own DVD slide show, only a very limited VCD (yuck). If you want your DVD slide show on a DVD, you have to e-mail it to them and they make the DVD for you for a SMALL fee. The only way you can make your own DVD is guess what, upgrade to Slide Show 4Delux for another $ 30.00+ bucks. I don't recomend software people that feel it's necessary to deceive to sell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nero Photo Show Elite","review":"The program is very easy to use and makes viewing your pictures a snap. The only draw back is that you cant print your own projects such as calenders. Sending them out to be printed is costly especially if you have a good photo printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I would have known","review":"It is a very easy program to figure out, BUT the few things I don't like is there is not even much clip art, you can't add your own, there is no choice of font just one plain one they ofer. I wish I could put it on a dvd but can't. You would have to order through them which is too expensive for one dvd.I paid too much for this program. It would be okay for a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, it's so easy to use!","review":"I went to their website and downloaded a trial and it really is very easy to use. The making of the slideshow with music is very cool because they have preset themes, which I haven't seen from anybody else.
