And as the following passage makes clear, the writing is often just awful. \\"But, gals, there's no denying it: sometimes we stink, and we know it. Not like strawberry yogurt or a good Cabernet but like, alas, albacore. Or even skunk. How does this happen?

I found it a refreshing and interesting view on a subject (biology and hard science) that many people find inaccessible. As a professor of English, I disagree with some reviewers who find her style platitudinous or immature. As I read, I was often impressed with her unique combination of the erudite and the colloquial. Some might find that juxtaposition jarring, but I really enjoyed it. I have recommended this book to several people. For those looking for an esoteric or scholarly approach to women's biology, this isn't it. I don't think that's the intended audience for this book. If you are like me, never really understanding the hard sciences, anything biological or chemical, then perhaps Angier's approach will be appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"INFORMATIVE and quite interesting for all aged women!","review":"Learned a few things here. Very broad and informative about the female body and it's varied life tasks.

An exercise by the insecure for their own aggrandizement perhaps.

Barf."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same feminist perspective \\"science\\" -Boring","review":"Yes, I read it all, as boring as it is.

Love Angier's science writing in the New York Times and can't recommend this book enough. If high school biology had been this fun, we'd all be scientists. Angier deconstructs the myths, explains the truths, and does it all with beautiful writing and a racy kick. A woman or want to understand one better? Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and Entertaining","review":"The second-last chapter - about 60 pages - is worth the price of the book. Finally, some well-reasoned counter-arguments to the \\"sociobiology\\" of sexually promiscuous males/monogamous females, which tends to make females the underdog in the mating game. For instance, Ms. Angier contends convincingly that logistically, pursuing as many apparently-fertile females as possible would not maximize the extent to which the male passes on his genes. It may be that not all points made by Ms. Angier necessarily rest on proven fact, but what matters is that they are as valid as the equally unproven, more noxious and more traditional \\"sociobiology\\" of the sexes. The entire book is full of interesting and often surprising facts and insights."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's a science writer????","review":"I must say that if this book had been written by say, a comic, I would not have half the objections to it that I do. Since the author is a science writer, I was VERY disappointed in the science and how it was both presented and handled in the book. I felt like I was reading P.J. O'Rourke, but without the disclaimer at the beginning of \\"I may not have all the statistics and science correct.\\" If one seeks to be entertained, and basicly blips past all the attempts at science, then this book is for you, espescially if you are a woman. If, like me, you are a stickler for scientific accuracy in a \\"scientific\\" orientated book, then avoid this book, or you'll be kicking yourself when done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny, thoughtful, and deeply felt","review":"I loved the way Angier turned commonly held perceptions on their head, looked at them from odd angles, filled up the chapters with insight and wit. She was laugh-out-loud funny, and at the same time, her wisdom gave strength to her interpretations. This book also has one of the most elegantly beautiful, and beautifully designed, bookjackets I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman is Witty and Wonderful","review":"With prose that flow like a mountain stream -- at times meandering, then rushing over the falls to settle in lucid pools of understanding -- Natalie Angier teaches us more about science and the nature of women than Darwin ever imagined. As a self-proclaimed \\"female chauvinist sow\\", the author takes us on a wild romp through the female body, debunking male-proffered myths as she goes and leaving us with greater respect, understanding and wonderment for everyting from eggs to estrogen. Angier knows her science, and she knows how to touch a reader's emotions, making us chuckle, empathize and sigh on cue as she draws on personal material, the lives of other women and sceientific research to make her point. The author gives us a fresh perspective on women that could go a long way to improving self-image among women and reducing misunderstanding among men. A must read for anyone who has anything to do with women (which pretty much includes all of us who have ever been born!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives New Meaning to the Term \\"Purple Prose\\"","review":"This book is very weak on science and very strong on polemics--a feminist rant based on the work of a handful of interviews with a handful of scholars and, as the reader says below, a mighty slow slog. The author seems in sad need of editing (she seems overly fond of her own screaming voice) and of someone to remind her that in science, at least, evidence is all. This book has all the literary charm of a greeting card, and all the power of a burned out light bulb. Rather than sell it at the end of the semeter, as a reader suggests below, I'd advise that you give it a pass altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes!","review":"Garbage. Bad science coupled with anecdotes and far-flung speculations. Add to this an annoyingly poetic writing style and a tone that demonstrates the author's contempt of all things male and you have one of the most overrated books I've ever come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I would hope that this book is a joke. I have never read something that does so little for women. We do not have to worry about men giving women a bad name, this book does it just fine. This book is mostly written in a crude and vulgar tone that will turn off most readers. For example, the author refers to a whale penis as a \\"ten foot rod,\\" and made a comment that states that women should be asexual and procreate by themselves. So much for gender equality! We are going backwards here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Don't you Re-name it, Woman: Feminist Whore?","review":"Completely asinine. I was severely disappointed and dismayed at Angier's depiction of women. It is full of contradictory and faulty evolutionary biology. Narrow minded and crass. I literally took this book outside and burned it half way through reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book both women AND men should read","review":"Angier ties together, in a highly readable manner, the complexities of the human body very, very well all the while never loosing site of the whole.I disagree with her on a few points. I don't think she sufficiently looked at human relationships as far as she could but, overall, this is minor."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful and thought provoking","review":"as the cliche goes, i laughed, i cried. angier has a way with words that allows the reader to feel as if she is speaking directly towards her. amidst the humorous sarcastic comments, her book educates the reader. she explains things about our own bodies that i don't know how i lived without knowing. this book isn't the male-bashing propaganda that i expected. instead it is a beautifully constructed insight into what our bodies are like and why they are that way--and in instances when the authorities are uncertain, angier presenst the possibilities with their pros and cons and leaves it to the reader to come to their own conclusions. i urge every girl, every woman to read this book. even if someone feels that they know all the facts, angier will provoke you to think about them--to turn them over and over in your mind until you can finally be comfortable with your body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy with a twist!","review":"This is a really interesting book written by a woman for women. I learned all kinds of things! Although it does get a little slow towards the middle, it is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better on second read","review":"Looking through Woman for a particular passage, I found myself rereading whole chunks and chuckling anew. This book is just as fresh the second time around, so if you haven't read it once I envy you: you're in for a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Scientifically inaccurate, poorly reasoned, and dreadfully written, this is quite possibly the worst popular science book I have ever read -- a huge disappointment and a real disservice to a fascinating and important subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is science writing?","review":"Although the premise of this book is promising and there are a few interesting little facts any real value is obscured by Angier's tired attempts at stylistic wit, complete failure to appropriately cite scientific findings, and blatantly opinionated feminist rhetoric. I was looking forward to learning more about the science behind the mystery of the female body. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well-written delusion","review":"The author expends her energies on a diatribe against science, specifically evolutionary psychology, because the social constructs in her head cannot accept that some things just ARE! Evolution shaped human behavior and neither the cant nor the barbed wit can change that. Join the author and deconstruct yourselves into the past of myth and superstition. A big step backwards, the author would rank with the famous \\"debunkers\\" of Darwin, except that she is not of this caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful, misleading, psuedo-poetic","review":"I'm concerned about the comments of the reader below who accuses a critic of this book of being anti-intellectual. Indeed, one need only peruse a chapter or two of WOMAN to grasp that intellectuals in particular will be offended by its offerings. Angier seems to fancy herself a poet, but in truth her writing has all the poetic sensibility of a Hallmark greeting card. Her prose reels from purple to polemic, with now and then a crude attempt at the vernacular aside. And her science is anedotal, spotty and at times misleading, although her blast at evolutionary psychology, though not entirely well argued, is certainly welcome. As a feminist I found this book patronizing. As a scientist I found it disappointing. And as someone who enjoys fine writing, I found it pedestrian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Entertaining","review":"This is a must read for all women and those who love them. Natalie Angier provides great information about women in an entertaining and often laugh out loud style. I have recommended this to all my female friends and their partners. I have even recommended this to my gynecologist."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED it","review":"This book took me forever to read, but mostly because it kept blowing my mind, after which I'd have to take a break and just absorb the many exciting revelations. The friend who originally bought it for me said it took her five years to get through (that's because she was simultaneously raising babies, working full-time, and completing an advanced degree). In turn, I bought it for anyone who would allow me to give such a gift. Fantastic, quotable, shout-it-from-the-highest-height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"Woman is a close look at ourwomanly bodies. I wasn'texpecting to like this book,but Angier is mesmerizing.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful endeavor...","review":"Angier presents the sort of passionate, imaginative thinking that germinates and nourishes good theories, in an unmistakable, extremely likable style. At sometimes she is a bit long-winded, but this book is definitely WORTH IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"I would think this book ironic, if I believed the author were capable of irony, but she clearly is not. Given that I have no scientific credentials, I cannot comment on the book's scientific credibility, but as a professor of English literature, I can say that the book is so poorly argued that it had no credibility for me. As well, it is written in an over the top style one associates with eager freshmen, not seasoned journalists. One hopes this author will return to straight forward reporting on science, and redirect her \\"poetic\\" impulses to late night scribblings in a personal journal."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I picked this up in the library, which is good, because this is not a book I'd want to keep on my shelves. Like the reviewer below, I really don't understand the hoopla. I mean the author got it into her head to voice her opinions on all things female, and being a New York Times reporter she found someone to publish it. She doesn't have anything new or particularly interesting to say, and yet she seems intent on screaming at the reader as though she did. Her writing style swings from Hallmark card to rant--it's just plain annoying. And her arguments are often just as poorly grounded as the arguments of those she critiques. So why the big deal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than science","review":"I found this book to be very good in several areas, although a bit wordy. The basic premise of woman as the primordial mother of us all is not a new one but it is expanded and expounded on here in a manner that I found very entertaining and informative. I don't think that the reviews reviling the science in this book caught the full implications. Angier was not dealing strictly with biology; she was discussing the emotional, psychological, and spiritual levels of being a woman as well. I can appreciate the humor that the book was written with as well. I have read several books dealing with womanhood that took themselves far too seriously and turned me off with the man-bashing. This one didn't have that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for every man.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, although it offered re-affirmations rather than revelations. I would recommend that women buy it for the men and boys in their lives, particularly those who would find this a \\"new\\" perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I cannot say enough about how much I love Marillion's Clutching at Straws. If i was ever stranded on a desert island, i would be perfectly happy if this was the only record I'd be stuck with for the rest of my life.The songs are crafted brilliantly, Fish's lyrics about alchoholism are backed by the bands tightly polished musicianship. This album is 100% class and was the catalyst to Marillion finally shedding that dreaded \\"Progressive\\" stigma.You can read other's reviews for in depth analysis of the songs themselves - but for me - as a whole - this CD is probably one of my favorite pieces of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"cup holder for golflogics","review":"Totaly worthless, the manufacturer say amazon will not change the product discription for this.

How can an incredible album-ending song of that caliber be removed from Linkous's most perfect album??? I'm assuming it's due to time restraints. As I said, I'm happy to have it anyway but buyers be warned. You are purchasing 95% of \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\" There ain't no babies on the sun today.If you want the original LP with all the tracks be prepared to shell the same amount of money one could spend to pick up the entire Sparklehorse vinyl reissue catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Music From Another Planet","review":"The title track, It's a Wonderful Life, is one of the coolest songs I've ever heard. It starts out slow and ethereal, but when the chorus comes, it effloresces into a symphony of preternatural sound that blows you away. The cd is well worth buying for that singular track, but there are other highlights like Gold Day, Piano Fire, King of Nails, and Devil's New. This is the first cd I bought by Mark Linkous and co., and I'll probably be looking into buying the rest of their cds now. Buy this if you're in the mood for a pleasant treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"the song that might be dead at sea","review":"we think this album is good almost great but, not perfect. it does take a few listenings to get used to it, however we like being filled with dead bees at sea. they crunch inside in a pleasent way and they sing sad songs at night... hum hum hum"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unified Musical Statement from Linkous","review":"\\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is one of those rare albums where the songs all manage to fit together into a unified musical statement. To say, as the previous reviewer has, that \\"all the songs sound the same\\" is just proof that most people don't bother to take an album like this one seriously enough.Linkous has woven beautiful musical tapestries, and he has the musical sense to know how to enhance each track as much as possible. PJ Harvey's two guest vocals are sublime. And the addition of Adrian Utley (Portishead-are they dead?) on bass is equally important.This album has drawn the usual generalizations from some critics, e.g. \\"they sound a bit like Radiohead.\\" On the contrary, this album is original, well constructed, and breathtakingly gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"sparkles always","review":"possibly the most beautiful record i've heard this year. the neil youngish/waitsish moods flow over the listener, completely saturating one's brain with the sounds of what a modern rock record can hope to achieve. think of an album length version of \\"cortez the killer\\", Bone Machine, and some sprinkles of Perfect From Now On. epic, weird, and sweet rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Wonderful (Almost perfect) Record","review":"Sparklehorse is one of the best bands around these days, and this here third record of theirs is just short of perfect. A lot of the music here won't be much of a surprise if you've heard their first couple of albums; the songs are slow, sometimes almost uncomfortably intimate, and played in a manner that is decidedly amateurized. This album is more lush than it's predecessors, with thick fuzz made of piccolos and flutes, and haunting strings. I'd give the record five stars if it was a little more of a departure from what the band had done previously. Thankfully, it's as gorgeous and sad this time around as it was last time and the time before that, and delightfully weird when compared with much of the pop slop being passed off as music these days. A lot of the music doesn't grab you on the first listen, but over time it sinks deep under your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sounds Currently Available!!!","review":"If you are new to Sparklehorse, then let me save you some time . . . buy all 4 of his studio albums and be prepared to wear them out. At first just a couple of songs will grab you . . . eventually you will cherish every second of every track. The downside is the rest of your music is going to become a bit less meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacramental hope shining through the mud.","review":"Rarely will you listen to an album as personal as this one.

Celestial."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the musical equivalent of Capra's crowning glory.","review":"So my friend says to me, \\"you need the new Sparklehorse\\" and I'm thinking \\"yeah, I need that like I need a...\\" I wasn't overly impressed with their first album so I was a bit skeptical, but M is usually right so I took a chance.Wow! This album is incredible. At times I feel I'm listening to Mercury Rev (probably because there are some guest appearances) and to me that's a very good thing. In addition to Sparklehorse's obvious talent there are several guest artists and collaborators (besides Merc. Rev)that make this record really come alive. (PJ Harvey and Tom Waits are a couple of my faves.) If you've been \\"sittin' on a fence\\" trying to decide whether or not to add this to your collection, buy it. You won't be sorry.

As others have mentioned I've tried everything to reset it, but it always ends up an hour early until fall. The clock is on a wall near large, south-facing windows, and I live by a major city, so radio signal is not the problem. If you live in the central, mountain, or pacific time zones, you could adjust for DST manually by pressing the button for the next time zone over. However, for the Eastern Time Zone, you'll just have to live with it being an hour off all summer. Note that it is not possible to override the radio signal and adjust the clock yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daylight Saving Time Warning","review":"I don't own this clock, but I do own one of it's sister clocks, the Tambour Style Mantel Clock, and it did not change for DST now that the date has changed.

Even though I selected Mountain Time Zone it set itself to Pacific. I waited 24 hours and checked again but it did not re-set the time. So, I changed the setting to Central and when it changed to Central Time I re-selelected Mountain Time, this time it worked correctly. We'll see what happens in the Fall when the tiime changes again.One minor issue: If you don't like to hear a clock ticking you may not like this clock; It can definitely be heard although to me it isn't obnoxious - but it is noticeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radio-controlled clock","review":"I ordered this clock to put on the wall above my large TV.

Now they have brought it back on the type of CD that most serious classical music lovers avoid, that is super hits. Fortunately, this super hit CD is not like most of them. You do have some short pieces in orchestral arrangements. However, when they are done there are three outstanding recordings of major works. The La Mer by Szell was recorded in 1963 when the great maestro and the Cleveland Orchestra were at their absolute best. It is a great performance, played in very taut style that I happen to love. Some listeners might find it somewhat cool but I find it refreshing and extremely exciting. All the other performances are also exceptional.

It is harshly distorted--musically and vocally, which ruins the bulk of the songs. Whoever introduced Mike Scott to singing through a micro-synth should get the death penalty. And the pronounced Irish affectations in his voice have reached their preposterous zenith. Half the songs on here would be decent if they were stripped down to basics and cut shorter by 3 minutes (not every coda is worthy of Hey Jude treatment). If you are a new fan, stick with Mike Scott's Still Burning and the Waterboy's first 4 CD's.

Only buy this one for the sake of completing your Waterboys collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The genius morphs into a retard","review":"I'm quite sickened by the rave reviews of this horrendous CD. The once brilliant musician and poet named Mike Scott somehow lost it past age 30 and couldn't produce a worthly album if his life depended on it. \\"A Pagan Place\\", \\"This is the Sea\\", and \\"Fisherman's Blues\\" are among the best albums released by any band ever. However, on this album Scott has been reduced to releasing silly creampuff songs that would fit well on a Loverboy or Outfield album. Even the lyrics are sickening. I tried listening to this CD 10 times and then, after realizing I could no longer stomach it anymore, threw it in the trash where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding new style","review":"Mike Scott has created a new style and sound, which is very different from earlier Waterboys efforts. I love Pagan Place and This is the Sea, and this new one is just as good, but very different. Scott has combined eras--60s folk and Beatles-pop, 70s arena rock power chords, 80s new wave, and 90s grunge to create a truly imaginative but also very listenable style.

I do not recommend either it or the first in the series, The Tainted Blade, unless you are really dedicated to classic D&D novels. It has some good ideas at times, which is what redeems it somewhat, but it also wastes a great deal of time in descriptions and the constant emotional agonizing of the characters rather than getting to the meat of the matter at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Part Tangerine, Two Parts Dream","review":"Imagine a tangerine. Then imagine a dream. Put the two together and you get Tangerine Dream. This early '80s album exposes you to 4 roughly 20 minute tracks. Recorded in Warsaw during a period when Solidarity was challenging the communist regime, we get a sense that this krautrock group is exposing people behind the iron curtain to what is possible with citrus-named new age music. I've noticed that if you abbreviate Tangerine Dream, it is T.D., which is also the shortened version of touchdown. But Tangerine Dream has never played at the halftime of the Super Bowl or even the Orange Bowl. Why is that? Can the world be just if that is not true? And Schmoelling adds the perfect amount of schmaltze. My friend's cousin's brother-in-law told me that this is the favorite album of Bobby Knight, but I didn't believe him."},{"rating":"2","title":"received this paperback quickly","review":"I received this book about Pollack quickly and found it a fascinating read.

I also noticed that some of the blocks have been drafted incorrectly...too bad this wasn't noticed prior to publication.On the whole though, the book is still worthwhile purchasing as the details included about Jane Stickle and the pictures of the quilt/blocks are inspiring. What a work of art this quilt is...I wonder how she did it without all the gadgets we have at our fingertips nowadays. A quilt that comes from such a fascinating time like the Civil War is a true treasure! Shipping was very prompt and the book arrived much sooner than estimated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a cookbook without the recipes....","review":"Dear Jane is a complation of the two hundred and twenty five blocks from Jane A Stickle quilt. If you are a pro quilter you will probably be able look at these drawings and figure out what goes where. For the rest of us, who require directions, you will probably wish Papadakis was a bit more thorough.Its fine to identify the blocks. I could probably do that given the time. But a drawing and the block name does not constitute a 'pattern.' It might be more accurate to say this book has pictures of each block with a diagram but no instructions.Overall, I expected more. The Jane Stickle quilt is a masterpiece but this book was useless unless you just want to identify the blocks she made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book thinking it would tell me how to make a reproduction quilt based on the Civil War-era quilt on the cover. It does not. It has a color photo of each block (which is nice), and then a line drawing the author drafted of the block. Many are inaccurate or have mistakes. There are no instructions for making the quilt. The yardage given for the background is wrong, according to the author's website. I had to look up on one of the author's web contributions to find out that the quilt has sashing, and how big to make it. Worst of all, to my mind, the bulk of the book is made up of cutesy diary entries that the author writes to the orginal quilter--long on feelings and short on substance. Finally, the names given to the quilt blocks are modern inventions, given by students in the author's quilting classes. NOT what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"A beautiful book with lots of blocks and inspirations. Use some of the blocks or all of them in lovely quilts.

I have to admit, it was very intriguing, and had me on the edge of my seat.. until the last 5 or so minutes. Do yourself a favor and stop this movie before the ending. It's how I'm going to watch this one in the future. What a completely horrid way to end the film. To the directors, all I can say is that they had a good thing going, and then blew it. As for the comparisons to Blair, there are a lot of differences. Judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'll admit--the only reason I saw this film was to see how it compared (or didn't) to BWP. First, let me say that while BW leaves a lot to the imagination, TLB tries to go out of it's way to explain everything. For that reason, I really didn't enjoy the movie as much as I probably could have. The whole documentary-like premise with all of the narraration just didn't scare me. There was a creepy little twist to the plot (those of you who have seen it know what i'm talking about) but the directors could have left it at that and ended the movie there. Bottom line: if you need everything explained to you and handed to you in a neat little package in order for you to understand a movie and be scared, then by all means, see TLB. Otherwise, those who have a vivid imagination should see BW."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie with a great ending","review":"This movie has a great ending, but the other 80 minutes are painful. No character development, bad acting, zero script, clips and monologue are repeated over and over and over... and speaking of the monologue, did I mention that the entire movie has our \\"host\\" narrating the entire thing ... nothing happens except for what he tells you happens, and his voice is SO annoying ...

I wanted this movie to be good ... it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Haven't Seen Blair Witch and Now I Don't Think That I Will","review":"I'm giving this movie 2 stars because I think that it was well made, but ultimately boring. A friend of mine gave it to me to watch and I guess I only have myself to blame: I told him that I've not been sleeping well lately. I fell asleep twice while watching the video so I guess I should be grateful. I won't give anything away but I really get annoyed when a movie ultimately makes no sense. This movie left me feeling very annoyed. As I say above, I haven't seen Blair Witch but if it's anything like this fiasco, I'm not sure if I ever will. I'll wait for the video (due on 10/31/99) and watch it when I need a nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but the ending sank it.","review":"This movie turned out to be nothing like what I expected. The directors do an excellent job of capturing the feel of a PBS-style documentary, and the atmosphere is suitably creepy. The ending, however, really put me off. The first hour and a quarter is in documentary format, then it switches to third person, and what is revealed by this removes all sense from the movie. If that is indeed the case, then why would the documentary have even been made, and why analyze the lost tapes? Mind you, I don't mind being suckered by the directors, but this was too cheesy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative..","review":"First of all..let's get one thing straight: This movie came out BEFOORE the trashy Blari Witch Project. In fact, I think they are suing BWP for ripping it off. The movie was cool, creative, and ACTUALLY LOOKED LIKE A DOCUMENTARY. The only problem it has was that it was too short. It had a nice edgy feel to it. It got good reviews from the critics, but lacked the advertising hype that BWP had. And I've read this film was made with only 900 bucks! So very nic job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to BWP's intensity","review":"Bought a copy of the tape from Amazon because of the (purported) similarities between it and BWP. Really not that similar. Acting was over-done and really pretty bad. You never got to know/like the characters, so you could care less whether or not they survived. Story line was weak. Wanted to like it, just nothing likeable about it. YMMV, but for my copy, it's off to the auction block."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible movie","review":"Don't even think that if you liked Blair Witch you'll like this TERRIBLE film. After 15 minutes I wanted to leave desperately, but I didn't want to waste the money I'd spent. I was astounded at just how shoddily the film was put together. The idea is an interesting kernel, but the manner in which it is put together as a pseudo-documentary is really painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real innovative thriller movie","review":"I consider this movie one of the best innovative thriller movie ever made, simple and intense.

Unfortunatly, due to the makers of the Blair Witch Projects ability to rip off a film completed a year before their production even started the Last Broadcast will forever be compared to a poor movie and live in the shadow of it. The movies shouldn't be compared and if you watch the Last Broadcast with the idea that its similar to Blair Witch, you're likely to miss out. The point of the movie is not to scare you, although it likely will at points, it's making a statement about modern media, and the way it twists the reality of life into entertainment. Keep that in mind and the mockumentary will keep you on the edge of your seat and the ending will bring a greater sense of closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"B for effort, F for execution","review":"This is a goodnatured bit of amateur filmmaking which had me snoring about an hour into it.Watching \\"The Last Broadcast\\" left me, too, in a state of contemplation: how best can I direct my desire (and my dollars) to support the new, the independent, the original artistic endeavor? How prone am I to believe in hype?Dig up some birthday home movies instead. It could be that your great Aunt Bessie is the next new thing. Maybe she had an edgy camera style, with a flair for subtly deconstructing pre-feminist family dynamics. Perhaps her unflinching eye for fashion could reveal to you a Mom you never knew: in her skinny days, serving cake in floral capri pants and black-framed glasses, upswept sweaty wispy summer hair looking all the world for something straight out of a 1998 episode of \\"Friends\\".If I was a film school professor, I'd give this project a B and suggest more classes.

That is just an excuse for why it looks so bad. As a film student I have shot on a digital camera and the results look much better than what we are shown here.Not only does this movie look bad, it also has horrible acting. At least Blair Witch hired real actors, not just thier friends.I have one final question for the film makers: Why is a movie that is supposed to be a mockumentary all of a sudden change that for the last shot? Seeing the killer with his camera doing his monologue over the dead body really took me out of the mood. The movie should have just ended with the revelation of the killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST...MOVIE...EVER","review":"The fact that this 'film' came before Blair Witch and was made for $900 should have no bearing on your decision to watch, or worse, purchase it. It is quite simply the worst waste of time and film I've seen since taking a college film course. It aspires to some unclear pretension of social commentary, like a community college student's wet dream, but ultimately, like the same wet dream, ends up a sticky mess of grade school writing and sub-amateur camera work. Somebody take the cameras and pens away from these jokers. Watch the Last Broadcast at your peril."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY BORING","review":"I did not see TBWP. If it is anything at all like Broadcast, I have no desire to see it whatsoever. I waited and waited for something to happen, but nothing ever did.

It did not belong in this type of movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This thing is terrible. I kept waiting for the scary parts but guess what? There are none. On the back of the box it says \\"Don't watch it alone.\\" Well they're off by one number. \\"Don't watch it at all\\". Its kind of like an expanded version of an episode of \\"The Outer Limits.\\" Yes....the ending is that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Blair Witch...","review":"I heard about the legal case between this film and Blair Witch and felt compelled to see for myself. I loved Blair Witch and was excited to see how similar the films were. After seeing this film, the comparisons are undeniable...when you think of how innovative BW was you MUST realize that the premise was stolen from this film.While the reviews on this film are mixed, I have to applaud the makers for the TRUE ingenuity that BW is credited with. Moreover, I thoroughly enjoyed the film.This is is just a fabulous film, innovative, scary and realistic all set against the backdrop of a cynical media-driven world. Fun stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic ending ruins the whole thing","review":"The movie is actually quite effective at first. There are a few precious moments that are horribly creepy but the ending...oh..the ending is so stupid that it ruins the entire thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This movie was an incredible disappointment. After reading numerous reviews portraying this movie to be considerably better than Blair Witch Project, I was quite excited. The Last Broadcast turned out to be nothing more than a low-grade psychological thriller. The makers of Blair Witch Project clearly took notes and improved this entire documentary concept by actually injecting an element on the supernatural. Not only did The Last Broadcast fail to deliver any chills or creepy moments, but it gave virtually no historical background to the story of the Jersey Devil. Furthermore, at no point in the movie was there ever a slice of information which eluded to anything other than human foul play.I feel bad even mentioning The Blair Witch Project in my review, because its an insult to compare the two. Hell, it doesnt even compare to Blair Witch 2. I gave this movie 2 stars merely for the fact that its an indie film."},{"rating":"2","title":"It scared the &%#@ out of me!!!","review":"This movie definitely was similar to Blair Witch because it had the same intensity. The mystery and freakyness made it hard to look away but the suspence made you want to dive to the floor. If it had a Resevoir Dogs ending, it would have been an easy 5 stars. A must see!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No style, no substance.","review":"Most repetitious and boring film I have ever seen. The whole film is told through a specific point of view and the filmmakers throw that concept out the window at the end. Final scene does not work with the rest of the movie. This film was promoted as one of the first \\"Digital\\" feature films, too bad it has no style and no substance. Interesting concept poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Labeling the items in your closet, alphabetizing your CDs...","review":"...cleaning your bathroom with a toothbrush... these are just some of the things you'll find infinitely more fulfilling and interesting than sitting through this painfully slow, sophomoronic attempt at moviemaking. You'll find the film's payoff is nothing compared to the mystery of how such a relatively short movie can make one feel as though they've just sat through a six hour series of instruction tapes of Al Gore's techniques for meditation. - BUT, it IS challenging! In fact, The Last Broadcast challenges it's viewer's to debate whether it might not actually be their last video."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a movie. We just kept waiting and waiting... and waiting for something to happen.

This movie has bad acting, horrible dialouge and terribly written characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"thankfully, the Last Broadcast","review":"Being a resident of NJ I wanted to like this movie. I have long been interested in the legend and mystique of the Pine Barrens and myth of the Jersey Devil. I also heard the hype that this movie was the precursor to the \\"Blair Witch Project\\". Unfortunalty, this movie isn't nearly as good or intense. It is pretty decent for the first 3/4 where it somewhat successfully emits a documentary feel. But the ending is stupid and the movie and its credibility fall apart with its idiotic and cut and paste conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"I bought this movie when I worked in a movie store everyone said it was supposed to be better than Blair Witch.

Please be warned I wish I would have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even try to compare this to BWP","review":"The only reason I saw this movie was because I heard it inspired BWP.The only thing this boring piece of crap may have inspired was the equally as boring Curse of the Blair Witch.So don't even waste your time and money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this garbage","review":"I waited for months for this movie to be released on video... what a disappointment! How people can say this is better than Blair Witch is beyond me. This movie was horrible in every aspect, from storyline to the ending. The poor acting almost made it unbearable to watch. As where Blair Witch seemed to be real, this film was totally see-thru. One of the worst films I have ever seen, don't waste your time or money on this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Broadcast","review":"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was horrible. It was not even a little scary. On the cover of the movie it says possibly done before blair witch.Well I did not see any reason to mention that. Even it you saw blair witch and did not like it you would agree it was better than this movie. It centers around a show done on public access television and it needs to boost ratings so they do a show on the Jersey devil. What is even worse is it is so bad you can't even laugh about it . My advice rent it if you are still interested but don't waste more than 3 dollars. Buy blair witch instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is up with the prices","review":"The movie is ok, After I paid almost 40 dollars for it and found out it was a Region 2 DVD, then Cancled it, THEN rented it for 4.50. Cmon dewds your charging rediculousy high prices for this movie, I almost think its not even worth the 4.50 from BB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Disgusting","review":"The Last Broadcast is a movie that centres around a futile plot, with stock characters. I travelled about 30 minutes just to rent this movie, and it was probably the biggest waste of time in my life. I live in Canada, and since it was only available at hollywood video, I drove down to rent it, because of all the great reviews it had. What I got was the slowest, lamest movie I could ever imagine. This movie is basically only good for people who want to watch a documentary, but, a made up documentary. This movie was NOT scary, it had no plot, and was a farce, as far as acting and storyline were concerned. It is my opinion that anyone out there, thinking that this will be another blair witch project, should just stay away. The scariest part of this movie is it's strange popularity. In short, don't rent it, buy it or look at it, you'll be disappointed for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"Despite the hoopla that this was the original 16mm low budget student success, The Last Broadcast falls flat on its behind, even after its creators tried to get the public to compare it directly to the Blair Witch, which was a far mor intelligent film. Another \\"dissapearance in the woods\\" movie, although this one is presented as a documentary, where pieces of the found film footage are examined by experts and a court of law. Had this movie actually bothered to delve into the legend of the Jersey Devil (which is an actual phenomenon, it may hvae been halfway interesting. The acting is grossly unconvincing, and the plot line is just boring. The film never becomes scary, what with all the courtroom talk, and the ending is just corny, and blatantly ruins whatever atmosphere the film had built upon. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A society based in reality T.V. this movie hits home!","review":"It amaizes me that people don't get The Last Broadcast. It is making such a powerful statement on our insainly based realitiy television society. Come on kids, \\"what you see is what you get?\\" The Narrative switch says it all! Hats off to filmakers finally using their heads! And if you've questioned TLB you might want to take a closer look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Blair Witch???? I DON\\"T THINK SO, KIDS!!!!!!!","review":"Don't believe the hype, folks. This movie isn't even in the same league as The Blair Witch. I was bored through 85% of the movie, and the ending left me cold and I felt as if I had been ripped off. Blair Witch was great because the movie slowly crept inside your head. This movie tried way too hard to be creepy and just ended up and plain boring. And I also have to agree with the consensus- the acting was HORRIBLE. All in all, the movie was barely ok. To compare it to the Blair Witch is sheer blasphemy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"What more can I say.. At least the Blair Witch is creepy at times. The Last Broadcast is a wet blanket with really lame acting, dialouge, etc.. It was made for $900 and it shows. I'd rather watch my uncle's home movies from the fifties.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoots itself in the foot with the ending!","review":"Okay, this was a fairly interesting movie for most of the ways. Although the acting was worse than in your average high school play, it put up an intriguing mystery. And then- SPOILER ALERT - at the end it suddenly stops being a \\"documentary\\" and turns into a \\"movie\\", right in time for one of the most sickening murders I've ever seen. It makes no sense, and the movie's final big secret can be seen coming a mile away.Another HUGE complaint: the movie basically assumes that every viewer in the audience knows exactly what the Jersey Devil and the Pine Barrens are. How about some explanation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"a few good elements but mostly just dull","review":"I could barely stay awake while watching this, and I forced myself to watch it all the way to the end...which turned out to be poorly conceived. It would have been better if the filmmakers had shown ambiguous footage that implied a real Jersey Devil, rather than just having the killer turn out to be a regular, dull human being after all.It's also difficult to watch because of all the effects, blurriness, wavering lines, and static that they seem to think makes it more realistic but is actually just irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the movie,But over priced on used one here!!!!","review":"I liked the movie,was suspence and shocking parts and kinda scary,but not great like Blair witch project was ,but was good...then i always wants to Buy it on DVD,but coudent find the new one on internet world .and also in amazon.com(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT HORROR MOVIE!","review":"THIS REALLY WORKS YOUR MIND.

The only interesting stuff on the DVD are the behind the scenes documentaries in which the film makers talk about the distribution and production of this no-budget failure.As for the film itself: it's dull (with a very annoying voice-over explaining every useless detail at least three times), and horribly filmed. If you're familair with Adobe's PhotoShop software, you will recognize the overdose of cheap graphic effects that should give the film some modern hi-tech look, but doesn't add anything to the (lack of) storyline.Made as an amateur movie, the filmmakers should have keep it that way. Let's hope not too many people will feel inspired by the Blair Witch Project and copycat the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is simply a horrible load of junk.","review":"Just saw the movie last night. I have NO idea how anyone could possibly think this movie is decent. The acting was terribly unbelievable, we get no reason to care about ANY of the actors, and there's NO motivation for what happens at the end.Why would this guy make a documentary on himself? Why would these morons drag two CRT's three miles into the woods, and have a live internet & television broadcast, but no equipment to do so? Why can't they type URL's right?It's quite obvious this movie was made by a few computer geeks doing nothing but showing off the editing equipment that was actually used for the movie.

Unlike predecessor and alleged copycat \\"Blair Witch Project\\", there is a mix of \\"raw\\" tape footage with interviews and TV news report clips added to good effect.The story is this video was made for a thousand bucks if so, another thousand bucks would have really helped clean up the few holes this highly watchable video is.

I don't think so. This book goes beyond the news reports and Hollywood embellishments to give you a cockpit's view of the spacecraft's hair-raising ride. Lovell and his co-author Kruger let you see the problems as the crew saw them, as Mission Control saw them, and as a nation saw them. It answers all the questions you may have had, makes you ask more, and then answers those. The authors show the fear, stamina, and true heroism of those intrically involved in the mission without the unnnecessary heart-wrenching of the film, which is based upon this book. They give you the facts as known by those on the mission, then translate to give any reader a clear idea of the feelings and actions of the crew and ground support. The book will inspire any reader, and give him faith in humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Moon - Read before you buy!","review":"Mr. James Lovall wrote a great book about Apollo 13.

Why did i gave it only 4 stars and not 5? There is only one thing, in the way this book is written that i really didn't like. The book is written like this: \\" And then lovell did that\\" \\"And then he felt that\\" etc. And not like you would expect \\"And then I did that\\" \\"And then I felt that\\" . I think this is the only one thing that i didn't like in the book, because it makes you feel less.. \\"There\\". and isn't that what books are all about?..

Readers of some of the his short stories from the same period will notice repeating ideas, which may cause some irritation.This book is driven by concept and plots, not characters. The characters are sketched in lightly, with detailing on the emotions and thoughts behind their actions. The dead bodies don't start piling up until the middle of the book. This novel is both a thriller and a sci-fi concept novel, but it is ultimately a meditation on power, attempts to hold onto power, and the morality of what people deem \\"is unfortunate, but necessary.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I thought I knew a lot of ways to gain and keep clients, but this book proved to be a real treasure trove of ideas that had never occurred to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK-Don't waste your time or money","review":"This book is AWFUL.

He is one reason Zen made it's way to the West, after all.

The lyrics make me cry. \\"Nice Guys finish list\\" proves these guys the saviors of punk. The best thing is, this CD is approved by the godfather of punk, Carson Daily. His show on MTV is THE BEST. There are so many punk chicks out there that diss poser punk like pennywise. I just wanted to say CARSON, I LOVE YOU, MAN!! I LOVE YOU SO FRICKING HARD!!

Green Day is all over the place musically with this album and that weakens it to a certain extent to me because no matter how great a band you are there are just some genres of music you will be weak at.

But while some hard-core fans may criticize their use of extra intruments and the testing of new waters... why? They've proven with this album that they're more than just a catchy, three-power-chord-bashing punk group. With songs like \\"The Grouch\\", \\"Redundant\\", \\"Walking Alone\\" and \\"Good Riddance\\", Green Day has proven that they've grown up, grown out and grown wiser. And at the same time, they give us a throw-back to the carefree teenager days of Dookie.

BUY IT!!!!!!...... just get it already"},{"rating":"2","title":"their last great cd","review":"This is truly Green Day's last GREAT cd. It is their third best cd after Dookie and Insomniac. Their sound is definitely different from their earlier works being a little heavier and less punk. However, it is a lot better than their later works, which sound totally different than this stuff. It has really good catchy songs that have great replay value. Nice Guys Finish Last is a good song with a hilarious music video. Hitchin A Ride is good too as is Redundant, Haushinka, Walking Alone and Prosthetic Head. Good Riddance is the big radio hit of the bunch and has reached the status of a legendary sentimental song. I recommend this to ALL Green Day fans and to those who think rock music today sucks and are looking for good music of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're a Nimrod if You Don't Have it","review":"This yet another awesome Green Day CD, featuring the big hit Good Riddance(Time of Your Life), which, according to Billie Joe, only took him around 10 mintues to write. It was also ironically the number 1 wedding song that year, although the meaning of the song was really a bitter send-off. My all time favorite on here, though, is Hitchin' A Ride. I love everything about it. Last Ride In, King For a Day, and Redundant are also some of my favorites. I also recommend that you try 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours or Insomniac if you want to hear a more punk Green Day, because everyone seems to delight in saying they aren't punk anymore, in which today I think I'd call them more Alternative Rock with a dash of Punk here and there. But who really cares? If you like their music, then what difference does it make what genre people put them in? So pick it up, because you'd be a Nimrod if you didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album by the best band","review":"This album is amazing and no green day havent gone soft over the years.

There are great songs on the album (Nice Guys Finish Last, Hitchin' A Ride, Redundant, Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)), but I would much rather listen to Dookie or American Idiot than this album.

Worthy of 500 stars.","review":"This CD shows a complete mix. This is more eclectic and varied musically than even a 311 CD. It mixes extreme-core punk (Platypus, Take Back), pure punk (Scattered, Nice Guys Finish Last, Reject), and pure experimentation (King For A Day, Good Riddance, Last Ride In, Hitchin' A Ride) All together it makes an amazing mix and by far the best Green Day CD ever. My personal favs are 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18.Everyone says Green Day suck because they turned pop on Warning. I don't care.

Fast-paced and neurotic in true Billie Joe style, resorting to interludes of angstiness and even a beachy instrumental, Nimrod is the absolute classic Green Day album. Including 'Nice Guys Finish Last', 'Hitchin' A Ride', and the balladic 'Good Riddance (Time Of Your Life)', Nimod is the album to get you introduced to this King of Bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'mon, you gotta love the variety!","review":"Nimrod, the fifth release by Green Day, captures the time when they decided they where going to screw off all their punk critics and create a CD that was in the style that THEY wanted. Well, I think it came out pretty good, because Nimrod is a great CD. There is so much variety on this CD, some of the songs sound like they could be on Warning, while some of the others sound like they could be on Insomniac. There is also an instrumental track, and the song King for a Day that includes horns. Worth getting if you are a Green Day fan, and worth getting if you like music at all. Best Tracks: Nice Guys Finish Last, Hitchin a Ride, The Grouch, Scattered, Worry Rock, Platypus, Jinx, Haushinka, Take Back, King for a Day, and Good Riddance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iam Having The Time Of my Life listening to this CD","review":"The Green Day NIMROD cd kicks ass buy it or else"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album from Green Day!","review":"Whoa!

NICE GUYS FINISH LAST has become one of my favorites, i really like HAUSHINKA and PROSTHETIC HEAD too. all in all, this is a must have for any \\"punker\\" out there. don't ask bout the punker, my brother called me that once and it just kinda caught on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Day makes another classic","review":"Just like Dookie and Insomniac, this is a classic. After those CD's, they sort of steered away from punk and made Nimrod a more alternative rock CD, which I think was an extremely wise move. This CD is probably their best songwriting than on any other Green Day CD. Not to mention, like Insomniac, it's in the angry league. Don't be fooled by \\"Time of Your Life\\", this CD is a angry, foul-mouthed hard alternative record, but if you do get it, you won't regret it.Best songs: Every song, with the exception of \\"Scattered\\", is equally good, so every song other than the formentioned is my favorite song."},{"rating":"2","title":"very very very good","review":"all green day albums are great - i have all of them, but this is probably my favorite. my favorites include: nice guys finish last, hitchin' a ride, the grouch redundant, scattered, all the time, worry rock, uptight, last ride in, jinx, haushinka, walking alone, reject, king for a day, time of your life, and prosthetic head.incredible cd. well worth it. it rarely leaves my cd player"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best Green Day CD","review":"Nimrod is an awesome CD. Green Day really shows their musical diversity here. On this album you'll find speeding punk, raging Hard Core, swingin' ska, and even a little alternative.

In that time, they decided to make an album according to their instincts and not to follow through with their punk signature style. The result - one of the best CD's of the year, a great mix of their usual punk songs like \\"Nice Guys Finish Last,\\" \\"All the Time,\\" along with other, lighter songs, like \\"Prosthetic Head,\\" \\"Redundant,\\" and \\"Scattered,\\" as well a hard-rocking songs like \\"I Hate You\\" and \\"Take Back.\\" Of course, the best of the set is their acoustic smash \\"Good Riddance (Time of your life).\\" Green Day has finally matured into a better band, and have begun to stretch the limits of punk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"i love the cd. the mix of style of the tracks makes a great album. i have been a greenday fan for a long time. even though i liked their album dookie better this cd is a good buy and u will enjoy it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab A Copy Of This CD Whenever You Can","review":"this cd is one of green days fineist. i especially like 'king for a day' and 'Hitchin a Ride' but Dookie was a great CD too.

Sure, Korn and Offspring sold out, but Green Day?I've been a fan of them since 1994, when Dookie came out. I got the disc and couldn't put it down. Then when this came out, I was so excited. I got it from Columbia House (a music club I belong to that's about to kick me out). I loved it. Now I am reading this sh*t about Green Day selling out on Amazon. Let me clear it up: THEY DIDN'T. QUIT SAYING THAT! And yes, I DID hear some 1039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours songs. Green Day did NOT sell out! They're still as great as they were in '94.by the way, I wrote another review. April 28. I'm the guy who's the \\"Official Imitation Mascot of the new millenium\\"...something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good","review":"To put it plainly, I liked Dookie better. I am a punk fan, so that figures. If you are at all into the melodic, soft rock side of Green Day, I recommend going with Nimrod. You will like \\"Redundant\\", \\"Good Riddance\\", etc. Do not fear, loyal punk fans! Green Day stays true to their roots on this album (well, a little bit) with headbangin' songs like \\"Haushinka\\", \\"Take Back\\", and \\"Reject\\". There are a lot of songs on this album, so whichever side of Green Day you prefer, you will find something you like. Go ahead and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah baby yeah!!!!","review":"I really love this cd. About half of their songs I absolutely love, and the other half are still good though. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is because they swear so freakin' much! I can handle it when they use the profanity in moderation, but I don't know about the rest of ya'all, but everytime one of my parents walks into my room i have to make a mad dash to my cd player and turn it off so they don't freak. I really love the song \\"the grouch\\", it's so catchy and that's why it pisses me off they chose those lyrics-how many of you really wanna go around singin' that crap-i for one don't. Over all though-it's a great cd-don't let the uncreative lyrics stop you from buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent album that matches the skill of 'dookie'","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this album after hearing such bad reviews, yet it was a pleasant surprise. It was as if the group had done a little growing up - they still have the punk rock attitude, but with mature lyrics. As always, they have tons of cuts on the album which means more listening time. All in all it is an intriguing album that show this band has some real depth and will stick around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bunch of two-and-a-half minute headbanging sessions","review":"Nimrod - a fairly awesome CD. The mix is unreal - unlike Dookie, which despite being magnificent is a lot of the same, Nimrod has the psychedelic (Platypus), the lyrically brilliant (Time of Your Life), the melodious (Redundant) and even some hard core, yes, almost metal in Take Back. And of course, the rockin hit Hitchin A Ride. A great new sound for Green Day"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little better than Insomniac","review":"I like this a little better than Insomniac.

Get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk Rock Hipocracy","review":"Green Day are such hypocrites, on this album especially. There are some gems, like The Grouch, Good Riddance (Time of Your Life), Uptight, and many more. However, in many songs, they sing about rebellion, so they can opress others. Although they don't actually say that, many songs (especially Reject) show this attitude. Uptight has themes involving angst, but they bash these same feelings in Prosthetic Head. Platypus (I Hate You) is the worst track on the whole thing. Lyrics like \\"No one loves you and you know it\\" should not be praised. Who do they think they are?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment","review":"you guys, i only bought this cd because it was one of the only punk bands i don't own a cd to, so i felt obliged. no offense, i know these guys put a lot of work into everything and i respect them for that. but people? green day SUCKS!sorry, just had to put that down. the lyrics are meaningless, and the music is imitation. if you are looking for kicking punk, check out the descendents(who are the KINGS!

I hate the way Green Day tries to become trendy with pathetic attempt to get on the ska bandwagon with King for a Day. I also really hate Good Riddance. What the hell are violins doing on a so-called \\"punk\\" band's CD? If you like the sound of this song, don't buy the CD. They release a single that is really soft sounding and then they throw really hard songs at you like Reject, Take Back, Platypus, Jinx, and Prosthetic Head. All of these songs have screaming vocals and heavy guitar that shows absolutely no talent.This CD should definetly have a parental advisory because they say the \\"F word\\" 19 times on it. I don't mind the \\"F word\\" that much but when it becomes all you say on a CD, it shows that you suck as a songwriter.Green Day has the best drummer and bassist in the music industry but Billy Joe Armstrong ruins it with his awful songwriting, hard guitaring, and screamed vocals.

Good mix of fast and faster songs. My favorite-Haushinka-a great song with a lot of different chord patterns-progressing mood-comes right out of Jinx. Good Riddance is a great slow song-an insteresting side of Green Day. Prosthetic Head-Great ending. If you like Green Day, like rock, or are a lost Blink 182 fan-buy this album.

If this is yourentrance point to Ween you won't find a better one.The album is all over the place. Metal, gospel, pop, folk,funk, rock, R&B;, punk. A lot of it is plain old ridiculous,but it's so overdone that for the most part it just makes melaugh or groove along.Some people try to write Ween off as somewhat of a comedy act.Not serious enough.

A mix of indie, lofi, punk, metal, pop and comedy rock makes this album one of the coolest albums I've ever heard. This album displays the great relationship Gene and Dean have together as song writers. It is clear that they are having so much fun making the music, adding thier heart and soul into every song on the album. It is a great 76 minute adventure of ever changing joy. The remastered sound is superb; you can even notice the quality difference on a little boom box. Some of the best tracks (in my opinion) include: I'm in the mood to move, Fat Lenny, Bumblebee (both parts), Don't Laugh (I Love You), Nan and the crazy psychedelic Blackjack.

In the cover there is a story of the brothers Dean and Gene Ween and their encounter with Boognish, who is displayed on the front cover of the album. They go on to say that Boognish is the embodiment of two extremes: Good and Evil. The musical styles of this album are more or less a reflection of this concept. The gist of this album is punky, funky, and ultimately delerium, ABSOLUTELY a Ween album to say the least. There is even a funky cover of Prince's \\"Let me lick your p***y\\". This is definetely an album for Ween affecionados. Those who are recently tuning in to the band may do well to pick up \\"Chocolate and Cheese\\" or \\"White Pepper\\". Like the title of one of the albums songs, this disc is like a mushroom festival in hell.

I took test pictures and uploaded them to be certain it wasn't my error, but consistently it erases a full camera of snaps instead of uploading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died within a few months","review":"The first time we let the battery drain completely, it died. It will not recharge. It is totally dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films I have seen.","review":"Rabbit Hole is one of the best films I have seen. It depicts a suburban couple who have lost their four-year-old son. He was hit by a car as he ran after his dog. It has been eight months and the wife and husband are finding themselves in conflict about how to work through their grief. Her mother and sister, their friends, the young man who was driving the car, and people in the therapy group they attend also struggle with the complications of the death of a child. I like the simple honesty of the scenes, which show how loss does not necessarily draw people together, but does raise the stress in their lives. Such an event demands change and it is never certain what direction that change will take. Little decisions and acts determine if and how healing will take place. I can't say more without ruining your experience of the film. Fine script, fine direction, fine acting by Nicole Kidman, Aaron Eckhart, and Dianne Wiest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"I debated about how many stars to give this movie. The cast is good, especially the actor who portrays Jason (I can't think of his name). The other actors are okay, too, but the story is flat, and just as I was thinking at the end about rating it, it ended. I HATE the ending. The story is pretty good, but it just never quite gets there, and it leaves you wanting. Dianne Wiest is great as usual, and for her performance and for Jason, I'd give them 5 stars for sure. Otherwise.... Eh. I would have given it one star if it weren't for those two performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dramatic masterpiece","review":"Second best drama I've seen since Doubt with Meryl Streep.

Your loss that you didn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theres not much to this movie","review":"I don't really know what the other reviewers saw that I didn'tsee, but I must say I was disappointed with this movie. It neverreally took off. The movie in my opinion needs work.The beginning is really slow and the ending is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, but you're wrong","review":"I've read several reviews that critique the movie as having no conflict (the movie seemed centered around conflict, conflict b/w the husband and wife, between the mother and her mother and sister, between Jason and the husband), and several found the ending needed more (although the subtlety of a life-goes-on-let's-heal ending demonstrated this loud and clear to me). The premise of the movie is clearly stated, so you know this isn't going to be a feel-good movie. In fact, I would have been disappointed had it taken the turn of \\"Ah, we are fine again, and whole.\\" That's crap-thinking, and unrealistic, too. Too often life's tragic events are depicted as humorous, and there is no way losing a child should ever be treated as a lighthearted matter. That, I think, would trivialize the intense subject matter for the sake of entertainment, which would be a travesty. This movie will touch your heart, and if you go into it with the proper expectations, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"i did not BUY THIS","review":"dID NOT READ IT DID NOT BUY IT.

No movie, play, novel, or any other type of literature can touch upon every complex issue of losing your only child. This movie did however relay in very realistic manner the bigger picture of this type of grief. Great actors that acted great in this film was comforting for me. There is however nothing that can truly comfort a parent who has lost their child or provide any magical answers to the \\"why did this happen\\". This is a great movie that was well researched but it is not reality. The reality aspect of this movie is unbearable at times. In loving memory of my beautiful Son, I will see you again someday. Your loving Father"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grief...like a brick in your pocket","review":"For those who have gone through the grieving process this movie is very familiar and speaks to the difficulty of living with the loss of something that can't be replaced, how different people strive to learn to live with and move on from something that really isn't reconcilable. The cast did a great job and in particular Kidman."},{"rating":"1","title":"no conflict, no resolution","review":"this movie has a plot - boy is killed and parents struggle to find themselves again. However, no one could possibly ever get over the loss of a child.The movie went on and on featuring their daily struggles but there was no build up towards any conflict. It just sort of.... ended. Who wants to watch people grieve for 1.5 hours? I took nothing away from this film other than the fact that the loss of a child bears no greater pain on Earth (but everybody already knows that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Could Have Been","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie.

I tried watching it again due to the wonderful reviews here, but still could not see what others saw. It felt like I'd watched this movie several times before.

The end project was such a success, and even a few days after seeing it I find myself thinking about scenes and portions of the film that were just so well done. This film wasn't given a wide release, most likely due to the dark subject matter of losing a young child. Don't let that get in your way though, as the end result is a relatively inspirational film going experience. See this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"*","review":"This is a great book.

Everytime he finds Blue he yells \\"Yay!\\" He's only two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Occupies My Daughter!","review":"Once my daughter and I read this book together a few times, she took it and ran with it! She likes to flip through the pages and lift the 50+ flaps, talking to who/what is behind them. She is 20 months old, watches Blues Clues a couple times a week, and LOVES this book. It is a big substantial board book and has so much to discover inside. She likes to read it on her own or with me or dad, and NEVER tires of it. I strongly recommend this great Blues book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Here are a few clues to help you decide","review":"I took this book through three kids before the flaps got ripped out. I know a lot of reviewers have complained about \\"flimsy flaps\\" but I don't think it's fair to blame the book because a toddler ripped it. All I can tell you from my many years of experience with toddlers and board books is that rips are going to happen no matter what the flaps are made of.That said, this is a really fun book. It has lots and lots of flaps, as well as a plethora of objects and characters for your toddler to identify. If anyone in your house is a fan of the original show, you'll be thrilled to see all of your favorite friends represented here. In addition to identification opportunities, there's also a story that takes you through a clue finding experience, as you and Steve try to figure out where Blue wants to go today.My kids have loved this book. My two-year-old is currently obsessed with it. We read it like ten times a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who in the heck is Kevin","review":"I bought this book used. The adult in the story was Kevin.

Seeing all her friends from Blue's Clues makes it interesting, and the colors are bold and the illustrations just like the show. The jillions of flaps are just what my curious girl needs. Many of the flaps are bent or missing now, but I plan to just buy a new one when it gets too beat up. It's a very large book though, can be hard to tote around when your on outings or trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware cheap flaps","review":"Although the book itself is entertaining, the flaps are made of a flimsy cardboard material.Needless to say, it took my 2 year old son all of 10 minutes to rip some off as he tried to pick up the book, while holding an open flap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"This book was awful. The writer double talks at every possible time. He uses a lot of filler and overdoes the work. It was like he was just sitting around at a coffee shop and just talking with some of his friends and asked per example: What do you know about Client 32?...and then he proceeded to write what he said. It is not well structured and he jumps from point to point and there is no continuity. The book could also have page numbers the \\"Roman Numeral\\" concept does not work very well, it gets confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I have just finished taking a course at school using this book. I have my MCP and A+ and want to get my CNA. If you are thinking about doing the same DO NOT buy this book! It was the most poorly written text book I have ever read. It is terribly organized and hard to read. The author duplicates himself on numerous occasions, and jumps from topic to topic often. Save your hard earned money and buy a different book!

Some of the best native California sites are listed in the book, and hopefully it will stimulate people to investigate these interesting cultures and their lifestyles further.

This being said, I bought my nephew a sled for Christmas which has become a joke because I told him maybe he would be able to use it next year. Since Christmas, there has been enough snow for 2 neighborhood sled days. I say neighborhood sled days because there are not any extreme hills or rough terrain to sled on in their neighborhood. The brake broke the 1st day! A broken brake doesn't keep this sled from being usable & it is fast--but I think if you are going to have an option like a brake on a sled that as a customer I should expect it to last longer than a day. It IS built as a \\"kids' sled\\". Unfortunately, they didn't tell me about it breaking right away so now I missed the return deadline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Great product. Fast arrival. Great experience.... Would not have had a better or faster experience shopping at a store. Thanks a bunch!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So excited...only to be disappointed :(","review":"I purchased this sled as a Christmas gift to my son. I received the item in a timely manner, however, the sled was damaged in multiple areas. The seller only packaged the sled in a black plastic bag and it offered zero protection for the sled. After contacting the seller, who was courteous and understanding, and notifying them of this they told me that they couldn't put the sled in an actual box without charging more for shipping for an oversized package fee. They then refunded my money.The sled itself seems to be somewhat durable yet flimsy at the same time. It seems like it would go over snow fairly easily but any excessive use would ultimately break it in a heartbeat.If anyone wants to purchase this sled then I would highly recommend them purchasing it from a company that will ship it in a box to keep it protected. A black bag is not justifiable protection for a thin plastic sled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even durable enough for a child!","review":"Purchased for Christmas, first time out the end of January and it literally broke in half the first time sledding downhill! My 12yr old 72lb son was on it and didn't even get to use it a 2nd time. Would ask for a refund if I thought it was worth the trouble of fighting them for it! Would not recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun sled","review":"Damaged packaging, but intact sled. Fun for kids. Hand brakes don't really do much to slow sled down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but watch for poor craftsmanship","review":"The first unit shipped had a defect in the handle -- whoever put on the pin misaligned it, which kept the handle from retracting fully. It also didn't go through the reinforced section like it should have.The second unit had a similar flaw, the handles don't retract all the way, but they do so symmetrically, so there are no steering issues. This sled is very fast, very light, and fits our 5-year-old perfectly. She is able to control her speed and steer the sled very well. Amazon's return policy is what makes buying this sled online a possibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sled is dangerous","review":"Used this sled the night of a new snowfall - worked well for a few runs. Came back the next day, when the snow was more packed from more sledders using the hill. After the first run, a handle and side cracked off. On the second run, the back corner cracked off. On the third run, the other side cracked off. The fourth run was never completed; the sled literally cracked in half. The front of the sled kept going, the back just lay there while I was sent aimlessly rolling down the hill. This product is amazingly cheap. Would you let your kids use a sled that breaks up into sharp plastic bits? I guess it depends how much you like them. Zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked Used","review":"I have ordered may products via Amazon and this is the first time I am not happy....this toboggan arrived in poor condition.

We bought it to take our two year old sledding. On the very first run my husband went down it broke! The whole handle and side piece.

We went in a group with many families and each family brought some sleds (including several foam ones from Costco, etc). But this sled was the best by a big margin. First day when it snowed, none of the other sleds worked in the soft powder, but this one worked great. After several (unsuccessful) trials with the other sleds, we decided to put them away and all the kids lined up to use this sled (and another plastic saucer, which was ok...but not as good). Throughout the trip, all the kids wanted to ride on this sled only.When riding, this felt safe as the whole body is enclosed (noone fell out, which was a common problem with other sleds). Also it went really fast and far...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got random color (not as pictured)","review":"We haven't had a chance to use the sled yet, but it looks sturdy and friends of ours have the same model and are happy with it. Still, i am disappointed that we got a RED sled when the product image is BLACK. I ordered this sled on purpose because i didn't want any bright color, but at this price it's easier to keep the color i don't want than mail it back at my own cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"********** TEN STARS! ABSOLUTELY BUY THIS BOOK FIRST!","review":"This book is ABSOLUTELY the best on the subject. And I've read _all_ of them: Field, Froug, Hunter, Seger, Halperin, and many more.

However, as a book on screenwriting, this book gives the very basic of basics. That is, to sum up 97 pages of text, you need to have characters, a plot, conflict, a resolution. Oh, yeah, and it all has to make sense.Each concept is \\"delved\\" into in about two to three pages. Most of this, however, is just primer to the Analysis Section in the back of the book, where the writer now explains how all those elements take place in various movies he considers Good.Not a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST THERE IS FOR A NOVICE","review":"Howards book is the best there is for the new student of film. His twenty tools hit the nail on the head. That's 100 pages of the 300 page book. Then he applies his 20 tools to 16 successful films. He calls this his analysis. He wants the reader to view or review all 16 of the popular films he lists prior to reading his analysis. This would take over 30 hours. If you have 32 hours, great.On reflection, ever writer must chart his own course in screen writing. \\"I'll do it my way\\" as Frank Sinatra sings.

One that intrigued me was Mary Cantwell's recollection of mistreatment by the medical world. The order of the day was that women were kooky and needed to be medicated, and doctors should be paternalistic. The choices were frightening: amphetamines for depression, contraceptives for thinness/maybe an eating disorder. It appalled me tha Ms. Cantwell suffered for months with \\"infertility\\" because her obstetrician neglected to tell her she was taking a contraceptive. The fad of the era was prolonged Freudian psychoanalysis with no forseeable end. Contrast that to the current managed care psychiatric environment where you must become well after ten visits.

Well, Clay hopes to dispel some of that ignorance in this brief text. He explains that these are nuclei often travelling at very high speeds; often several percent of the speed of light. Just being nuclei, without any accompanying electrons, means that they are highly charged.Which gives rise to the experimental methods to detect and study them. Ranging from balloons carrying detectors high in the atmosphere to ground-based detectors. The experimental aspect of this field can be somewhat colourful.But where do they come from? Why so energetic? He goes into several possible explanations. Possibly from stellar reactions deeper in the galaxy. But it is contentious as to what those reactions are.

Bags are much better for traveling, of course. We have bought Rooibus, green tea loose, better belly blend, better sleep blend, chamomile loose and enjoy them all, but Rooibus (African Sunset) is our favorite, hot or cold, with nothing added (my wife) or with honey or a very slight touch of stevia (me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to the Carpenters","review":"I'm a major league big time fan of Carpenters.

Taped it off HBO during those free premium weekends and watched it over and over again.Years later, I got the DVD and realized Ive become more critical of movies- to that point: The movie's real world logic was really non-existant at all - at times I had realize that this was probably a dream or fantasy and that logic was far from the key.But I did realize that the quotes and dialouge in the movie are what sells it. Its all about the actors and the words between them. Some of the gags are better than others, but through it all, the words seem to make this movie great. Its a tale of the underdogs and outkasts sticking it to the snobs in their own wacky way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good eighties flick!","review":"I've recently rented this and Better Off Dead, and this is my favorite of the two (which should be seen together). It's funny, and a great geeks-beat-the-cool-guy movie. There are really cool animation shorts, Demi Moore sings (if that's actually her voice) and it's also got Bobcat Golthplait and Jeremy Piven as a preppy jerk. I laughed out loud. My favorite scenes were the one where the preppy bullies make a human basketball hoop out of one of Cusack's friends and when Bobcat Golthplait gets stuck in a Godzilla costume and crashes a party. Definately worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Crazy Enough","review":"This movie is cute if you really loved \\"Better Off Dead\\" but doesn't really hold up under closer scrutiny.

A friend recently suggested I see this film, so I bought it with the hopes it would be great. It was. I do not love it as much as the others, but it still has the quirky humor of that time which I absolutely love.If you do not like \\"Better Off Dead\\" I would not suggest this movie, because it plays on similar themes.

The movie is cute and silly,certainly not a masterpiece,but I love to see all the familiar sites(Cusack's graduation was filmed where I went to Jr. High and \\"The Nantucket Drive-In\\" was actually the now nonexistent Hyannis Drive-In where I have great memories of childhood, seeing the Billy Jack movies with my siblings and my Mom,later partying with friends and dating girls as a teen).

The author's attention to detail and precision with regard to the many motorcycles, race cars, and Porsches that crossed Jimmy's path, as well as details about each of the races he entered is truly impressive. The book also includes a touching foreword by Jimmy's cousin, Marcus Winslow, Jr., a moving prologue outlining the author's lifelong interest in James Dean, and a fascinating epilogue spanning 50 years.

He admitted reluctantly that he considered returning it, but didn't want to hurt my feelings.

After an hour or so of chewing the layers split apart, making the bone shrink dramatically in size AND creating a choking hazard for the dogs. These bones will last an average of 3 hours.

Each action taken by a character seems to be prefaced by what almost happened, or what would have happened had the circumstances been slightly different. Being familiar with D20 rules I can understand that Byers is trying to explain the various spells/feats/skills in whole as he moves the story forward. However, I'd expect this sort of detail to work better in a gaming manual than a novel. (You can almost see Byers writing this book, throwing dice to decide the outcome of each scene.) I found the writing style confusing at times, and often had to reread a paragraph or two to figure out what had just happened. In the end, the writing broke my suspension of disbelief.I don't see myself reading the rest of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy All Three!","review":"I was first turned on to Byers after reading his book in the War of the Spider Queen. Since then I've read everything of his I can get my hands on.What I love about Byers the most is the how he can incorporate reality into his characters. Most often AD&D; novels have just a few shades of gray between black and white, but he expands the spectrum immeasurably.The characters and situations are all well written. I even found myself emphasizing with the antagonist! Almost a \\"tragic villain\\" if you will.I also really like how he keeps the reader chronologically engaged through dates in the chapter headings.I highly recommend buying the set all at the same time.

As this is a Forgotten Realms book I was not expecting a masterpiece. I was however, expecting an enjoyable, action packed book with an undercurrent of plot. As per the title of my post I was not disappointed.Byers style is very action oriented, with lots of fight scenes but the book developed a strong plot and did a good job developing inter character relationships. My only complaint is his repetitive use of phrases like \\"mystic pass\\" to describe the somatic components of spells. This usage was both repetitive, and made the book (and the other books in the series) sound somewhat like a DM's narration of a role playing session."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The product is definitely not worth the money IMO.

There is no way this little girl is sitting on the horse like the one that I got. It is simply a stuffed animal with no infrastructure.

Do not waste your money. My niece had a little horse that looked just like this one and was very sturdy. I thought I was buying the same one, I was not. It is extremely rickety, sorry there is not other word to describe this toy. We bought it for our three year old (around 32 lbs.) for Christmas and I was hoping that it would simply make it through the day without breaking. I didn't want her Christmas ruined because her toy broke. It's legs bend very easily. I am not sure what type of support it has but it feels like a wooden rod through the back. I have to say that it is cute but useless. It is not cute enough to be decoration and not sturdy enough to be ridden. Kids can sit on the horse but they must sit very still and be careful getting on and off, as it is prone to collapse. Just a note of advice, research any purchases you make through other companies first."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as nice as I thought it would be!","review":"I really thought this would be sturdier than it is.

This is such a big horse that any kid is going to want to sit on it. But they can't. Every time my daughter (who is small for her age) or my 5 year old son gets on it, the legs bend and then it falls over. The only time it doesn't fall is if the kids keep their feet on the ground and bare their own weight. This toy was such a disappointment and a source of frustratiion for the kids. Boo!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this product for this price $65.00 probably for $35.00","review":"When my little daughter saw her gift she was very happy, but when she sat on the horse it's was to weak. I bought it because I saw that they can use it like a real pony. She is a normal weight and 4 years old so she meets the specification described in the pony's detail. The same day she received it, the pony's head broke.

But in all honesty, its not made to ride. My daughter is 5 and weighs 40 lbs. But the front left leg actually collapsed while she snuck on it. It scared her cuz she thought she broke her new horse. I bought this for her cuz she wants a real horse and I have not the money or the room for one. I thought it would be a good substitute. I think we r both disappointed. But the horse is here to stay.

You should read the 1, 2, and 3 star ratings for this - they are correct. My 6 year old who weights about 50 lbs cannot sit on it without it collasping. If your child is going to sit on it - it is NOT a good toy. We have tried to adjust the legs and re-enforce it, but it is very poorly constructed and feels like it will break easily. The other reviews complain of the same thing - so I do not believe our toy was unique in this respect. It is a big expensive stuffed animal and not mean to be a toy to sit on.In addition the head is bent forward making it look nothing like the pictured horse at all.This was our featured gift for our 6 year old and she is very frustrated with the toy - I have not bought other Melissa and Doug stuff but if this is an example of their toys, then I will steer clear of their products.I would be concerned about the 5 star reviews - they do not seem to be describing the product I received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more","review":"For the price, the cross is very nice but the chain is much too thin.

But there home life is a nightmare, with their policeman father who holds many secrets. But in War-time England life is changing quickly for everyone. And with change, can come whole new lives.Overall, I really enjoyed this book, the only reason that I didn't give five stars is that Katie seem a little too clueless for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"unusual and interisting","review":"this story is about an Indian boy named Twisted Foot who has a deformed foot and cannot hunt because he can't run. He gets captured by another tribe along with an old man who tells stories. His favorite story is about creatures he has seen that the pioneers call \\"horses.\\" Twisted Foot and the old man set out to find these horses and they do. Then they figure out how to ride them (the old man remembers what a saddle looks like). It turns out they are the first Indians to discover horses! This book has a lot of action and I recommend it to readers 9 years old and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK puzzle, dislike sound","review":"I would not recommend this puzzle. Vehicle pictures are just stickers on wood, so not very durable. Sounds are incredibly loud, distorted, and annoying. Also, this puzzle is light-activated, so that if you walk into the room & turn on the light switch, this puzzle sounds off. Which has woken up the kids in the middle of the night, not to mention given me a heart attack! My kids don't play with it as much as they do with similar puzzles, I think because they don't like the noise. To turn off, you need to take out the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad - don't buy it!","review":"I bought this puzzle in a store for my 22 mos. grandson. I bought it twice because the first one didn't work. The sound would work at times and not at others. I thought it was a fluke and so i bought another one. That one was even worse, in that it worked minimally the first night, which upset my grandson very much. I returned them both! I am so surprised that Melissa and DOug would manufacture this, or continue to manufacture it after all the negative reviews. I wish I had read them before buying these puzzles. I will not make that mistake again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound effects!","review":"Bought this for my 18 month old son for supervised play, I would not recommend it. The sound effects are pretty loud and annoying. Also, it does not matter which piece the child is trying to put into which space, the magnets on the back of the pieces will make any of the other spaces go off...so if baby tries to put the airplane into the car space you will hear the car sound effect even though the piece is wrong. Sort of annoying. Additionally, the pegs are very small and if you or your child has ever stepped on one - VERY painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the usual high quality Melissa and Doug creation.","review":"These puzzles can be very annoying and SPOOKY! The puzzles are overly \\"sensitive\\" and slight movement will and can trigger the puzzles off. Our cat likes to hang around the play room and in the middle of the night, these puzzles sound off on their own!!! We actually had to warn our house/pet-sitter just so she won't be calling ghost busters!. Poor design and construction - the pieces does not even have to match, will just randomly goes off! We bought both the vehicle and animal puzzle and hence the example given here. My 18 month old \\"bang\\" (didn't even need to be in place) the roaster piece onto the cow spot and next it's \\"moo moo moo\\". Zero star for educational value for these series of puzzles!The pieces are also small and thin, unlike the typical high quality thick chunky solid wood pieces Melissa & Doug is famous for."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"It is a neat looking puzzle but when my son opened it on Christmas the sound wouldn't work. We tried different batteries but still no sound. He does like the puzzle but the main reason I bought it was b/c it was supposed to make neat sounds. Maybe it was just one time luck that it didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds are Terrible and will make Noises at Random","review":"The puzzle will go off and make vehicle noises at random, even in the middle of the night. This has been going on for months. Also, a vehicle will make noises even if a piece is placed on top of an incorrect cut out space. I don't mind noisy toys but this one is frustrating. I would much prefer a silent puzzle. I don't recommend this puzzle at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very thrilling","review":"From the comments I read,I thought I was about to embark in a nail-biting thriller - nothing farther from the truth. The story is well written; characters are finely developed, but the story does not thrill. Medium pace; series of flashbacks; does not really climax anywhere, just fizzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Difficult Read","review":"Although I usually really enjoy Ruth Rendell's books, this one was below the average. Her characterizations are always well done and they were in this book also; however, there was not a single character with which I could identify or have sympathy for. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"I majored in 17th century English lit; I am not a stranger to tedious writing. My wife gave me this book to read without telling me how awful it was. I read the other reviews and wonder if we read the same book? The plot is non-existent, the book moves at a snails pace with no perceptible direction, and the \\"shocking\\" ending was the biggest letdown of anything I've ever read. I would give this dreck zero stars if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful experience","review":"First, there are only two reasons I even completed the book: I wasn't going to let a bad writer get the best of a good reader, and I didn't have much other choice for books written in English at that time. Contrary to the other reviewers' opinions, I think the characters show very little development. They remain self-centered hedonists the entire time and do the things self-centered hedonists do. Ms. Vine tried to give the novel a dark and foreboding tone, but only succeeded in suffocating the reader with a wet blanket of boredom. While she could have redeemed the book with better descriptions of the settings and changes in that, she only made half-hearted attempts to do so. I have not read any other Vine/Rendell books, but my advice is to pass this one until you've read another. I hope it is just one bad book amongst some good ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"clever and creepy","review":"I will just say that for me this was one of Ruth Rendell's mostfascinating books. An English countryhouse, a bunch of twisted people and a rather inconvenient discovery on the grounds of the house provide the backdrop for a chilling, clever mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and dull","review":"The story is far from original now but maybe it was when it was written. (Group of debauched and at least one mentally unbalanced friends live together during young adult years and one or more of them kills another told in flashbacks). There was pretty much no suspense for me as a reader because it became fairly obvious half way through the book what had happened. I also could care less about the lives of the main characters (which I was told about in great depth and detail) because I despised all of them. They weren't even interesting in a bad way, they were just spoiled and selfish self-indulgent jerks. Flawed main characters are fine, but at least make them interesting so I actually care what happens to them! It felt for me like a story I had to slog through in the hopes that it would eventually become more exciting. It does, but unfortunately that happens on the last page and it is not enough to save this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 1/2 Stars","review":"I liked it, it was decent enough to keep me turning the pages. Nothing memorable. Good study in the psyche of the character's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teach Yourself New Testament Greek","review":"The book, Teach Yourself New Testament Greek, by D. F. Hudson makes a good coverage of the language, I've used several other such books and this one is very clear and well done. I like the use of passages from the classical literature but think that more could be done with the New Testament, such as giving more examples of grammar points from Scripture itself. I would also have liked to have seen more use of the NT and even the Septuagint in the exercises. There are one or two errors, as for example on page 41 where Hudson gives an exception as occurring only once in the New Testament. It actually occurs twice! However, Hudson's grammar explanations with interesting and numbered points are really quite valuable. I would be happy to recommend this book to any beginner of New Testament Greek and even for others like myself who are better acquainted with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great primer!","review":"Great book with lots of information about the major sights in Australia.Good intro for people of all ages!

THERE IS some innocent blood on you believers' hands).The world was never flooded, and we have the scientific research to prove it.I find it hard to believe that God spared humanity just because Noah was entertaining, and that God wouldn't let anyone on the ship procreate .Just be glad the wiccans didn't walk up to church and rant about this violence,immorality, and inaccuracy.I don't think that a deity would drown all his subjects at the FIRST SIGN of sin, or simply because they accused his prophet of \\"Sorcery\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie ever seen","review":"I started to watch this Movie and right at the beginning I couldn't really understand what was going on, this movie is such a terrible blasphemy.

The Bibel said that God himself closed the door and nobody could open it, till it was time, in this movie Noah and his family are taking regular walks on the \\"deck\\" of the Arch, than a trader swimms to the Arch and sells goodies to Noah and his family. And the summit of it all, at the end Lot comes as a Pirat and tries to conquer the Ark.

We all know when Noah and his family boarded the ark there where no people left, but not in this movie. People had survived the flood and was in ships trying to attack the Ark. The worst of it was the leader of the pack that was trying to overtake the Ark and that was Lot. I can't forget to tell you the part where Noah and his son starting fighting. After looking at it I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very possibly the worst movie I've ever seen","review":"It's been years now since I saw this movie but the offensiveness of its inaccuracies still remain clear in my mind because I was so completely appalled by them! Like other reviewers commented, it seems odd that one would choose to create a bible-based story and then not seem to actually consult scriptures to find out what the storyline was!I guess part of what makes no sense to me is if you are making a movie based on the bible you are somewhat limiting the audience - so I would assume you would then create a story that WORKED for that audience. In this case it's like they narrowed their audience and then set to work seeing how they could best ruin a story that is known and loved.I hope a better version of this story is tackled at some point because it's one worth telling :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't know the real story ... don't look for it here!","review":"This is the worst version of Biblical story telling I have ever seen.

Everyone said I was too nitpicky. Then this movie comes along, and they're reacting the same way I did. Hardy har.

Hallmark Hall of Fame produced this \\"new\\" version, which is totally out of whack with the biblical narrative.Jon Voigt as Noah may be fine, but when suddenly the men of Sodom and Gommorrah arrive on the scene to have a battle with Noah, you know there's something wrong.

God is portrayed as whimsical. Noah's son's aren't very godly either. It's inaccuracies and toying with the bible makes it worthy of kindling to start a fire.

The Bible contains important truth for us, and this movie tramples it. If they had desired to play games with special effects and epic scenes, they should have chosen another source for the story than the Bible. The movie is a hopeless mishmash of badly digested scenes (and mis-matched individuals and timeframes) from the pre- and post-flood biblical narrative. And the dialog concerning the reasons for God's judgement is blasphemous. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, for any reason. It is not fit fare because of its misrepresentation of God's judgment on the pre- and post-flood world.

It never ceases to amaze, how Hollywood continues to snub such a huge audience of faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst Bible movie ever made.","review":"Can you imagine someone retelling American history and to shorten things up a bit, they have George Washington freeing the slaves and introducing the \\"New Deal,\\" and then he gets shot in Dallas. That's what \\"Noah's Ark\\" does in telling Bible history. In this movie Noah prays for Sodom where his nephew Lot lives (It was Abraham who prayed for Sodom and his nephew Lot, several hundred years after the time of Noah). During the flood when Noah and his family are safely on the ark with all the animals, Lot comes along on a raft and tries to hijack the ark. Ugh! Possibly the worst Bible movie ever made. Nice special effects. That's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!

Imagine several bible stories mixed together, add in gory scenes, a few special effects and you end up with this apalling mess. I don't know if it gets any better but after the first 35 minutes I ejected the disc and threw it in the trash. Avoid at all costs, rating should be minus 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ishtar's Ark (but worse)","review":"Blindingly aweful. Colossal waste of time (and money, if you are foolish enough to buy this).This must have been intended as a spoof. However, it was just simply stupid--nothing imaginative or clever, just stupid. Bad writing, bad acting, bad effects, bad everything.It was hyped on TV as an epic mini-series resembling something coming from the Bible. If so, the writers got BADLY, BADLY lost somewhere. I actually went and found a Bible to read the real story again. [That was worth the time.]Had they attempted to even half-seriously approach the story of Noah that even the kids of anthiests are familiar with, they would have done much better.I was stupified by how simply aweful this was. Give it a -3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waterworld meets Noah","review":"What was this? It's inaccurate, ridiculous and boring.

From the first few minutes...I knew this was going to be stupid. The script...ayayay Who the HELL wrote this?!?!? And how did it get as far as to actually be made?? This \\"movie\\" was full of bad humor, bad acting and the Worst direction. How they even dare to \\"sell\\" this on home video is beyond me... 1 of the Worst movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd, Terrible, And Biblically Inaccurate","review":"Is this really suppose to be the story of Noah and the great flood. It seemed more like a story from Grimm's Fairy Tales than from the Holy Bible. I saw this when it came out on television, and it was hysterically horrible. Putting Lot in the story was the most inaccurate thing the director could of done among other obvious inaccuracies, or maybe the people behind this film read from The Hollywood Bible. It was hysterical when Noah and his sons go head to head ready to rip each other's face off on the ark, when they all become incredibly insane. I would of thought this was great comedy if it wasn't so blasphemous. Anyway, it's a really big waste of time watching this trash, so stay away from this...you have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive joke!","review":"I had been so looking forward to this movie. Boy, was I disappointed. They tried to make it almost \\"campy\\". Very inaccurate, Noah and Lot did not even live in the same time period. Abraham and Lot, his nephew interacted in the Bible. When Sodom and Gomorrah was being destroyed and Lot's wife looked back, she turned into a salty stone-like statue. When Lot reached over in a comical way and broke her finger off, I gave up! They seemed to try to work in a lot of comedy that just didn't fit at all. I've never been more disappointed with a movie. It was such a wasted opportunity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible : The worst biblical film I have ever seen","review":"I should have known from the opening scene this movie was going to be a disaster; there was a message \\" WE HAVE TAKEN POETIC LICENSE IN THE CREATION OF THIS FILM\\". That was an understatement. The movie twisted all the facts, timeframes etc that were in the bible. For example, having Noah deal with Sodom & Gomorrah???? What bible were they reading to create this movie? This movie was not inspired and it shows. I threw this DVD in the garbage can. Do not buy this movie it is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help what idoit did this to the good book?","review":"Boy NBC much need the money or they need help. the Actors are good but what happen? hope that they dont do this all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie insults Hebrew and Christian believer alike.","review":"This film is an unconscionable slap in the face for anyone who believes that the bible is part of a pathway to understanding the mind of God. One need not be a fanatic bible thumper to be insulted by the total disregard for the beliefs of hundreds of thousands of faithful people. Six million Jews died because they believed these stories. Countless Christians have suffered persecution because they trust the words in the bible. Truly I would be ashamed to say I had ever worked on this project I would have my name removed from the \\"credits\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I will not waste too much words on this. As a christian you should forget about this movie, for you will find it utter bull. Especially the scenes in which Lot tries to capture the Ark as an old-day pirate, a panhandler sailing the seas on an old-day waterbike and Noah's family starting to become crazy, makes you wish you never put on the DVD, let alone bought the crappy thing.Take my advice, do not come near this product!!Ps.

First of it was not anywhere near accurate to compliment the story of the bible and secondly when I saw two lobsters as well as two male peecocks climbing into the arc that was it for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"What can be said that hasn't already?","review":"I can forgive bad acting, stupid effects and maybe even completely distorting the Biblical story. I can forgive these things if the script was even moderately clever. Which is why I can't forgive this piece of garbage. When this movie was trying to be clever, it succeeded only in being annoying. Stay away. Stay far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noah's Ark","review":"I would have to say that if there was a less rating than one star this movie would winn hands down. Again I see that the Director took no thought for historical accuracy of the events and times in which they took place. To begin with, Noah didn't live in the times of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham was the one who lived during that time. Lot was the one who lived outside Sodom and was taken out by the two angels. I wish someone would do their research properly before making a movie on the Bible. Anyone who changes the Word of God is in danger of being judged by it. I was a great deal upset , to say the least, while watching this movie. Maybe someone will take not and study the facts next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a 0 star rating for this one!","review":"Wish they had 0 star ratings, but no option for that. This was so anti-Scripture it was rediculous. It looked like the movie was made just to totally twist the stories and make up their own stuff to confuse people. Sad that people will see that good name \\"Noah's Ark\\" and think it might be the true Biblical story. So, just so you know...IT'S NOT even close. YUCK...would be the best word to describe this movie. Don't waste your time watching this...you'll be very glad you passed this one up. Even the newspapers reports on it ripped it to shreds...about being totally nondoctrinal, and unscriptural, and making fun of the true stories of the Bible. So thank God for those many true reviews of this twisted movie. The old classics were so good at staying online with Scripture...best to stick with those. Enjoy the oldies but goodies...and especially enjoy reading the real thing...THE HOLY BIBLE...no better book than that! God bless. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"If you are looking for an accurate biblical depiction to share with your family...DON\\"T BUY THIS.

The bluescreened animals entering the Ark are an excellent example. First of all, since they seem to have had the animals anyway, why the bluescreen? And secondly, if they *had* to bluescreen, couldn't they at least have added the appropriate shadows?Just another bad thing about this abysmal affair. Forget about Biblical inaccuracies. If this were called \\"Edgar's Big Boat\\" and no one had ever heard the Genesis story, it still wouldn've been terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"why cant we give 0 stars","review":"i must admit the first hourof part1 was entertaining, but after the affects got to be awful and the story turned s far away from the real story i grew broed and like a idiot i watched the 2nd half and when i saw then hallucinating and tlaing to oranges i wanted to run out of the room screaming, 1 delightful thing was carol kane who is always great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Worse than you think","review":"If you are under the impression that this story resembles what you learned in Bible School, think again.

As far as biblical history goes, it was an insult. Even when I looked past the inacuracies, it was plain silly and childish. Don't waste your money. I would rate this a zero if I could. If you want a more entertaining and accurate look at the biblical Genesis, I recommend the movie The Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Anachronism","review":"Having watched great movies in the Bible series such as Joseph, David, Abraham, Jacob, Moses and Samson and Delilah and other good ones pertaining to scriptures, I was looking forward to another fantastic and educative film. What a let down by this anachronism. How low can one go! This is a disappointing and misleading movie that perverts the word of God.If you do not believe in God, have never read the Bible, particularly Genesis but have heard of Noah from hearsay, perhaps this movie might be of some entertaining value, a mediocre one at that.If you are looking for a movie with an accurate account of Noah's ArK, don't aggravate yourself. Avoid this movie like a plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherence throughout!","review":"Absolutely atrocious!!!that's not to say the worse about this movie. I don't comprehend how a movie that has as its name a biblical passage, can be produced without a minimum knoledge and understanding of Genesis. In order to make the movie longer, passages of Abraham are impersonated by Noah, someone who lived ages before. A lot of the scenes were taken out of one's infertile imagination and not from the actual Bible. Don't waste your time with this movie as you will find this an absolute mockery of the Bible. If you want a better account of Noah's history, watch the classic ' The Bible' instead. Save yourself from a disappointing movie night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noah's Farce!","review":"I'm not a particularly religious person, but this took irreverence to the point of blasphemy. If nothing else, why use a catacylsm as the premise for a spoof? The arsenal of \\"hip\\" modern dialogue, pratfalls, double entrendres, vaudevillian asides and just plain bad acting leaves one hoping that the whole enterprise would have sank.....Ark and all. Watching Academy Award winners Voight and Abraham mug their way through this ill-written disaster illustrates the seductive power of money. There is absolutely no other reason for them to have partaken in this debacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GREAT teaching tool!","review":"I use clips of this film to teach a class on Hollywood -vs- 'The Bible.' I couldn't have asked for a better example of just how BAD a Biblical film could be.Even the slowest of students know that everyone on the planet dies (except those inside the ark) during the flood, so when the pirates show up - so do the questions.Thank you Hallmark for one of the worst films of all time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Debbie is Totally Correct!","review":"The video is worse than a waste of time!

You should have a rating of 0 to really make it fair. If you really want to see a good Noah's Ark, get the original John Huston Movie, The Bible. This one from NBC so disgusted my wife and I that instead of just taping over the copy I started, I threw it in the trash. I cant believe with the resources televison has at its disposel that they couldn't have at least found some one who could read the Bible. It was another example of the extreme liberals in Hollywood trashing God. Don't bother to get this movie. You would get angry if they gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we give zero stars?","review":"This cinematic claptrap is as lame as they come. Never mind that the story makes a complete mockery of the biblical account of Noah, it's just plain bad acting and directing.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noah's Ark","review":"This is very bad and clumsy movie.

I don't even believe most of the Bible is true, but it does generally make exciting movies, but shame on the people who put this together and the lack of taste they showed in offending the millions of people who do take it seriously.Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen must have been desperate for work to even have agreed to make this mindless movie that depicted them in such a degrading light.This really could have been an excellent movie, comparable to \\"The Ten Commandments\\" had they stuck to the original version.Maybe one day Hollywood will learn--poking fun at things that millions of people hold \\"sacred\\" is not the best way to win an audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilariously Inept and Inane","review":"This movie could be a classic in the vein of Monty Python's Life of Brian if they would have billed it as a parody. A drama it is not. What is most astounding is that a film like this can get the green light and make it to the screen (albeit the small screen). I can picture the NBC execs passing around the script; \\"Wow! What an epic! That Noah did more than just build that boat!\\"The most hilarious scene of all is when, after fire reigns down on Sodom & Gomorroh, an exhausted Noah and his wife take a break and she tells him \\"Noah, you should write all of this down otherwise no one will know you were here.\\"Oh. That explains the discrepencies.Wait. I almost forgot! The portrayal of Lot as a horned-helmetedViking-like hellraiser is absolutely classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worse Bible Movie Ever Made","review":"This is probably the worst Bible movie ever made. It combines the stories of Noah and Abraham into the life of one person (Noah), and then it adds some special affect miracles to give it glitter. It directly contradicts the Bible in so many places it would be impossible to list in this short review. The biggest problem with the film is that some people will watch it and think this is the story of Noah from the Bible. It is not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noah's Ark","review":"This movie is not biblicaly based. I would not recommend this movie for viewers that want truth. Noah was not instructed by God to leave Sodom, it was Lot and his wife and two daughters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boat that didn't float ...","review":"This ARK has been ship wreaked on the ocean floor, and please no one try to raise it. Bad acting, bad script, bad FX, bad everything. Okay, so they said upfront that they stretched it a little to get a better story, but this was to much of a stretch even for the Bible. Looking more like a really bad scene from Saturday Night Live bit than the quality I've seen Hallmark produce. I don't know how to put it into words other than to say ... this movie really was bad. God was wishy-washy as to what he wanted to do, Noah was a drunk, the rest were just as strange and the tiny ship was lost in a bad movie. I think the Koala said it best when it took a power poop on screen. Clearly they tried to make an epic on a B-movie budget. What a waste of film, save your money and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please return your Oscars!","review":"John Irvin, the film's director, should have been washed away in the flood! This film is absolute drivel. And Oscar winners Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen, F Murray Abraham, James Coburn and Sidney Poitier should all have to return their awards.

I would like to see more movies based on the Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not just bad...","review":"...it's barely watchable. It looks like a version of Noah's Ark made for dinner theater, and isn't to be taken seriously, except as an example of how not to produce a Bible story.

Well, if it were in the \\"So bad it's good,\\" category, there might have been a rainbow at the end of this stinker.It sinks as bad as an ark full of two-of-a-kind animal poo. If I am ever desperate enough to consider showing this during Sunday School, please excommunicate me! On the other hand, it does have one of the worst lines ever recorded onto any screen. \\"Hey Noah, going to the orgy later?\\"The only good part of the whole purchase was that some of the money went to a good cause thrift store, and the good cause thrift store was minus one God-awful film.

Those who make a mockery better beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the Bible","review":"I only like this movie because of the exciting things. But I really don't like it because it is not at all like the Bible. First of all, they had other characters that weren't in Noah's day and they were supposed to be Noah's friends in the movie. Also, they added hours of stuff that people didn't really care about and it just wasted time. And another thing, why in the world would there be a caravan in the flood? That is just so stupid! The Bible said that only Noah and his family survived by being in the ark, not a stupid caravan guy and his things that he was selling. Besides, if in the Bible it said that he was there, there would be a very small chance that Noah and his family would see him if he was the only person besides them. This should be a fiction story more than a Bible story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes itself too seriously","review":"Roofworld is very frustrating, in part because it could have been so much more. The protagonists are poorly constructed and the concepts, while great, do not take flight. The secondary characters in Roofworld form a freak show and the Roofworld's \`Ambassador' is not introduced for some time - and then only as a shrivelling, pitiful character as the street world's main character. A few action sequences where we never get to fixate on one particular person makes this a very limp narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great but quickly goes downhill","review":"Christopher Fowler has an atmospheric setting and a nifty plot to hang his story on but that can't last for three hundred pages.

The story is definitely not a lesbian film, however, it did explore sexism (minimally) in basketball.

This movie sucked! I guess the reason there aren't any reviews for this movie is becuase everyone was smart enough not to watch it. This movie had no plot and honestly i don't see the purpose of making this movie. The worst part about this movie though would have to be the film quality itself.

Technically and emotionally powerful, The RX Bandits actually improved their music. This album sounds mature and well guided, as if it has a higher purpose.This album is too good.

No one in the world is like them. Enough has been said about the amazing musicianship, but no one has really commented on the concept of the album itself. The lyrics, along with the cover art, is extremely thought provoking and probing. The entire album is very artfully presented in a way that only these guys are able...they have come a long way from \\"those damn bandits\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recently converted Rx Bandits fan","review":"I must say this band has me at a loss for words.

It's one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice rotors, good price.","review":"Not a whole lot to be said about rotors other than to stay away from both the really cheap Chinese ones and the overpriced ones from the dealer. Centric offers a quality rotor which may not be the very cheapest but will meet or exceed all oem specifications.What sets these premium series apart is the e-coating. If you can see your rotors thru your wheels, these are nice in that they will not look like rusty hunks of metal after a few trips through harsh weather. the also have a bit of a taper which will help the pads set better with less risk of squeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"My life will now be complete...","review":"Long before I ever heard the band Can, I heard this album and LOVED it. It WILL change your life. Holger is a madman, hearing music in everything---he incorporates noises from a variety of sources. The guitar and keyboard work are very pleasing...it's all beautiful. I used to sneak cuts from this album onto an FM jazz show I used to do...Some people freaked right out, some people worshipped me for playing it, but I always got phone calls. Buy this release. It's Hula music for ice cream lovers. It's summer and swimming, it's the rings of a tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential listening for fans of Holger Czukay","review":"I pretty much agree with the review of Steve from near Dundee who gave this CD 2 stars, except that I would give it 4 stars.Persian Love is one of the best tunes of all time. The rest of the tunes are quite enjoyable. There is a nice blend of groove music, sampling, humor, and Holger's trademark sound. Holger was a pioneer in the world of sampling.I want to give this 5 stars but even I realize that is excessive. There is not much pop music from more than 25 years ago that I am not embarrassed to be still listening to ... this certainly holds up with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am pleased with this one.......","review":"I have always enjoyed CAN, they exhibit fine musical sense of humor, and have been a great \\"break\\" from listening to bop & Post-Bop jazz-- they are the quintessential minimalists! Mr Czukay just let me in on the fact that he too can be a bit \\"funky\\" ,and really does have some nice \\"musical chops\\"! ( HIS \\"IMAGE\\" WAS ALWAYS MORE CEREBRAL, IT SEEMED) He tastefully uses samples, and even a singsongy nurseryrhyme melody like \\"Cool inna Pool\\" is saved by the really nice little phrases throughout the remainder of the tune.( i realize the melody is \\"toungue-in -cheek). Persian Love is a rather wonderful interpolation of Persian vocal samples and the typical CAN quasi-funk , led by Jaki Leibzeit, the human drum machine! Accessable for someone looking for something new, and a must have for fans of C-C-C-AN!

But sometimes of course you need to let music grow on you, and many moons later I can't help notice that not only do I click on this playlist regularly, like weekly, the entire CD is still there, I haven't deleted anything that annoyed me. That's pretty remarkable in itself, damn few CD's live whole on my playlists. I realize there's a story here, and probably that would be more apparent if I didn't have the songs sorted by title, but that doesn't matter much to me.

He hammers the government and press, but then references their reports and articals when it fits his mindset. What perturbs me the most is his anti-nuc (nuclear) position. It appears throughout the book, in unrelated topics, and is mostly unsubstantiated. He repeatadly says \\"radiation levels are rising\\", which, of course, is not happening. Also, his cut and paste of news paper articals are weak- he treats them as research.

Please tell me it's not to \\"cash in\\" on the new-found popularity of its director, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (or however you spell his name). It was a most inauspicious directorial debut for the California governor, notably NOT propelling him into a directorial career.

It is one of those \\"feel good\\" holiday movies that gets you in the spirit of Christmas. Tony Curtis is halirious as the producer who is worried about ratings and network politics; the side stories are light and provide comic relief every few scenes. If you are looking for a deeply emotional movie like \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\", then this movie is not for you. However, if you, like me, want to intersperse George Bailey (admittedly a humourous movie in many areas) with a few laughs and a simple, light hearted movie during the Christmas season, give this movie a chance. If you're looking for light-hearted romance based on the spirit of Christmas, you won't be disappointed with this remake (or the original) Christmas in Connecticut."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Remake of the Original","review":"Okay - I admit it, I love Dyan Cannon and even though this doesn't have the depth or sentimentality of the original, this more contemporary version is still a great holiday film. Cannon's comic timing here is great and the best reason to get this version. Yeah, it's cute, but it is also charming and good fun. Recommended for your annual holiday viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Sappy For Once","review":"Most Christmas movies make me want to run for the insulin because they are so sappy sweet. Not this one! This modern remake of the old classic is just what today's Christmas movies needed. Dyan Cannon is smart, savvy, and willing to own up to her mistakes. Kris Kristofferson is the perfect earthy foil to be the hero, and Tony Curtis' masterful comedic rendition of the interfering obnoxious boss adds just the right amount of spice.For those who like good feelings without the overdone sugar, this movie is a perfect holiday favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This product is terrible.

Further the only way that you can get stations set is by fiddling with the connection one increment at a time in options, but there is no way to save your adjustments, so that once you have a signal, each time you change channels you lose that signal.

The video quality is fine, and it has no problem picking up and displaying TV channels, as well as my Wii! The only complaint I have is that on my computer, full screen video is kind of laggy. I imagine a computer with a better video card / more ram / faster processor wouldn't have this computer. I found a solution to this problem, however, by setting the video to less than full screen and then using the computer's zooming feature to zoom in on the video window.Edit: I solved the lagginess problem: I turned off the Aero theme on Windows 7 and it freed up enough resources to make full-screen video totally smooth.

It goes beyond the usual dirt bike or rally DVDs and has a style much more akin to a professional documentary. It's a DVD that people with only a passing interest in motorsport can still enjoy.The DVD captures the taste and flavour of an awesome desert race across part of Mexico. It shows the amateurs and the professionals, the two and four wheel competitors and the almost carnival atmosphere that surrounds the event. As a motorsport competitor and enthusiast myself it's great to see the locals enjoying the spectacle and madness too.Get this DVD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Being an off-road motorcycle fan, I was pretty sure I would like this movie, and of course I did.

There was only 4 people in the theatre and it had only been out for a couple of days. Too much interviewing and going back to people. All the action is cut and it sucked!

I've had two of the fail within a few years. 2) Your \\"lifetime\\" FM data subscription (60 dollars) is tied to the device, and when the device fails and needs to be replaced, the subscription can't be transferred.

I have contacted Garmin about this and they did not know what to say, except that they will send an email to Clear Channel. I would suggest staying away from this or any other FM traffic at this point. It looks as if this is a \\"work in progress.\\"I would really like to find a system that will actually work in the Los Angeles / Ventura County area.

I was about to throw the whole thing out, but went looking for a replacement fuse setup just in case. For a replacement cost of $200 for the unit, I'll keep looking for the part.

The plot....well there just wasn't much of one. I'm not sure how the four plot threads were supposed to fit together. Not one of Emma Thompson's more memorable performances. As for the allegedly starkly beautiful Scottish coast, to me it was just stark. Subtitles would have been useful; I missed a good part of the dialogue because of the heavy accents. Judging by the ratings here, many folks loved this movie. I was simply underwhelmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hours you will never get back","review":"Great cast, excellent acting, and poor script that is full of incomplete ideas. A character piece that is for sure, The Winter Guest story line lacks motivation for what the actors are doing.

I was expecting pretty good sound from all the reviews here, but they surpassed my expectations. Very crisp, clean sound with just the amount of bass you want to add.But...I have been through 3 pairs of these now. Everytime I set them up, they go for about an hour and then I start getting a loud static hiss from the left channel. The last time I tried new speakers, I hooked them up directly to an iPod to try them out. Sure enough the static starts. I finally emailed Klipsch and they told me to trade them in again.One other thing, I have a Dual G4 Mac with a 23\\" Cinema Display and these are the only decent speakers that match how cool my system looks. Excellent design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant hiss from amplifier to satelites","review":"Very high quality sound BUT the constant unstoppable hissing that feeds from the speakers when not in use is off the charts. The only way to stop it is to get down to the base bin and kill the main power switch on there. I would NOT buy these again. Returned for refund quickly. For that price range they need to be much closer to perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth ever dam penny","review":"These speakers are just wow. The sound is amazin and they look great next to a G5. I was a bit skeptical at first just like everyone is but this product is truly amazing.

Trust me you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at the start...bad long term","review":"Yes...these speakers are pretty good. But after about 5 months of use, this system has failed to impress me. First, I didn't notice the hiss, but out of nowhere there is a loud popping noise every now and then. A VERY loud popping! Second, my subwoofer is sub-par now. At certain bass levels, the bass pops which is distracting and disappointing. Apparently the subwoofer couldn't handle it a lot of bass. Overall if you want to get a sound system for a cheap price, get these. Just don't play your music on it very loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't mind the subwoofer cutting out...go for it :(","review":"I owned the older version of these speakers and loved them. I purchased these thinking that they were merely asthetically updated. To my suprise, as soon as I hooked them up and plugged in my ipod there was no bass. The subwoofer was not responding whatsoever. There was a short circuit in the control box. Upon tapping on the housing the bass would come on...this did not scream quality. In fact, each time I would turn the speakers on, I would have to fiddle with the control module. Thankfully amazon gave me a refund, I guess I'll buy another set of the old ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear map","review":"I bought this map book with the intension of using it as a road map while driving when necessary.

Coughlin details the life of a boy brought up on the knee of his Nazi-loving uncle. What a shock he turned out the way he did.Very timely information. Many of the questions asked in the media today were answered by Coughlin in this 2002 book. You can't finish this book without thinking President Bush did the right thing going into Iraq. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the writing itself. Coughlin skips around, throws a lot of names and history at you, and not always in chronological order.

The first 45 mins. sort of drag a little, but each time the fighter boys go out, it feels great. The score got a little too intrusive towards the end, but luckily it was gone by the end run. Max Steiner is okay, but this time the score overwhelmed some of the scenes, especially the serious one; the score has a gayity to it that doesn't go with all the ariel scenes. I've always liked Robert Stack in these type of old WWII movies, he's smoothe and cool throughout.

The plasma display had cracked. The actual exterior screen is intact but the display beneath it has been compromised. Philips says that it isn't covered by them - that I must have \\"done something to it\\".

You have no room to play or adjust things. After a couple of months I can say that these silly little things have greatly improved the clutter that is my work space. In fact, after my desk it was the sound system, then the bedroom and so on. This is my second order.Something I do to make it easier is make two initial loops around the cable pull it tight.

However, the loop side is black on both shades, which means that if you really want the gray to be visible, then it should be hook side up.These are much thinner (smaller hooks and less fuzz) than I thought they would be.Their length accommodates thick powerstrip cords, but isn't long enough to make tying up something thin difficult.These will come in handy for a long time, and I think it was the smartest purchase I've made in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as you would expect","review":"I just bought hundreds of these to clean up my massive cable wall.

The Blue Buffalo Company of Wilton, Connecticut has announced a dog food recall of certain batches of some of its popular products due to potentially toxic levels of vitamin D.My dog got extremely sick, and was very upset to hear of this. Only thing that changed with his diet/life was blue buffalo. I literally almost lost my dog last week and had to have in surgery because his gallbladder was about to explode. He quit eating completely, was throwing up, diarrhea, and took him to the vet to realize his liver was swollen and gallbladder had to come out. It's sad to think you pay good money for dog food and you still could be feeding him poison. I don't know how I will every trust dog food products anymore. Please make sure there is no recalls on food you are feeding your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite portable headphones.","review":"To be honest, I initially bought these to complete my cosplay of Minato Arisato, the main character of Persona 3.

Once you activate the product on one platform, you have to buy it again if you want to use it on a different platform.I might be willing to pay for an upgrade if they were offering a Universal Binary, but currently they are not.

(See Greg Bear's \\"Eon\\" for that!)Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea; good science; bad novel","review":"What intrigued me about this book was that it dealt with the Dyson Sphere as a follow up to the TV episode of TNG that dealt with it. I was disappointed in the lack of plot and character development and there were points where, amid all the science writing, things got rather confusing. The whole scene within the hollow moon and the sphere within a sphere -- all that stuff had great potential, but it seemed no sooner was the situation introduced (along with the new aliens) that everyone gets scared and runs for their lives -- chapter over. Again, the possible etherial connections with the Borg could have been great plot devices -- but they were not developed! Traditional characters were not well written; The Horta were somewhat interesting. But by and large, it seemed the two authors wrote two different stories and \\"smooshed\\" them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish.","review":"More hard science than we're used to in Star Trek novels, which is fine.

There are some fun nods to the Horta race seen in the original series and the comic books, and a rushed tour of the giant structure in what appear to be its final hours. The book is very short and not particularly good. All the regular characters play their parts, but there isn't enough time for much to happen before the book comes to an unsatisfying end.This book is very similar to a much better book titled \\"Excession\\", by author Ian M. Banks. I say this mostly because of the way both novels end. Take my advice and seek out the better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, Eagerly awaited and let down badly","review":"Dyson sphere promised so much in a title taken from one of the best star trek episodes in the season, However the book takes too much time to explore the relationships between the horta and Picard that it loses it's way, Research is one thing but we readers don't want chemical analyses and atomic structure explained like we dropped out of high school chemistry, we want action and suspense, I waited months to get hold of this copy and now it is filed in the \\"Read only when depressed\\" section of my library. Believe me read this and you can throw your idea of a good book down the drain along with what ever you spent to buy it. Avoid this and go straight to the Double Helix series, Its a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good Trek","review":"\\"Dyson Sphere\\" has a lot of hard science, but not a lot of hard plot. Many things happen in this book almost by magic, without much description of how or why things are happening.

I do not recommend \\"Dyson Sphere.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite there","review":"I'm not a huge fan of the Star Trek novels, but I am a huge Pellegrino fan. Everything of his I have read before has been gold - this book just falls flat. There is something in the style and presentation that seems like it was \\"dumbed down\\" from his usual fare. The ending is also somewhat anti-climatic, but I think the plan was to leave some options open for the future. There is also too many referances to Pellegrino's past works - they seem forced. All in all this book seems rushed and misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much science & not enough plot","review":"I was truly disappointed in Dyson Sphere. There was much too much \\"science\\" and not enough fiction. It could have been any generic crew rather than Picard, Riker, Troi, etc. I much prefer novels about interactions with other cultures. Picard aside, the other characters were hardly used. I did not find the Horta to be particularly appealing protagonists either. This was a rare disappointment in the Star Trek series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"\\"Why?\\" sums up this one quite nicely. You know, Trek novels in general are a fantastic way to get insights in characters that maybe got one ep devoted to them a season ... Characters like Geordi and Beverly for example, who rarely got to spout more than technobabble. So, after a drought of non-serialized TNG novels, imagine my disappointment after reading Dyson Sphere, which seemed to be more of a showcase for the authors' knowledge of the arcane rather than a showcase for any of the characters. I wasn't impressed. If I want a science-heavy novel, I'll pick up Diane Duane's collected works any day of the week. At least she remembers who she's writing about. I was expecting a little more considering half of the writing team here was behind A Fury Scorned, which, while not exactly a Trek tour de force, wasn't completely unreadable. Dyson Sphere, however, is just that. Sorry, fellas."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it.","review":"I got myself through this book, only because I kept thinking the next page would draw me in. But it never did. Nothing flowed very well, and about the only thing that really held my interest were the essays by the authors at the end.But try as I might, I simply could not envision the inside of this Sphere or what was happening to it, and the story narrative did nothing to help, nevermind the stilted, choppy dialogue.And Scotty, where the heck was Scotty??!!! Too many mentions of his poor ship, but no sign of my favorite engineer. I didn't check the timeline, so I don't know if he was already with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers by the time this book was written, but maybe not. Doesn't matter, he should have been part of this story. Heck, the S.C.E. should have been here, not the Enterprise!If you ask me, the only characters with any depth at all were made of rock.

Not recommended except for the collector who has to have every ST novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but dull.","review":"If you like that kind of technical/ factual Star Trek then this book won't disappoint. It has a really good concept - did the Borg really create the Dyson Sphere? - and is well written. But any one who likes lots of action and excitement in their ST books, then my advice is: do not buy this book!Maybe its just me, but I thought this book had too much scientific stuff and too little going on. The characters were the only thing going for a book that was way too short (it had less than 200 pages!). The book had two very talented writers but still reads like it was written in a rush to finish before a deadline.If you read it you'll probably end up really confused, as half of the crew's decisions don't seem to make any sense at all. It's the kind of book that gets read once and then never again.I give it two stars - one for being a Star Trek book and the other for good descriptive/factual writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad character potrayal and too much science","review":"Having waited a long time to read this book since it to forever to appear at bookstores in Singapore, this book is, to say the least, a huge disappointment. The idea to re-visit the Dyson Sphere is well-conceived, but was wrecked in the hands of these two amateur writers. The book bombards you with long-winded and boring paragraphs of hard science, tiresome to read. The writers forget that the MAIN part of a novel is its characters. The characters behave unrealisticly, the dialouge is childish and the philosophy is weak. The resolution at the end is too convenient. The inclusion of the alien race Horta, of whom NO introduction is given, in the story does not appeal to me either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a huge disappointment for anyone expecting interaction between the STNG crew, action, adventure, or anything vaguely resembling STNG. I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you found it at a garage sale for 25 cents, then I would bargain it down to 10 cents, which would still be overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I bought this book, thinking that it would be the Star Trek equivalent of \\"Ringworld\\" or \\"Rendezvous with Rama\\". However, this book does not capture the same sense of spellbinding wonder of the two aforementioned books, and the writing is quite dull. The characterization is quite bland, and the only reason why I cared about them at all is because they are the star trek crew.

I, myself, am more shakespearan in style, preferring to have not a perfect ending, but this seemed more like an open pipe than one with a clamp, if you understand my meaning. I won't go into the details about then end, but i believe more questions could have been answered-- or a second book could be written elaborating such.

You can tell by the completely inappropriate colorization of the characters in bright colors on the front cover that something is wrong with this book.

The reason I gave 4 stars is because on a few of the pieces the corners were slightly off, leaving a bit of an overhang. This is not the sellers fault, rather the manufacturers, but I thought it was worth noting. Once it's covered with canvas, or in my case t-shirts, you probably won't notice it.

The tale is beautifully told and the illustrations capture the emotions of the characters without being sentimental.

Thanks so much for helping us remember the true meaning of this season."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Hottest X-mas Karaoke CDG","review":"The Sound = Excellent, can't complain about it, the price terrific, my overview rating is a 10+ for quality and an A+ for Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT FILM, LOUSY TRANSFER","review":"As I was born and bred in the UK I have fond memories of growing up to the various Carry-On films. Now I reside in the USA I decided to do a search to see if any Carry-On films were available in NTSC format, and to my joy I found this movie. Joy turned to disgust when I actually sat down and watched it - the conversion process from PAL to NTSC looks like it has been performed in somebody's garden shed on second hand video editing equipment. The picture is fuzzy and the soundtrack hisses like a ruptured high=pressure steam pipe. This is a great movie, but the quality of the tape means that it is nearly unwatchable. Until someone decides to remaster these films onto DVD I will not buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much magic","review":"Ms. Heath write well and is great when it comes to descriptions of places and characters. And she does not shy away from married couples having relations, without going into much detail, which is taboo in most regency romances, unfortunately. Why most regency authors think that regency misses are cold in unrealistic to me. But this story did not work for me, unlike a similar story, Marigold's Marriages. This story is just too overloaded with magic. The cukoo bird was everywhere and it was annoying following Kate ahd Lord Carismont trying to have a conversation with flying colors, lights, fire places, birds, voices...too much of a distraction so I really lost interest early on. After all, as one reviewer pointed out, not much romance to be discovered when the romance is provided, in the end, via magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull magic","review":"With every aspect of the plot taken in hand by magic, there's not much point in having characters. He's rich and handsome, she's poor but good, however, since once someone casts a magic spell in the first scene to make them fall instantly in love there's not much more than can happen, and nothing does.Oh, Heath does write well. Here's hoping that in future she finds something to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intoxicating...","review":"A friend of mine who recommended this album described it as \\"Gillian Welch backed by the Dirty Three.\\" While Nina Nastasia's style is not as retro-country as Gillian's, they both share a dark Appalachian inflection in their deceptively ordinary-sounding voices which get richer with every listen. The impeccable Steve Albini production and dramatic instrumental, mostly-acoustic backing (including cello, accordion and musical saw) is indeed reminiscent of Dirty Three at their finest. I would highly recommend this to fans of either or both artists.Like most great art, the more time you spend with Blacked Air, the better it gets. I dare you to find a more gut wrenching tearjerker this year than the album closer \\"That's All There Is.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is What it is","review":"With Steve Albini at the controls and some very talented musicians in tow, Nina Nastasia's The Blackened Air makes for quite a record. Instrumentally everything sounds great, and the songwriting for the most part is solid. I could probably listen to Nastasia's voice singing just about anything and be perfectly content. \\"So Little\\" is a really good song, and \\"This Is What It Is\\" is an extraordinary song. The lyric about her having perfect pitch cracks me up every time. My sole complaint is that the record is a little long and the writing is not necessarily consisent all the way through. But I honestly would have bought the disc just for \\"This Is What It Is.\\" Nice job."},{"rating":"1","title":"tragic","review":"I would not give this album one star if it were my decision--the dylan references were COMPLETELY misleading--i bought this after happening upon one song that i liked and instantly regretted it. if you enjoy country and twangy music, this is for you. if you enjoy VERY mellow, not dark, just calm music, this is for you. no dylan-esque anything is evident in this album, unless compared to his recent, ghastly country efforts-- anyway, this is not dark folk. this is calm country. you can barely hear any instrumentation in a few of the songs, only her prosaic, quasi-decent voice. thus, if this type of thing spins your wheels, by all means, pick this disc up--but for me, this cd was a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"discusting display of money grabbing","review":"How could you possibly like this album after listning to BME and TMTC? What happened to the talent? It deffinately lacks throughout a good 90% of the cd. After listning to songs like Block, how could you put up with the hip hop? It's all about the money now, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"love 'em","review":"I have always loved the no holds barred stlye of Machine Head and this cd is one of their classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad as hell","review":"ive been a machine head fan since burn my eyes, i saw them live with pantera and they blew phil and the boys off the stage. This disc is incredible after hearing how much robb flynn's vocals have changed from burn my eyes i was a little sceptical but this cd rips. from first note to last this cd is great although they could have done without \\"message in a bottle\\" a cover of the police song. but this cd is the sh*t. i can sum it up best by robb flynn himself, what makes this disc better than other albums of its genre? we are machine head, and they are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only two excellent tracks","review":"I saw Machine Head with Coal Chamber in Milwaukee,WI. The performancewas intense, but the cd lacks consistancy. Track 2 and TB,TS,TT (track 4) are amazingly awesome. There's definately some talent in those songs, but the rest of the cd is like the old stuff. Just your average metal band. Buy the cd though, track 2 and 4 is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 STARS!!!!!","review":"this album is their best so far, it has its own feel to it, just like the first 2 but more so. its so innovative and different, yet u kan still tell its them; machine head isnt afraid to be different and try new things, this time it was for the better, way better!!! this is easily in my top 5 cds of all time, if your a fan of any metal buy this cd now!!! \\"I DEFY\\" the trend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone-crushing guitar riffs that will satisfy to the core!!!!","review":"Machine Head are back with yet another great album. Robb extends himself as a lyricist more on this album than he did on the other two.

Check out tracks 2,3,and 7, they are all really good!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is MH thinking?","review":"I have been a fan of Machine Head since the Burn My Eyes days. The band has always been one of my favorites. I have even gotten the chance to party with them... the most chill guys I'll ever meet. But, I would love to know what happened to change their style so much. Before they were a style all their own, and now I can easily compare them to Powerman 5000, and Korn. The Hip hop aspect of the album is dry. Although, I was satisfied with the last four tracks (including \\"Message In a Bottle.\\") I found myself comparing the end of the album to track such as \\"Block\\" and \\"I'm your god now.\\" But it all boils down to this, a loyal fan is now lost. I'm sure I wont be the only one. But, hey, if you are one of the people that goes for the teen \\"freak rock\\" such as Korn or whatever else is popular.. buy it. If you are looking for brutal \\"**** it all\\" music, you are better off with \\"Burn My Eyes\\" or \\"The More Things Change.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The ill-fated \\"new direction\\"","review":"Machine Head has joined the long list of metal bands that have changed their musical direction. Unfortunately, this means that their music is less heavy and more mainstream. For fans of their first album, you might not enjoy the slower and \\"hip-hop\\" driven songs. But, if you like Limp Bizkit and Korn, this one could be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Yourself a favor and borrow this cd instead of buying it","review":"Needless to say, I'm quite disappointed with TBR. It doesnt even compare to their previous albums. Machine Head brought in that hip hop crap and it totally ruins the whole record!! I found maybe one good song and the rest are trash. I'm not sure what they are trying to prove but its not working. I always thought of Machine Head as one of the premiere bands with brutal songs, kick a** riffs, and mind blowing guitars. Maybe I was wrong. Dont buy this album,"},{"rating":"1","title":"I CAN'T BELIEVE THE SINGER IS RAPPING NOW","review":"THE BURNING RED IS A BIG LET DOWN.

What happened to machine head? The first two albums rocked but this album doesn't even do that! If you like the first two albums you probably don't like this album at all because it sounds nothing close to who they where before!

Terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tearin' it up","review":"Incredible! This is all I can say to describe this album. Before I ever got this album I had never even heard of Machine Head. I received this album from BMG without even wanting it, but when i listened to it I couldn't send it back. this album defines what speed-metal is all about. I've heard some of Machine Head's older music but I don't think it even compares to this album.

I want my money back.","review":"This CD gets one star because the system here does not let you give zero stars or a negative score. I have been a fan of machine head for ages and I really dig their other albums. However I can not say the same for this. It is pretty disappointing to hear the once mighty Machine head reduced to this. You'll laugh at the pathetic \\"message in a bottle\\" and \\"from this day\\" and feel sad when you remember how good Machine Head can be. I think that Roadrunner records should be ashamed of themselves for promoting this \\"Album\\" so heavily as it just proves that as a record company they are solely devoted to making money and not putting out good music. What a wasted oppurtunity......"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's BETTER than you think.","review":"When I bought this album I did not know really what to expect of it. I guess half of a failure and half of success since this metal band was able to grab one of the hottest producers of heavy rock being Ross Robinson. After the intro track that doesn't contain any type of importance the album feels like a thunderbolt ringing throughout the speakers and the motion of a heavy duty truck driving fast on gravel. Tracks 2,3,4,5,7,9,10,11 are absolutely furious with the rage so many bands try to show but fail. They tracks have good beats and may sound like a few bands in the past (pantera,etc...) but this album has a good sound with a good rhythym and the amount of good tracks on this heavy rock album is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than supercharger!!!!!!","review":"possibly the best MH album so far!!!!the best songs are:I defy,the blood,the sweat,the tears,nothing left, and silver!!!1.enter the pheniox-pointless!1/52.desire to fire-fast,heavy,aggressive and very angry4/53.nothing left-awesome!!!!!-very heavy!!!!!5/54.the blood,the sweat,the tears-lots of shouting and heavy grinding guitaurs mixed with ultimate speed!!!!5.silver-awesome jumps from silent to loud very,very well!!!!!!!5/56.from this day-owns some of the best riffs on the album!!!!7.exhale the vile-crushingly heavy!!!!!!!awesome crushing riffs!!!4/58.message in a bottle- my kind of version of this song!!!!4/59.devil whith the kings card-such angry lyrics!!!!4/510.-I defy-THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM!!!!!!!!!!!!!5/511.five-very angry!!!(in lyrics and guitaurs)4/512.the burning red-rubbish!!!!1/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Machine Head CD","review":"I'de never heard much of Machine Head untill recently, but I'm impressed. Some of the songs on this CD aren't so great, but I really like others. The begginings are interesting, and to me, at least, this is a new sound. But then again, I don't usually listen to this kind of music. Yeah, from what I've read of the other reviews, if you like KORN and Limp Bizkit, etc. this is a good one. I liked it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Machine Head CD","review":"Wow..really..what can I say? Wow. Ross Robinson has added another to his collection of great CD's. This is my favorite Machine Head...for some good reasons. The singer's voice (Flynn) has really come far in this album. The metal riffs on the guitar are toooo catchy. :-) Some stand out songs are \\"The Blood The Sweat The tears\\" \\"I Defy\\" \\"Desire to fire\\" Well..they are all pretty good actually. This CD also doesn't sound like it was recorded in some garage, so the sound quality plays a big factory. I really do enjoy this CD, and often find it spinnin' in my Diskman. Thanks for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Drumming, Excellent, Heavy, Melodic, Some Rap & Alt.","review":"MH have changed some by incorporating Rap and Alt.

I saw the reviews in which some people whine about the rap infusion in SOME of the songs. Folks, this style (assuming you dont like that stuff) is only on like two tracks. What people tend to forget is that bands change...I know, not always for the best but lets face it, even metal musicians need to eat man, and least its not at the cop-out level of Metallica. So if machine head thought they could gain a bit more of an audience by tapping into the mainstream...let'em. Its better to adapt slightly then to die out...oh yeah the CD's pretty damn good."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the?","review":"I am going to put this in my CD player. Switch it to track 2.Alright this riff is cool. Oh yea, now they're jammin! So far thisis cool! But huh? What's this! Is this Rob Flynn rapping! Switch it! This is a major downfall. Burn my Eyes was classic but now I guess we can consider Machine Head a sell out. 2 or 3 songs are good but that's about all you'll find. All the rest is some soft () or some mainstream waste of sound. Die hard Machine Head fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happens to bandwagon jumpers after the trend is dead?","review":"If this isn't a band totally changing their sound to cash in on a trend, I don't know what is!

If you're a limp biskit or korn fan, buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent and disappointing","review":"First off I saw these jokers open for the great Pantera--and let's just say they can't quite touch the masters yet. Let's face it they began their careers as Pantera clones and now they can't decide what kind of band they want to be. They seem to be emulating Korn--which isn't saying much. The rap on this cd is dumb. People buy the Coal Chamber cd instead. This is directionless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too slickly produced. They've sold out","review":"If you're looking for nu-metal then this a better album than the majority. I don't like nu-metal much, but of all the stuff I've heard, this is a much better album than most. It's good if you want something heavier and better than all that Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach... But if, like me, you're looking for a sprawling, epic old-skool metal album with guitar leads, longs song structures and double bass kicking then you're in the wrong place. You wanna get Burn My Eyes, Machine Head's debut. They've sold out completely (Sting covers, rap, I think you get the picture), which is a damn shame considering the masterpiece they released in 94. But if it's nu-metal you're after, then this is the right place. But if you've heard Bun My Eyes and you're hungary for more then I recommend Lunar Strain/Subterranean by In Flames or perhaps Valgar Display Of Power by Pantera."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply great","review":"One of the best written libertarian novels, as well as amazingly well written and entertaining science fiction .A must read"},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"This can safe arrived dented and when you unscrew the top the can is exposed and very sharp.

C'mon! This is the same guy that brought us Bauhaus and such classic albums as \\"Love Hysteria\\" and \\"Cascade\\"? This sounds more like background music you hear at a Middle Eastern cocktail party. Unimpressive and thoroughly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murphy betrays loyal following with deathly boring release","review":"In the age of Kaaza and other P2P applications, musicians who betray loyal fans by releasing \\"self-serving experimental\\" compilations will find that the attempt to make an easy buck is thwarted by consumer's ability to sample the music before buying. Peter Murphy will learn this lesson with his release of Dust (the title conveys its worth). The CD is not interesting or fulfilling in any regard. The tracks are void of Murphy's angelic melodies, and the accompanying music lacks any level of energy or life. The music is dead to a degree that Goth fans will pray for light and life. The music is repetitive and dull. The lyrics lack any creativity or wit. Murphy may be bored with the music his fans love, but his fans will be bored to death by this release. What a shame from such a great artist. Don't buy this album. I'll give you mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I ordered this disc because Peter Murphy was coming in concert and I wanted to re-familiarize myself with his later work. The music is brilliant and the order came in enough time to enjoy it prior to the concert. And, the show Rocked! Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time Has Got Something To Do With It?","review":"If \\"Dust\\" is imperfect then so are we. If Dust is perfection then so are we.Forced to bring forth a musical context, I would suggest Kate Bush's \\"Hounds Of Love\\", Brian Eno's \\"Another Green World\\", Peter Murphy's \\"Cascade\\", Michael Brook's \\"Hybrid\\".This album should one day get inside you in a wonderful way, but those who have a taste for any Marilyn/Sisters/Cure/Nephilim etc Goth nonsense should probably stay where they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't your older brother's Peter Murphy","review":"Wow. A lot has changed for Peter Murphy since his last release, Cascade. And it hasn't changed for the better. You can't blame Peter for branching out and trying to make his music sound different. But as others have mentioned, the \\"world music\\" sound and Peter Murphy's voice just don't mix. Most of the song's sound the same and they're very bleak and void of any melody. If you want a great Peter Murphy album try Cascade or Deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Hard to Listen To...","review":"I've been a Bauhaus - Murphy - Love& Rockets - David J. - Daniel Ash fan for a long time, Murphy being my favorite of the group. However, this is the worst album out of the lot. Maybe my aesthetic sensibilities are too narrow to see the brillance other reviewers see - but I found the album, despite its experimental nature, a meandering bore. With difficulty, I've gotten through it several times and not a single track attracts me. While I don't want to see Peter making the same album every couple of years - the leap from Cascade to Dust was too great for me. Other than his characteristic vocals, there was nothing to remind me that this was the \\"Murphy Music\\" that I cherish in Love Hysteria, Deep and, to a lesser extent, Holy Smoke and Cascade. I can't even recommend it to \\"hard core\\" Murphy fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"awakening...","review":"i don't even see this as just another Pete Murphy album...it's just a great album. it's so evocative of all things ancient awakening for the first time in centuries...it's passionate, sensual, dark. it makes me think of ancient cities at night...istanbul, rome, morrocco, cairo, antioch. it makes me think of vampires, ancient beings seeing the moon for the first time in ages.

Now, don't try to tell me that a pair of headphones should be flat and without coloring the sound. I'd agree. But, that's not the case here. The only time it showed some sort of life was when I played some Beastie Boys. Any other music genre sounded as if the sound was coming out of cardboard boxes.These headphones are not even worth half the Black Friday price.

Most audiophiles will proably call it poor. I'd recommend theSony MDR-V150 Monitor Series Headphones with Reversible Earcupsinstead.

I went back to my Sony headphones after 2 minutes of listening to this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"After purchasing this product I would recomend these headphones, they are light weight and comfortable to wear, the lead is a good length and I like the in-line volume control.The sound is very good and fold up for convinience,worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Headphones for the price","review":"I just bought the Panasonic RPHT227 headphones and I like the overall features. There is a nice clarity in hearing different instruments that I cannot hear in the car or on a normal stereo/computer speakers. The bass is pretty strong as well, but the only drawback is that there is a slightly strong mid-range peak in the output that seems to stick out slightly. I bought these for monitoring my bass guitar from a jack on my bass guitar control unit on the floor and the long cord and inline volume control are a great help. If you want perfect audio sound, these aren't quite there but they work for other applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of headphones","review":"They work well, and were the right price. I have no complaints for these head phones, they work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds quality is Great, but Extremely uncomfortable","review":"These headphones have great sound quality...if you can tolerate wearing them. The swivel ear cups and adjustable headband sound great in theory, but they don't do anything to make the fit more comfortable. I have a small head and these headphones still seem too tight! The plastic is also really poor quality, so good luck getting them to last more than a month. The ear cushions are thick, but too hard to be comfotable, and don't block any outside noise. I can hear pretty much any outside noise with these on. Not a product I would recommend, but if all you are looking for is sound quality and you don't care about comfort, these might work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound quality","review":"The sound quality is so horrible and i haven't noticed any \\"!!EXTRA BASS SYSTEM!!\\" as they say it would do, apart from the light weight and fold able body.

The sound is great and the Extra Bass system is really nice, so for that price is just perfect. But even for my small bald head they are just too uncomfortable for my ears and if you use this o regular desktop computer or laptop the sound volume is to low, but if you have a good PCI or PCIe sound card like I do, YOU JUST WONT stand half of the volume!So pic very well and if you are looking for a bargain and don't mine some negative sides, get this headphones! You won't get regret, I didn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These Headphones are worth it. NO BASS!!!!!!","review":"This are cheap and the foam part on the ear sucks. The quality of music sucks too.

Joan Armatrading's \\"The Weakness in Me\\" is heart-stopping, Sister Hazel proves that they have more than one good song in them, Save Ferris rocks the house, and the infallible Semisonic provide a B-side that sounds like an A-side. The Cardigans show they're more than \\"Lovefools,\\" and even the incendental music from the movie is worth a couple of listens. The only misstep is putting Brick's \\"Dazz\\" and Ta-Gana's \\"Saturday Night\\" on the album at all, but especially so close to \\"Atomic Dog.\\" The groovification of George Clinton makes the other two sound like the vacuous disco poseurs they are. 12 good tracks out of 14 -- great movie, great soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"answer","review":"someone said they were looking for the song in the beginning [the pretty, popular girls in the car], i believe it is: \\"one week\\" by the barenaked ladies."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this music","review":"great soundtrack, great movie though I wish they had Heath Ledger's song that he sings on the bleachers on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD saved my life!","review":"Last night I had a ten-page paper to do and I didn't start until eleven, but I put in this CD and it kept me awake and energized all night.

That's why I didn't even bother buying the soundtrack, although I listened to the CD a couple of times in the store. The two songs are: 1) One Week (Remix), by Barenaked Ladies and 2) Hypnotize, by Notorious Big. Instead of purchasing the soundtrack, I got myself each individual CD containing these great songs!!!

It has some very cool upbeat songs like 'I Want You To Want Me' by Letters To Cleo(my favorite song.) It also has 'New World' by LeRoy, 'FNT' by Semisonic, and 'Wings Of A Dove' by Madness. It's a cd I'd recommend. It's worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice but........","review":"This is a very good cd if you like the music that is in the movie. However not all of the songs that are in the movie are on the soundtrack. An example of this is the song that is being playeed when the main character is giving a table dance, or when the chartacter Pat is singing to Kat in the football stadium. So far i have noticed that there are about five songs in the movie that are not on the soundtrack. So if there is a particular song that you want to have on it make sure you see it on there before you make you purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 Things I Hate About You","review":"If you are considering purchasing this because you thought that the music in the movie was excellent...do yourself a favor and resist that urge. You will be disappointed. Most of the selections from the cd come from party scenes, or scenes where the music is not the showcase.Really, considering all the great music in the movie...this was a really poor selection. There are two or three decent tracks, but not enough to redeem the disc or capture the fun of the movie.Putting the remake of the classic \\"I Want You To Want Me\\" first on the disc is also a poor choice. In the movie it seems like a fresh take on a really good song and a fitting ending. On the disc, it just made me want to listen to the original Cheap Trick version.I would suggest looking for discs from the particular Artists who made contributions to the movie. I was truly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack for a GREAT movie","review":"I loved 10 Things I Hate About You, and the music plays such an important role in the movie, so I got the soundtrack and I love it.

Since the Miracle at Pentecost painting was lost recently in the Biblical Arts Center fire in Dallas, it was difficult to find the book. It is extremely interesting with remarkable photography. Torger Thompson was an amazing artist and a wonderful Christian. Zola Levitt, the co-author of this book, made this painting come alive again for me. Levitt wrote of his visit \\"alone\\" with the painting as a spiritual experience, which is exactly what it was for me the times I visited it during my years in the Dallas area in the l960's and 1970's. I have always wished I could go back again and I was able to do so through this book. The world lost a wonderful gift to mankind when the painting went up in flames.

Share this wonderful book with a child you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and clever in an understated way","review":"My daughter adores it; maybe because she is much like Olivia, the endearing female piglet with ballet aspirations and a desire to paint on walls.The best books for children are those not looking down on them, where humour is grown-up and where the writer is not afraid to talk to a child as an equal.Limited to black and red, laconic color scheme is very expressive and lets the child's imagination run wild. It is very subtle and will leave you smiling; your child will ask you to read this book to him/her again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivia Rocks!","review":"This book rocks! The art was delightful, even the expressions on little Olivia's piggy face. She is an active little \\"girl\\" who is into so many different things: from beautiful art (the details of real life masterpieces included in the book's museum scenes are priceless) to basking in the sun to scaring away her little brother Ian. She will delight you and your children or your students or whoever the little people in your life are. Olivia is a modern classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliva Book Review","review":"This book was a pretty good book. I really like the illustrations that are in the book.

Over all I think that this is a good book and I would recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"original and fun","review":"What a refreshing book.

Great job."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this book and the sequel for my infant daughter and","review":"my husband said he thinks I bought it more for me than for our daughter! I am bowled over with the way that Falconer's simple text and charming illustrations meld into a book that, after taking it home and reading it, forced me to run to my computer to order another (and the sequel) to send to a child across the state. And I am one picky reader, too.Olivia makes me squeal with delight. Falconer captures the everyday life of a small child with humorous touches that are certain to amuse the parent asked to read the book aloud over and over and over again.I consider the $... I spent yesterday on Falconer books (purchased one \\"set\\" at a local bookstore and a second \\"set\\" here at Amazon.com--for much cheaper, I should add) to be well-spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Olivia book","review":"This is a truly novel, fun children's book.

We will likely not buy these books for our children. I have read through other Olivia books at book stores and have found them to model inappropriate parent-child dialogue. In this book Olivia\`s mother allows bargaining (regarding how many books will get read to Olivia at bed time). This is not how I want my child to talk to me. I was pleased to see original art used in the book. However, I would rather spend my time with my daughter reading books that model more appropriate dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Customer Service Alert","review":"I think I have the wrong window.

However I found it too disjointed (there isn't really a narrative, just a series of descriptions) and too full of sly adults' injokes to really appeal to my son. I am personally not a fan of children's books designed to appeal to adults.I know this won awards and the Olivia books have a great following, but I don;t think i will risk buying another one online."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will laugh","review":"What a wonderful story.

My five year old wants to read her story over and over again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Active, Energetic Olivia","review":"Who's Olivia? Olivia is a pig, a rather active pig who is good at wearing everyone out, including herself. The simple illustrations consist of black, white and red and dominate the text of 319 words. In addition to building a sand skyscraper, Olivia feels the need to try on every piece of clothing she owns when she gets changed. During one of her visits to the museum, she views two pieces of art in particular. She tells her mother that she could do one of the pieces in five minutes. After her visit, she goes home and attempts her own rendition of Jackson Pollock's Autumn Rhythm #30 and makes a mess in the process. At bedtime, she bargains with her mother to read five books and they agree upon reading three books together."},{"rating":"1","title":"We didn't need this book...","review":"Okay, with a family of 7 (3 hyperactive) we just didn't need this book. This energetic/lively little pig was more than what we considered necessary. Although perhaps an impetus for sluggish children, this animal is not the best role model. The book truthfully, bores me. My kids don't choose it and we really didn't enjoy it -- even the first time. Sorry Olivia. And you're such a cute little pig."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the Worst Book for a Toddler","review":"I know everybody loves this book, I cannot imagine why. It is terrible. Why would I want to put the following ideas into my stubborn two year daughter's head?Scaring her little brother is OKTrying on everything in the morning to get dressed is OKDrawing on the walls to imitate pictures at a museumAsking for five books at bedtimeMy daughter does not need these ideas put into her head. If I do put these ideas into her head with this book she will learn it is ok to scare younger children, it is ok to try on all your clothes when getting dressed, how to draw on walls, Olivia asks for 5 books so will I. Who is this author? Do they have children and siblings? Do they try to leave the house on time when the children are trying on all their clothes? Do they try to put a child to sleep after just five more books?I don't get the point of this book. Children learn by what they see, read, hear, etc. Why introduce these concepts to a toddler? This book is plain awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A BLANK JOURNAL NOT A STORYBOOK!","review":"How can a blank journal have an author or an editorial review? The cover looks just like the picture attached (a little pig in the middle of a white square that says \\"OLIVIA\\".) But (on Amazon) you can \\"look inside\\" and see the pages from a \\"different\\" edition. What you actually get is a nice little notebook with a pen and about 50 sheets of 6x6 lined paper. This was a waste of money, and for the price, hardly worth returning. Very disappointing Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious!","review":"What an unforgettable character!

Long live Olivia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"only the best will do","review":"what a fun, lively and adorable character Olivia is! And character is definitely the word to describe her. One of the best new children's books to come along in a long, long time. It is only out in hard back, but is so well-worth the money. Don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story...a jewel for those with daughters","review":"Anyone who's ever had a toddler...especially an active, inquisitive one can appreciate this story. In the literal sea of vividly colored children's books out there, Olivia stands out based on simplistic artwork, color choices, and it being a GREAT story.Parents and children can relate to Olivia's antics...singing loudly, trying on everything in the closet, having a vivid imagination, painting on walls, etc., especially Olivia's mom saying \\"You know you really wear me out.\\" And the fact that she is a spunky pig makes no difference.I have enjoyed hours reading this book (and other Olivia books) to my daughter. It is short enough for a bedtime story but long enough to be complete. A good book all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Olivia","review":"We love all of the Olivia books. They are well written, well illustrated, and my kids love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll recognize her.","review":"OK, OK, I confess. I only bought the book because my almost-five-year-old is called Olivia and like most kids her age she loves to see her name in print. But she and I sat and laughed like morons all afternoon and read the book about a dozen times in one sitting. Anyone who has one of these little creatures (kids I mean, not pigs) will recognize something of their own in Ian Falconer's charming text and wonderfully expressive drawings. From lugging the cat around the house by the armpits to negotiating like a hard-nosed trial lawyer over the number of books at bed time, Olivia is as real a kid as yours and mine. Our family can't wait for the next in what I hope will be a long series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Olivia!","review":"This is a wonderful book! The illustrations are fantastic.

Sedona (5) loved reading it as she is learning how to read and doing a great job. Sandia (2) thought the pictures were fun and Sandia really was entranced by the black, red, and white scheme of the pictures. I would recommend this book and the rest of the series to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully illustrated","review":"A great story, especially for the spirited little girl in your life. My daughter loves the pictures, and I find the story very heart-warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four bright stars and a full moon","review":"In Olivia, Ian Falconer captures the effervescent spirit of six-year-old Olivia, showing her quirks and charms with deft skill in an amazing display of charcoal sketching accented with vibrant splashes of red. The trio of white, red, and black form a powerful trio of color that capture the confidence and boisterous Olivia's high-energy personality.Mr. Falconer slips in enough surprises- the Jackson Pollock painting and the rather astounding sand castle, for instance-to add more zip to this lively romp. This book is a welcome breath of fresh air to the field of children's literature, where all too often, well, let's just say the books are pretty poorly conceived.The text and story are short and economical, providing just enough details to justify the elaborate, funny illustrations, which are the reason you may every now and then pull out this book for another look even when the children are asleep or out in the treehouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting story about a very human pig.","review":"We have purchased two copies of this book; one for our daughter and one as a gift for a friend's daughter. The story is sweet and not too long to lose the attention of our two-year-old. She loves to look at the illustrations and will sit for some time by herself just flipping through the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sqeal of delight","review":"I bought this book as a birthday gift for a little girl, and almost decided to keep this for myself. This book tells the story of a naughty little piglet named Olivia. Her antics are delightfully funny, and will remind you of that fun loving 4 year old in your life.The illustrations are wonderful, and accomany the text well enough so that even a new reader will be able to enjoy the book at some level.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is searching for that perfect book to give as a gift, or to add to any childs library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is one of my favorite children's books of all time! Amazon.com made it easy to find the correct book and the ordering process was simple and fast.

Olivia is a wonderful character with charm and charism that would make all other pigs snort. Olivia has class and I think that is what makes me love her so much, either that or because she reminds me so much of myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olivia reminds me of someone I know, oh yeah!

She's not sure why I think the illustration on the sand castle page with \\"she got pretty good\\" is so hilarious--- but it'll slay you if you're a grown-up. These books are really really witty. you hear this a lot- but they're great for kids AND grown-ups!"},{"rating":"2","title":"L'Chaim","review":"The story line and the writing are both outstanding; and Graubart's sense of humor adds something playful to a profound exploration of the human condition and the struggle to make the world (and oneself) a little better. I could not put the book down, and afterwards felt a keen desire to study with its author. Reading this book also energized my thinking about Torah study, though I believe that Planet of the Jews stands nicely on its own as an exciting and well-crafted science fiction story that changes the lense of our world view enough to make the reader think in a new way about some once and future issues."},{"rating":"1","title":":-(","review":"I never finished the book.

This may be an OK learning program for experienced guitarists, but beginners should stay away. There is no written material other than a tab book that doesn't tell you how to read tab. Plus, the text in the tab book is almost unreadable. This DVD may have been marginally useful if the tab booklet was adequate, but it is pretty useless with this poor quality booklet. I gave my DVD away to my brother-in-law who is an accomplished guitarist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Hot Licks series!","review":"I own several of the hot licks DVD's and this one blew me away. It gives you a very broken down lesson on how to approach electric blues and especially how to play standard tuning slide. Haynes goes into great detail on how to play slide, as well as his own techniques on how to mute unwanted notes and how to bring out the best in the notes you do want. The looping options on the DVD are a great tool to help you nail down the licks he provides.What I found most useful is how he actually plays longer licks here...not the normal 15 second or so lick and thats found on many other guitar instruction DVD's. The playing here is for more advanced players, but that does not mean that even beginners cannot get something out of this. He really gets into the playing and it only helps aspiring guitarists learn some great licks from one of the best players of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haggah for vegetarians","review":"Unfortunately, I found this haggadah to be too pedantic. The philosophical/ethicial reasons for being vegetarian were discussed in a very grim and uncomfortably vivid way. I purchased this for my cousin, who is a 15 year old vegetarian in the hopes that it might help her feel more connected to and included at our Passover Seder. Instead, because I found the haggadah upsetting, I didn't even show it to her. The idea of a vegan/vegetarian Haggadah is a great one, and I hope that when someone else attempts to create another one that they spare us all the descriptions of agribusiness animal torture we are unfortunately already familiar with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine...until it bends","review":"I had one of these for about a month before it suffered it's first structural failure.

Most of it is stuck inside the bank therefore would be a really boring movie for some as it isn't very action apart from parts of the movie towards the end it gets more shooting. If you are keen on a bit of action here and then and you don't mind having a film that dosen't really plot anywhere else than one place, you will sure like this.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"To be quite honest, although there was a stunning cast, the plot was gory. It was sweet and had it's element of romance, but it was too morbid for me to enjoy. If you are watching for Drew Barrymore, don't bother. she only appears halfway through the movie and then only sporadically afterwards.

I plan to buy a new one from a different manufacturer, partly because of the problems I've had with it losing its format (and my data!), but also because the curved shape has been a problem from the start. The shape makes it easy to grasp but it makes it too wide to fit into the USB port area on the front of my desktop PC's. I have to use a cable, which makes it less compact/portable.

Both intellectuals, they vie for the affection of petite, beautiful,Elly who is torn between the love of her best friend, who is trying to rekindle a girlhood platonic love affair, and the love/lust/desire of her handsome American boyfriend who promises excitiment, drugs, sex, wealth and travel.

This is a must read for Dunant fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy!!!!","review":"After reading about these guys in Murder Dog I had to pick this one up. Fans of Esham, Brotha Lynch, and Tech N9ne will dig this. They remind me alot of Insane Poetry, and old Ganksta Nip. Only these guys are much more lyrical. In fact their lyrical skills completely suprised me. They can spit just like Twista. The content pretty much makes Eminem look like Will Smith. \\"Laughing till Suicide\\" \\"Napper of the Kids\\" and \\"Cannibal Orgy\\" are a few of the titles to give you an idea of what these guys are into. Also their poking fun at the Columbine incident almost goes too far but for jaded rap fans looking for something on the edge and very different don't hesitate.

Unlike many volumes of short stories this volume's stories promptly get you interested in the story, and one's interest is held to the final sentence. Nor is the conclusion left \\"up in the air\\" as is so often the case with modern short stories. This book eminently deserves the five stars I give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Island Stylee Music","review":"a very nice cd for the average pacific islander reggae enthusiast. songs are definite reminders of pure island reggae at its best. i'm probably the only one who has bought this off amazon and i'm more than grateful i did and honored to be the first to review it. i used to have the cassette version back in high school but lost it somehow. i'd recommend this to all pacific islanders (micronesians, polynesians, and melanesians alike). one love, one destiny... jah rastafari!! dig it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these mats","review":"I have bought them before and I will buy them again.

Listen to all of the above comments on the condition of items received from this company, they are very TRUE!! I took a chance even though I read the reviews and probably got the hood that someone else described above. Banged and dented and scratched. Delivery box was so flimsy and hood was packed terribly. AND... you could tell that it had been sent somewhere else first. It had another packing slip in it from 2 months before I ordered ours. Don't purchase from these people. To be fair, I did return it without any problem but I had to return it and that was problem enough and I was stuck with a hood filter from a different vender that would not take it back w/o me paying shipping because there was no problem with the filter. But what do i need that filter for now? To ship the filter back was more than the filter cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"The range hood was reasonabled priced, and the shipping was free. When I found it on our front porch, I knew it would be damaged ,only a tank could have survived being shipped in the retail box. I had to ship it back @ $5.00 more than what was credited to me ,Probably all the tape I used to hold the box together. Initially when I called I spoke with a woman her middle eastern accent was so strong, I had to keep asking her to repeat what she was saying.Her message was to keep it & theyll send me a new one.

We were sick when we took it out of the box and found out it is dented right in the front of the hood. The box was not damaged so it had to have happened in the factory. Because we did not inspect the product as soon as it arrived and we are beyond our return time limit I guess we are stuck with a $63.00 dented hood fan. We trusted that because the original box was in perfect shape the product would be perfect as well. This is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check locally before buying this","review":"The Good: It is inexpensive, easy to install, works reasonably ok, packaging was decent- arrived without incident in a few daysThe Bad: Loud, very very loud. You won't be able to handle the fan noise on high, even on quiet it is louder than the one it replaced (which oddly had a higher noise decibel rating for the fan). The front plastic vent cover is ugly and lets some air through, but it is not a deal breaker.If you can wait a couple of weeks and need a low-end, inexpensive range hood, I would check your local Home Depot for the lower-end Maytags (they usually have to order them), they run about the same price as this but are of much better quality and lower noise. We needed one immediately and this did the job, barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does The Job, Stainless Finish Looks Nice, But A Bit Flimsy","review":"This Range Hood does the job. I bought it to replace my old one that have seen better days.The stainless steel finish compliments my stanless stove and fridge nicely. The exhaust fan has decent draw and prevent the house from smoking up when you fry something.However, some of the craftmanships are flimsy. These includes switches and the way the filter is mounted, I also wish the enclosed the light bulb a bit more to avoid grease sticking to the bulb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Whatever your reason is for taking a long, hard look at the cheapest of range hoods, buy this with confidence. This was a perfect, and attractive replacement for a 20 year old range hood. My local Home Depot didn't even carry 36\\" wide, much less offer a range of options. You will need to buy and wire in a plug, and provide some duct tape to seal to your existing duct, but this thing was a slam dunk. Having read the other reviews about how light weight the sheet metal is, I got a good chuckle out of a message on the box, warning me not to pull it out of the box by grabbing the middle of the front edge. Treat it gently at install, and you'll be rewarded with a dirt-cheap but perfectly functional stainless steel hood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Hood","review":"Beautiful product that works perfectly.There is only one bad thing I can say - The stainless steel is thin, and kind of flimbsy when installing. I think the stainless steel could have been thicker and a higher quality.Once its installed you can't tell though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the money!","review":"We ordered this to replace an old hood that didn't work.

The story is nice and interesting but the characters are problematic. Oz's heroes are not normal people, they act and speak weird which makes it impossible to identify with them.

There's nothing this guy can't do. This movie is very entertaining and suspensful. Bret's portrayal of Michael Raine is chilling and you pretty much forget that he's a rock star altogether. Superb direction, and a great supporting cast. I'm so glad I bought this!

I recommend it for any mystery buff; it will definately have you thinking (and watching) to keep up. Very cool ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Letter from Death Row is a very low class film that is not worth the time it takes to put it in the DVD player. I am a huge fan of Bret Michaels, but this movie is not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Bless Bret's Greedy Little Soul and Washboard Abs","review":"As a long time Poison fan, this two-star rating pains me. Especially since one of the stars is for the amount of time Bret spent with his shirt off. Very nice. Anyway, the other star is for the somewhat interesting story. With the amount of time it took Bret to finish this movie (I remember hearing about it back in the late 80's), you'd think he would have done a minimal amount of legal research? A lot of this is just poorly researched nonsense. Like a story written by a kid in junior high who has no access to books or the internet, and just imagines what it must be like to be on death row. The movie attempts a Big Twist! at the end, but really didn't make any sense. I managed to watch it all the way through, so I guess it wasn't that bad. Except for the Sheens, the acting is just as bad as you suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable garbage","review":"After struggling through watching this movie it is readily apparent why every studio in the world refused to distribute this piece of garbage. A golden turkey, without insight or emotion, it was probably conceived during one of Michael's frequent drug binges and it is no wonder that this bomb was never released directly to video."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of TheBest In Suspense","review":"When I first rented it i didn't know what to expect but after I watched it I was blown away. Another fine performance from the front man of one of the best bands from the 80's Poison. Bret Michaels is believeable on his role and it keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I highly recommend this to anyone that is a Poison fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD would not play","review":"We recieved this DVD in time for Christmas but when we tried to view it, we got an error message.

I thought Bret Michaels was excellent for a starring debut. Yes don't expect to see much of Martin Sheen and even less of Charlie, but don't worry.

I've read better from 7th graders. It was almost like the author had a story and tried to shove in his own selling points in all over the book just to make it relate.

Although not on par with Bewitched [my fave] or Penthouse, it is next in line. A bit mellower, but it definitely grows on you with repeated listenings"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Yet","review":"I have been a long time Luna fan and listen to every cd routinely. I am tired of reading reviews written by fans that say that the last two studio albums are great or that long time fans should just get over the Penthouse or Bewitched albums and accept that their sound is evolving. I believe their music has done just the opposite. It has regressed from a melodic guitar band with an edgy sound and clever lyrics into dopey melodies and dopey lyrics.I own a company that employs several 23-28 year olds and several part time people in the same age group. We have an extensive cd collection in the office. Interestingly, new listeners to Luna put on the Bewitched cd and sometimes Penthouse and never Pup Tent or Days of Our Nights. Romantica is just not on their play list at all.With the exception of a song or two from each of the last three albums, Luna has not recorded a good album since Penthouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Love","review":"On their sixth studio album, Romantica, Luna's Dean Wareham is in love, but I'm not sure with whom or with what. Certainly he adores the post-Velvets drone of guitars-bass-drums. Certainly he adores his ironic, prankish sense of humor. And certainly he adores the career band that's now surpassed Galaxie 500 on every semi-commercial and artistic level. Yet though Romantica doesn't really sound all that different from Pup Tent or Bewitched (though not the masterful Penthouse), there's something missing in the mix. Could be the detached post-modern eye he turns towards his romantic travails - very continental, don't you think? Could be the thudding lyricism he aims for and misses on many of these tracks. Could be love isn't Wareham's great subject - seduction is, especially when he has to try just a little bit harder than he does once he gets what he wants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me Luna Or Give Me Death","review":"I love Luna. I'll admit I'm prejudiced. I have been a fan for a long time. But I thought Luna could never top The Days Of Our Nights. I was wrong. Songs like 1995 rock you into a state of shock and songs like Romantica sweep you into a state of tears. Dean's poetry has never been sharper, nor has the interplay of the band ever been more pure. Britta is an excellent addition to the band, not just for her chops but also for her beautiful voice, highlighted on Mermaid Eyes. The record I drift to sleep with every night and wake up with in the morning. Everything that is good about rock music is here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for retirement","review":"This cd strikes a new low point in Luna's recording career. It's definitely not the same band that put out Penthouse and Pup Tent--both great cds. If you are new to Luna, start with those recordings and work your way down to this dud, but only if you feel it's absolutely necessary. Personally, I feel the band was much better with Stanley Demeski on drums and Justin Harwood on bass. The new girl is definitely distracting Dean with her cheesy sultriness and weak, whispy vocals. Why can't more bands follow the worthy precedent set by the Beatles and break up before they get terrible?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish.","review":"Qfwfqu, an immortal being, guides the reader through the evolution of Earth.

Vapid, empty, boring, naive, and utterly lacking do not go far enough in describing the content of this book. Of the few one-liners that did contain any substance, they are simple re-wordings of easily identifiable famous quotes by other writers know for their witticism (i.e. Ben Franklin, Tao Te Ching, Jesus, etc.). Other quotes are confusing if taken literally or thoroughly pointless if examined with a critical eye.Clearly other than re-publishing others' work, very little effort was put into this work.

But what I got was the most depressing and sordid life story of a supposed real life English prostitute. The film made an attempt to give a sympathetic late 20th century presentation of her life. But I saw through it and believe me I didn't sympathize at all! I found the lead character to be the most unpleasant, disfunctional mess of a human being that no one would ever want to encounter. I could only sympathize with her father and a host of her victims whom the film went to pains to discredit. So much for late century revisionism. I was forced by Amazon's rating system to give at least one star but if I had a choice I wouldn't give it any at all. Oh, and the cheesecake rating on this film is very low.

They are whimsical (a walking fish delivers a toureen of fish soup, for example), beautiful, and altogether unusual. I collect cookbooks and found none of the recipes to be an improvement upon those I already own, so I am in the process of framing the artwork for my kitchen. I couldn't be happier with the book, but perhaps not for the reason the author intended.

It gives me the impression that these guys do what they want; thing showed in crazy parts, solos, mixing the most extreme death metal with power metal(singing like Andre Matos,ex-Angra). And check hidden part in the last track, you will see what I'm talkin' about. You can find lots of bands like Sins of Omission, but no one executes better.But Sins of Omission doesn't play the typical AtTheGates-speed and rhythm, they go further, with an originality hardly heard before, daring to play different tempos and intrincate rhythms as well, with the best melodic riffs and solos, putting 'em all together in order to create a nice soup of melodic metal!!=)With so many bands doing the same nowadays, it's a great feeling to find an oasis in the desert!

Although they're still pricey online, it's nice to know we have more affordable options.That being said, this particular textbook was in exceptional condition and priced very well.

Since I already have two complete sets of Shakespeare's works, which I paid considerably less for, I didn't see a need for this text. Well, I was wrong! I decided to buy it since the reviews proved that this edition may be more informative then the less expensive editions I already own. That was very true to form! I found the introduction of the book, and of all of the works, very informative; and most of all, I found the glossary at the bottom of each page to be extremely valuable. These are features which my other volumes did not include and it was worth every extra penny for this volume.

James Maxwell as editor guaranteed a reliable text, and I was astonished by the quantity of useful supporting material. One of my students - at that time very nationalistic and hostile to relics of colonialism - objected profoundly to a course concentrating on one author, and an English author at that. Also to the price and cumbersomeness of the prescribed text. As an able student she subsequently went on to complete her MA at Leeds and her Ph D at Yale. A couple of years back she was telephoning me in desperation to know where she could replace the book - now worn to pieces, and long one of her most prized possessions. She could not praise too highly the excellence of the Riverside as the most useful complete Shakespeare onthe market.

They abandoned the old slow formula for a fast paced, high energy feel easily comparable to Funker Vogt. The first 8 tracks on Nymphomatik are all gold material, but my favorites would have to be Flesh Menagerie and A Matter Of Time. The only point at which the album starts to decline in quality is with the last 3 tracks. 96 Degrees is just a bridge to the 2 remixes that follow of Perfect Stranger and Physical Education, which aren't nearly as good as the originals. However, the rest of the album is so great it doesn't even seem worth complaining about. I for one love this new style for Informatik, and hope they continue to develop future songs in this manner. If you are a industrial/EBM fan of any kind, Nymphomatik is the album to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great offering of music","review":"I like this band and I am very pleased with this album.

I look for the following 4 qualities in a movie to be rated by me: substantial script, great acting, solid directing, & efficient editing. This movie has a disposable script, next to zero directing and probably zero editing also. The 2 (actually 3) lead characters show some reasonable acting abilities.You will miss nothing if you never watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring like hell","review":"I really did my best to watch at least first hour of this \\"opus\\". Unfortunately, it is almost impossible. The movie is so avantgarde, that it is hard to digest.

The cinematography is interesting at first, but quickly gets old. The lack of dialogue not only makes it difficult at best to discern a story line, but also makes it virtually impossible to emotionally connect to any character.One reviewer was impressed that the actors were \\"nude 90% of the time.\\" Ok, the director managed to achieve something any porn director pulls off in almost every film.I've seen well-made art films that use black and white, that use symbolic imagery. Ingmar Bergman's \\"Seventh Seal\\" is a touch-stone film in that category.

We rented it over the weekend and rather enjoyed it. It accomplished pretty much everything it set out to accomplish, and while it wasn't a huge blockbuster, it was none the less a very enjoyable movie with a 'different premise' that drew on other movies to enhance the humor. There were many original twists and turns to the plot, and it ultimately does teach children a family value - the main idea to the whole story is that a mom and dad loses their son and are willing to do anything to get him back.

I can't recall a single Disney movie, animated or live action, where a character must take such constant abuse.

I fell a sleep on the movie the first time and the second time, I kept wondering how much longer the film was-when it was a short movie to begin with.

They'll enjoy the cute and cuddly chick who wants to be loved and appreciated. However, some people will be perplexed by the storyline. I felt the premise of the story was too long. There's only so much you can do with a small story and it showed with the inclusion of space aliens. I also wasn't impressed by a few characters. One character I realy was annoyed at was the pig. I felt he was out of place and not funny at all.

All i can say is poor Walt......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lower your child's self-esteem with Chicken Little!","review":"I read all of the 1 star and 2 star comments and was shocked that no one mentioned the real problem of the movie...Everyone is just plain mean to Chicken Little. Why? Even the dad openly says that he's embarrassed of his kid. You would think that he would be extremely protective of his son ever since the wife's (hen's) absence. Chicken Little is surprisingly strong-willed despite the fact that everyone in the town considers him to be crazy and a loser. Other than the fact that he's small the characters all promote bullying. And what was the redeeming factor of the movie? The lead chick tells his dad that \\"he's never there for him.\\" Duh. ... My daughter is 2.5 and really didn't get the story. All she saw was bright lights, loud noises, and cute animals. She obviously liked the movie. There's no way I'll show this to her when she's older.

The writers definitely had to stretch their imagination too much to come up with some of the ideas in the film; yet it was an interesting take on the Chicken Little story. It does keep you interested. When you find out certain things your reaciton is \\"Oh you've got to be kidding\\". There are some very funny scenes, particularly towards the end. You've gotta like the Chicken Little at the end, he's COOL! I will watch it again and probably include it in my library for my young children to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with this one. I was expecting a smart movie full of imagination and beautiful animation. Well, the animators did a great job, but the writing was really bad as was the direction.

I was bored all through this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised... :-)","review":"I have to admit that I was dragged into the movie theater - I simply was not interested in a movie about a chicken. But I was positively surprised... I have watched it twice - the first time I saw the normal version and the second time I watched the 3D Version. Even though I loved the normal version, you have to see the 3D Version! That is amazing! If you have the choice - see the 3D Version. Great movie, great music!

Go see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicken Little","review":"My husband and I took our two children, 3 and 5, to see this film. We were all disappointed. My husband joked that the best part of the film is that it was only 70 minutes!!! The children, who are usually enraptured in Disney movies, could not have been any less interested. In the way of the Shreck films, the movie humor was geared towards adults... not that we found it in the least bit funny.Forty dollars later, we found ourselves asking why did we bother? The best part of the outing was getting to spend time with our children. Save your money and find another way to spend your valuable family time. This film is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to see the Digital 3-D version!","review":"The digitally projected, polarized 3-D version is astonishing. The clearest, brightest image I have ever seen in a multiplex; this is truly the future.The movie itself was a cute kid flick; if not as good as the best of Pixar, so what?

The venom against this film is mostly illogical; just enjoy the family film (in glorious digital 3-D) and forgot the comparisons to other movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"It's an alright movie, wouldn't rate it one of my top favorite Disney movies but its a must if you want the whole Disney collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny and Entertaining Film for Children and Adults","review":"Perhaps because it does not aspire to the more ambitious plotting of a Pixar film (i.e. The Incredibles, Little Nemo), poor Chicken Little has been treated like the runt of the litter by many \\"critics\\". Too bad, as CL as a film is actually a notch above those Pixar flicks, if only because it only strives to elicit laughs. Guess what? It works. Clocking in at just over 80 minutes, CL burrows through a mostly non-stop barrage of funny characterizations, sight gags and dizzying 3-D animation. There are, in essence, no slow spots. Which is probably why, unlike the enjoyable but longish Pixar films, my five year old has watched this one repeatedly and laughed throughout. As either a multi-day rental or purchase, you really can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicken Little","review":"LOVE this movie! Cute and funny.

I gave it 4 stars, and darn it, I'm writing the review -- so there. They gave it 3 stars because they felt that the move wrapped up too quickly.Chicken Little starts where all Chicken Little movies starts, with Chicken Little raising the alarm that the sky is falling. Then it moves into an entertaining tale of a son trying to win his father's admiration.The science fiction references are excellent, and the characters are funny and original. For example, there is a fish (named Fish) who goes to school wearing an inverted diving bell (water on the inside). One great line comes when one of the character taps on the diving bell faceplate to get Fish's attention. The other character says, \\"Don't tap on the glass. They don't like that.\\"The humor was quick. The story was entertaining, and the movie is only an hour and 20 minutes long.

We shut it off after 25 minutes, collectively bored and unhooked. I, myself, was quite irritated with the voices. The animation was incredible, and very creative. There were a lot of cool ideas going on in the town. However, as I mentioned before, the voices were very annoying. It didn't make sense. The animal children had voices of adults. ANd the father of Chicken Little had the voice of an extremely elderly man. It didn't make any sense. My daughter was bored and asking for the \\"Witch Movie\\" aka \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" so we gladly put that on for her. Imagine that, a toddler today wanting a movie from 1939 instead of this. That says something. There are some cute and fun parts to this movie, however overall it just doesn't hold the interest of a child or an adult. The action sequences were so boring we fast forwarded through them. Imagine that. The animation is good, the story and characters are bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"lighten up folks, it is a movie for kids","review":"I took my four year old grandson to see this movie. He liked it.

The text does not get into details which are thoroughly discussedin McLachlan's excellent \\"The EM Algorithm and Extensions.\\" Some important points are so condensed and in places so poorly presented that the the discussion is worthless. For example the important section 3.4 \\"Standard Errors\\", which underlies much of the discussion contains errors.The book could be useful to a practioner who is only looking for guidance in fitting mixture models with available software. Unfortanately McLachlan's mixture software referred to in the Appendix, is not available. That's a pity because the advertised software features and design potentially rank it the top choice.For a user who will use his own EM software to fit mixture models I would recommend highly the McLachlan's EM Algorithm book over the Mixture book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vital and fresh voice in a chorus that is growing strident","review":"Shirin has found a voice from her experience that encourages us to consider more than the veneer of the Muslim that is put before us, on occasion, through the press and pulpit.

This is a book, however, that does guide us to understand the motivations we (Muslim and non Muslim) share for honoring those things most important in our lives.

They are kind of like Alkaline Trio, not in sound, but rather in the sense that their sound is definitly \\"pop-punk\\" but somehow they break the mold of the crappy pop punk that is dominating the airwaves.

The highlight for me is the excellent performance of \\"Up on the Sun\\" sans the extension and \\"Wipe Out\\".

Even if you don't dig biking or riding a bike, the way they made the bike scenes and the chasing scenes were very clever. It kept me on my seat for most of the movie. The plot is kind of a simple one but it achieves its goal by entertaining even the viewer who wouldn't normally watch this kind of movie.

It's like a Saved by The Bell movie with better production value.The story doesn't develop enough to warrant an hour and a half and the soundtrack reinforces the feeling that there's nothing new being shown. It's so corny at times you wonder if it's supposed to be an ironic spoof with Levitt doing a cheap Franco impersonation from 127 hours and Shannon coming across like a much less interesting Ray Liotta dirty cop, any one of the many he's played. And I'm a fan of the acting work of both Levitt and Shannon, most notably Shannon in Take Shelter, an all time great performance in a role tailor made for him.If I knew then what I know now, I wouldn't have rented, and I refuse to justify money and time spent by pretending this is anything more than garbage.

Who is going to get the ticket and what is going to happen to the little Chinese kid?

With Joseph Gordon-Levitt's recent successes in movies I was hoping this one would be just as good. Unfortunately it is an extreme let down. This movie seemed like a grown up version of a Disney Channel Original movie. I thought this movie had to deal with some sort of top secret message that could ruin Wall street or something, but instead it is just an envelope of money that a friend needs to get to a lady so she can pay for her son to come from China to America :/ Really, that's the plot....it's so lame. However, the biking parts of the movie were very entertaining; it's not everyday you see a high speed chase on a bike. So if you do end up renting this movie, I suggest that you just watch the whole thing on mute.

While it may not win any awards for the plot, the action is high-quality and the movie provides lots of laughs with the insane acting of Michael Shannon and the bike cop-JGL interactions.I'd compare this movie experience with Crank, such that it's got a decent plot but the cinematography, action, and humor more than make up for it.

As far as the music goes, I think Bromberg is an expert player, but to me the songs are overwrought with technique, and the bass is oppressively up front in the mix. I have other recordings where the bass player is the \\"leader,\\" (Paul Chambers comes to mind), but I think they're richer for their understatedness.On a final note, I have to ask one thing.

If you don't put all the sticks in PERFECTLY VERTICALLY, or even if you do, and they don't STAY that way until it's frozen, then getting the lid off (and then back on again), is nearly impossible as the sticks are at different angles. I solved this by simply not using the lid at all, and letting the sticks go in at weird angles (it worked OK, just looked funny eating a crooked popsicle).2. You have to keep the entire mold in the freezer until the last popsicle is eaten, and that is both a waste of space, and lacks flexibility. Individual pop molds can be stashed wherever there is room, once they are frozen. I suppose you can remove the popsicles from the mold and store them in something else, but that's kind of a mess.I eventually replaced it with individual molds that I liked much better - Tovolo brand or something like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I bought this, thinking the price meant it was better than Wal Mart's cheaper options. I was disappointed. The metal 'lid' makes it very difficult to use (it's suppose to help unfreeze the pops form their placement without drenching the pops in water). Then, the sticks that came with it kept breaking while I tried pulling them out of place when frozen. It's a great idea, just not worth the higher price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the most annoying book I have ever read","review":"This is my most hated book I have ever read, bar none. And I have read a lot of books. I've never been so annoyed while reading a book. Supposedly a pleasurable activity. I was actually rooting for Tibbie to go back with the former lover who impregnated and abandoned her. She'd be better off with him than with Nick. What a clod. All he had to say was \\"I love you, will you marry me?\\" and the book would have ended at the halfway point. BUT NO. She had to tell him she loved him, FIRST. Why is he so insistent? When he knows all she's been through before with her former lover? It doesn't make any sense except that the author had no plot. If you read this book you will be wasting your time and money. I simply can't say enough bad things about it, as I don't have my thesaurus handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT FIRST NOVEL","review":"This novel is what vampire literature used to be before the vampire got sexy in more recent literature. The vampire is a creepy dead thing that \\"infects\\" or \\"contaminates\\" all that it touches. This novel has a air of creepiness that doesn't let go. \\"The Historian\\" is a fine novel that is written with care and it does take its time with its subject. The ending is rushed a bit and does slow things down a bit but overall its a great book to read. I can't wait to see what Elizabeth Kostova's next novel will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously overhyped","review":"This was one of the most monotonous, self-conciously overwritten books I've ever read. It was so boring that I had to drag myself kicking and screaming through the first few chapters until I could read no more. It's the kind of book where you keep waiting to get to 'the good part' which is no kind of book at all. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly dull and ininspired writing","review":"This had the potential of being a great book with an original story. Unfortunately the characters and places never became real and there was no real sense of suspense. The writer unskillfully used numerous adjectives to try to describe people and place, but never managed to evoke a real sense of them. I never once felt a thrill of horror, fear or suspense. Sometimes the plot seemed full of holes, with people's actions seeming very contrived in order to move along to the next plot device. And the epistolary style was vastly overused. Jonathon Norrell and Mr. Strange was a hundred times more skillfully and beautifully wrought. The Da Vinci Code was a hundred times more exciting and fast paced. I was really disappointed and slogged my way through only because I'd spent $25 on it - waste of money frankly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Boring, thats the only word i have to describe this novel, it starts out boring, it has a boring story and ends boring, what a waste of an afternoon, i get more excitement cleaning up cat hair balls off the carpet.

Kostova writes beautifully, but the book could have been written in 100 pages. Long doesn't always mean good."},{"rating":"1","title":"An interesting subject wasted by horrendous writing","review":"Kostova deserves credit for developing a fresh take on a subject that one would have thought cliched.

(Not going to be one added to my permanent collection.) It was like reading a text book in a subject you didn't like much. Slow, pedantic and way way too long.

The story switched back and forth between the father's past story he is telling his daughter, then switches to the present story of them traveling. Unfortunately, the story doesn't seem to ramp up, and drops into a padded travelog with too little happening of any interest. 100 pages needs to go to speed this story up, and frankly I no longer care. I got to page 243 and stopped reading. I no longer care, I feel manipulated and bored. Anybody want to buy my book, because I don't care if Vlad chews on them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING !!

I can't finish it because it's so boring and all anyone does is talk. If you're looking for action and a page turner, this is NOT your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book without a soul","review":"I wanted to like it but while Kostova can write she's not a writer. She can turn a phrase but they have no meaning. She can construct characters but they have no soul (no pun intended). Her scenery is vivid but not at all interesting.Kostova has indeed put a new twist on the Vampire legend, she has made it boring.The only positive thing I can say is I bought it for $3.95 from the bargain bin. Now only if I can get those hours of reading back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype?","review":"This was an ambitious book that seemed at first to justify the breathless reviews. A third of the way through, I realized that it would a chore to finish. And it was. It devolved into another drawn out vampire story with all the improbable history and invevitable final show-down. I was looking for another book equal to the one I'd recently finished -- \\"The Shadow of the Wind.\\" This wasn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Drakula is undead and reads this book, he will die of boredom.","review":"I found the beginning of this book engaging and engrossing; the ending was boring and banal. Your time would be better spent reading Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula\\" or visiting www.donlinke.com/drakula/vlad.htm."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Horror Is My Paying for the Hardback","review":"Let me preface this review by telling you that I haven't finished reading The Historian. How dare I commit - and admit - this sacrilege? My answer: I cannot allow another reader to struggle knowingly through this boring tome. Based on a thoughtful, enthusiastic review in a respected publication, I rushed to the bookseller. (I seldom do this; I wait for recommendations from trusted friends.)I was enticed by the concept of combining history and horror genres. Although the opening chapters didn't grab me, Kostova's character creation,descriptive settings and artful use of language encouraged me to pursue a so very slowly developed storyline. The obvious in-depth research earned it another star. Unlike many readers I will not compare the author or the book to another: I was prepared for it to be different than early Ann Rice,L. A. Banks, et al. I'm on page 36. I can not go further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and dry","review":"This story starts out with a lot of promise. The premise is intriguing as the search for Dracula begins after a prominent professor goes missing. However, despite all the author's attempts at trying to make a suspensful novel, everything ended up being so predictable. The pace of the book is excruciatingly slow, and at times, I felt as though I was reading a textbook on Eastern European history rather than an exciting mystery. I actually fell asleep several times while trying to get through some very verbose and boring history which ended up leading nowhere.This book was not worth reading, the climax is painfully predictable and unclever. Save yourself the trouble and re-read the Da Vinci Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes a special author","review":"It takes a special author to write boring vampire novel. Vampire stories by their nature are full of sex and violence, so why did this book just drag on and on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Beg To Differ","review":"I read every page of this bloody (no pun intended) book and cannot conceive what all the hype was about. The novel reads like a cross between a Ph.D. thesis on medieval eastern Europe and a travel guide through the Balkans. The characters are stereotypes: the vaguely absentminded professor, the emotionally impaired father-deprived woman and a vanilla teen-age girl who is merely a device for propelling the story through time. When Dracula finally makes his appearance he comes off as a fey, boorish Oscar Wilde. If you want to read about eastern Europe, I suggest The Assault by Harry Mulisch. If you want a good vampire story then it is Salem's Lot by Stephen King. In the meantime, The Historian get a silver spike through the spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book I've read but it comes close","review":"The mystery for me was not in the book but in the question, how did it become a bestseller? The writing was amateurish, the story line almost non existent, the time line confusing and the descriptions too lengthy. Where was the editor? Drakula must have sucked the blood out of the main characters about whom I cared not a whit. Any number of writers, without Ms. Kolstova's good fortune in having such dribble published, could give her lessons in good dialogue. Heaven knows she's needs them. Yes, some of the history and local customs of Rumania and Bulgaria were interesting but I could have gained more info on these subjects in a non-fiction, probably better written book. Editing down to 200 - 250 pages might have made a better, more exciting book but 642 pages are 400 too many. I'm glad I borrowed it from a library rather than wasting my $'s on this disappointing work. Sorry, Miss Kostova."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring, and repetitive","review":"The same formula repeated over and over and over with forced coincidences that go nowhere. 100% disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"650 pages of nothing but boredom","review":"i really wanted this one to be good, as i am a big dracula fan. unfortunately this one never got going in the slightest. no plot, not much of anything really. the great impaler shows up for a forgettable cameo in this forgettable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dense","review":"Look, I'm a sucker for a good historical mystery, especially one with what sounds like an awesome plot. However, this book is so drawn out, getting through the plodding writing makes it an impossible chore to get to the exciting bits. Everytime she would get to something resembling a plot, the author had to draaaaag it out. If I wanted 3 seconds of advancement in the plot for every hour of reading time, I'd go watch Lost. If you can stick with it and actually discover the ending to the plot, good luck to you. Me, I had to bale out after 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't finish it","review":"First a caveat: I did not finish this book. Normally, I'll give a book at least a hundred pages to hook me before giving up on it. In this case, because I really wanted to like \\"The Historian,\\" I gave it almost two hundred pages before giving up. Eventually the slow pace, the coincidences, and the so-so writing style just piled up too high, and I put it back on the shelf. The novel's premise sounded great, but the author just didn't deliver, at least not enough to engage me enough to read the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED!!","review":"This book started out with so much potential! I was hooked....until she NEVER stopped describing scenery and never allowed anything of real substance to ever happen. What is the plot???...BORING!!!! So, overrated!!!! If you love lots of detail....this is the book for you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding","review":"I never finished this book, so I can't offer an opinion on the whole thing. I normally fly through novels, but it took me about 20 tries to get through the first 200 pages of this one because I kept falling asleep. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over and over, and every time the main character spoke, I pictured Will Ferrell's overly affected professor character from SNL...\\"My LUVah and I were in the back of my SuBARu...\\" It was painfully dry and moderately annoying. The ladies of my book club loved the story, so I wish I could have made it to the meat of it. I guess medieval history and Dracula just aren't my thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging - Well worth your time","review":"I was daunted at first by the shear length of the book, but quickly became engrossed with the story. Ms. Kostovo knows how to pull you in... Most of the book is told through letters written by a diplomat to his daughter, explaining their family's strange history. In it, the reader also enters the worlds of Istanbul/Constantinople, Budapest, Bulgaria, Wallachia and Transylvania (Romania today) -- areas at war with the Ottoman Empire during the reign of the real Dracula, Vlad the Impaler. With this history, the author mixes in clever clues based on iconic church images that direct the diplomat and his daughter in their search for the tomb of this tyrant. Unlike many novels that successfully weave a tale of suspense only to disappoint the reader with a unsatisfying conclusion (Da Vinci Code, for example), the ending of this story is worth the time it takes to get there. If you don't like history, you won't like this book. If you do, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"All I read are historical suspense novels, so when I came across this book I was interested. WhenI read the book jacket and Dracula and vampires were mentioned, I almost didn't buy this book. I don't read horror novels, and wasn't about to start. Still, the reviews were good, and the historical part of the novel intrigued me. Wow, I couldn't put this book down. It is never dull and boring, but moves right along. I have to admit that I learned a lot about the Ottoman Empire, but she teaches us in a fun way. Never academic-like.The Dracula side of the novel, I actually found very interesting. I never knew the real Dracula. The author's story telling ability is excellent, and I honestly had a few night's sleep slightly disrupted by her great story. If you love historical suspense novels, don't let the Dracula factor stop you from buying this book. I'm in no way a fan of vampire books, but I really loved this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no \\"bite\\" here - just history","review":"I echo the remarks of a recent reviewer - up to about mid-point of the book it keeps my attention with action and what is next. At about 300 pages it turns into a complete history lesson. From the description of the book, I thought there would be more interaction with the vampire world. I skimmed the last half of the book and was disappointed. The only part of Dracula is the legend and historical references. For those who like more \\"spooky\\" to their stories, this doesn't deliver. This book is more for those who like highly detailed history and legends."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring.","review":"I don't recommend this book to anyone except Dracula fans. The writing is so ridiculously coy and transparent (\\"I must pause here, brave reader. I cannot bring myself to write anymore for the moment.\\") Give me a break. All of this wouldn't be so bad if the writer actually delivered on her attempts to build suspense (which she doesn't). I read constantly but I don't usually write reviews. However, the hype made for this book has been so overly inflated that I had to say something."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooorrrring","review":"I was so disappointed with this book after all the hype and publicity the author received from varying reviews as the Costco Magazine to NY Times Book Review.I found the multi-layers of characters and time changes distracting...I sometimes lost track of who was telling the tale.I didn't feel empathy for any of the characters - they all seemed cold and remote.I disgarded my rule of \\"if you're not hooked in 50 pages - forget it!\\" and plowed through the 500 plus pages - sometimes leaving the book for days without any urge to pick up the story again."},{"rating":"1","title":"slap me when it's over","review":"this is a boring read for me. too much revelry in describing everything and i mean everything. no shortage of new characters. they come and go one after another. i just wanted to get to Dracula! pacing leaves a lot to be desired. mid-read, i skipped pages when there's no action going on (believe me, still describing and describing....on and on and on....) and headed for the climax. guess what? did not miss a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I knew then what I know now...","review":"I am half way through this long laborious read and can't give up now. Just because I am hooked on the plot and want to know how it all ends doesn't mean that this book is a good read. Where was the author's editor? This book could have been cut in half, which would have resulted in a much more quick paced experience. There are two different stories going on here (or is it 3), both of which are written in the first person...I think. At some points I found it hard to follow the switching back and forth between the stories. The plot involves to many coincidences and I womnder why the vampire(s) just didn't kill all the people snooping into his/their \\"life\\". All I can say is I hope the next 200 page investment is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Payoff was pretty good, but it was a slow trip","review":"By and large, this book was the very definition of a \\"slog\\". While there is no denying that it takes talent to interweave this many overlapping stories for over 642 pages without tripping over one's own feet, the fact that it was done primarily via letters written by the characters began to wear quite heavily on my patience. In fact, by about page 400, I could no longer feel my feet. Fortunately, at about page 500 or so, the climax of the book finally (and not without some page-turning tension) comes into view. Look, technically this novel is mighty fine. I just tend to need a bit more juice along the way. If you're looking for page-by-page, white-knuckle terror, skip this. Or, just read the flap, then turn to page 500 & read a spooky 142-page thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, poor pacing/storytelling","review":"I like the idea of this book, but Kostova really needed a better editor. I understand what she was going for, but there were many parts of the book that sacrificed storytelling for atmosphere, and storytelling for dissertations on monks and sultans. Also, all of the love stories in the novel are really trite and forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"while the author has an amazing style in her prose, the storyline is dragged for most of the book. this book really needed to be edited and the fact was it was not. About half of the text could have been cut, leaving the storyline, which has a horrible, very dissappointing ending.forget this one!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"All filler and no bite. Small amount of suspense in the last ten pages or so, but if you are expecting something to \\"happen,\\" get something else. This is a historical detective novel. It has very little to do with vampires. I'm glad it was a gift; I'd have been upset if I had paid money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Evocative Read","review":"Enjoyable read. Much historical detail and good character development. Probably could have used editing down a tad, but it was one of those books that takes you to a different world.One gripe: Kostova's resturant sceene(s) with one protagonist about to tell the other the big secret -- I'm won't give it away -- was repeated far too many times.Read this about a year ago and recommended it highly to anyone who likes the spate of Templar Books, The DaVinci Code, The Book of Four, Anne Rice's offerings and such. Umberto Eco's Name of the Rose is probably the grandday of this kind of atmospheric book with codes, archives, reasearch, hidden/gnostic knowledge. That Kostaova sustained this for 700 pages is no mean feat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pedestrian Scenic Tour of Southeast Europe","review":"This would be an excellent vehicle with which to teach a college-level course in expository/descriptive writing.It is overloaded with scene description,however well done.Consider it a hardcover edition of a \\"James Fitzpatrick Travelogue\\"Not much of a detective story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"The book started off brightly, keeping me engrossed although somehow its plot promises always seemed to fall short. The biggest disappointment came at the end, however. After building up such an impressive and menacing evil presence, it all ends with a clumsy attempt at a football tackle and a gunshot? And that's how DRACULA, the great evil throughout 500 years dies? Silly, if anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book","review":"I am an avid reader of books of all genres, and this book is one of the few that I would not recommend to many people. The basic plot line was mildly interesting, but the character development left a great deal to be desired. I really tried to give this book a chance, but in the end I had to force myself to finish reading more out of a sense of accomplishment than any real connection to the story or the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickens Does Europe","review":"Well, this is the Waterworld of books. Awful. Set in 1970's Europe, wooden characters who talk like they stepped out of Dickens travel around Europe seeking each other and Dracula. Although Ms. Kostova uses Stoker's method of telling the tale through letters and diaries, she creates no sense of suspense, let alone dread or horror.Maybe if this was the last book on the planet and I knew I was going to spend twenty years by myself on a desert island, I might read it again. I cannot imagine the movie. Maybe it's a return to silent films?"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"read other reviews for more detail but the simple fact is that this is one of the most boring books i have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dull","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I had to force myself to finish reading it, and ended up skimming at the end. It was too bogged down in extraneous details that the story line itself was all but lost. And there is no character development to speak of. I've never cared less about any literary characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature This Isn't","review":"Literature this isn't. (I put it down twice as \\"unable to finish\\") No discernable plot. Rather paste board characters. No real action. Part travelogue (Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania in the 1930s-70), part mystery (do vampires still live?), part romance it's simply too long, too convoluted (multiple narrators) and, frankly, somewhat immature. I thought it needed several applications of an editor's red pencil and better judgment and was surprised Little Brown published it; but I guess they knew what they were doing because it has been a big hit. As this is written I note Ms Kostova has a new novel just out and I wish her well. Just hope she's learned to write with greater brevity and better story telling skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the abridgement is a yawner; narrative ooze rather than drive","review":"You might like this if you did not know that Muslims and Christians fought for centuries through the Balkans. But you would also need to be fascinated by silly characters plodding towards a nothing climax.No matter how much the publisher hypes this book it amounts to faux literature and fizzled pulp."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak writing, weak history lesson","review":"On the bright side, I did not spend money on this book, it was given to me as a present. The writing is really poor, and one cringes at some of the dialogues. The characters have no depth and the story relies on too many coincidences to make sense. Peppered with Eastern European names and expressions, the book is nonetheless little researched in depth, and while the author might know some Slavic languages, she is not really familiar with Romanian or Hungarian. These are, still, forgivable sins. The main problem is that the book is boring. While Angels and Demons, which is the closest I came to this genre, is fast paced and entertaining, the Historian crawls at a painful pace, beating the long dead horse of the Vlad Tepes, the vampire. Nothing original there. I am reading right now the Queen of the South, by the guy who wrote the Club Dumas, and these are books are truly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's horrible!!","review":"Actually the first quarter is okay, and then it just drags.I began to wonder why every single character acted like a historian. Probably because she did too much research for her own good and she needed to include really random details - like how coffee came to Budapest.She actually drops the narrator as a character halfway through the book only to show her in the middle of France on a farm having her first sexual experience. What the heck?By the time they actually get to Dracula I didn't even care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major hype=one deadly dull vampire tale","review":"It started out with promise, and with all those fantastic reviews, how could anyone not enjoy this book? ...I'm now heartened to read that many other reviewers found this book tedious and horrendously edited, with wooden, indistinguishable characters and zero payoff for slogging through Ms. Kostova's pedantic goulash. I literally contemplated putting the book down for good at the childishly-described \\"climax\\" nearing page 600, but forced myself on, wagering there must be SOME pay off...well, I'm going to go ahead and ruin the ending for you just in case you too are wondering if the next 300 pages will be worth the effort: Don't bother! There are no cool twists or big surprises. It's all just one big, fat, boring tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better read than heard","review":"When I read The Historian, I thought it was fantastic. I loved the mystery and the chasing back in time and the vampire element. But when I bought the audio version, I realized that the writing wasn't really very good. I've found this to be the case with a lot of modern novels. They are page-turners that can keep you up all night but when you hear them read out loud, the writing seems mediocre and clunky compared to, say, Dickens. After several disappointments, I have given up on listening to thrillers. I recommend LibriVox and Dickens. Free and satisfying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova","review":"I love making my purchases from Amazon the service is fast and dependable.

A man searches for his Professor and his wife, who he believed were dead. Each search happens in a different time and place, but each storyline blends and intertwines to form a cohesive tale involving the very evil Vlad (AKA Dracula, the Conqueror or Vlad the Impaler). As each sets out on their journey to discover the truth, they eventually tell us a little about Vlad lure and history, all revealed thru letters and flashbacks.I will not say that \\"The Historian\\" was the most engrossing vampire read, but it was definitely not the worse. I thought the imagery and attempt at suspense building was ok, but it wasn't \\"can't put it down good\\"..instead it was definitely a slow, methodical process to reveal a truth that you always knew or suspected. If you need something historical, with a slight twist on the vamp theme (Dracula wants a library), then you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling \\"sequel\\" to the original tale","review":"I'm old school: when it comes to vamps, you just can't beat Dracula. With The Historian, Kostava embarks on a journey that brings both new historical and fantasy interpretations of the vamp daddy himself. She takes us on a globe-trotting adventure that has spanned generations, following the legacy of one family's search for answers behind a mysterious book. WHile the book was a little confusing and slow in the beginning, once it picked up, it REALLY picked up. I could not put this bad boy down! Kostova weaves a fascinating story, shining new light on vampire lore. I LOVED that she followed (in a sense) the original form of Brom Stoker's classic--the novel is comprised of letters and journal entries from various characters entangled in this search for truth, loved ones, and Dracula himself. Brilliant! A highly recommended for anyone who loves historical fiction with a twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"So long and boring","review":"This book was recommended to me by a good, trusted friend. It is the worst book I have read in ages. It was very long without enough story to fill its abundant pages. I finished it--though, I'll admit to having skimmed the last hundred pages. I was so relieved when it was over--not the right feeling to have when you've just read a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but too much padding","review":"I bought this book because I love history and the premise caught my imagination. I'm not a vampire story reader and this story didn't hit you over the head with that. It is just a part of the total story. I love the use of the different perspectives, the story told through people and time, I just couldn't get past the wordiness of the whole thing.I have no problem with long books,I am a big fan of Edward Rutherford but the story was just too descriptive places for my taste.I rarely give up on a book, I want to give them every chance to win me over, to seduce me into finishing the story.However I only got about 25 % through and had to stop. I may go back to it but it just became burdensome to plow through the \\"color\\" to get to the story. Frankly I started to skip and skim and that is a bad sign.Maybe I will go back to it and find out the who and where of the mystery but for now I will let it RIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who was telling the story?","review":"The book is written in the first person, done by the daughter AND father, one never knows which one is doing the telling.

I don't think there was any suspense at all, it was more like a geography narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god how I hated this book","review":"My husband complains that I go through too many books too fast.

He loved this book for me because it took me 3 months to read.(normally it takes a few days, and I like them long) Oh how I dreaded each night ( my normal reading time ) reading this awful horrible book. I liked the first chapter and then it just fell into a history lesson with the worst cast of charactors you could imagine. I drudged through this book like so many others, hoping wishing it would get better, it never did. If anything it just got worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"The next Da Vinci Code? Oh, puh-leese!!","review":"I bought this book after much media hype - in fact, I pre-ordered it. Touted to be the next Da Vinci Code, the book promises to be a compelling search for Dracula himself. It was more like a historic travelogue about the Eastern Bloc. The research must have been painstaking, but the final product - this book - has been categorized wrong. It should have been categorized under Ancient/Historic Eastern Europe. The Count, in this book, was reduced to being a mere portrait, a collector of books in search of a librarian!People who are thinking of buying this book as an equal to The Da Vinci Code, please don't. If you are a historian or a history student or even an architecture major, buy it - not otherwise.Sorry, Ms Kostova, but the media hype around your book was completely misplaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"the historian","review":"I will be short. If anyone out there is fascinated by a history in general read this book.I felt like I lived it.I can not say I am 100% sure it is all accurate , it is a fiction in the end but it has to have a lot of a true research in it that real reader always appreciates in the end.Thanks to the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"I thought this book was VERY well paced, and suspenseful. I could hardly put it down, and I always looked forward to picking it up again. That said, the END was HORRIBLY dissappointing (without giving it away). I was not satisfied and left asking if everything had been built to nothing. Overall, the writing is superb, the story is delicious, but it will only torture and tease you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"It started out slow but once you got into it was a great read! Don't let the size of the book intimidate you. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the non-Vlad aficionados","review":"My horror/dracula focused sister recommended the book & I started reading it to appease her. To my utter delight I find Ms. Kostova a remarkable author. The pace of the book is consistent & her attention to detail rewarding. I enjoyed this book so much that I bought Ms. Kostova's 2nd book, \\"The Swan Thieves,\\" as soon as it was released. If you enjoy intricate, carfeully developed plots nurtured with attention, try this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!\`","review":"I am absolutely in love with this book!!!! The way the story flowed was great. I have listened to the audio-book and read the book and now am going to read the book again... definitely a keeper!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated! Stay away from this book!","review":"This a very promising book, heavily advertised and positively reviewed in respected journals/magazines. I rushed to get a copy but after a few pages felt as a victim of a con trick. There is nothing here, the plot is illogical, the book poorly edited, too long, there is no suspense or interesting characters. The general feeling is that someone liked the DaVinci code and decided to write one on Dracula. But this book is not even close to the quality of the Code."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to do this","review":"I hate to do this! That is write a bad review and put the book down before finishing and move on to another book. But I am doing it with the Historian. It is boring. I am more than 200 pages in to it and it has not grabbed me. Tuesday I have a long flight from Boston to Vegas. I need a book that will hold my attention as I sit in the giant steel tube at 30,000 feet for a ponderous 5 hour flight. The Historian is equally ponderous. How many times can the main characters run from library to library reading about Dracula. Reading the Historian is reading about a bunch of people reading about Dracula. Additionally it lacks the slighest bit of humor. The main characters the little girl and her wimpy father are boring. The father should be brought up on child endangerment charges. The author should be brought up on reader endangerment charges as she has put my lifelong love of books in danger.Rent the 1931 Bela Lugosi classic film Dracula. It is more fun and scary than the Historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you make a vampire book boring???","review":"Kostova has done the impossible--she's managed to make a vampire book that'll put you to sleep. Her research is remarkable, however, her narrative abilities fall far short. The tale progresses at a herky-jerky pace which does not mirror the story line--i.e., Oh no! There's a vampire! He's going to kill us! Lets...sit...down...and...read...a...book...and...talk...about it...for two...hundred...pages...I plowed through several hundred pages, hoping that the forgettable, lackluster characters would actually do something worthwhile. I should've reread Bram Stoker's classic instead.All in all, Kostova is like an aged scholar--quick to show off her prodigious learning, while the entire class drools upon their desks in sheer boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine debut","review":"Highly recommended. The few minor things that were bothersome:1. The slow pace is perfect for building suspense, but once things start happening, the pace should have quickened considerably. About 50 fewer pages would have been perfect.2. Too many of the early chapters end with astounding revelations. They just don't feel so astounding when they pop up so often.3. The author has a few favorite words and phrases that get overused.I blame none of this on the author, she just needed a more attentive editor. For a first novel, it's excellent.For another book with subtle atmospheric horror (and, like The Historian, European settings) check out Gothic Wine, by Darren Speegle, the best such book I've read since . . . well, Edgar Allen Poe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written","review":"I couldn't make it past the first hundred pages. The writing is very clunky. It reads as if she were writing with a thesaurus in hand. So many of her word choices, especially her adjectives, are just not quite right. It's as if she doesn't 'quite' know what the words mean, and is trying to sound literary. And the conceit of presenting overly-complicated prose as if it were a story told by a father to a daughter, or in a letter, just doesn't work. No one talks to someone else as if they were the narrator of a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Kindle Read!","review":"I really liked this book! This book is very rich in beautiful words, loving descriptions, and relationships. \\"The Historian\\" views Dracula as a historic person (which he was) instead of a modern cultish figure. The crux of the story is not about Dracula sucking blood, but of finding Dracula's burial place. My only complaint with this book is that it took the author 710 pages to tell the story and get to the climax, bu shet wound the story up abruptly in 10 pages. I felt the ending was rushed and not compatible with the very methodical, much more detailed rest of the book. P.S. This was the first book I read on my Kindle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea Poorly Executed","review":"What a great idea!! Dracula is alive in 'real time'. None of this 14th Century stuff, what's he like NOW. Unfortunately, he was in the such an icredibly brief time, like 3 pages, and you have to plow thru so much to get there, I felt cheated. I was really looking forward to the meeting with Dracula, what a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed a good editor...","review":"I wanted to like this book but found it impossible. The story was dry, the characters boring, and it was wordy without saying much. It could only have been improved by some judicious editing, maybe 300 pages worth. As a reader who has enjoyed everything from Dickens to the DaVinci Code, I found \\"The Historian\\" to be another highly touted book that fails miserably to live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"So you know what you're getting into...","review":"I wouldn't normally go out of my way to critique a book, but this one is so long, I think it only fair to warn readers of what they will get for their investment. Kostova obviously put a lot of work into this novel and tried to be ambitious. But it is not particularly well written nor gripping. The character's motivations are implausible -- particularly when Helen gets her say. I worked my way through, hoping after page 300 for a payoff on the time I had already spent. Unfortunately, I never found it. If you want an idle read, this is fine. If you're looking for a great book, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"I dont understand what all the hype is about. I found the book fairly tedious and stilted because it is just too long. At times the author was able to produce some suspense but there is too much unnecessary description which made it hard to get into the two parallel stories which take place a generation apart of a professor and his student which at times held my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Predictable.","review":"Kostova's debut novel slides into the history of the infamous Dracula. She certainly proves that her skill at research is commendable and her writing style is original. However, the book is too long to thoroughly enjoy. The story is easy to follow because it is utterly predictable. The novel's narrator is hauntingly similar to the woman in The Da Vinci Code. The reader will feel as though they have read the book once before or at least seen too many trailors for the movie. Kostova reportedly received a $2 million dollar advance for the book which is why the huge hardcover sits at the front of every bookstore in a large display area. It may make a decent movie, but did not make the cut for this summer's must reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Suspense?","review":"Bland, slow, incredibly long story about a global search for Dracula, who is seemingly undead and well in the 20th century. One would think that the topic alone would be sufficient to create suspense, but it didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just could not wrap my head around this one...","review":"Ok so the book is 642 pages (hardback). I expected this book to be thrilling with Vlad facts but After 100-150 pages I had to set it aside... I was bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Dracula this book just goes on without end","review":"This book starts out well and has its moments when something interesting actually happens, but the story quickly gets bogged down. Most of the time you have little idea who is talking, what they are talking about, where they are or who the various characters are. Despite the viscosity of the text I decided to just push through to the end. Two months later Dracula is dead. Or is he? Who cares? I was just happy the story was over! On the plus side you will learn some interesting history of the centuries long battle between the Ottoman Empire and Eastern Kingdoms. My recommendation - save your reading time and the whopping $4 this book will cost you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book, The ending BLOWS!","review":"700 pages of fabulous mystery, history and a love story all combined. The last 4 pages and the ending are a complete let down, I actually thought I was missing some pages. I am soooo disappointed with the ending, that I gave all my attention to reading this book and to be let down by some non-sensical ending really frosted my cookies. Ms. Kostova, you need an epilogue to your epiloge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"World Travels with Vlad","review":"I felt like I travelled the world as I read this book. I went to France and to Hungary, to Romania, to England, to Brussels, and more. I am so in love with this book - I cannot say enough. I am not a vampire novel fanatic, but this is something I never expected. If you like books about books, academic fiction, historical fiction, suspense, romance, intrigue; if you enjoy beautiful writing and staying up all night because you can't put the book down, well then you will like this tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hidden Gem","review":"This was a \\"Hidden Gem\\" of a book. My wife told me to read it after she finished it. Most of my time reading this book was during our vacation all over Italy. It was a very easy read and EXTREMELY interesting. There was never a dull moment and I would highly recommend The Historian to other readers. This was the first novel of this genre that I've read and I happy to say that I eagerly await another story of it's kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal without any kind of reward","review":"I don't mind longish books in the least and I LOVE the vampire genre. I thought this would be fascinating, and somewhat different. Well, it was neither, really. The book is bogged down with so much information, but it doesn't really do anything. It is very boring and tedious and I wanted to actually stop reading forever. But I read somwhere that it rewards the reader at the end. Right. Ok. I must have missed my reward then because I couldn't guess the climax if my life depended on it. Well, I'm joking of course but, literally it was the most boring pointless ending to an already pointless book. I saw no redeaming qualities about this book whatsoever. I admit some points were interesting, but that is because I like the genre. But as a book, it failed to capture my interest or attention. I am actually surprised I finished it. It has never taken me so long to finish a book before, ever. And what a waste it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book, It just didn't happen","review":"The book started off well enough. I told my wife it had \\"promise\\". But it became a chore to read. She flashed between herself and her father and between an old father and a young father and a young girl and woman that I spend most of my time trying to decide from what point of view the story was being told. Could have been a good one but ultimately it fell on its face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the characters, and the writing style of this book. You don't have to be into Dracula and vampires to enjoy this cleverly laid-out novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Journey...anticlimatic end","review":"I loved this book. I thought is was a beautiful journey through past and presend Europe. The story was twisted and insightful. Sadly the ending, for me, was anticlimatic. Maybe I didn't understand it well, but I was expecting much more considering the genius of the earlier parts of the book. I would still recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"The story line is interesting but I found the book to be a bit slow paced. There is also too much and too repeatative history of the Ottoman Empire and Transylvania. I had to put it down every few days to read something more exciting then return to a few more chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I wonder...","review":"The first vampire novel I've read in years. Yet I wonder about the Prince-Vlad III Dracula. Why did his father send him to the Sultan's court; was Prince Vlad evil-or a warrior? He made peace with the man responsible for his father's death. Why? What motivated him to take up arms against the Turk- to hurl the vile Sultan Mehmed out of Wallachia? What was his first wife truly like, did he love her-did he weep when she perished? What pulsed through his veins as he fought tirelessly for his realm, his honor-his people? Why did King Matthias Corvinus betray him? And who killed him? That would be a novel I would like to read. And one that is coming, my friends, doubt that not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in years","review":"I read this book a year ago, and I have been searching for an equally good read ever since, sadly without success. I was totally enthralled from the first page to the last. I enjoy historical fiction and historical mysteries, both cravings that this novel satisfied. I do not usually like fantasy/supernatural/horror stories, but Kostova incorporates the vampire theme so deftly that I didn't need to suspend my disbelief for even a moment. The writing is mesmerizing, the characters feel like flesh-and-blood people, and the descriptions of Prague and Humgarian villages made me feel like I'd been there. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. I hope Kostova publishes another novel soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and spineless","review":"The premise is promising, and I had great hopes as I started this book, but found it hard to stay engaged after page 200. Every character in the book has the same voice and cadence, and it gets dull very quickly. The father, the daughter, friends they find along the way, everyone speaks in a spineless, verbose style, making the entire book 'soft'. Frankly, I've given up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of description","review":"I'm enjoying the book although it's slow reading (I'm a slow reader anyway). Lots of description and interesting facts about the subject -- Dracula"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical vampire story","review":"700 pages and I was sad to read the last one. This is a beautifully written book, part travelogue, part mystery. It is written in first person from the standpoint of 4 characters...some from letters and some from diary excerpts. I enjoyed my armchair travels though what remains of Medieval Europe...always looking for the next clue with a wary eye looking backwards to see who or what might be following. The author does a good job of tying up loose ends but sometime this ends up as being trite. I think it is difficult, in this day and age where so much has happened, to write about things that a supremely evil w/o being trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Men are described as women","review":"I know it's hard to write how men are different from women. Maybe the writer tried to show us how all of us are equal. BUT - based on stereotypes - I could say the men on this book (Paul manly) have the behaviour of women (shyness, love for details and convoluted dialogs instead of action and pragmatism). It is like the writer was trying to project herself on the characters and have portrayed womanish traits on men. Maybe she is right and in the real world there are no differences between men and women, but absolutely the characters sound wrong in the literary world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"One of the very few books I never finished. I read over 450 pages and this book was going no where. Very repetitive decribing places and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it...","review":"Which I did not want to, because I love books on vampires. But this was a bad book. It is way too long, too boring and too hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book sucked (yup, that's a pun)","review":"How did this monotonous, annoying book get published?Horror? you're joking! If this author is as verbose speaking as she is writing, I feel sorry for her friends. I had read so many glowing reviews that I kept thinking that the story has to get better, faster, more interesting somewhere along the line. Nope. After reading 646 of the 656 pages, it finely got kinda interesting. I was annoyed with myself for bothering to finish it. What a waste of my time. If you decide to read this, be prepared for a long slog thru a vastly over rated book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah Lit","review":"This novel is tarted up pseudo-lit for those who need to be seen with such a tome. I much preferred John Twelve Hawks' THE TRAVELER, which makes no claims to be anything but what it is--a thrilling, rewarding and stimulating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"This book is incredibly long and incredibly boring. Could have been 300 pages shorter. I am the type of person who can finish a 350 page book in one day while attending school full-time and working part-time...so why have I been trying to read this book for almost a month now? Thank God I only paid $.99 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I ordered it because I saw an article on USA Today. The article didn't really say much about what the story was about and I was expecting something much different then what I read. I would get into the book so much that when I went to bed, I would dream about Dracula. I really got into the time period and geography of the book. Made me feel very lucky to be living in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deus ex machina","review":"Disappointing. Although the book is well paced, easily readable and indeed, does have a tremendous historical information centered around historical eastern Europe, as a reader, I just cant get over the ending. After 642 pages, a more well reasoned ending should have been developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to it's repuation","review":"I saw a Dateline regarding this book and read the reviews here and bought this book. Was very disappointed. From a person who is seldom critical of books and rarely finds a bad one...this book ranks in w/ those few. It was slow to start...slow to end. After spending 350 pages worth of reading time, I vowed to finish this book...but have to say towards the end I was just skim reading to get the book over with and didn't really care about what happened to the characters, or Dracula, by the time the book dragged itself to the conclusion. This book is one I'm almost embarassed to display on my shelves. I've never written a customer review for anything..but wanted to caution those thinking of investing their precious time into this unfulfilling book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are We There Yet?","review":"Here is an author with a talent for setting the scene but an inability to get to the point. After six hundred plus pages, the action that unfolds is truly an anti-climax. Dracula is disposed of far too easily and Helen's tale of why she abandonded her loving husband and child makes little sense. Abandoning your family to do research to find Dracula to avenge your father's death is not a good enough reason to ruin your husband's life! A good editor would have cut this book by a hundred pages or more and given the story more focus. A vampire book should be sexy, romantic, violent, and this is really none of those things. The best I can say is that it stimlulates an interest in Byzantine history."},{"rating":"1","title":"And that's...the rest of the story","review":"If you think Paul Harvey commentaries are thrilling and suspenseful, then you'll love this book.If not, then the main plot twists are so obvious that by the time the protagonists figure them out you want to drive a stake through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's on first?","review":"This was probably the worst-written book I have ever read. The publisher, editor and author should be ashamed of themselves. I hear the author won a prize for best novel in-progress. Surely not this one. I dare anyone to tell me who's talking, in what city and from what decade. And do the characters ever stop eating? This was a better cookbook than a novel. If all references to food were taken out the book would be half the size and, hopefully, half the price. If I thought for one moment that my bookseller would refund my purchase price I would do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"what can I say? Eh.","review":"Interesting idea, lots of great sentences and turns of phrase, but the pace of the action was so...drawn...out, she just lost me. I thought the book could've benefitted from some aggressive cuts - get to the action faster please! Descriptions of the places the historian and her father traveled felt to me like they were there to demonstrate the author's facility with language, and not to drive the story. And that's just self-indulgent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring time waster","review":"As a big fan of Bram Stoker's Dracula and vampire books in general, I was excited to pick this book up and get reading. I plodded dutifully through nearly half of the book before giving up in disgust. Simply put, this was a gigantic waste of time. The characters are boring and their voices blend together in a way that makes it nearly impossible to distinguish one from the other. Don't waste your time, find something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Travelogue","review":"All the hype led me to believe this book would be as amusingly gripping as the Da Vinci Code -- not serious, but still a good story. I was wrong. It could be condensed by 300+ pages and be a much better read. I bought the hard-cover and started working on it. Working indeed; it's such hard slogging through interminable descriptions of countryside and atmosphere. There's really very little story here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Historian","review":"Amazing , wonderfull, easy to read and follow. Giving new twists to the old Vampire legend.

It was difficult to tell who was telling the story - original mystery girl or her father through his telling or obviously epic length notes. The abrupt ending was a severe disappointment and totally unbelievable.That's enough - save your money and follow others' advice - get it from the library if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I downloaded this by accident one day so I decided to read it.

I loved everything about this book. it has everything you are looking for. Vampires, romance, mystery, history and more. Granted it s long, but trust me it is worth it! I wish this could be turned into a movie. I do not know why this book was not on the bestseller list because it deserves a spot there. Read this book it deserves reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit slow but worth sticking it out","review":"this is very slow, and the problem is also that the charracters are not so intersting. Been trying to figure out why. I think it's because their emotional states tend to be shallow, no depth, no real fear or hate or love or joy. But the research is very good, the plot tends to carry the reader along. It's taking a while to finish it, put it aside for another book, will go back to it. It has very rioch textures of place, atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"Felt more like assigned reading for a class instead of enjoyable fiction. author is obviously highly educated which is good , history references are interesting and well researched.

I hate to start a book and not finish it, especially after shelling out $25.95 for a 2-week old NY Times #1 bestseller, but I was completely disengaged from this book. I tried, but I just could not get interested in the author's story. The premise sure sounded great and it looks as though it'll make someone a nice chunk of change, but it's not for me. If anyone wants a copy, let me know and I'll send it to you postage due."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad I Can't Rate it Zero Stars","review":"This has to be the most over-hyped piece of bad writing in a long while. The characters are unbelievably dull and naive, prone to coming to brilliant deductions 80 pages after the reader has figured it all out. Speaking of characters, there are too many of them who just fill up the pages and don't add to the story. I didn't think much of the vaunted research either. I'm no Dracula scholar, but I didn't read anything in this book that I hadn't come across in reviews of old Christopher Lee movies.The only good news in this is that it took Kostova 10 years to write the book. Maybe we'll have 10 years of peace before she finishes another one.

Enjoyed the book.

I barely managed to finish it but kept on to the end hoping for answers to the many holes and loose strings in the plot, which still remained unanswered on the last page. I don't understand why this book is so popular or so well received by the critics. I recommend avoiding it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chasing Dracula at the pace of grass growing","review":"Kostova is quite the stylist, but despite her exotic locales and the lure of vampire hunting, The Historian is incredibly over-worked. This sort of writing is the most tedious form of authorial conceit. The narrative is constantly being overwhelmed by Kostova's penchant for imparting excruciating amounts of detail. This is definitely an author who tells us more than we want, or need, to know. Imagine an oxen pulling a cart, plodding through the foothills of Transylvania and you've got a handle on the pace at which this novel unfolds. The Historian is, quite simply, not worth the time it took to read it. I would, however, heartily recommend this book to anyone who's serving a stretch in prison or someone who's confined to bed rest for about a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably dismal.","review":"I've only ever thrown away two books in my life before. This will be the third one! I just wasted four evenings of my life reading this awful thing. It's dull, long-winded but saying not much of anything, with dismal characters that you just want to slap. This whole 800-odd page book (I have the paperback) leads you to the last 20 or so pages where the researchers finally find Dracula. Dracula isn't frightening, he's old, uninteresting and smelly. If this is what an MFA teaches you to write I'm glad I don't have one. And what was a literary board thinking when this author was given an award for a novel-in-progress?Worst dreck I've ever read. Seriously. And to the author, GET AN EDITOR, pleeeeaaase."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORDY!","review":"I have never read a book so \\"wordy\\" in my life. The story seemed so promising but it just got bogged down in descriptions. We read this story for my book club and the general consensus was that the book was just too wordy. We liked a lot of the characters but their personalities seemed to get lost in the background descriptions. I was hoping for a much more entertaining and thought provoking story. I am glad I was able to sell it used the day after I finished it since it is a book that I wouldn't ever opt to read again!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dryer than dry. Don't waste your time!","review":"I cannot believe that Publisher's weekly starred this book, and cannot help wondering how much they were influenced by the Publishers. I definitely was not bitten; rather I had a hard time forcing myself to read to the end.I am in total agreement with D.G from Boston. This thing reads like a dissertation-duller than dull. Even the vampires don't pick up the pace. I'm a fast reader, but this took me two weeks and I had to force myself. I only finished it because our book club was thinking of doing it-not any more.If the publishers or author hoped to have a second 'Da Vinci Code', they didn't even come close. All I can say is the author does good research-and wants us to know it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Brown meets Dracula","review":"This book is simply Dan Brown meets Dracula, without the tight writing of Dan Brown. Historian was in need of a good editor to discipline a first novel! I finished it simply because I can't simply abandon a book (a defect in MY personality). I found myself on many occasions screaming out loud, FOR GOD'S SAKE GET TO THE BLOODY POINT!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent piece","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the journey it took me throughout history. I found myself constantly between the line of reality and fiction which isn't where I like to be too often, but Kostova insists that the reader enjoy it. She has certainly done her research and I loved learning about an era I didn't know much about. Don't be scared away from this if you're not a fan of the Medieval Era - this book will interest all readers! The book became a bit too wordy and detailed about 3/4 of the way through. I didn't mind the incessant details about the monks like many other reviewers, but I feel some things could've been cut out to achieve the same effect. Also, I wish Kostova would've delved deeper into the narrator's character a bit more; however, I enjoyed the plot line with her father. I definitely recommend this if you're looking for a mystery throughout history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Publishing Phenomenon","review":"What, yet another Dracula novel? I thought that this particular genre was owned by Anne Rice with no room for a newcommer. And besides that I thought that Harry Potter pretty much owned the rest of the mystical market. It's clear that I was wrong.Ms. Kostova has written a classic. It's not a small book, and the detail is tremendous. The book has about four stories going on at once. Still it's not that difficult to keep them straight, and of course they all come together in the end.I particularly liked her setting the main character as a sixteen year old girl beginning in 1972. The story is being told by her some thirty-six years later in 2008. As she said, she tells the story of those who survived, and those who did not.This is not a terribly bloodthirsty/gruesome novel, but the body count is certainly respectable. I hear that movie rights have been sold, this just may be the start of a new publishing phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not very clever....","review":"Let me start by saying the premise for the book is great, and it's the only reason it gets two stars instead of one. The problems it has are just too large to give it anything higher.First of all, it's not very clever. I was able to guess exactly what was going to happen hundreds of pages in advance. I just didn't see the twists and turns that other reviewers did.Second, the structure of the book was terrible. I didn't mind the idea that it was all told as a flashback, but there were several parts where the story was told as a flashback within a flashback within a flashback. It's almost like the author used this structure to cover up how simple the plot really was.Finally, much too much Deus Ex Machina. At one point the author uses the 'missing letters' excuse to avoid explaining how the parents got from America to Turkey. This kind of thing happens at waaaay too many crucial points of the story. I guess if you're not clever enough to explain it, Deus Ex Machina it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"Just too slow to grab my attention, I keep trying to get into the book but I just can't seem to find it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"It's written in the epistolary style of Bram Stoker's Dracula. 670+ pages. Women love it but it's unbelievably slow and by page 350 I no longer cared how the writer finished the book. Needs about 300 pages edited out of it. If you've been in an accident and are bed-ridden, this is the book that will help you sleep while you recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most verbose, boring book in the world","review":"I can't believe that a book about Dracula could be this mind-numbing dull. I was brutally forced to read it for a book group and can only say: I want those hours back. I can't believe anyone would fall for her contrived, silly plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I'm not gonna get into some eloquent dissertation. I read a lot of books of all kinds. For all the hype out there on this book, it was VERY disappointing. So LLLOOONNNGGG and drawn out. Not long in a good way like Colleen McCullough books. Long in a too-much-information that leads to a big downer of an ending in terms of excitement level way. Dracula is only in about 20 pages and what a let down. Half way I was wondering why this first time novelist hasn't been hacked down some by the publisher's editors. It did remind me of Anne Rice. You know, how sometimes, because Rice is so famous and her books make so much money, she just rambles on and you wish that her publishers would reign her in and edit her. Glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Lacked Compelling Characters Or Decisive Action","review":"The moment someone pulls a mysterious ancient book off the shelf you have got my attention but the story had better go somewhere meaningful. A novel in the vampire genre, no matter how well researched, cannot stand solely on the pretext of historical suppositions. As I sit here, without looking up at the synopsis, I cannot remember the name of the main character. Anything so easily forgotten is best forgotten. The structure of the story was built around dark, raining backgrounds and countless library backrooms followed up by the occasional tomb but it almost completely lacked compelling characters or decisive action. Kostova tried to set her work apart from previously written works, perhaps leaning more towards the Bram Stoker version than Interview With A Vampire. While I admire her spirit of depth, the story was sleepily written. Had I not been waiting for a revelation that never arrived, I would not have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah","review":"My eyes were reading the words, but my mind was hearing \\"blah blah blah blah blah.\\" How can there be any 5 star reviews for this book? This is the only book I have ever started but didn't finish. I tried really hard, but I was bored senseless. To describe this book in more detail, I would say melodramatic, lame, unbelievable, and so agonizingly boring. And it takes itself way too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was expecting an exciting story about vampire and vampire history. I could barely get through the first few chapters, it just rambled on and on, I got so bored, I didn't even want to skim through it. I ended up selling the book. I shouldn't really give it a one star because I didn't even finish reading it, so it might not be fair. BUT on the other hand I spent good money on this book and couldn't get through it shows me that it wasn't even worth the one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Story","review":"This was a very interesting and imaginative story almost on the level of local folklore. Who, of all the characters, is \\"the historian?\\" And who is the real hero? Given the way the story line of the book ended, it is eminently suitable for a sequel. I hope Ms. Kostova has a sequel planned for the not too distant future - to answer some of the open questions, and (purposely?)left out factual lacunae of the story that could easily become the seeds of the next book in this series. After all, the Eastern Orthodox Culture Hero looks from the parapet \\"as if all the world is before him.\\" Will he continue to do so?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Historical Fiction - Pleasurable Read","review":"Love the historical information weaved throughout this interesting and unique story. Elizabeth does a great job telling 3 different but related stories from multiple view points. This was a pleasure to read and kept me wanting more, she took my interests and imagination to unexplored territory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is losing me...","review":"I'm am not an experct literary critic by any means. All I can tell you is that this book is about 300 pages TOO LONG. I'm about 1/2 through the book and I don't think I have the attention span to finish it. I'm disappointed because I love the history of Dracula and vampires. I really want to know what happens in the end, but getting there seems impossible. Don't try this one if you are a slow reader like me :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but...","review":"This was a great story that was hard to put down, however towards the end the historical aspects got to be a bit lengthy and a tad boring. The story has three basic and easy to follow story lines that a equally compelling. But for the length of the book I think the end was rushed and came abruptly and slightly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"This book was horrible. I couldn't even get past the first 50 pages. I am not the type to easily give up on a book, but for this trash I made an exception. Poorly written and the premise is not even fathomable. Don't waste your time on this book where the hype has more power than the story itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me......?","review":"Never mind the fact that the book was boring (according to other reviewers)and poorly written. I couldn't get past the 60th page due to the fact that the print was so light and small. Someone skimped on the ink on this book. The pages I read were good though but after reading some of the other reviews I don't think I would continue even if I could see the words (and I'm not blind - just wear reading glasses!).I love to read too much and have too many other books on my list to waste my time!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome story!!","review":"This book grabs you from page one! The blend of fact and fiction is incredible. I am a hugh Dracula/vampire fan. It has become increasingly difficult to find good stories on this subject. The book blends perfectly the rich history (fact and fiction)of the Dracula legend without it becoming campy. I would reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read","review":"This one stands with the best. Move over Bram Stoker. The Historian will become a classic vampire thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Historian","review":"I purchased this book for my husband who is a huge fan of Dracula and vampire mysteries. He couldn't put it down and quickly passed it on to a brother to read. He raves about it and how complex the writing style is while covering two story lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was so excited for this book to come out. I thought it was going to be an action packed novel about a girl desperatley trying to find out about Dracula. Goodness was I wrong!!! This book reads like a history textbook about ancient europe. It is dull and boring. There is no juice, nothing that wants to make you go further. For all of the hype it received, it should have been a lot better. If she would have cut out about 300 pages, it could have been more interesting. I wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book published?","review":"I'm a writer. Even better, I'm a reader. This novel shouldn't have been published. It should've been tossed when she sent it to her agent.Someone said an abridged version would've been better. I agree. The middle 598 pages should be tossed, and the first and last pages kept.If you like the boring and the banal, buy this book. I'll give you my copy. If you like good books, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had so much to offer","review":"This book severely lacked substance, was way too long, was too slow, and was too back & forth for my liking. It constantly switches from first person, to third person, and it's very hard to follow. I was really disappointed, as it does really sound interesting, but is just too dense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"After trying to force myself to read this (mainly because I didn't want the money I spent to be a total loss), I've given up at approximately the half way mark.The success of this book speaks volumes to the effectiveness of marketing in place of quality.If you like boring first-person narrative with a lot of yak-yak-yak interspersed with the occasional appearance of a rather tame neck-biting librarian, this book is for you. I really wanted to like this book and am sorely disappointed as a result. If you must read it then get on the waiting list at your local library and save your money for something worth while. This book sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like it","review":"I usually read books in 2-5 days, it took me approximately 3 months to read this book. I liked the concept of the book and the historical information was very interesting. However, I did not like a single character in this book. The characters were way too sentimental and two-dimensional. Maybe its just me, but I would not risk my life and freedom to search for a missing doctorate advisor nor would any of my fellow graduate students. The author does not establish the relationship between student and the mentor rather we are told that he feels strongly about his mentor (told again and again) without telling us why. I know this seems like a weird thing to focus on but the whole plot is driven by the student's search for his mentor. I would have loved to read more about Constantinople and Eastern Europe during the Ottoman reign but instead I got pages and pages of corny characters reflecting about their feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very excited to purchase and read this book, however, once I did I was very disappointed. The book is very confusing constantly jumping from one character to another. I found myself wondering who was speaking - father or daughter. Also, I think this book of 600 and some pages could have been completed in say 350 pages. Very, very wordy. I do not think I would read another of this author's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I don't want to give much away . . .I didn't really expect to like this book, but just hoped to have a nice long read to keep me occupied. However, I ended up reading it in less than a week! It kept my mind racing at night thinking about what had happened to the characters and what I thought was going to happen. Absolutely one of my best reads of the summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped, overwritten - a Big Bore","review":"I am a quarter through the book and still there is little story, just endless description of places and long-winded letters written by a self-indulgent academic. The main characters are made of cardboard. Nothing in their heads (or any other part of their anatomy) except the research. What a waste of money - and trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled by a Talented Marketer","review":"Simply awful. A waste of time and paper, readers would be better served to read about Dracula's real life than to waste their time reading this dull bohemoth. I recommend Dracula, Prince of Many Faces; and In Search of Dracula: The History of Dracula and Vampires. All of Kostova's information about Dracula is obviously gleaned from books such as these and make up the only good part of the book. My advice: Skip the poorly written fiction and read what the editor should have cut Kostova's book down into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair comments","review":"Those reviews that advance the idea that this book was not properly edited are utterly unfair. It seems the original book detailed how the main character met by chance every single one of the destinataries of the 1454 other books printed by Dracula. That brought him to 145 countries in the world (it seems the chapters where he travels to Burkina Fasso were particularly riveting). The book had to be trimmed down from its original 50,000 pages to the mere 650 it contains today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea But...","review":"This book moved way too slow. Multiple narration better have some very interesting people doing the narrating.This Empress isn't wearing any clothes (however...from what I seen from Elizabeth Kostova photo, that wouldn't be a bad thing at all);-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!","review":"I have never bothered to post a review online, but after finishing The Historian and reading through several pages of reviews I felt compelled to. This is the worst book I have ever read. There are a couple that come close, but The Historian gets the nod due to its length. It is poorly written in the sense that the author lacks any ability to build suspense or tell a story (and it's a \\"thriller\\" about Dracula). Obviously a lot of people enjoyed it, and presumably not everyone who enjoyed it has universally bad taste in books, so I'm not sure what to tell you if you're considering reading it. If you're bored after the first 50 pages, RUN! You'll save hours of frustration in not only your life, but also for your spouse who has to listen to you complain every time you pick up the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, why did it take you so long?","review":"I have become more and more distrustful of publishers' abilities to pick books we want to read, and this book is a prime example. Is it just me, or have even usually solid writers like Michael Crichton run out of words? This author had, I guess, the opposite problem, which was not knowing when to quit. I finally did after about 120 pages as the main character pulled out her yawn-invoking, story-telling father once again. To the complainers I have to say this: What took you so long in figuring out this book was a massive waste of your time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even finish.","review":"I thought the writing was very good, but I had to give up on this book about a third of the way through. It was just too slow. I disliked the method of the narrator's father telling her bits and pieces of his story and then stopping for months at a time. Maybe one day I'll go back and finish it because everybody else seems to think it's wonderful, but I'd have to be awfully bored to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read about people reading","review":"I'm going to be quick here.This book is very very boring. If you read this book all the way to it's pathetic excuse for a \\"climax\\" you will be very angry at yourself.This is a book about people doing research. Most of it takes place in libraries. If you want to read about people reading,this book is for you. If you want to read about Dracula, read Bram Stocker. If you want to read about the history of Dracula, get yourself an encyclopaedia, it will be far more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Interesting but Very Tortourous","review":"I'll start out with the good points. This book takes a very interesting tour of 15th centruy European history. Very informative.....but not page turning. I along with other readers really felt like this book could have used some serious editing. When one is on page 500 of a 650 book and nothing really has occurred other than the examination of an ad nauseum list of ancient manusroipts... it becomes difficult to continue. I really struggled through the last 150 pages and the so called climax of the novel. (Which was very anticlimatic if you ask me). Interesting concept. Poorly executed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Sominex","review":"Chop 200 pp out of this tome and the result would be a shot at a good read. What we've got is an overblown treatis of a tired subject that proves that...when it comes to Dracula...there's nothing new under the sun...or would that be the moon?P.S.I'm using my copy as a doorstop."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Rolled Into One","review":"If you're looking to read a book with ingredients such as suspense, thriller, mystery and horror, then you will love The Historian.

I only stuck it out to the end in hopes that something...anything would happen. Save your money, buy some paint, put it on a wall and watch it dry and it will be more exciting and interesting than this book. How this book got on the bestseller list is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"East Meets West via Dracula legend","review":"I enjoyed this book during my evacuation from New Orleans during hurricane Katrina. The story is beautifully written and provided the reader with insight into the history of Muslim/Christian clash of cultures in eastern Europe. The story seemed to me a combination of a travel and horror story. The climax was exciting and scary. Kostova's Dracula is not a seductive romantic as found in so many recent vampire stories, but a true monster in keeping with the history of the real Vlad Tepes - Drakulya."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift Book was great!","review":"Book was on my daughter's wish list for a while. I took a chance buying used, but it was in excellent condition --just as described. It arrived on time, and I am very happy with the book and the service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"I cannot hope to improve upon the savvy review by Craig Kenneth Bryant, but also cannot resist the temptation to add my two cents (and lone star). I have read worse books, but find this one all the more inexcusable because it pretends to be so much more than it is. There is no wit to relieve this tedious, pointless, and seemingly endless travalogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aargh","review":"I second everything in Craig Kenneth Bryant's review. Thank goodness... after reading so many stellar reviews for this tedious book, I thought that I must be the crazy one. Yes, the quality of writing is better than say, Da Vinci Code, but it is overly long, with waaaay too much detail and description given to people and situations and rooms that are completely inconsequential. Who cares that a black spider was on Helen's back? Why do I care about every minute detail of every hotel room, unless it's going to advance the plot, or make some sort of point? And the so-called \\"coincidences\\" of meeting just the right people at just the right time... oofah.I love travel and I'm all for exploring dank and dusty cathedrals and monasteries, but for the love of Sveti Georgi, enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time.","review":"This book is truly a waste of time. I like me a page turning thriller with a hint of horror as much as the next guy, but the problem here was - this wasn't a page turner, and it wasn't scary.The Historian is just straight up bad. The plot plods along without purpose, and the characters are full of detail, but no heart. There are many ways to write a good novel. It can be focused on characters, on plot, or on ideas, but if you've got characters no one cares about, a plot that doesn't move, and no important ideas to speak of, well, your book is just not going to be any good.I am told years of research went into this, which probably explain the mind numbing cultural detail. Apparently, not only can you write about vampires and exotic locales in a totally tepid and uninteresting style, but you can also become a bestseller by doing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let anybody talk you into reading this book!","review":"If you thought the movie \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" was great you will love \\"The Historian\\". Otherwise don't let anybody talk you into either buying or reading this book. It is a story within a story within a story but the author does little to help you figure out which one is which. When the book finally gets to the meat of the coconut, around page 520, you may sit on the edge of your chair for a minute or two but then the book resumes the tedious drag that was the first 519 pages. If it did, indeed, take the author 10 years to write I think she spent most of that time thinking about how she could pen the most boring manuscript that the NY cocktail set would talk each other into buying! She is laughing all the way to the bank. Don't waste either your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Time","review":"Straight off - save yourself the time and don't bother reading this book. Kostova manages to take a subject as cool as Dracula and render it completely boring. In fact, because of the book's absurd length, reading it is like a chore.Worse, the characters you spend so much time with are as thin as the parchments they keep miraculously uncovering. Uh oh... did Kostova just lead the plot to a dead-end? No wait, we just found ANOTHER LETTER FILLED WITH MORE BEYOND-THE-GRAVE EXPOSITION!Reading this was about as much fun as doing your own scholarly research in a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger is NOT Better","review":"I finished reading this book and it was a chore. However not as much a chore as finishing Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell. Both books were over-hyped and made it to the New York Times Best Sellers list. The only good thing was that I borrowed The Historian instead of paying for Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just had to say","review":"I loved this book. If you are looking for an Anne Rice type book then this is NOT for you. This is a HISTORICAL FICTION. It has a lot of history which drew me into the book to begin with. And it entwines history, fantasy and reality so well that I almost wondered if it was a factual book instead of fiction.If you are NOT interested in history then yes it will have its slow moments. But the suspense and mystery of the book more then make up for it! There were times in the book when my heart would race or nearly stop out of suspense! I got so involved in the story that I would dream about it, and even think about it like it was really happening. If you like history, if you like the story of the real Dracula, if you like suspense and are not afraid of a more challenging read then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential, but needs an editor","review":"The Historian takes a potentially interesting plot and drags and drags it out until you just have to put the book down out of boredom. I agree with the other reviewers that this book badly needed better editing, as the action could have been truly fast paced and hooking and the flashbacks would not have been that confusing and dragged out. The ending is also a bit anticlimactic, as I, for one, was expecting a vampire and ended up with a librarian. At that point I wanted to throw the book across the room. After enduring looooong (but admittedly well-written) descriptions and travels covering half of Europe and multiple people, all we get is a librarian who is biting and scaring people in order to help him with his 'collection'. Ooookay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to live up to hype...ambitious but dull","review":"Touted as a smarter Davinci Code type novel blending fact and fiction in the search for Dracula this ambitious debut fails at entertainment and suspense.Lots of sightseeing as the plot meanders through Bulgaria to Romania stopping for tea and various tasty homemade meals along the way.The details are impeccable but the whole book is details all dryly trotted out.The tales of the characters related through flashbacks via many letters grows tedious.The drama finally surfaces somewhere around page 570 but you have to go through too much tedium to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, drudging, like a textbook","review":"First of all, I read a lot of historical fiction. I like long, complex historicals. The idea of reading a long book does not put me off.But this one did.I picked up this book hoping for a good gothic vampire story, something mysterious. This just isn't it. It is not written badly, it is just written like a drudging textbook. The narration is offputting- you are constantly tossed out of the story to switch narrators, so I could never get into it. The author felt the need to put in details that no one needs to know to have a good story. It is like someone narrating to you every single step they take in the morning before going to work. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG disappointment","review":"I fell for the hype! Shame on me!The first 100 or so pages make for a very promising start that does not deliver some 500 pages later.When I reached just under half way through the book I considered giving it away. Instead, decided to finish reading it despite my better judgement. I thought the book might \\"come back to life\\". I was wrong.The characters lack life :) .....or should I say the characters that were not members of the \\"living dead\\" have about as much personality as a zombie from a \\"B\\" movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great audiobook for a dark and stormy night","review":"I'd read the Historian a while back and recently had the chance to listen to the audiobook version. I enjoyed it immensely. A cast of actors was employed to voice the characters, most of whom were very good. Creepy music helped increase the drama at crucial points and eased transitions between chapters.While I still have problems with the abruptness of the book's ending the audiobook is superior to many other audiobooks out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing experience","review":"Oh, this book showed so much promise in the beginning, but then it ended extremely one-dimensional. It's not much of a vampire story, more like a story of unravelling a mystery. It could have been much better if it had not been stuck with needing to invent a contrived connection to both the historical Dracula and the vampire in Stoker's novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit of a snooze","review":"I'd have to agree with the reviewers here that found this book miserably slow. I first I kind of enjoyed ambling along with it, (the style is a sort of modded-up, Bram Stoker-ese), fully expecting it to get going at some point. But it really doesn't, at least not by 2/3rds of the way through, when I gave up on it (Drac had still not shown up). Because it's slow you also start to notice the annoying stylistic flourishes, the endless descriptions of journeys taken and meals eaten (the only stew in this book is on the table), and the fact you are once again confusing the three different first-person narrators in three different time-frames. If you're not a fan of big, slow novels, you probably should pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Contrived for its Own Good","review":"I started this book with high hopes and found myself very disappointed. The book could have easily been 200 pages shorter if the author and her editor had done some much needed cutting. Dracula doesn't show up until the very end and by that point I was so sick of all the characters, who are dropped in to move the plot along, that I really didn't care. I would have quit reading the book sooner, but it was a gift from my boss and I was afraid not to finish reading it. I don't know why this book got such great reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated. Doesn't live up to the hype.","review":"We're supposed to be impressed by the fact that the author spent many years researching this book. Well, that would have been impressive if this was a non fiction history book and not a novel. As it is, The Historian is one long and boring tirade of historical data that serves no purpose other than to bog down the bare bones plot and make this book twice as long as it should have been, a real editor was sorely needed.The story, regarding Dracula alive in the modern age seems to be an exciting premise, but believe me, it's been done before in many other novels and much better I might add. In fact Dracula himself makes only a brief appearance very late in the book.How this novel has become a best seller is beyond me. Perhaps it's because it's being compared to The DaVinci Code, but The Historian is nowhere near as fast paced or exciting as that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong Start Weak Finish.","review":"The first hundred to 150 pages are good. After that the book becomes plodding, dry, and academic. When I finished I did feel I had wasted a lot of time.I would recommend the first hundred or so pages for students in rhetoric classes as a modern example of good style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Impressed","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. From the beginning the writer mentions that these were true incidents from personal experiences and written documents/letters, that some of it was made up of what she \\"thought\\" had occurred. When she wrote that her father and Helen saw the professor grow fangs before their eyes and blood drip from his neck as he laid undead for weeks in a coffin , I knew this was all rubbish. Furthermore, she claimed all this was left in letters written by her father. Unbelievable ! She should have listed this a PURE FICTION, that is what it is. What a waste of 30.00 !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended...","review":"This page-turning thriller surrounds a young American girl who uncovers an ancient medieval book, in the heart of Amsterdam. She approaches her father about the book and, while offerng the utmost in honesty, he unwillingly reveals a rather disturbing story. Concerning his past, he lifts the lid on how Paul, her father\`s advisor, sought several answers to Dracular\`s controversy, believing he is still alive. He takes us on a voyage through his truimphs, defeats, upsets, betrayals, and barriers. Following the much-discussed story, the young girl finds herself thrust into the heart of investigation, as she sets out on her own mission, searching for answers and clues. Such twists and turns prove this novel to be an absolute classic, interspersed with emotion, suspense and mutiple surprises! You will find this novel extremely hard to put down, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I read it.","review":"Put a few color pictures in it, and you'd have the Fodor's guide to the Balkans. Lots of tourist spots and local history lovingly rendered, with plot thrown in as an inconvenient necessity. Conflict and character development are sacrificed in favor of detailed descriptions of hotel stays and lists of ammenities.Early criticism pegged the book as an attempt to intellectualize a pulpy immortality rag. These things generally don't work out as planned, and this book is no exception.From what I've seen of the author, she seems to be a decent enough person. If she ever decides to write a real travel guide, I'd probably buy it. Here's hoping she abandons fiction entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"I've had this book for 6 weeks now and can't get through it.

The storyline is good but the excessive detail is TOO much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historian Review","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a little long in the middle, but I read that this book was the culmination of 10 years of research, so I can see how it would be difficult to get in everything you want to. All in all, I loved the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"This is an intriguing story, rich with detail, about a young woman who confronts her father about his past and learns that the legendary character, Dracula, was not only a real person, but is still alive today. When her father disappears without a trace, she becomes determined to find him by following the clues left behind in a pile of mysterious letters he wrote. Followed by strangers seeking to stop her from revealing the secret she now possesses, her life is torn apart as she journeys through the wilds of Europe to Transylvania, the place that started it all.This is an author who knows what she's talking about. The details that are in this book are remarkable, although sometimes a bit lengthy. Not exactly a \\"light\\" read, this 642-page book is nonetheless entertaining and imaginative. The obvious research needed to complete it is impressive enough, but to have an incredible, riveting storyline as well makes it truly unique. A rare find, to be sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Take on an Old Legend","review":"Kostova's \\"The Historian\\" looks at the Dracula legend in a new and different way. I heard about this book on the Diane Rheim show and ordered it before the program was over! It lived up to its billing! Highly readable, it pays hommage to the original Bram Stoker novel in its style while still being relevant to today's readers. Memorable characters, effective suspense, up there with \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and \\"The Dante Club\\" as an a book for people looking for so much more than sex and violence! Thought-provoking and enchanting! We need more books like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, Blah, Blah","review":"Man, can this woman ever get to the point? 500 pages of endless droning and the story STILL goes nowhere!

As a rule I don't review novels on Amazon but THE HISTORIAN by Elizabeth Kostova is the best I have read in years. She creates a whole company of characters and you will like, or at least be interested in, and remember them all. If you like history, this is your novel. If you like mystery, this is your novel. If you like exotic locations and characters, well,,, you get the picture. When I recommended THE HISTORIAN to my mystery-loving wife she asked me if there was any suspense to the story. I told her that the suspense was such that I really hated to put it down. You will too from the first paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat story idea...way too long","review":"While I think the story of tracking down Dracula via clues in history and the cleaver idea that Dracula is alive and wants to protect his privacy, the author does not move the story along fast enough. The book could have been cut back by about 250 pages and would have been much better (it's over 600 pages long!).Also, for a story that describes so many interesting world places, the author never develops the knack for making the reader feel like they are at these places."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good book that needed a good editor","review":"Kostovo's \\"The Historian\\" is an excellent read that could have been whittled down by about 100 pages and still kept its shape. Even so, this is a promising entree into the realm of modern sleuths searching for historical secrets that may not be as dead (or undead) as they seem. Read this instead of the multitude of Templar novels that weigh down the shelves at local book stores!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Take on \\"The Impaler\\"","review":"I've heard this book compared to \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and I caution readers that the pace of this book is nowhere near the pace of Dan Brown's books (it's not even a Rule of Four pace). The characters in this book spend a lot of time in libraries and talking over meals sharing information on what they've uncovered. It doesn't mean that this is a dull book. It is a gripping thriller, but one that lossens its grip more than a couple of times. For me, I loved learning about the shift in power between the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires and the events of that period. The thrill of the \\"hunt\\" and the incremental discoveries that they go through was more than enough to take me through the 650 pages. Also, the Vlad Tepes that they do finally encounter is an interesting character, but I wished more pages were dedicated to him interacting with the other characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Yes, this book was very disappointing. The first third was sort of interesting, suspenseful and mysterious. But soon thereafter the author began spreading the cottage cheese across the pages in heavier and heavier layers. It turns into a juvenile romance novel by the end. I wasted over $25 and five days on it. I did purge myself of this guilt by donating it to my local library, thus hopefully preventing others from making the same mistake. Given the popularity of this novel, however, the author will likely continue to write and publish many more books in the future. The thought makes me shudder and swoon. Do you want to read superb, even transcendental horror, the kind that is genuine literature? Pick up anything by Thomas Ligotti."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"I typically do not write reviews, but I was so disappointed in this book and just had to write about it to save others from wasting time reading it. I read it for a book club. About 100 pages into it (out of 600 - 700 pages), I went from enjoying it to being totally bored. This could have been a good story I thought about half way through, but it was way too long and just went on with pages and pages of letters, needless descriptions. Honestly, who cares what someone ate in every cafe or what every building looked like. And, there was just too many places, tombs, maps etc to keep track of or want to care about. I wanted to finish it for my book club, but I skipped so many pages in the second half as I just couldn't stand it any longer. And, in the end, the truth is, it wasn't a good story. Boring, uneventful ending, predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Vampire Book since Dracula","review":"I'm shocked by the negative reviews. Truly, Kostova is wordy, very descriptive, and this is not a quick or easy read. She is a storyteller. She sets an incredible tone for her novel that makes it unique in the cannon of vampire lore by telling this story through narration, memory, and letters that allow us to be involved, then once, and then twice removed. The disbelief and skepticism of those involved make the events more believable and therefore more terrifying. Commit to this book. It is time-consuming, but rich. If you want to finish a vampire novel in one afternoon, go read Twilight. This is literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"So glad I didn't pay for it.","review":"My only consolation in this book was that I found it on my workplaces's book-exchange shelf. Therefore, I didn't waste my money with this plodding, overwrought drivel. The other reviewers have pointed out the many flaws and inconsistencies of logic. It took me two months just to force myself through half the book. Now, knowing it doesn't get any better, I'm going to put it back on the exchange shelf--with a warning note! Avoid it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good condition","review":"best book I've read in years....cannot put it down..bought a second copy for my husband so he could enjoy it too.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly believable","review":"This was a fantastically written, beautiful, haunting look at the search for Vlad the Impaler (Dracula). A little confusing to catch on to because of the multiple stories within stories each coming from different generations of researchers, but definitely worth digging into. This book was truly spooky to read and was actually spine-tingling. Much of the story takes place in Turkey and Hungary, so the settings are wonderful and there is a huge amount of Turkish Empire history included, which I enjoy, but I could see how that might deter other readers. I think what I loved most about this book was that it reads like true, honest historical fiction, even though you know that it can't possibly be true because it deals with mythological lore. By the end of it you are left believing in vampires. Amazing when an author can convince you to believe in things that you KNOW aren't real. Well done, Elizabeth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant enough for a while......but....","review":"A decent enough debut novel, interesting premise, well-written, and I loved the sort of travelogue feel to it all. But my word, this thing is just too long and slow. Pages 300-500 were a chore to get through and nothing really ever happens. Not coincidentally, that is the section of the book where there are little to no vampire appearances.I finished it. I didn't hate it. Parts were even quite excellent. But overall, just too much invested for too little reward."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Historian is captivating - Excellent","review":"I absolutely enjoyed this work, finished it very quickly and now I am looking for more on The Historian from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm not sure what I expected from this book, but it wasn't what I got. After a promising 100 pages or so building up the plot and setting the foundations for what should have been an exciting adventure, the story flounders along at a laboriously slow pace. It fails to deliver either as a literary work or as a thriller. Characters remain two-dimensional and the attention to unnecessary detail is often painful. To carry off that kind of writing you need to be hugely talented, and sadly Kostova isn't - or at least that talent isn't realised here.A lot of people seem to love it, though, so it could just be one of those situations where I just didn't click with a book - it happens with some of my favourite writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drag","review":"I received this book as a gift with great hope and enthusiasm. Vampire stories, though hokey at times, are usually fun and fascinating. I slipped into this novel only to be jostled free every 30 pages or so. A good story contains great background but a times it was a bit much. I kept thinking that the author had a few doctoral dissertations on obscure Hungarian and Eastern European topics lying around. Each time I arrived at one of these moments I rolled my eyes but continued to read. I was caught by the main story but drowned in the backstory. It could have benefited from a little more editing.Despite its flaws, I did finish this book, which is not always the case with me. It wasn't all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A compilation of history... and that's it?","review":"It's an amazing book, in term of the historical depth that this book goes into (regardless whether it's accurate or not). The problem is, that's all the book have going for it. That's about what the whole book is about, one piece of history after another, compiled in a manner that tries to resemble a great overarching plot, but failed to strengthen the plot. The ending, in addition, is very disappointingly short, and seems rather inaccurate given what's written in the buildup for that climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry as dust.","review":"Readers are invited to join a young woman on a journey around the world to discover the truth about vampires, in particular, Vlad Dracula. Following a trail of clues in old journals, books, and letters, the narrator tracks down the undead. Somehow, this legend is the key to her own past, but how? Learning the truth could be the death of someone, or worse.** After all the hype surrounding this novel, I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, it is as dry as dust. The characters are virtually devoid of personality, with truly interesting events only happening in the final few pages. **Amanda Killgore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too long","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers on two points: 1) Ms. Kostova's editors could have done a more thorough job editing her novel, and 2) The characters are superficial and insufficiently compelling to drive the story. The plot twists were predictable. The strength of the novel is its ambitious and fairly successful attempt to blend historical fact with just the right touch of fiction to engage the reader's imagination. I think that part of the difficulty is that the search for various & sundry historical documents which drive the central mystery is not terribly suspenseful because it's very distanced for the reader. You're essentially reading about someone reading/translating a document. I did come away with a much firmer grasp of Eastern European history from that era. I left wondering why I lugged such a heavy tome to and from the airport."},{"rating":"1","title":"An editor, please!","review":"Somewhere in this novel's 676 pages is a marvelous 300 page thriller. Alas, Kostova's editors did not even attempt to find it. Through the premise of the novel is an intriguing one, the tale, like Stoker's Dracula, wanders quite a bit as the book proceeds. At times, I resorted to reading the first sentence of every paragraph until I found some actual movement in the plot. This strategy proved necessary over dozens of pages. The minute detail accompanying nonessential events becomes quite frustrating after the first hundred pages or so. Another problem with the book is the lack of distinctive characterization. Just about all of the characters have similar and prolix narrative voices. There is a real absence of gender difference in the characters' voices as well. In all, a disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bone Dry","review":"The only thing juicy or scary about \\"The Historian\\" is the hype. Proving that movie moguls and music impressarios have nothing on them, book schills somehow turned hundreds of pages of rehashed horror basics into a blockbuster. \\"The Historian\\" is way too ponderous and not nearly inventive enough. I must admit, however, that I skipped a hundred pages so that I could make it to the finish line. It was a cheat, but the book's preposterous length and repetitiveness had me as dazed as a member of the undead. Stay away! Far away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long on history, short on suspense...","review":"After hearing about it all over in the press, I HAD to have this book. At first, I found it mildly entertaining. Halfway through I wondered when the story would start to get REALLY interesting. Towards the end, I was just gritting my way through it hoping for a return on all the time invested. If you're looking for a travel-log with more than a dash of histroy thrown in, this is the book for you. Frankly, I prefer more suspense in my suspense novels. Not one I'd recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good balance - Not too much fluff, not too much history.","review":"I enjoyed this book. It took me a few months to read because I was constantly interrupted from my reading pursuits but I kept coming back to it and enjoying it. I have read reviews that complained of the extended interludes on the routes taken by monks between the Balkans and Constantinople. That did not bother me. I like histories (American Revolution era especially) but break up the monotony with the occassional James Patterson or DiVinci Code. The Historian provided a nice mix of both elements. A hell of a lot more sophisticated than my normal pot boiler."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Novel was well written...","review":"The novel was well written and that is what kept me interested until about the end. I liked the general concept of the novel and the interesting way it was organized, with the letters and all. However, what keeps me from giving this book 5 stars is the ending. It seemed quite rushed and hurried. The entire book was built on the suspense of finding Rossi and Dracula, and when they did it was found that Rossi was snatched in order to become Dracula's librarian and Dracula was not as formidable as everyone thought (considering how easily they killed him when they first met him). It took 600 pages to found out these mysteries, but the author tried to tie up the loose ends in 76 pages. It didn't seem like enough. Now, don't get me wrong, the rest of the book was great, I was surprised I liked it, but the ending is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Must Read - For Insomniacs","review":"I suppose I should start with a positive...the movie will almost certainly be better!!!Actually, I'll keep this succinct. The way I describe this book to others is \\"A 320 page novel *crammed* into a 700 page tome.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A suspenseful voyage","review":"I found myself completely consumed by this book. I couldn't put it down. It's a very well researched fictional story based upon the life of Vlad Dracula. Vlad is not the main character here but looms in the background. It's an exciting adventure that travels across Europe combining historical information with a good fictional story. I was slightly disappointed with the ending, but would recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have cut this book in half....","review":"I have read a lot of books in my day. And I have never read a book that I was 65 chapters in and still waiting for something EXCITING to happen. What a disappointment this book was. This author, tried way to hard to describe so much. I thought if I read one more chapter describing the mountains or the countryside I thought I would vomit. It was just too much. We get it! Europe is beautiful!!!!The plot seem to go around in circles at times, and the story line could have been cut in half. And I found myself skipping chapters and finding out in the long run, that I didn't miss anything by skipping them! Sad! Dracula has a library, that he wants someone to catalog-thats scary? And I read over 600 pages to find that out? Big deal. This was more like history lesson and geographical lesson not a vampire noval at all. This story line was \\"never ending\\" and it could have been cut in half and could have been so much better. I give it two thumbs down :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely Unsatisfying","review":"The Historian was like the Da Vinci Code, but on steroids.

Look elsewhere for good historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"I thought that this book was just okay. There were parts that were exciting and made me want to keep reading, but there were also parts that were not so exciting and made me want to skip ahead or just put the book aside. I am definately no pro on book writing, but I believe that there were certain parts that she just put too much detail into. She would go on and on describing something that was not an important part to the story. With that said, I am not suggesting that one should not read the book, but it would not be on the top of my suggestions list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read, but Needed an Editor","review":"\\"The Historian\\" is a good read, a story well told, but over told. It needed an editor. At times, almost like reading a Thomas Wolfe epistle...good stuff, good story, good discripton, but too much of it..The length and detail, at times, detract for the story itself, which is unfortunate. A good story, extremely well written at times. When reading it alone, especially late at night, some of the discriptons, situations and story lines actually bring chills. It's that good!! But it in the end, it is too long. Far too long. The same criticism, however, could be made of any of Wolfe's beloved books, \\"Gone With the Wind,\\" \\"Les Miserables\\" and countless other \\"must read\\" books. Read this one on vacation--when you have plenty of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"bram stoker's book adapted for the new century","review":"It's a good read, although slow and at times confusing as there are 3 parallel plot lines.My only problem with the book was that the suthor realy needed to do more fact-checking regarding life in the Soviet bloc. At some point she mentions that Stalin's body was put next to Lenin's in the mausoleum in the 1980s, which made me chuckle. Also, the ease with which Western researchers and diplomats (!) cross borders, obtain visas, rent cars, catch planes and freely travel outside major Communist cities is simply breathtaking.An American (Rossi) traveling by himself in Romania in the 1950s, a few years after the WWII and at the height of Cold War? Give me a break.Throughout the book characters jet-set around Eastern Europe as if it was the year 2006 and not the early 1980s, just thought it's funny for a book titled \\"The Historian\\". This makes it as historically accurate as the Stoker's \\"Drakula\\", with an exception for the historical background of Vlad III."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better and so much shorter!","review":"I found this book to be more a history lesson on Eastern Europe than anything else. I was so excited when I read the back cover and couldn't wait to get started. However, I found there wasn't enough \\"thrills\\" in between all the dates and history notes to really keep me interested.

She kept telling us how the characters were filled with dread and horror but as a reader, I certainly never experienced either emotion. Stop telling us it's scary and start scaring us. She obviously wanted to write a horror story with literary pretensions but literary or not, horror is supposed to scare you.

In the time that I began this book, I have read six others and then keep coming back to the Historian because I always finish a book and I hope and believe that it will end better than the last 542 pages.

I love long novels and have devoured, with great enjoyment, such classics as War and Peace as well as more modern novels such as No Angel, so the length of a book has never deterred me.

If you can pass that test, and if you are not put off by the vampire motif (and I'm glad I didn't know of it when I bought the book), you will be rewarded with one of the best reads of the summer, if not the year. The research this author has done must have been encyclopaedic - and I did go to my encyclopaedia to refresh my memory of the various post-WWI treaties which formed much of the political geography of the book. I have visited many of the sites she describes, and the travelogue is impeccable. The characters are sharply and engagingly drawn, and you are despite yourself engaged with them - which undoubtedly helps with your digestion of a very tall story. Is the Vampire strain a metaphor for something? An intriguing thought for you to work through for yourself - buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Infuriating! (And not in a good way.)","review":"Ugh. All I can say is ugh. I stuck through nearly 700 pages with such hope only to be dumped ceremoniously when our authoress realized that if she were truly going to do her story justice, she'd need to go on for another 700 pages! And it had such promise. Dad was suitably aloof, mysterious and yet loving. Daughter was slightly on the dull side but she had potential and was a good listener, which was really all that was required of her. Mom was loving and yet slightly sinister, weirdly believeable as a person. But it just tanked at the end.Another reviewer mentioned the lack of motivation of Vlad Tepes. HE'S DRACULA! He shouldn't need motivation! But that's what all the poking around in books made one expect. That and some nice parallel Cold War intrigue that also never manifested.If you're way into \\"enjoying the journey\\" and don't generally concern yourself with plot, go for it. If you expect an author who respects your time and intelligence, I'd take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neverending Story","review":"I made it halfway, I admit it... I can't finish this book. I don't care what happens to the characters, so why waste the time? I know everything about where they go, everything about what they wear (surprisingly the thread count of their clothing is missing) but I have no clue who these people are. Why would I want to go on such an epic journey with them?I'm sure there is a good plot buried in there somewhere.1 star for an original idea1 star for the author's tenacity, it must have taken forever to write this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bit and was bitten--pun intended","review":"Talk about a disappointment. After the glowing professional reviews, I bought this one. 647 pages later, much of which I speed-read, I realize I will not even give it to my best friend. What ever happened to editing? This thing could easily have been cut by 200 pages. It has been praised for its comments on the nature of evil. It certainly does--ad nauseam. No sublety at all! Pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This was the most boring book that I've ever read.Six hundred pages of secondhand accounts of parts of the plot and absolutely unbelieveable chance meetings bored me to death.I love vampire books, I love history. I hated this book.I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me, and that's fine, but trust me, this book was as boring as the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian--too wordy","review":"I've been picking away at Kostova's epic for over a week, trying various forms of attack--hunting for the meat of the story, skimming the pages of overly detailed descriptions of architecture and attire. Time is too precious to waste on this tedious and boring novel. Why has it been so highly recommended and hype is beyond my comprehension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"This book was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. The premise is excellent, however the follow through leaves SO MUCH to be desired. It was quite a bore for a vampire novel. I would have purchased travel guides had I wanted a romp through the Eastern Europe and Turkey. Extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your precious time!","review":"Sometimes one just wants to read an easy book for fun, distraction. Although I like to stick to the classics most of the time, I do enjoy an occasional \\"Harry Potter\\" or commercial thriller. I thought this would be one of those fun books. It is not. Actually, I never got so angry after finishing a book. The books starts with a big promise, drags you through 900 pages and at the end you will feel like someone made a big fool out of you. I have to admit though, the author is good at teasing and playing with the reader's curiosity, and that's all, and that makes you go through all the clichés, tacky romance, sterile endless landscape descriptions and flat characters because you hope at least to get a grand finale, but... no. Even Dracula, such an interesting literary character, even him was disgraced here... somehow the author managed to ruin him too. Please, save your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring","review":"I really tried to finish this book. I love history but this was an overload. I kept reading waiting for the good part but it never comes. I gave up halfway through. I don't know how this book got so many great reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"Reads more like a college history paper then a novel...slow moving and dull as if Kostova felt the need to drag the story on for as long as possible...lacks character development, plot, and other basic fundamentals of an english novel...the end does NOT justify the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book","review":"This is a great book!! I would higly recommend it to anyone. It immedietly draws you into the story and unfolds the story of Dracula from several points of view at the same time until suddenly everything comes into focus. Simply excellent, very much in the style of the Da Vinci Code.Also the title should not chase away the history averse amoung us. This is a story told through the ages, though from the first person point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word...lame.","review":"Although the plot is decent, this book is way too long. There are pages and pages...and pages of boring descriptions of the countryside and various buildings that do absolutely nothing to move the story along. The encounters with Dracula himself are few and far between and are not at all 'chilling' and 'spine-tingling' as I heard from others. The end is anti-climactic and I felt ripped-off after trudging through 600+ pages to get to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many coincidences","review":"predictable and disappointing but I read the whole thing anyway. has some interesting takes on the dracula theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacularly bad writing","review":"Great idea. Great incorporation of history and place; clearly the author did her research. Terrible writing. Much of the plot exection was plain stupid. This is not a literary novel or a remotely frightening novel. Seems like a great premise was dumbed down with aspirations of Da Vinci Code meets Harry Potter. What a waste of material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and heavy","review":"This book was horrendously difficult to get through. Kostova is very good at constructing descriptive passages, but she fails miserably at plot, motivation, character development--everything that makes a book engaging. Her literary devices--Victorian letters from vague professors, a tale extracted from a recalcitrant father--ended up creating confusion. Who is talking here? And why? There was no reason for anyone to be doing anything in this book. Nor was there any emotional content in spite of numerous (and clumsy) attempts at creating tension through stock phrases which would have been hilarious in a potboiler. (A feeling of unnamed dread, an expression of horror, etc.). I would not recommend this book if you are looking for an entertaining read. However, it makes a great doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Boring","review":"After 130 pages, I cannot get into this and so I am kissing it goodbye. It was supposed to be on the lines of the Da vinci Code only with real history. As trite as Da Vinci was, at least it kept you hooked. If this book eventually justifies itself by insights into the history of the Balkans, that will be fine but I would rather read non-fiction for that. If you like vampire stories go read Bram Stoker again... there is no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"I usually don't give bad reviews to books; most have at least some redeeming qualities. But not this one. I bought this in hardcover and actually considered asking for my money back.This book was horrid.The premise was moronic, (Dracula luring historians-people well-known for their adventuresome ways-to his lair through the auspices of a smelly old book.) With three lines of confusing, ill-woven, time-flopping plot, the book hinted at a shocking ending but failed to deliver.The only thing that shocked me about it was the amount of time I wasted nursing it along. Take my advice and RUN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book written in the tradition of 19th century classics.","review":"Although the plot is a little slow at the beginning, it picks up and develops into a great thriller. I enjoyed the book immensely and I wish there were more of such kind on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snooze-fest!","review":"Was this author paid by the word or the column inch? I waded through 25 pages looking for a plot, a start,... ANYTHING before I chucked it onto my discard pile. Just because it's THICK, doesn't mean it's GOOD (right, Stephen King?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish and this novel smell in three days!","review":"Actually, it took even less time to realize this book is a complete waste of time. Davinci Code fans will love this book--trite, uninspired, pedestrian. I don't normally read \\"Top 40\\" literature, and this novel reminds me of why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great promise, bad delivery","review":"I could only read about 110-120 pages of this book before getting bored to death. It starts off pretty good, giving cliff hangers and showing promise, however, it drags terribly. I usually give a book 100 pages before I decide to give up on it. This book was terrible and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is the perfect sedative. The weak plot is slow-paced and simply boring. The characters are shallow and unimaginitive. Just when you think something exciting is going to happen, it falls short. You need a degree in geography to know where the author is talking about - it's impossible to follow. I have no intention of finishing this one - right to the donation bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumptuous, Riveting. I loved it.","review":"I can whip through most books in a couple of days. This book has kept me entranced, especially with the wonderful descriptions of strange places, exotic foods and enough suspense to hold things together. Took me a week to read, and I enjoyed every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and literate re-invention of the vampire novel","review":"This is really a four and a half star review, almost a five. The novel is, for the most part, superbly written, gorgeous in its descriptions, sure-footed with its characters. The author's ability to re-invent the vampire genre 110 years after Stoker launched it is amazing. (It may be said that Anne Rice re-invented the genre once already, but Kostova's effort is superior in every way.) There are some draggy and confusing parts as we get toward the end, and I think the novel really could have been shortened a bit, but overall, this is a masterful work of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the ending","review":"I actually listened to the audio of this book, which is well done, by the way. I enjoy reading fiction about otherworldly creatures, and was deeply enveloped by this book until......the end. What a rotten ending for such a well put together story. I was so disappointed that I refuse to suggest this book to anyone. Which is unfortunate because I work PT in a bookstore!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts are greater than the whole.","review":"An interesting premise and several compelling set pieces. But overall, overly long and redundant and, sadly, predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Look, I'm a fanatic for both history and the occult, when I read about this book I thought it would be a masterpiece. Instead it is a big snooze!The novel's characters are boring. The way the author teases the reader by having Dad constantly stopping the telling of the story was irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cerebral horror","review":"The Historian is an intelligent and suspenseful read. Kostova's strength is writing wonderfully detailed descriptions of the settings as the protagonists travel around Europe hunting Dracula. The reader feels like he/she is along for the hunt as well. The ending is suspenseful and does not disappoint. This book is much better than most of the horror that is written these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how you can make Dracula boring, but...","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was not daunted by the size of the volume, so I plunged in, with high hopes. And I waited, and waited. While the prose is beautiful and the descriptions are lovely, I did not purchase a Frommers guide, I wanted a novel. The plot twists were somewhat easy to guess and the characters' motivations were somewhat off (I can't see a parent leaving their child behind, no matter what). I got to the last page of the novel, hoping for a dramatic confrontation between the protagonists and the antagonist and I got nothing. I reread the last page in shock, wondering what really happened at the end, and realizing that this was it. Frustrating. Entertaining, but not much of a payoff at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula - the game...","review":"It's a comic/computer game book...the \\"a-ha!\\" moments are so pervasive that one becomes numb after a while, anticipating the vampire in the library...I didn't think it possible that a novel about this subject could possibly be dull, but this one is...It begins with promise, but is far too tedious and poorly edited to continue reading...darn, I, too, was lured by the hype - and full of hope. Silly me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is not fast food","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time, but beware it is not \\"fast food\\". It has lots of detail, development, and historical context - if you are looking for fast paced mindless action and don't want to savor the details - you will find this a difficult read. I compare reading this novel to eating a large, well planned, delicious meal. Take your time and enjoy every bite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry","review":"Actually, watching paint dry is more interesting than this critically-hyped novel that was supposedly this season's Da Vinci Code. The author has absolutely no ear for dialogue. I think that she aspires to be another Hawthorne, given her penchant for mind-numbing wordiness. If the author is reading this, I'm sorry to tell you that you are no Hawthorne. This novel is just pretentiously bad. I made it through page 103, but decided that life is just too short and unpredictable; I'd hate this to be the last book I ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing style, not so good everything else","review":"Very little happens in the almost 700 pages of The Historian. The story is told through three generations of historians as they travel through Europe searching for the lost tomb of Vlad Tepes, better known as Dracula. The plot proceeds at a snail's pace and the characters are barely developed past the rather two-dimensional nature with which they are introduced. What kept me going for the first 200 pages was Elizabeth Kostova's wonderful writing style, and after that I continued reading because I thought surely with all the slow build-up and fact finding, the book had to be going somewhere extraordinary. I was wrong. By the time the protagonists reach the end of their search well after page 600, I was disappointed at how anti-climactic it all was. The Historian will serve as a personal reminder as to why I rarely devote my time to finishing novels that seem lackluster from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly tedious and self-indulgent","review":"I rarely discard a book when I am finished reading it--but I want to save at least one other reader from wasting hours of precious reading time, and so I am recycling this one (or perhaps I will drive a wooden stake through it). I am a history buff, and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the literature program at UCSD--I am not a reader without patience. After the first 200 pages, it devolved into an endless travelogue--libraries and monasteries in country after country, blurring into each other to no purpose in either plot or character development. I kept going gamely for the next four hundred pages, and although I became increasingly bitter, I vowed to see it through. The last one hundred pages are interesting, but the suspense had been sucked dry long before."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pain in the Neck to read","review":"I love reading historial fiction. I am entranced by the romantacism of vampires and Draculyan legend. So, this booked seemed like a natural fit, right? The beginning certainly tantalized me; I was even captivated and intrigued by the father's haunted past. But honestly, after knocking around every dusty library and monastery in Eastern Europe, the plot seemed to spin out of control and I lost interest.I wasn't expecting lots of gore and even an \\"adventurous thriller\\" but a little less of a history lesson and more action would have kept my interest longer. Even Anne Rice got off to a better start than this!In separate reviews this book has been compared to DaVinci Code. Not by a long shot! At least Dan Brown got us caught up in some cloak-and-dagger.This one was kind of a let down. Not good when you're 3/4 through the book and hoping it will all be over soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just skip it","review":"I gave the book 2 stars for its wonderful description of the countries that the main characters travel to but that even got too long winded in places. The book just did not hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"My biggest problem with the book is poor character development. It became increasingly difficult to figure out who she was talking about as I progressed through the book and I finally gave up about half way through. Perhaps if the characters were better developed I could get into whatever it was they were trying to do. Characters incidental to the plot were better developed than the main characters and are not involved enough to compel one to read any further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula Lives!","review":"I am always open for a new vampire novel, and this is one of the best new ones around. If you like books like The Da Vinci Code or anything by Preston and Child, then you will find this book, full of twists & turns, oblique characters, and plotting that needs Mapquest to figure out, a wonderful read. If you are looking for vampire sex/blood, this isn't it. Yhe interactions among characters is almost 19th century courtly. Relationships are slowly,gracefully developed as the sense of eternity emerges as one of the main themes in this novel. I have read just about every vampire novel imaginable, and I think this is one of the best in an often-overlooked genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY wanted to like this book","review":"I love this kind of book and was pumped about reading it. I kept waiting for the part that would suck me into the story, but it never came. The writing was good, I just couldn't get interested though. I finished it because I'm stubborn that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeesh","review":"I read a LOT of books and this has to be one of the most (if not the most) B O R I N G books I have ever read. If by adding another one star review it keeps just one person from picking this book up, I have done a good deed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiler Alert!","review":"Since 1976, Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire has been at the top of my list of the most boring vampire novels ever written. Rice must now move to second place, the top spot being taken by Elizabeth Kostova's The Historian.Here's the story. Dracula is an angry book collector who tempts academic historians into chasing him all over Europe so that he can turn them into vampires and make them catalog his impressive library. He does this with three generations of related historians. It's not clear why he would have to turn them into vampires, except that then they would be able to work for him longer. Nor is it clear why being a vampire is such a bad thing that these historians don't want to become undead.There are places where the reader gets a glimpse of something better, but it quickly gets buried under Kostova's turgid prose. Why she would have won any awards for this dreck, or why anyone would encourage someone else to read it is beyond my comprehension"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Historian","review":"When I bought this book, I had heard it compared favorably to Brown's The DeVinci Code. The Historian is not comparable to the Brown's book. I thought this book was easy to read and I did enjoy it even though I do not believe in vampires, much less Dracula. Connecting Dracula to a real person increased my interest in history. I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is one of my favorite books. There is an aura of suspense and creepiness pervading the whole story that makes it absolutely thrilling. It is made all the more enjoyable (and creepy) by the fact that it is based in historical fact. I would highly recommend this book, especially to history buffs and anyone who likes a good mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gothic tale!","review":"Great book, intricately told tale, with compelling characters (unlike The Shadow of the Wind, which I read recently). The vampire tale is well told, and revealed over time as the daughter discovers her parent's sorrowful tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book encrypted here","review":"There is a good novel encrypted in this massive, messy book, had the author pared it down by ridding it of the unnecessary book-within-a-book-within-letters-within-more-letters structure and by purging the melodramatic cliches. A few examples of the later, cited by Paul, one of the several first-person narrators: \\"...made my blood run cold,\\" \\"I felt the blood drain out of my head,\\" \\"I felt the blood draining from my heart,\\" my body ached profoundly,\\" \\"It had cost me a terrible pang,\\" and \\"A chill ran down my...\\" There are too many chills running, crawling, and snaking across Paul's various body parts to mention. There is a good plot and interesting historical research here, but for me these were ruined by the author's excesses. I found myself speed-reading through most of The Historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"Although very readable, THE HISTORIAN suffers a ridiculously slow pace (yes, stuff is happening, but it's the same stuff--over and over again), a plot that's chock full of coincidence, and characters that ultimately aren't that interesting. I love a good historical epic--even one with a slow build--but I had to give up on this one about 350 pages in. If a book hasn't hooked me by then, it's not going to. And the fact that characters \\"just happened\\" to keep meeting people who were also studying Dracula eventually just got too overwhelmingly implausible to ignore. If you want a weighty historical tome with some supernatural elements, I highly recommend Robert McCammon's The Queen of Bedlam or Katherine Neville's The Eight instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter tedium","review":"Do not buy this book, do not borrow this book, do not even read this book. This pretentious waste of time should be avoided at all costs. It is hundreds of pages too long, and full of preposterous contrivances all in the service of the writer's catastrophic choice to type it out in an \\"epistolary\\" style. All the characters are shamefully phony and weak, and the threadbare plot, such as it is, could barely fill a 25 page short story. Elizabeth Kostova's editors should be ashamed of themselves, because they dropped the ball in every way.I honestly am appalled that other reviewers are calling this padded nightmare \\"literary\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says history can't be suspenseful?","review":"I'm still reading this book, but I've been impressed with the author's beautiful writing voice. Her story is compelling and well-paced in spite of changes in point-of-view character. Vlad the Impaler, better known as Dracula, was a scary enough dude in real life, no Bela Lugosi required. Kostova has managed to bridge historical fact and Bram Stoker's classic vampire traits with her own ideas, and the result is a frightening picture. Along the way, you just might learn some fascinating history about Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria.This story is not a read for an airplane or at the beach. Read it at home with a cup of tea and the phone off the hook instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"This book was great. It was long, thick, and juicy. Everything a book should be. I couldn't put it down, but when I reached the end, I was sorry I was done, and wished I had read slower. This book was worth every penny... one word of advice, don't read this if you scare easy or late at night when you are at home along.. or if the power goes out.... just a tip. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATTENTION ALL VAMPIRE HUNTERS!!!","review":"This is a wonderful vampire suspense book, however, it is very complicated. The meat of the characters are mixed up in so many ways, the main stream is hard to follow. I was disappointed in the whole book make up, but if you follow the action through out the book, the meaning & ending is great! If you love long vampire thrillers, this is the book for you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"EDITOR, EDITOR, EDITOR","review":"The paperback version...a 300 page book jam-packed into 900 pages. I long for the days when an editor was actually hired by a publishing company to do what they do best. Ms. Kostova suffers from a common ailment of modern authors...the inability to limit her subject. This book is alllll over the place. A GREAT start, interesting and promising. I might even go so far as to call it a fresh take on a classic, but eight hundred pages later we still have seen nothing but a shadow of Drac and have learned about the dining habits of every character in every country they visit. Written diarrhea. Very rarely do I consider not finishing a book, but this was a challenge to complete. A big, big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"ambitious but falls way short","review":"The story is quite interesting, and it is captivating to read some of the actual historical accounts of Vlad and how she weaves the fiction with the non-fiction. However, that is about all that's good with this book. It is poorly written and there are many, and I mean many, parts of this book that are boring, unnecesary and long. I actually stopped reading this thing with about 200 pages left, and I have never done that with any book before. I am compulsive when it comes to finishing any movie or book that I started, and this one was a first for me. I went to the last 15 pages or so just to see how she ended it all.I warn you now, don't waste your time with this one. Get the Cliff notes instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious- A Great 350-Page-Book Inflated To 700+ Pages!","review":"I bought this book with great expectations, based on the reviews and cover blurbs- and I was very disappointed. While I enjoyed the last chapter or two, it felt like it took me forever to plod through to them (and I'm a fast reader!). The text bogs down so much at times one is sorely tempted to give up. Better yet, just don't start it...it isn't worth the effort, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"I picked this book up on a whim and was amazed at how good it was. Other reviewers have covered this book pretty well so I will keep this very brief. A few reviewers complained that certain parts of this book dragged but I found it very gripping from beginning to end. She has an excellent writing style that is wonderfully haunting. This is a wonderful twist on the Dracula tale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz.....","review":"I'm afraid I have to add to the pile of reviews from people who thought this book was a bore. The first couple hundred pages were excellent reading, and because you're reading a book about Dracula you start to think that you are well on your way to something exciting. Well, about halfway through you start giving up on that notion. \\"The Historian\\" could have been about 200 pages shorter. It got so tedious that I felt like I was reading a college textbook and I should whip out my highlighter and a liter of Mountain Dew to keep myself awake. To be honest I got fed up and skimmed through the 500's. I don't like to give up on a book though, so I did finish it, but I'd really like to have the time I spent reading this book BACK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!","review":"Kostova clearly did a lot a research for this book. Thus the book is quite clever. The plot is tight. It's very suspenseful. The characters are very interesting. Overall, a very fun read. It is not your normal horror book - which I like. It's not gorey or gratuitous in any way. It's smart. It reads like a mystery. The only thing I was a little disappointed with, and it was a minor disappointment, was the ending, which wasn't quite as clever as the rest of the book. The ending was a bit conveninet, but just a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I found this book randomly and thought it sounded interesting. It is one of the best books I have read in a while. It does an amazing job of combining fiction with history. I learned a ton about the ottoman empire and other bits of history while staying intrigued in the fictional story. I liked how it went between the present and past. The transitions were well done. The writing was very good. I found myself unable to put the book down and reading for hours every night. The chapters leave you wanting to know more and makes it hard to put down. I am so glad I found this book. It is truly great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"Most of the reviews I've read of this novel are critical of the length mainly. Personally, I don't think she could have told this story any other way and I wouldn't wanted her to cut anything out. Its an incredible tale spanning centuries and vast distances and introduces many important and varied characters. This book is for lovers of history as well as those devoted and efficient speed-readers out there (you cant zone out for a spell and then snap out of it expecting not to need to backtrack). Anyway, this is one of the greatest tales I've ever read and I'm so grateful I stumbled upon it. Its a book for people who love to read, not just one to casually jump in and out of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent novel!","review":"This novel literally grabbed me from the first pages, and I raced through the pages, devouring ever piece of it, until I reached the end. Ms. Kostova is a magnificent story teller. Her research was supurb, and her take on the Dracula legend was fresh and supremely...well, let's just say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and can't wait until Ms. Kostova publishes again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it by the pool","review":"I won't go into all the plot holes and weaknesses of this book, they have already been mentioned by A. Lewis in his review.I think of 'The Historian' as a book you want to like, because the narrative is flowing and the writing is decent, but you can't like it, because you feel that it's just missing something.Besides, I had the uneasy feeling that the author's historical knowledge is presented as if it were taken straight out of Wikipedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book seller.","review":"This is a fantastic book so far. I have not finished it but it takes you into the authors mind and you feel like you are really in Eastern Europe and are looking for Drakulya. Definitely a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Different!","review":"I've never read a book quite like \\"The Historian.\\" I could have done without so much description of European architecture, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. The history and pursuit of Dracula was page-turning and the touches of history were very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only literate if you can recognize a literate book","review":"I was very surprised by the (few) readers who claimed The Historian was not literate. Then I reflected that you would not be able to recognize a literate novel if you did not actually know what \\"literate\\" meant. So maybe a simple glance at a dictionary would make a difference to these disappointed folks. I only hope they didn't give favorable notices to the execrable prose of Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code. It was a lovely idea for a plot - how sad that Dan Brown should be the one to think of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite literally one of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"The thought that kept going through my head as I read was: how did this get published? I'm sure worse first novels have been written. But was the editor out of red pencils when he/she read this manuscript? It's far too long and poorly told.There's a dictum in storytelling: show, don't tell. Repeatedly the author tells us that some character's \\"blood ran cold\\" upon reading some passage in a book, while I, the reader, found the new revelation to be perfectly boring.As for the book's surprises... they were so clearly telegraphed beforehand, so utterly obvious, that the only people who could not see them coming from a mile away was the characters themselves.I truly believe that were it not for the wild success of The Da Vinci Code, this book would never have been published.A warning to any intelligent reader: don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, long drawn out waste of time...","review":"Usually I wait for reviews on Amazon to see what others think of new writers. I should have stuck to that rule. It's overwrought with drawn out tempid descriptions of locations with little plot or premise. After the first third of the book I understood the weak storyline - but I can honestly say I truly didn't care to know anymore than I did.Characters, though well described, lacked excitement. Even Dan Brown made a cryptologist sound better than these academians. If by chance Ms. Kostova cares to read this... make them more lively and not so prim and propper. Even in the '70's people had personalities.Perhaps, I'll go back to it again after I read some other true \\"thrillers\\" and see how she winds this up.But seeing how used books are going for a quarter of the price Amazon's selling them for it's a solid indication of much of a keeper this book truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd Spend Your Time Better Cleaning Out A Closet","review":"Horrendously overlong. Enough plot for maybe a 250-page book. Some chapters are beyond plodding. Some plotpoints are so obvious, you'll get them 100 pages before the lead characters do. The final showdown is less than jaw-dropping. There are moments, but moments are dwarfed in a tome 641 pages long.Dracula would go thirsty if he were depending on Kostova for bloody thrills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some people just don't know when to stop","review":"Overall the first 3/4 of the book were enjoyable; however, we reached a resolution at a startling pace. With such a long build, you would have expected a more satisfying resolution. I could live with that; however, some people just don't know when to stop. Had the book ended with no epilogue, I would have given it 3 or 4 stars. The epilogue called the resolution of the story into question and made me feel like I had wasted my time reading the previous 634 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick characters, weak plot","review":"The prose and descriptions are good but the characters are one dimensional and the plot is almost non-existent. It could have been told in 1/3 the number of pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Unabridged CD version","review":"With all the hype about this book, I couldn't wait for the audio version since I listen to audiobooks while commuting. The abridged version is dicey...hard to follow and sometimes downright confusing. I don't know why an unabridged version isn't available. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book, but it was somewhat hard to get into initially. The beginning of the book jumps around somewhat, and there is very little dialogue to keep the reader interested. Once the father starts to really tell his story, the book becomes much more interesting and I enjoyed it much more. However, I found the ending to be a little disappointing, like the author had to come up with an ending so she just ended it with the first thing that came to mind. I also didn't think the Epilogue was necessary. If you can get passed the first couple chapters and into the main story, the book is worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"I was somewhat wary of the book at first, as Dracula has been overdone in so many ways, but surprisingly, I ended up really enjoying the book. It's long, but it's very action packed. It's also complex enough to keep your attention through out the meanderings of the plot that traverse the various histories of 'the search'. However, what was really exciting was the detail on Vlad Tepes Dracula - you could tell that the research had been painstakingly done (and not just on the dracula legends but also on the settings in the novel). The ending, I must admit, isn't as good as the rest of the book, but how you get there...definitely a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"long story","review":"If you are looking for an advanture and fast-pace novel, it's not the one. If you're a vampire-hunting fan, it'd give you a different perspective from the other books.It's also a good way to learn the East Europe. There're many detailed descriptions about the people and towns there.Overall, this book is a little bit flat for me. Maybe I was expecting to get some exciting advanture experiences from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"This book wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. The beginning dragged, the changing narrator was sometimes confusing, and the plot twists became fairly obvious if you looked closely enough. It's almost as though Kostova was attempting to mirror Bram Stoker's style but couldn't quite figure out how to make it work. If you can read another book, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"I got to page 97 and then went and bought the CD. I have a long drive to and from work and traffic can be a beast, so I thought listening would give me time to appreciate what I thought was going to be a great story. I thought reading nearly 100 pages would finally have grabbed my attention but no. I found the CD to be a bit more interesting and did get all the way through it but I am really glad I didn't spend my time reading the book. I usually take book critics seriously but it was way over rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Live Up to Hype!","review":"I pre-ordered \\"The Historian\\" based on the description on Amazon.com and an article I had read about Elizabeth Kostova. I was intriqued by the comparison to \\"The DaVinci Code\\" and the fact that she had received a $2,000,000.00 advance for her first novel. When it arrived, I expected it to be a \\"can't put it down until it is finished\\" book, instead I found that it was a \\"have a hard time picking it up\\" book. I found it boring, slow-moving, repetitive, and lacking in suspense and horror. I wish I had waited for the paperback version and saved money - or better, checked it out of the library. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief What a Waste of Time","review":"I slogged through this book because a friend said it was the best book she had read all year. This has got to be one of the most poorly written book I have run across in a long time. There were three stories woven together. The author was not skilled in weaving these plots seamlessly. They were choppy, hard to follow and just plain boring. I seriously could not stand this book. Now, I have to fudge to my friend and say I liked it (well, I'll tell her it was ok...but, I promise I won't gush over it). Really, if anyone is thinking of reading this it's a huge waste of time!! Huge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, what a novel!","review":"Applause to Miss Kostova for The Historian. This novel has everything that a novel should have: mystery, love, suspense, i didn't want it to end. I must admit, there were times when i was reading this novel that my hair was standing up on my neck, i am not quite sure why, i credit the brilliant writting and the detailed description of certain events in the book. I cannot praise this book enough, so i urge you reader, go ahead and read the Historian, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally made it to the end!","review":"This book is dry, dry, dry! It could have been a marvelous book - the concept was intriguing - but it was VERY slow moving. I'm disappointed I spent my hard eaned money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags in Middle","review":"I really wanted to like this book! It has been a long time since I have read a book that I could not put down, and with all the hype that surrounded the release of this novel, or tome, I had high hopes for many sleepless, page-turning nights. This book starts off well, but drags on excruciatingly in the middle for about 200 pages. By the time I finally reached the end of the story, I did not care if they found Vlad or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I purchased this book when it was first published. It was being hyped as the next \\"DaVinci Code\\". The author was making the morning TV rounds and I was excited to get started. However, I must say that this is one of the dullest books that I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete snoozer","review":"The major problem with this book is that it is just plain dull. \\"Historian\\" is a play-by-play of each character's bone-dry life. So-and-so goes to the bathroom. So-and-so puts her hand on his shoulder. So-and-so stares forlornly at the painting. Not only that, but the payoff is bankrupt. At least with the plot-shallow \\"Da Vinci\\" we have a sprint and come across the finish line feeling like we accomplished something. With \\"Historian,\\" the only thing we accomplish is burning a few calories for having to carry around a tome of this size.Kostova needs to learn how to do a little more plot blooming as it happens, instead of waiting entirely until the end. It's okay to reveal key facts and let the audience know that they're key as they happen, instead of just rehashing the same facts over and over ad nauseum to string us along until the end. She needs fewer words, a better editor, and a sense of pacing.Verdict: good for weigh lifting, bad for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"NSG","review":"Well my first impression from the reviews was this book would keep me on the edge of my seat. Unfortunately, reading this book was anything but interesting. I am in a book club with co-workers and it took everyone 3 months to finish the story. I kind of gave up at the end when it keep dragging on and relied on my co-workers to fill me in. This may have been good for some but I rate it NSG--NOT SO GOOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Herculean effort too heavy on prose","review":"I heaved this handsome, titanic novel off the shelf with the expectation that it would be an interesting bit of historical fiction/folklore that would provide me with a long, satisfying reading experience. All I got was \\"long.\\" Heavy-handed, endless passages do little to either move the story along or help paint the picture of the vampire-chasers' adventures.Rather, the hundreds of descriptive pages in between plot points do little to build the suspense and one could actually forget it's conceived to be a thriller in the first place. While it is obvious that the author has a gift for language and detail, I (finally) finished this opus questioning her overall storytelling ability. Best for die-hard Drac fans, methinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"author in love with her words, not the plot","review":"it was late last night that i decided i will either force myself to finish this book or i never will. i started skimming and scanning thru the last 200 pages, not giving a damn anymore to the endless, frivolous, minutely detailed describtions, or facts for tt matter. ms. kostova is just in love with every word she types, and in doing so, she sacrifices tempo and momentum in such a plot, where flipping thru pages as fast and breathless as one can should be the prime concern with a brick novel as this one.also, ms. kostova seems to be quite under the effect of his bulgarian husband when it comes to formulating a stand point for the region's history and politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!","review":"When this book came out last year, it was acknowledged as one of the most awaited novels of the summer. I read an excerpt online and couldn't wait for it to come out.With such high expectations, the question to ask is..did it measure up?? I would say it did...for the most part. At times, I found the author was perhaps trying to create too eerie an atmosphere, to the point of being unnecessary.Otherwise, the story is amazing. The history behind Vlad the Impaler and the surrounding folklore and myths is absolutely captivating. The geographic locations Kostova takes the reader to are exotic and mystical;Romania ,Hungary and its political ties. These aspects of the book were expertly interwoven into the plotline, which was fast-paced and gripping. The characters got more interesting and provided more depth to the story as the book went on. A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"I recommend this book %100. I didn't know what it was about when I started it, but it caught my interest fairly quickly and kept it throughout the story. Towards the end, I couldn't put it down...it was that engrossing. Unlike some historical thrillers, where you can pretty much guess the ending 2/3 through the book, I was totally in dark right up until the end.Oh...and it's terrifying (in a good way). It's very scary and all the history about Vlad the Impaler is just fascinating (especially if you're not that familiar with him to start with - as I was). The characters are well developed, the writing is great, and never trite. It's a bit long, but the length never feels burdensome; the story unfolds beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"i so wanted to like this.and i *did* love the descriptions of the european places (my main reason to finish this tome.)and the language is often lush and rich.but the story itself:twist after tedious turnlibrary after libraryone-dimensional character ofter one-dimensional character...no.as fiction, it's boring.as a crash-course on some history on vlad tepes, however, it's actually rather entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe! Pure tripe!","review":"I cannot believe that I paid nearly thirty dollars for this gothic PoS. I was beguiled by an author interview I heard. Full of improbable coincidences and even more improbable characters, this book reads like a very poor imitation of Dickens. The writing is plodding and kitschy. Another reviewer rates this book \\"...up there with The daVinci Code.\\" Therein lies a tale, as I rate it subterranean - even Hadean - with TdVC. If you like the earlier PoS, you'll prolly like this one, too.But I like my fiction firmly plotted and planned. No innumerable and impossible coincidences for me. Save your money AND your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"I not only put the book down, I traded it in.Avoid this book if you want an enticing novel of intrigue and mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with the story please!","review":"Whew! This book is in dire need of some serious editing. It all begins with overlapping narrators. It is difficult to keep the point of view (narrators) straight. The story has merit--who doesn't like Dracula stories?--but it bogs down in a travelogue filled with all sorts of people who become part of the narration. Narration quotes within quotes within quotes is ponderous. The author seems to suffer from new writer syndrome: in love with her words. There are too many of them! This book could be 200 pages shorter and more tightly written. The prime narrator (if one can figure out who that is at times) seems to be the father. Basically he comes across as a dimwit. I'm ambivalent as to whether or not I liked it. It had a few--very few--sparks of good story telling. But on the whole it was difficult to stay focused. I kept muttering: \\"For God's sake, get on with the story!\\" Recommendation: Read Bran Stoker's Dracula, you'll be better rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Austen meets Dracula","review":"The HISTORIAN is a classic novel written in the form of an 18th century gothic novel. Like a Jane Austen novel, the plot and characters are revealed inch by inch as if peeling back the layers of an onion.Dacula is always an intriguing subject, and unlike the Anne Rice novels, this book does not seek to ennoble vampires, but sees them for the horrendous evil they are.This is a well written book, although at 640 pages it is quite a load. I think the same story could have been written in about 450 pages, and that is my only real criticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I Have Ever Read","review":"I read typically 5-7 book each month and I have to say this it my all time favorite. It's a 650 page book and I read it in 2.5 days. Needless to say, I couldn't put it down. This book has so much interesting historical information but is written in a way that keeps it easy to read and very interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Historian","review":"Very disappointing! I read reviews of this book and had very high hopes... sadly, it was too slow going. I really tried to stay with it - and wanted to like it... but, it is endless. I always love a good Dracula story - and this is about as compelling as a trip to motor vehicle. I never found myself engaged with the characters - you just glaze over with all the endless details. The plot labors on and on... in a historically pretentious way. Historical references galore... but not one shred of emotion or concern for any of the characters. If you want to get to sleep early - this novel is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth Kostova is no Dan Brown","review":"I enjoy history and historical novels. A good plot or well developed characters in an interesting historical setting is usually enough for me to give a book a passing grade. I am not a vampire fan, but the opportunity to learn a little about Ottoman influences in eastern Europe was enough to get me to buy this book. I have learned a little about the period, but at the price of painfully weak dialog and an alarmingly unsophisticated world view. If you are under 15 and are a big Dracula fan, then this book may not dissappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, boring and overwritten","review":"I bought this book when it first came out, and I'm still only half way through it. Kostova overwrites, putting too much detail in nothing with much importance to the story (much of a reminder of Anne Rice's The Witching Hour). The story starts out interesting, but not too far into it I found myself forcing to get through the pages until I had to give up completely.Save your time and money. This book is overrated and very, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"I QUIT ON PAGE 60","review":"I went into this book with high expectations. The conceit of the plot: that Vlad the Impaler was still alive was excellent. The idea of reading a DaVinci-style chase across Europe sounded as though it wouold be very entertaining. In reality this book moved with all the speed of paint drying on a wet, humid day. Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooring","review":"A lot of hype and after 100 pages I could no longer read on. If you must try this, don't waste your money on the hard cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving History a Bad Name","review":"The prepublication and Amazon readers'gushing reviews are the only mystery about this book. It is completely boring. I labored through 300 pages until I could endure it no longer. The locales may be exotic but a tedious and overblown description of each setting makes even cities like Istanbul,Amsterdam and Budapest boring.But I do think that the author possesses a great talent. Making a story about Dracula,vampires and the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires unreadably boring borders on a certain kind of genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"When I heard about it, i thought it would be a unique and exciting view on your average Dracula story. I was wrong. The story is long and drawn out, full of useless facts and historical information, so much so that you loose track of the story! Even if you choose to suffer through that, thinking the ending will be worth it, don't. The ending is odd, boring, and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"It's not often one is presented the opportunity to give feedback to authors much less others. I could not wait to finish the book because it was so slow and boring.Mrs. Kostova's idea for the book is indeed a good one. But she dilutes her style by adding way to much fluff and descriptions of places visited. If she would have stayed with her main theme and stayed with the action, the book would have been an excellent read. However, this was not the case, the letters in the beginning hook you and from then on she spends 80% of her time on fluff that has nothing really to do with the story line. I wish I would have read the on line reviews of others and not spent my hard earned money on this book. In short, very disappointing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really, really tried to like this book...","review":"...and after reading so much good press about it, and being fond of the vampire genre in general, I got through about 500 pages and it became torture to keep going (Dracula had yet to appear). Stuffy language and very little going on really kept me from wanting to finish this book. I really did my best to give it a chance, but I'd still be reading it this time next year, and there's a lot more out there to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"endless description, little to no plot","review":"I borrowed this book, and I'm glad for that. Had I bought it I would have been quite upset. Essentially I had to put it down as its dragging inability to keep a plot going amidst the flowery descriptions of ruins and quaint European towns beat any ability to keep the story going into the ground. Once you think the story picks itself up, it's immediately lost again in the narrator's flighty attempt to recall back story, which itself gets lost among letters and other third party recounting that, naturally, gets pushed further and further off in favor of physical description. I couldn't make it to the halfway point in this book for that reason alone. If one is looking for a romantic travelogue, this just might be your book. If it's plot and storytelling you're looking for go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as interesting as it likes to think it is","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I bought it while on vacation because I generally like historican fiction, but the characters and the way they speak are unrealistic. The book is structured as a story within a story within a story, so you are constantly reading characters' letters that either rehash the plot or skip over inconvenient bits. The characters are constantly saying things like \\"Naturally, you could understand my terror,\\" but they aren't very convincing.There's also a very cliched \\"love interest\\" angle. I finished it because the idea behind it is interesting (modern day historians in search of Dracula), but overall it's disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Historian","review":"After looking forward to starting this book , I found it a bit difficult and slow to get into. However, it did catch my interest soon enough and I found myself reading it whenever I had the chance.This novel follows Paul around eastern Europe in an attempt to find his lost mentor. A mysterious book with only a dragon printed at its center has started both Paul and this lost mentor researching Vlad Tepes, aka Drakula. Could Drakula still be \\"alive\\", almost 500 yrs after his \\"death\\"?Although a bit wordy at times, I found myself drawn into the story. I am quite glad I stuck with it, as this truly is a well written novel with a great storyline. Filled with historical facts, myths and legends, The Historian is a welcome addition to my bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Read","review":"I read this as a member of a book club. Most of us found it to be a very difficult read. Several of us did not manage to get all the way through it. I really believe that the editor could have slashed 100+ pages out of the book and the story would not have been negatively affected."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Dear Unfortunate Reader","review":"I am going to keep this review brief. I was expecting alot more from such a dynamic plot: A missing adviser caught in the mists of Dracula, Vlad the Impaler, and conspiracy. Rather I found long prose, empty characters, and overall a droll story. If anything I kept waiting for some exciting answers to arise but lost hope after 500 pages( and still a good 200 pages from the end) All culminating in sheer disappointment. If your're looking for a vampire thriller, or a look into the evil workings of medieval royalty like Vlad the Impaler, This is not your book. I do applaud Kostova in creating substantial historical context, nonetheless I was expecting a more fruitful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST ending I've ever read","review":"This book took me three months of casual reading (always just fifteen or twenty minutes before bed) to finish. It's waaay too long, and never got interesting enough to make me want to read it during the day (I saved my free time for better books).Just when things get interesting, you hit a wall...again and again...until the only reason you're still reading is to finish the damned thing.And when you do finish it, it is a MAJOR disappointment. Don't expect even a single character to find happiness in this book and don't expect the plot to actually be tied up and over.Maybe it ended that way to alert the reader to a sequel, but I couldn't care less about what happens to these characters anymore. It's all going to be sad and tragic anyway!The author shows signs of talent but she either has no editor or no idea how to end a book. It's like she got as tired of writing as we get of reading, and just quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information, slow pace","review":"While the premise of the book is an intriguing one, Kostova has thrown in so much superfluous information that the pace of the book is very slow. Da Vinci Code readers may buy this book thinking it might be similar, but it is NOT. The pace of Dan Brown's books is very quick and sucks the reader in. The Historian moves very slowly and Kostova devotes a great deal of ink to humanize her characters, but it doesn't work. I found myself skimming many chuncks of text to get to the action, as her descriptions are long and completely unnecessary. If you like mysteries that are not page-turners, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great, but then doesn't know what to do with itself","review":"I was very excited about reading this book, and I had heard much buzz about it. While I enjoyed the first half, during the second half the author seemed to have lost track of what she was doing or where she was going with the storyline. The ultimate climax was, well, for lack of a better word - anticlimactic. Ultimately, I feel this book was a waste of time. The only reason I give the book 2 starts instead of 1 is that it started out so well. As I believe this is the author's first book, I will hope for better in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"It was alright, I suggest reading Gary Jennings if you are looking for real historical fiction.This author didn't even go to Dracula country until AFTER she wrote the book and ABC's 20/20 paid for her to go. what's that all about? you want to call yourself a historian and write books based on history visit the place that you're talking about.she got $2 million for the book before she wrote it and is also making it into a movie...it's an alright book, but overall pretty kiddish too me. It'll be trendy and cheesy pretty soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like the Divinci Code","review":"Last night I finished reading \\"The Historian\\" and was very pleased overall with the novel. This novel read nothing like the Divinci code, as some people believe, and is far better written. The authors excellent verbal illustrations of the landscapes and geographics of the book were astounding. However, the ending I found to be slightly anticlimatic and basically cut short. There could of easily been another 100 pages and not even be at a slight risk of sounding long winded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brainy Suspense","review":"A mixture between mystery and horror, this novel features an entirely serious academic quest for that legendary (and, most of us believe, imaginary) monster, Dracula. The characters criss-cross Eastern Europe on a hunt for the vampire's tomb, and the majestic beauty of those lands is described so lovingly that readers may find themselves booking tickets. The author's structural choices -- most of the novel is told in flashbacks and letters -- add greatly to the tension and help to sustain it over the many, many pages. Sadly, after all of this fascinating buildup, the resolution is too easy and pat and left me really unsatisfied. However, the rest of the book was engrossing and enjoyable, and I look forward to Ms. Kostova's next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious beyond belief","review":"This has to be one of the biggest publishing hypes ever - a book that is mind-boggingly boring, badly-written drivel passed off as literature. Forget it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I read this book with high expectations, I had read a few reviews and was excited about the \\"Dracula Alive\\" subject. In the beginning, I still had that hope, once I hit the 200th page or so, I grew more and more frustrated, this book wasn't bone chilling, suspenseful, not an ounce of curiosity came over me, which seemed ridiculous, because we're talking about DRACULA BEING ALIVE! I couldn't continue reading as every page was a long drawn out description of her father, or culture whatever. I even tried to give the book a second chance by purchasing the audio version, but even then I skipped to the last CD just so I can get to the end. This book was way too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Great Facts Interwoven With Fictions and Poor Story","review":"There is a lot to like with this book...lots of historical facts woven into the tale, a really effective depiction of Dracula himself, some really fine decriptive pasages of both places and food, drink, etc.But, after an intriquing build up, the story truges slowly to a climax that is itself very poorly done. The pace slams to almost a halt, the levels of narrative just kind of play out without any real purpose in terms of the story, and the climactic confrontation with evil is just plain silly.After wading through the narrative---the book ceases to be a story for about 100 pages or so---the climax is so chock full of illogical co-incidence that it seems contrived to end the book quickly as an act of mercy.Some really good things here, but not a good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time or money","review":"I was very excited when I bought this book - I love history, vampires, fat ol' novels and all that..but this book was so painfuly long and lacked synonyms so badly that I couldn't but laugh! I got caught up in the whole marketing buzz, artifically created around this no-name author that I actually spent my $30 and purchased the book and then spent countless hours forcing myself to read it 'till the end. I was furious with my own self for buying into the whole - \\"This Week's Top Releases\\" in San Francisco Chronicle - nightmare. I am reading \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\" now (one reason being to get rid of the bitter taste in my mouth from Ms. Kostova's book)...and with every turn of a page in this brilliant book loaded with WRITING, I can't stop wondering why the hell did I wasted so much time reading The Historian!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"This is one of the worst books in this genre or really any genre that I've read in a long time. I was taken in by the premise--historians searching for the real Drakula and by Elizabeth Kostova's brilliant bio. The book has its moments and it is those glimmers of creativity and the premise that kept me going back until I finished it. Basically though I think it is overly ambitious, doesn't deliver and is in bad need of an editor (as one of the other reviewers mentions). I was sadly dissapointed and afterwards went in a desperate search of my own for a real thriller. I found one too. Ms. Kostova needs to work on her craft before another such adventure or she'll have very few readers indeed. As it stands I feel as though I've been vampired. The verbosity of Kostova and her ill-concieved, poorly realized book sucked the life out of me for the days it took to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....dead dialogue","review":"I have been attempting to read this book for the last few days and it has got some of the most boring dialogue I have ever encountered on the written page. Not only that, but the author is TELLING instead of SHOWING when it comes to the entire book. I don't feel any sympathy,or anything else for that matter, for the characters because they aren't written with any sense of feeling. She has put wooden words into their mouths so they feel to me like walking talking robots. If the characters had no names I would not be able to distinguish one from the other based on their inner strengths,weaknesses,or dialogue. For a fiction book to work there has to be differences between the charcters to create conflict....and there is none here.I don't know how this book got published, and the editor of it ought to be drawn and quartered.Don't read this book....instead go read some Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, who actually knows how to write a good 'vampire' fiction novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm bored","review":"I have only read a little more than one third of this book and I can't get up the gumption to read any more. This is very unlike me. Yes, the descriptions of landscapes and even mood of places and people seem very well done (why I rated more than just one star) but the book just goes on and on and on. Great descriptive writing, great descriptive writing, great descrptive writing, a tiny bit of story . . . A friend who I love discussing books with and who is a voracious reader loaned me The Historian, telling me I would love it. I am a little confounded that anyone could love it, or perhaps I am confounded with myself that I don't love it, but the whole thing is a mystery to me. Well, not the plot (I just don't care) but rather, how anyone could enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What could have been.","review":"I was so engrossed in this book, for the first half of it. Some where at the half way point, I was weighed down with unnecassary facts and triva. A lot of these dates, and points of reference did nothing to actually contribute to the overall story in my humble opinion. It was the same irritating feeling I had watching National Treasure, at some point in the movie, you've had enough dates, and obscure facts taking you to another dead end. Finally you just want to get on with the story. This was definitely not worth the hype, character development was great, however the actual implementation of the Vampire lore left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!","review":"SPOILER: (I hate spoilers, but I wish I had seen this one before reading this awful book)900 pages of ponderous searching for the Prince of Darkness when finally (mercifully) they discover his tomb. At last, the denouement, when we face Dracula's end game, when all those shadowy secrets are revealed, when the drama reaches a fever pitch! So what happens? They shoot him through the heart, he dies. No great battle, no real peril, no revelations, no creativity. LAME. After Kostova crafts this epic villain who has cheated death through the centuries via savage cunning and supernatural resources, she kills him in one silly paragraph. GAAAACK!A WASTE OF TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty Pleasure","review":"I usually enjoy books of substance, such as biographies, history, chronicles of discovery or classics of literature. And being a book snob, I don't usually read gothic mysteries. That said, once I opened the pages of The Historian , I must admit that I could not put it down , much like the book's protagonist, who finds a certain book very compelling. As Ms Kostova took me on an odyssey through ancient libraries and musty document rooms across Europe, her book held me in its occult spell for nearly straight 30 hours. I took breaks only for water, bathroom and quick snacks. I neglected work, family and exercise to arrive at its dusty denouement. I'm eagerly awaiting Elizabeth Kostova's next literary effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much HYPE, so little substance","review":"I like a thriller as well as the next person, but this booked didn't deliver. There are no new insights into Bram Stoker's charecters or mytholgy. Go back and read Stoker if you want to get a really good scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Read the glowing NY Times review and raced to buy it.....started it immediately and then trudged through it (taking time to read other better books along the way.) It wasn't deserving of the hype or of my reading time. E. Kostova didn't make me care about the characters or the plot line and the book is far too long for the thin story she has to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloooow","review":"Really like the premise of this book but it just moved so slow. Actually, I still haven't finished it and probably won't. I'm a pretty avid reader, and probably could of finished it in a couple days if it were a little more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good book.","review":"I read this book several years ago and LOVED it. It was Davinci Code meets Vampire and it was magic for me. When browsing ebooks I spotted the title and had to buy it immediately. I can't wait to read it again! I also had to share that this is one of those books that sticks with you even years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"the historian","review":"Read as an audio book. Fun combination of history, mystery, and fiction. Kept me hooked until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book","review":"I read somewhere that it took the author something like ten years to write this book and I can totally see it. The history is incredibly well researched. The story is so compelling that it seems to suck you in with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"You'll get more than halfway through this book before you realize you've been suckered. Page after page after page of expository dialogue will drag you through the mud with the promise of (SPOILER ALERT) meeting Dracula. You will meet him, and you will seriously wonder if you are the butt of a joke for having put in the work to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I read a different book.","review":"The author does a fantastic job of describing the landscapes our travelers experience - in excrutiating detail. I think the book could have been 33% shorter had she been more diligent with the story than describing the scenery, because the story, well, it's boring. The characters are lacking character, I don't buy the love story, nor do I buy the Dracula being described (again, lacking LOTS of character). The author has obviously done her research on the times and places she writes about, but she leaves much to be desired in the story department."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth the hype","review":"I read the hype for this book and could not wait to get it. I got it, tried to read it(took me 2 months) and am so disappointed. The title is correct, a bunch of history and not much else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book's strengths were its own undoing","review":"We're a book club of ladies (hence the XX) from the Philippines. We've been meeting bimonthly for over five years.We liked the historical background, the exotic settings, the consistency of the clues and the creepiness, but the book's strengths were its own undoing - the historical narrative was rambling, the clues were too pat, too parallel and too neat, and Dracula's motives were wanting - all that effort and blood-taking just to maintain his archives? Our average rating, 3.9 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say about the Historian...","review":"Being my first vampire novel, the historian was a perfect read for me as the subject is not just the dracula character and more about period history as the title. It is truly a journey with the main characters involved in an elaborate chase more like the Da Vinci Code. The impaler makes enough appearances to entice and therefore the novel doesn't get all gore and science fictionary. A nice story about a father telling and showing his daughter through their vacation travels and their love of books their family's origins and helping her learn about her mother. Reading this world was fun and enlightening for me. Bordering on a 3.5 stars for me as novel because it starts slowly but has fast moments. Prose is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the sequel?!","review":"Not being too familiar with vampire lore, I found this book to be interesting without being too graphic. I love to travel in the books I read, and love to learn about places I've never been. (For example, I was unaware that Budapest was made up of two cities, Buda and Pest with the Danube River dividing (or uniting) them.) There were many stories woven throughout the book, and I was amazed how most of them resolved within the last 150 or so pages. Also I liked that the chapters were short so I could stop reading when necessary and pick it up again easily. I would greatly enjoy a sequel, and it seems Ms. Kostova has left a few loose ends for such a possibility. The perspective from which The Historian was written was unique and held my interest without being confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Original, If Not A Bit Long","review":"The author deserves credit for taking a tired genre and invigorating it with real-life history. She has taken the very real and very grotesue historic figure of the Vlad Tepes and melded him with the mythical vampire creature from Bram Stoker's famous novel, creating not only an original take on the vampire myth, but a fun ride through Eastern European history. You can tell the author definately did her homework. I have two complaints: the author had so many supporting characters and so many different tangents that it made the novel far too long and the ending was a major letdown after so much build-up. That being said, The Historian is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to finish! :(","review":"I bought the book in an airport, wanting to be entertained for the whole flight. It took me months to finish because it was NOT a page turner. The whole plot was an interesting concept. B-U-T it was S--L--O--W. The characters jumped from modern day, to 1477, to 1940's, character to character, and hard to figure out whose story you were reading at the time. I really like this type of story, but it is not a book that I kept after reading it, and didn't recommend it to any of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Adventure","review":"I loved this book! Great pace, kept me going and I couldn't get to the ending soon enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big, big bore","review":"I feel so bad that I was duped by media hype. What a waste of good time and resource. I do see that the author did quite a research before writing this novel. But only that much is good. If this is to be a novel, it should have something good in it. One of the worst books I ever read and I only wish someone could have advised me not to buy this book before I picked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I recommend you pass on this book","review":"At 656 pages this book is far too long. It's unfortunate because I see the book it could've been had it been heavily edited. While some parts of the book were interesting, most of it was boring and long winded."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Crime...","review":"Never before has hype proven so unjustified. This book is terribly disappointing. Such a wonderful premise. Such an awful execution. And it makes me angry that the publishing industry is making it a bestseller by manipulating readers (like me) who really would like an intelligent and gripping novel. Really, there is no point to this novel. Nothing happens. Undeveloped characters travel from place to place. Uninteresting characters eat and eat. And ridiculously dull \\"bad guys\\" chase ridiculously dull \\"good guys\\". Blah. Blah. Blah. I wish I could hold someone accountable for the money I spent on an absolutely awful novel. Please, do yourself a favor and think twice before you purchase this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"So many, many pages, so very little of interest. I had no feeling at all for the characters, whether they were lost, found, frightened, in love - I didn't care. The story boring, and the outcome disappointing, though sort of amusingly vain - a tribute to all withdrawn bibliophiles who are obsessed with some obscure, picayune area of history; \\"O' ye twaddling bookworms, the great ghoul Dracula himself wants YOU!\\" Cute.Those reviewers here who want to dismiss my disappointment as the sentiment of a \\"low-brow\\" American idiot, I feel compelled to say in my defense that I am an avid reader of history, biography and non-fiction, as well as enjoying such writers as Dan Brown (\\"Da Vinci Code\\") and Umberto Eco (\\"Name of the Rose\\"). I stuck it out to the end of its 642 pages, but I did not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and annoying Historian","review":"An extremely long and shallow story about Dracula that I personally could have done without."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-hyped","review":"This was the most poorly written novel I've read in a long time. The plot is fascinating, but the characters are mostly morons and the author is operating under the impression that EVERY noun requires at least one adjective. It might be a good yarn at 250 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is English This Writer's First Language?","review":"I'll dispense with a summary of what happens in this novel as others have done it thoroughly and well in other reviews. I don't usually write reviews. Yet, I feel compelled to post my two cents' worth because I was so disappointed. The writing in this book is atrocious and destroys a perfectly intriguing notion. I'm not being facetious when I wonder if it was translated from another language. And just so you have some idea what else I'm reading and comparing this to at the moment: '1776' by McCullough; Bruen's 'The Magdalen Martyrs'; 'Specimen Days' by Cunningham; 'Memories of Ice' by Erikson. If you still feel compelled to check out 'The Historian' then by all means do so... go check it out of the library. Even buying this at a huge discount is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dreadfully bad book","review":"This book was such a disappointment. After hearing all the hype, I was excited to make a new discovery. But this book is nearly unreadable. Obviously, a great deal of research went into The Historian -- but clearly not much editing. A classic case of too much information, not enough of a compelling, driving story line and characters that are boring, flat and indistinct. When more than half of a 700-page book consists of a couple of folks sitting around talking -- and it's a vampire story! -- there is a serious problem for the general reader. Sorry, it's not interesting, it's not scary, it's not suspenseful. If you're looking for middle European history and vampire legends, you'd be better off looking through the stacks for real dissertations and research. If you're looking for a good read, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hysterian","review":"Great researcher, terrible storyteller without a clue about dramatic development or the ability to deliver a thrill. It's so hard to slog through 600-odd pages of story within a story within a story, that you forget the hundreds of annoying and overblown sentences and passages that break the cardinal rule about \\"showing\\" emotions, dramatic moments, etc., rather than \\"telling\\" them with mind-clogging adjectives. Also, one of the leading characters (it's amazing I just finished the book but have already forgotten his name: Rossi's student, Helen's lover/husband is an absolute wimp whose heart is always \\"trembling, palpitating,\\" whatever.) And who really believed (or cares) he loved his mentor Rossi so much he'd chase him all over. (In grad school, I wished my mentor could have been spirited away to hell!)Do yourself a favor: see Coppola's movie and reread Bram Stoker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I quit sooner than many... snoozer","review":"Yes - marketing will give you a best seller. This book has been marketed brilliantly and reviews placed everywhere, but the truth is... it isnt really very good.When asked by my father, an avid reader like me, what I thought of the book, I said \\"It's amazing. I have started it 5 times, and each time I am fast asleep within 5 pages.\\" I decided at that rate to quit by page 30.I am a lover of vampire lore and the literature that explores it. This is an incredibly disappointing book, and the publishers shoulod be sued for mal-marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Historian AGAIN","review":"This is my second reading of The Historian. I read it in 2005 and then shared it with my daughter. It is her favorite book. I read The Swan Thieves recently and enjoyed it so much, I decided to read The Historian again.It truly is a very great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"I downloaded the Kindle version of this book which I have read like 5 times. It's an intellectual travelogue approach to the Dracula legend that is more scholarly in its approach, multi-layered and very engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horror","review":"Pages and pages of agony - no flow to the story or the characters involved. I found myself wondering who was saying what. And what are all of those letters and postcards supposed to be doing? Too, too much description and not enough intrigue and certainly not an easy book to follow. How did it get on the top 10 list? I was so disappointed. 0 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me Jump on the Boring Band Wagon","review":"Vlad Tepes is an interesting subject so it's a shame this is such a tedious and long winded book.The dialogue sucks. One can suspend disbelief in the incredible in a Sci fi or any other fantastic story but the ordinary must be believable, Kostova has a interesting premis involving Tepes here but the everyday world she creates is just not credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"Read the reviews when the book came out and bought the book with high expectations. The characters seemed undeveloped and stereotypical. Eastern bloc pols, Oxford dons, and medieval monks all behave as the characatures they are. The \\"letter\\" format struck me as unrealistic. Does anyone really write letters with that level of conversational detail? The plot twists were often unbelievable (an \\"amnesia drink\\"--come on) and contrived (everyone just happens to speak English when the need arises.) The suspense never materialized (I wonder what those monks are carrying around in their cart. Could it be a ----? Yep, thought so.) Finally, the time it takes to get to the last chapter is so out of proportion to the final reward that one should probably look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Historian with No Pulse","review":"I just finished this fiasco. Like many of you, I bought it after reading a few glowing reviews. I sincerely hope those reviewers are spending their kickback money wisely. Ms. Kostova could not plot her way out of, or breathe life into a paper bag. Cut through the pretentious historical blather (which takes a seriously deep cut), and you've got \\"Scooby and the Gang Meet the Vampire.\\" Only, much less interesting. Ms. Kostova's characters make Fred and Shaggy look like Stephen Dedalus and Leopold Bloom. I'm going to re-read Interview With the Vampire and watch a few Buffy episodes just to remind myself that all fiction about the undead is not as lifeless as the Historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoops! What did I miss?","review":"I read the SWAN THIEF on audio and somewhat enjoyed it. I then got this one on audio. I went one book too far.The plot kept wandering so much that I lost track of who was looking for who and I even quit caring.This is not one I will be telling friends to read. Too convoluted. But.....I did finish it and at the end said...\\"so what?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little too late","review":"I absolutely love Bram Stoker's Dracula and so I couldn't wait to read this book. What a waste! It is soooo slooowww. I had to push myself to pick up the book in order to finish reading it. It doesn't pick up until about the 45th chapter! About the last 1/5 of the book it does get interesting, but by then it's just too little too late. AND don't get me started with the disappearance of The Historian's wife, it is such a dumb reason for her to leave her husband and small child..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This novel is not a thriller. It was not suspenseful. It was painful to read and I had to force myself not to skip through it. I kept thinking it was going to get better and after all the \\"positive reviews\\" it was such a let down. I am glad to be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charmin in Book Form","review":"Wow was this book a bore and I TEACH HISTORY!!!! Of the 600 pages about 100 of them actually progressed the story while the rest was obviously filler. Even more frustrating, after you read 600 pages of crap the ending happens in three pages. The love story is rushed and without release, the plot moves so slowly I fell asleep more than once and while the basic idea is interesting the implementation of it lacks motivation or skill. I finished this book because it was a gift from my husband. Had I purchased it myself I would have gladly thrown it away without growing old reading it. Had I been able to give this book zero stars I would have. There is more passion and personality here in my review than in the pages of this book. I now keep this book on my shelf in case we are ever snowed in and need toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires, Crosses and Garlic--Oh My","review":"I was really looking forward to this book after hearing all the hype. Sadly, I had to force myself to finish it. While Elizabeth Kostova has obviously done extensive historical research, it seemed that she tried to cram far too much of it into this novel. The characters and the circumstances that they find themselves in are just completely ridiculous. For example, if you found yourself in a life or death situation involving vampires, would you take the time to hand write pages and pages of letters to someone who may or may not find them? Didn't think so. Also, a certain character that we really look forward to meeting in the book ends up being nothing more than a somewhat creepy, glorified librarian. Wholly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could NOT put it down!!!","review":"This is not my kind of book at all. I found a very old copy at a thrift store for a dollar. It was a large book and about history in some way, I thought, so I purchased it. I didn't even read the inside of the cover...I just started reading. PHENOMENAL!!! I loved it!!! I couldn't put it down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pffft","review":"This is one of those sucker books. It starts out strong, good character development, a strong story, beautiful imagery and then about half way threw just chokes. The story becomes overly contrived and the plot line becomes increasingly lame. I just can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, dull, interminable Vampire ripoff","review":"I wanted to like this book, but I've invested at least a week on it and have barely made it through 100 pages. I hate to give up a book only 1/6th of the way through, but Elizabeth Kostova simply doesn't know how to write. All the key characters speak in the same overly mannered, contrived, and pedantic voice: a teenaged girl sounds identical to her middle-aged father, who sounds identical to his former university advisor. The Historian drones on and on without a trace of suspense, feeling, or excitement. This is definitely not good airplane reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula shows up on page 712 and it's still boring","review":"Seriously. Reading this book was an exercise in discipline and effort. It took months and months to get thru it because it is SO BORING. I do not understand why this book has so much buzz and interest. I only read it because I'd foolishly bought it in hard back and I was darned if I was going to waste all that money.Save yourself. Use your time doing something else, something productive, anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm an English professor, and I hate it when my students say things like \\"this book was too long. It could have been 100 pages shorter and said the same thing.\\" Well, this book could have been about 400 pages shorter. You can see every plot twist coming from a mile away. Myriad trips to various locales don't add substantially to the plot or provide significant historical background. The characters are practically caricatures: all of the villains are dressed in black; the leading man and the woman hate each other at first, and then (shockingly) fall for each other; the communist bureaucrats are lifeless; exotic but benevolent \\"helpers\\" appear along the way. I'm more angry with myself than anyone else for sticking with this book to the bitter and inconsequential end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the view: \\"this book is no Da Vinci Code\\". Not that I'm a fan of DVC, just this book's thrill level is simply no comparison. The most amazing part of the book is with one and only one very simple theme, the author can drag on and on and on through 900 pages! I listened to the audio version and almost dosed off during my driving, the dryness of the narrators of the audio book is no help either. I call it a driving hazard! Honestly I considered quitting in the middle, however this is not my style, plus I already invested so much time on it, so I finally finished it. The feeling after finishing this 900 page book? Empty!The best part of the deal is this is borrowed from the library, not only I didn't spend any money on it, it didn't take up my valuable bookshelf space either after I returned it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, awful binding","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, but was really unhappy with the binding that was used. The book literally fell apart within a week of me buying it.Has anyone else had this problem?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...","review":"\\"The Historian\\" is a pretty good read, save for a few nit-picks. While quite an admirable start for a first time writer, Kostova resorts to a few tired cliches and strange leaps in character development at times. However, when she hits her stride, the book becomes a true page-turner. I whole-heartedly encourage anyone that likes \\"DaVinci Code\\" to check this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"This book limps along promising and promising a good story, and only manages to deliver a mediocre one. It goes back and forth between three time periods, Dracula's, the parents of the writer, and the writer. Most of the action takes place in letters. I would not buy another Kostova book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great farce","review":"Expecting another 'DaVinci Code' after reading rave reviews I was very disappointed to find a real dud, Even though the author keeps telling us that this is so grisly and terrifying - REALLY, you should be scared.I hope that by the time the movie is made the producers will go with it as a comedy. Can't you just see Johnny Depp as Dracula in full camp gear glowering, hovering, creeping - being crazy scary. The interview with the undead Rossi in his coffin could be a classic howl. Lots of great scenery though."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you Need Help Going to Sleep","review":"I wish I had read all the reviews before paying for this slow, tedious, boring book that I thought was going to be a thriller about Dracula. Don't waste your money--following the musings of a young teenage girl following her father around Eastern Europe with little action is not my idea of a good summer read. I'll take the original Dracula by Bram Stoker. Save your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Gripping, intelligent and artful. Her writing is perfect in that she gets the picture across without overdoing the prose. Yes, lots of history but again, done in a manageable way. It took me two days to read, cover to cover and I promptly recommended it to everyone I knew."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want it to end!","review":"If you didn't have any curiosity about Eastern Europe before, you will after reading this book. Complex, elegant, and scholarly, this is no cheap thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I couldn't get passed the 100th page. It was so slow moving in the beginning. I don't know what the fuss is all about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Very disapointing ending after a long buildup. Characterization is okay, but not brilliant. This book could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I ordered a NEW (not used) copy of The Historian and I wanted the 2009 printing as pictured in the ad. What arrived in the mail was clearly a used copy. The front cover is ripped and stained and it has a different cover than what is pictured in their ad. I believe the seller did not provide me with what they promised. I will return the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition too expensive","review":"Whatever you think about this book, the price is too high for a downloaded book. At this price you might as well just get the paperback - or better yet - borrow a friend's or get it from the library.Avoid buying downloads of books costing more than $9.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"very literate, intelligent vampire book - a rarity","review":"i really enjoy horror books but they are usually horribly written. it's so rare to find a vampire book that's absorbing and not insulting to read. (salems lot was, in my opinion, terrific.) yes, the author enjoys delving into history, in which she's very well informed. and, yes, this slows the narative a bit. but i thought it gave the old vampire tale a new slant. it didn't ruin the book for me. i found it interesting. i can't abide the ann rice stuff. so if you like that, you won't like this. but if you like reading woolf, james, dickens and vampire tales, like me, i think you should give it a shot. i looked forward to reading it each night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but a bit plodding","review":"Yes, some wonderful history was portrayed in this book. Yes, the characters were fairly written. No, I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would have. Between the history and what one might call the exciting and active bits, the story hardly picked up its feet.There was a bit of rush-rush in parts then a dragging step through out other parts book. I finished it because I simply could not stand, not finishing a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but too gruesome","review":"I think the author writes well and I enjoyed reading about the relationship between the narrator and her father as they travel through Europe, but I was just ultimately and absolutely turned off by the gruesome subject matter of Vlad the Impaler - I read 100 pages and then decided not to subject myself anymore to this subject - esp not for another 500 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't read it yet! Can't Review without reading.","review":"Amazon-book reviews should be voluntary, not solicited via a review request. It takes time to read a book and your timing on sending out this request is far too early. Product reviews can be done quickly but book reviews should be removed from this process. It forces a low review rating and is not fair to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Pretentious and TOTALLY BORING!","review":"I originally gave this book 3 stars based only on its length and potential,and now I have given up on it entirely at page 90. The author is successful in that it does sound as though it was written by a 16 year old girl, but this is a girl who is in dire need of a good editor. How can anyone have liked this, it is TOTALLY BORING! The Encyclopedia Britannica on Vlad the Impaler is better than this tripe. By the time I read as far as page 6 I was already dubious. The main character states on page 1 that she is 16 in 1972 and already by page 6 she is stating that in her 50's she returns to the Slovenian Alps every few years! She won't even be 50 until sometime this year! and the book was published in June 2005. I realize this is a small point but I suspect the rest of the detail is as faulty. This further detracts from any enjoyment of the weak story line. All in all a really dreadful book. I am amazed it was even published."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Historian","review":"It's a great story. I purchased this, becasue the one I own is just paper version. But the condition of the book wasn't that good. Actually, the main backbond was tearing out and book was collapsing.

It touches every aspect that contributes to really understand a great artist, probably the greatest in history of Art, with no distinction. And it's done with extreme clarity and attractivity. When my son saw that I had no more in my hands the great red book ask me why hadn't I continued. I answered him, \\"because I already read it and will do it again; it's uneasy to abandon it\\". After reading the book one becomes more serious over a matter that being extremely serious is dealed by many people unseriously, wrongly and stupidly. This book teaches, between many perspectives, that artists are suposed to be managed by their art, not by their personalities. The example of what have said Solti, a clear jew, is illuminating."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY NO OTHER BRAND","review":"LOTS OUT THERE CHEAPER....BUT BE CAREFUL FOLKS....YOU MAY HAVE YOUR PICK BREAKING ON YOU AND WORSE, BREAKING AND PIECES FLYING APART AS YOUR DIGGING......

Drawing on original sources in several languages, Guthke deftly analyes the major works about life and intelligence beyond the earth, both in fiction and in scientific speculation. He captures the spirit of each age as its intellectuals confronted the question of whether or not we are alone. He describes the encounter with the alien, as either an enemy or a guardian, as the philosophical and imaginative adventure of modern times; we are exploring the last frontier we can think of. Originally published in German in 1983, the book has been ably translated into English."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice set of songs","review":"A very wellproduced CD overall.

As the weeks passed I could not forget the authentic characters or Richard Yates intriguing and haunting writing style. Bios on him say he is a forgotten American author. I don't know why. He is worthy of being remembered! His work is ironic, thoughtful, and powerful. Although he reminds me a little of F. Scott Fitzgerald, whom he clearly admired, his style is very much his own. I really enjoyed \\"Evening on the Cote d'Azur\\" and \\"The Best of Everything\\". He writes about people who try to do the right things in life, but too often fall short. There is a detached observer that warns the reader to live more aware lives or wind up like these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden gem","review":"I too wondered where this author had been hidden. This book is a must for the contemporary American short story fan - Yates offers a painfully sharp snapshot of human motivation and emotion that will stop you in your tracks. If you follow the likes of John Updike, Richard Ford, Lorrie Moore, TC Boyle, you'll want to read what Yates has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful storyteller","review":"Richard Yates is a top-notch writer. It's hard to understand why he's not more popuilar. Maybe because there's so much sadness in his stories. More importantly, they are rich and true to life, showing a rare and deep understanding of the human condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dark Side of the 1950's","review":"When soldiers came home from the war, they wanted everything to be normal, and that's just what they got. But buried underneath all the normalcy was human nature, roiling. This is America at its uncomfortable peak.My favorite stories are about soldiers and veterans--especially the ones taking place at TB wards in VA hospitals. The men who survived the Depression and fought the war are reduced to waiting and coughing in crowded wards, watched over by nurses and doctors. You could almost say, if you went a little too far, that these stories capture the uniformity and sterility of the '50's in a nutshell."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE RING OF TRUTH. LIFE AS IT IS!","review":"A marvelous collection of short stories.I enjoyed it even more than his outstanding novel,\\"Revolutionary Road\\".Each of these slices of life caused me to recognize the truth of the interactions and the ultimate problems of human communication. As Richard Russo notes in his introduction, Yates focuses on our dreams and aspirations; mostly to be frustrated by the reality of day to day living.

All of the tracks are in Japanese, except for tracks 5 and 6, which are karaoke. The music on this CD is great, despite the title. I thought that this might be a bit too childish for me to enjoy, but I was wrong: the music is upbeat and fun to listen to, and doesn't even hint at being too \\"kiddy\\". I especially like track 4, mamanodaijinapokemon (which means \\"Momma's Favourite Pokémon\\" i think!). This track has really good lyrics and there's a superb guitar solo near the end of it.This CD is a must for anyone who liked the Japanese short, and comes highly recommended to all. Remember, it's likely that the soundtrack for the US version of the short will be rewritten, so you'll never hear any of this music at the cinema or on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Remember Correctly....","review":"Others have described the plot detail, so I'll just say this.

The framing of the book is a little unusual, with a long introduction in the present and then a fairly long and pointless epilogue.As a good companion to this book, I recommend The Perfect Summer: England 1911, Just Before the Storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply psychological novel","review":"Reminiscent of BRIDESHEAD REVISITED, THE GO-BETWEEN is a very similar coming of age tale.

The writer tells the history of the relationship between the Jewish population and their neighbors and German governnment. It ends in 1933, and points out ways in which the Jews tried to assimilate but were never able to please their government enough. It opened my eyes to 200 years of life before Hitler and how he was a cog in the machinery of the sickness of anti semitism.

If that is what you want, this is the book. Period.Note: while Pfitzinger's Road Racing for Serious Runners and Daniels' Running Rormula are equally good books for competitive runners, they focus on racing a variety of distances, so the marathoning information is understandably limited.

However, the whole book does not have any example regarding the transparency model. In Appendix G, the example G.3 (same as the one in Version 1.3) shows a default opaque model.

The lead actor is hysterical and is sort of a cross between a young Mr. Bean and one of the Bay City Rollers!lol! It's truly a undiscovered gem for the U.S. and deserves a lot of credit for it's honesty and realistic viewpoint.I haven't seen this DVD, but I know I will be buying it and I will add information as needed after I see it first hand.

To name some points. It does explain well some general structural issues in the media.I heard a great interview with Mr. Gitlin on NPR a couple of years ago which prompted me to buy the book soon after. I was disappointed to read a more or less uncritical analysis of the media structure or how media constantly censors out this type of information \\"that's [not] fit to print\\" while distracting everyone with dumb advertisements.

But Gitlin isn't brave. He admits, honestly, up front, that he will reach few conclusions, and merely wants to lay out what we face each day on the streets, on TV, and on the net. What follows is a stream-of-consciousness depiction of life today. I want more than that from Gitlin. I want his conclusions, not some lame statement that he hasn't reached any yet. He's not getting any younger. Lots of other fabulous thinkers have failed at this stage of their lives.

Being an American with Italian heritage, I see this as great music from some great works of cinema. The fact is that Italians have been known to be in a mob here and there AND we're known to have some great music and performers. Mob Hits II features non-Italian music and it is lacking something compared to this one.

So when I heard about this set I was just thrilled. This set has almost all you could want as far as the traditional italian music is concerened. I gave it 5 stars but there are only 2 minor problems. One, this could have fit on one CD instead of two 30-min CDs. That just seemed like more of a reason to get more money. Two, while it's understandable that the licensing for the \\"Godfather Waltz\\" from the movie prevented the original from being on the Cd, there is no excuse for the lousy remake at the end of disc one. They should have left it off.But the Cd is filled with the rich sounds of Dean Martin, Louie Prima, Al Martino, Jerry Vale, and more. Its a great album to listen to in the car or while your having a meal or just whenever you feel like it. It represents the mob movies well and I can't wait for Mob Hits 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 CDs = 64 Minutes!!","review":"A 2 Disc set where the CDs are 32 minutes each?? What a scam!!

You get re-makes or artists that didn't sing the hit song on the album. Here you have neither as these are the originals and it's beautiful music by those who made them into hits.

I prefer this style of writing-it was comforting and I felt like I really knew these women and they wanted the best outcome for me.

This book is tongue-in-cheek and is sometimes offensive to men and the women who love them. It lacks the science needed to help couples succeed and doesn't provide any new information to make it worthwhile.The best book out there and at a third less cost is \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" (ISBN 1569243719). It's written by a reproductive endocrinologist (a fertility patient himself) and a freelance journalist (his patient) and provides a step-by-step balanced and well researched account of what treatment is like and what readers can do to iron out the kinks they come across. It's easy to read, insightful, and humorous when appropriate. It follows a number of patients through their ordeals, addresses the latest cutting edge technologies and those in the pipeline, and is much more supportive than this book.Bottom-line, if you need a book on infertility, \\"A Few Good Eggs\\" ain't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"For anyone battling infertility and the emotional roller coaster that comes along with it, this book is for you.

I have since passed this book on to a friend; I'm not someone that recommends lots of books. In fact, I don't even BUY that many, it has to be really good.

Instead, I found the book to be condescending and blaming. There's an entire chapter called \\"The Real Deal\\" where they pretty much list all the reasons why it's all your fault that you are infertile. The advice they give is flippant and unhelpful. There is very little specific medical information. Their best advice for coping techniques was get more sleep and \\"reflect on what you really want in life.\\" There were a few funny lines. But it feels as if the authors have not made peace with their experiences and are taking it out on us! The one thing that did make me feel better was when I threw the book against the wall!Instead, try reading \\"Conquering Infertility\\" by Dr. Alice Domar."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not laughing!","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. Not only did it lack in technical medical information, but I found it to be harsh and unsupportive.

I looked forward to hearing other women's views of infertility. But, I was very disappointed in it. The women focus a lot on weight. As a first time IVFer I was concerned enough about using injectibles and whether or not the cycle would result in a healthy baby. To hear these women -the weight would be the worst of the ordeal. They talked on and on about how much they gained. And yes I gained weight, but it is hardly what the process of IVF was all about. There was a lot of trivial talk about nonsense in this book. And in the end the women never pursued ART pocedures and wound up pregnant. I have sympathy for all women stuggling to have a baby. However, I find it difficult to take opinions about IVF from women who have not gone through the experience. I wish those of you trying to concieve the best of luck in your journeys. I didn't benefit from this book, but maybe you will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting and judgemental","review":"If you have been struggling to conceive, skip this book. From the title and reviews of this book, I expected a funny, honest view of the trials and tribulations of infertility, but instead found that these authors were more interested in judging their friends' life choices, as well as berating themselves and other women who delayed having a family, than they were in providing helpful information with a humorous twist. There's none of that. Instead, prepare to feel worse about your infertility. While it's true that a woman's fertility diminishes after age 35, the last thing that those struggling with infertility need is another reason to blame themselves. This book was insulting and depressing. If I wasn't already ok with my own situation, I think this book could have really pushed me over the edge. I hope I can spare someone else the mistake of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an every day view","review":"In general I have found that books on infertility fall into two categores: inspirational and medical. This book has a different sort of twist. It is a well-written book by two veterans of the infertility/miscarriage battle who have set out to give us a \\"real life\\" perspective on the medical journey that is infertility. They draw from their personal experiences, those of others they have met, as well as medical knowledge to present a well-rounded view on many topics related to infertility and miscarriage. I do believe they are critical about a number of things in the book (including women's weight and age), and that is probably wasted criticism, as the vast majority of readers of this book will already have begun their fertility battle, and it is too late to turn back the clock.

I'm afraid \\"girlfriend guides\\" are too much reality for me. I'm not one to read gossip rags, watch reality TV shows, or rubberneck every fender bender.I have lots of girlfriends and not one of them would appreciate THIS type of book.My husband and I found a couple that we believe are more useful like \\"What to Do When You Can't Get Pregnant\\" and the \\"Couples Guide to In Vitro Fertilization\\".

This one insulted me, and made me feel that my infertility was something to laugh about.I agree with other comments here . . . don't waste your money on this one.

It wasn't a total waste of money, but didn't really address what I was looking for.

These two seemed to want to just chastise you for not grabbing the first guy you found at 18 and starting to have kids. I also found them a little pompous (as in yea - I had fertility problems but now look at me I have two kids, ha ha). Any woman who is going through infertility does not need this sort of info. I found it almost cruel. However, I could have ignored the stupid criticisms if there was any really useful info in the book. There wasn't. Most of it was very basic.

This one is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No science, all errata","review":"The hard evidence to back up the Two Chicks opinions on why women are infertile relies more on their limited personal opinions than on solid research from a medical standpoint.Much of the book is repeated in order to stretch it out I would presume.I really didn't care for the finger pointing by these aging hens that young American women are self absorbed hedonistic twits and that's why they're infertile years later.That's a simplistic analogy and doesn't contribute anything of value, save for snarky humor.Also one of the chicks commented that men who like thin lithe women must be gay.How weird. Guess she's fat and wants to think anyone not hot for her is gay.There is a plethora of fantastic books handling the topic of infertility and when to have children much better than this featherweight fluff.I'm happily single and young (under 30) and balk at the scare mongering these two old biddies dish up."},{"rating":"1","title":"good recording, poor perfomance","review":"This is music for a film without feelings. Too many instrumentals make us think it is a film of a composer, not of a girl.

I wanted this device to eliminate the extra catchlight produced by the D300's pop-up flash when used in Commander mode. The SG-31R indeed prevents the extra catchlight, but it also seems to reduce the effective distance of the infrared trigger. Since I tend to shoot portraits with a fairly long lens from across the studio, this sometimes causes inconsistent firing in my background flash. Easy to workaround once I noticed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon SG-31R","review":"Product as described and works as designed. It is a little difficult to remove from the camera.

However it was so dramatically and shocking that I couldn't stop reading. I wasn't able to imagne that the father sold his own kids to a foreign country and married them to strangers without asking them. It was unbelievable for me that such a cruelty is possible. It was disgusting that neither the British nor the Yemeni embassy did anything to help the poor two girls. Only with the help of their mother and a lot of puplicity Zana was able to leave the Yemen.

There were chapters on cities, recording studios and guitars that touched Mustaine's life, but the reader was always left wondering about how they related specifically to the artist. The interpretations of lyrics were interesting to read, as were some details of his life, but I questioned the validity of the facts as the author complains several times that there was only one interview with Mustaine. What made me want to throw this book into the fire was the atrocious grammar. Obviously it was translated, but before a book is published, doesn't someone check the grammar at least at a cursory level? Despite the negatives, I admit I'm not sorry I bought the book.....but I also don't regret buying those jittery handed Japanese videos of Megadeth's live concerts, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Ready to Spend 8 bucks?","review":"I guess with any 'unauthorized' biography, the reader is at the mercy of the author. In this case, the author is very obviously a fan and very enthusiastic about this project.As other reviewers have pointed out, there is no other biography on Mustaine at this time, so anything is better than nothing. It's unfortunate that this was not done better. The translation is atrocious and there is so much fluff (Mustaine's college, Jackson dealers etc), this person didn't seem to have done any research beyond her interviews with Mustaine.Nice try. I hope someone else does it properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing translation, but she tried...","review":"This book was authored by a woman from Argentina and might have been better in Spanish. The English is often garbled and the book is poorly organized, with superfluous material like a chapter on a community college Mustaine attended and a 6-page list of Jackson guitar dealers. But there are some nice photos and occasional direct quotes from people associated with the band to make it OK to blow [$] on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was a bio??","review":"This book reads like a magazine spread on the band in argentina. It doesnt give you any or very little biographical info on mustaine and the author keeps on going off on tangents of giving you background information on things unmegadeth related. The only part of the book worth reading is towards the end where there is a little mustaine interview. I only read it all the way through because of my interest in the band and I kept on hoping it would get better. I hope dave or another author write a true biography of the birth of megadeth and give fans a real read.

It contains many worksheets that would be useful for group decision-making processes. Unlike most organizing manuals, this one is clear, concise, and very helpful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, As Far As It Goes","review":"Organizing for Social Change is a fantastic primer to leading change in a community or organization. It is a rich resource with more helpful insights and instructions than most books of its type. However, having myself worked with groups seeking deep or systemic change, it is light on the leadership dynamics that make such change possible. It assumes a high level of competency and proficiency in a number of areas, and the simple fact is that people need time and guidance to become comfortable leading change.

She enjoys the music and dancing but most of all she seems to enjoy the \\"sunshine\\" when it squeals! However, this video, \\"Nursery Rhymes\\" has less music and more \\"talking\\", not by the tubbies but by the narrators reciting the rhymes. There is also more time spent inside the tubbies \\"home\\" which is less colorful for young viewers. My daughter doesn't respond to it with as much interest as she does the others.

King Pleasure and the Biscuit Boys crooning two nursery rhymes in a quasi-Sinatra swing style to which we always turn on the stereo. There is one segment late in the video involving Tinky Winky sliding up and down and up and down and up and down... Needless to say, it gets mind-numbingly, soul-squelchingly, spirit-crushingly repetitious. All other segments, though, are well enough done, with pleasing crooning to be (gasp) enjoyable even for parents.

These essays reveal de Wohl, hitherto best known as a prolific novelist, to be a vigorous champion of things human and divine.With sound knowledge and wise wit, de Wohl makes no pious apologies for bein a man of faith in the modern world.

After a 3 hour rehearsal there was plenty of rosin on my strings, but only a couple flecks on my cello. It also seems to not change with the temperature fluctuations. Oh, and the protective container is top notch. I'm a college student and it gets thrown in my backpack or music bag and books put on top of it, etc. It has not even cracked.

I found that I played it more often than my 1000$ fender telecaster. It stayed in tune and had a great vintage sound. It buzzed a tiny little bit on the low e string on the higher frets, but that's really a non-factor. All in all, I was very happy with this guitar.

The play has had over half an hour slashed from the script, and what they do bother to perform has been over designed and over directed. Alex Jennings and Lindsay Duncan are the only at all known performers in it and I predict the rest will remain obscure. What was Adrian Noble (Normally an excellent director) and the RSC thinking hiring these ...? It features the most unattractive Bottom I've seen since Dennis Franz's nude scene on \\"NYPD Blue\\"! The addition of a child \\"Dreaming\\" the play is ghastly and intrusive. In the \\"Pyramus & Thisbe\\" scene, which SHOULD be the comic highlight, they play Pyamus's death for pathos and it's beyond embarrassing. Skip this turkey and see the Kevin Kline film instead, which is gorgeous, well acted and sexy, although they play Thisbe's death for pathos. MISTAKE!!!!!

The problems is they are a pain to fill and keep coins in. I had assumed that i didn't need to worry about this, because i plan to keep the coins vertical in albums and didn't anticipate bending that would lead the coins to flip out. but, if you have the holders horizontal and put in coins, then have to move some coins out, you will have a very high chance of the coins flying out. i may end up needing to tape across the top of each holder, which is rather annoying. what these really need is a flap at the top so that the coins stay secured in.some of the holders are also not properly opened, so you want to check them all before starting to load coins in, because if you have to manipulate any of the sleeves most of the coins will fly out of the other sleeves.if you hold them vertically and secured you will be fine, but any flexing and you will have spillage."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading!!!","review":"the ad says to buy the coin binder with these sheets!!!well, these sheets are full size loose leaf and does not state this fact! the binder is ...you guessed it...small size loose leaf binder!!!

Languages study is my hobby and before knowing Pimsleur I wasted a lot of money in books and tapes with any results. I learned German and Spanish with Pimsleur and I'm fluent in both languages.I've studied Chinese for two years with a tutor's help (very expensive) and I dare say I learned more with this Pimsleur Chinese Cantonese course and with less pain than with a qualified teacher.This set is expensive, but shop around for teachers and ask for fees!!!Moreover you can choose when and where to study provided you have available a cassette or a Cd player.The snag is that after the 30 lessons you need to continue your study and unfortunately so far they haven't published set 2 and 3 (available in German, French, Spanish, etc....)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product laaaa!","review":"I have been learning Cantonese for a little while now, but only just purchased the Pimsleur product. It is quite good because the short 30 minute lessons are not demanding, and the repetition helps you remember the words. I would recommend buying a good book also and of course tutoring if it is available. One good book is called interesting cantonese and comes with some CDs for extra practise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"You will not find a better language course than Pimsleur. I've tried several other courses for Cantonese and struggled with them without really learning much. Since Pimsleur focuses on pronounciation and speaking, you really get into the language itself, without having to learn someone's system of writing tones and vowels. My Chinese wife and her family tell me I speak without an accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend; Just Don't Buy it Expecting to Become Fluent","review":"For an extremely complex language like Cantonese, Pimsleur does a great job at slowly immersing you into the language without overwhelming you.I am so far through 14 of the 30 lessons and I am feeling more confident with each one. I got the CD's because I am visiting my girlfriend's family in Guangdong and want to be able to communicate in some way, rather than look like a fool (mistake I made the first time!)I didn't expect Pimsleur to make me fluent, but rather I wanted to be able to understand simple phrases, vocab, and grammar. Pimsleur does well in teaching this in an organized, understandable manner. I recommend highly, especially since there is no Rosetta Stone or other program of this quality out there for learning Cantonese."},{"rating":"1","title":"The basket is not resistant.","review":"I bought this one because the brand has a good reputation and the cost is very good, but in the second play with this glove, the support of the basket broke.

The basic idea--a silent movie comedian who has vanished, but kept making films--is intriguing. And it comes fairly close to working, at least for the first half of the book. The last half doesn't work, however. It requires us to believe some of the characters would act in inexplicable ways and it asks us to accept a much too fortuitous timing of events. I can't imagine, for instance, that the protagonist would go back to Vermont and leave his new-found love to join him later. I can't believe that the wife of the vanished comedian is as nuts as she must be to do what she does. Of course Auster is a good writer. There's plenty of evidence for that in his other books. But I don't think he really thought this one through sufficiently. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Gallop That Comes To A Dull Stop","review":"David Zimmer is a Vermont professor who loses his wife and two children in a plane crash. Overcome with sorrow he retreats from the world until watching television one night he sees a silent film starring a virtually unknown comedian named Hector Mann. The performers' comic genius causes Zimmer to feel the first glimmer of emotion, and he sets out to discover more on this man who disappeared at the onset of talkies.What started for me as engaging soon became dull and meandering, and it was a struggle to slog through the last thirty or so cliched pages. By the time I had finshed, I was actually hoping the book was an illusion and I could've regained my lost time back. Three stars for the first 150 pages, minus one star for the remainder equals two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Like other reviewers, I think it's getting to be time to give up on Auster. Not only was this book just way too obvious and pandering, the characters didn't actually behave like real human beings. Unlike his earlier books where the characters were obviously symbols in an unreal world, in this one the world is real, but nothing that happens in it is. Sorry to have to take him off my must read list, but all good things come to an end."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK book.","review":"This is an OK book. Not better because the plot has limits. At times, the book seems designed for Auster to show off his immense writing skills. After all, describing in an interesting way the action in a silent movie is not easy.Unfortuantely, describing the action in a silent movie is not interesting for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I am a fan of Paul Auster and I really loved some of his earlier novels, but that one was one of the worse books I have ever read. Nothing is credible, it is only a succession of unprobable events that are writen in a ridiculous way. DON'T BUY iT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll have to fight to finish it.","review":"This had to be one of the most plodding overwritten books I've ever been unfortunate enough to read. Huge and I mean HUGE passages go off on tangents and it basically leaves you wanting to tear your eyes out. Then, after suffering through all the blah, blah, blah and toughing out massive meaningless passages the book ends completely abruptly as if the author had no idea how to end his story. In fact, the ending was nothing short of a major disappointment with absolutely no reward whatsoever. Aside from a tiny bit of brilliant imagery here and there this book is pure tedium and a must miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trusting Auster's Eyes","review":"The Book of Illusions--being the story of the narrator's encounter with Hector Mann, a former silent filmmaker--presents quite a few passages where the narrator describes one of Mann's films. As I was reading Auster's novel, I kept thinking I ought not to like the book so much. After all, describing Mann's work seems patently second-hand--\\"telling\\" in creative writing workshop language--and all the narrative commentary effectively takes interpretation out of readers' hands. Yet, I could not put the book down. The forthright prose and the resulting sincerity of the narrator won me over. I didn't mind his being my eyes and ears. Auster's movies seemed real. While I didn't find myself watching the movies with him, he did make me want to watch them. Narrators you care about can overcome any skepticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what the hype is about?","review":"I gave this book a solid chance. I read the first 100 pages, and was still bored. So I decided to skip to reading the last 40 pages. The funny thing is...I did was not confused nor did I feel I missed anything by skipping that far and finishing the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pete's Books","review":"An epic and moving read, with a story just filled to the brim with twists and turns. Excellent holiday reading.Takes us into the strange and historic world of the silent movie industry and the modern day criticism and interpretations of that art form. It also deals unflinchingly with horrific personal loss and the journey to heal. Parts of the relationship scenes were perhaps a little bit cheesy, although it is probably just personal taste and certainly not very important. This was quite a ride and after having finished it I still find myself thinking about the narrator, as though he were some kind of a friend or acquaintance...A novel very easy to get lost in."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad book regardless of the last sentence","review":"I just want to add a 5 star rating to this book. Even though it is a sad book in so many ways, I still couldn't put it down over Christmas when I generally would prefer to read something lighter. This definitely goes on my read-again list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Auster's least interesting book","review":"I've read every novel by this extraordinary writer. Sadly, it's the first time that I was bored or irritated by a Paul Auster novel. I thought the writing was not up to Mr. Auster's standards. I found the storyline ordinary, with some of Auster's usual tricks showing up again: the unexpected windfall of money, the disappearance of the main character under a new identity, etc. Usually, a novel by Auster leaves me exhilarated and wanting for more. This one lacked focus, as if the plot was too thin for a 300 page novel. That does not mean the book is without merit, but I was expecting much more from one of the major writers of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissonant and dissapointing","review":"I listened to the audio book while driving across country a few summers ago. I enjoyed the listen most of the way, but the inexplicable wrap up honestly left me queasy. There is some fine writing that creates believable scenes in this book, but that just makes the characters unlikely behavior at the end of the book that much more disorienting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too abd","review":"Similar to other readers I enjoyed his chapter on Mann's early work. This guy can sure write about a mustasche! Otherwise the story is contrived and in the middle there is all of a sudden an unnecessary [...] montage. I love that word."},{"rating":"1","title":"book of illusions","review":"A pretentious plod. Had to finish it for my book club otherwise would have willingly put it to one side. Paul Auster obviously rather fancies himself as he has quite a pompous style. Credibility of the characters and narrative is stretched to the limit over 300 horribly long pages. Some of the narrative is ludicrous and badly written - for instance when Alma pulls the gun on the hero. Up until then I was still hoping for something meaningful to develop and I had half liked Auster's descriptions of the old films but after Alma's appearance it was downhill all the way. Some people seem to write with the hope of a film contract in mind as this is packed with melodrama and ridiculous happenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Short Story, Bad Novel","review":"After 200+ pages, I couldn't put it down, not because the plot and characters were whisking me forward, but because I dreaded wasting the time spent reading this plodding narrative. Well, at least it wasn't 300+ pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just who is the story about?","review":"I don't like this book for the same reason I don't like Ann Rice. In Rice's case, she writes flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, ad nauseam. In Auster's case, the story starts out about this guy who's just received a letter--oh, but wait, there's something I need to tell you first. Then, 100 pages later, we take up where page 1 started out. Oh--just a minute--there's something else you need to know, too. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz... In the beginning, I thought the story was about the narrator; but, he spends so much time telling Hector Mann's story, that it's very distracting.It's a good story, and Hector Mann is a fascinating person. I really do NOT care for the narrator character at all. But I wish the point-of-view had been more consistent throughout. This book takes a TREMENDOUS amount of patience to get to the end (or even past the midpoint)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when I was ready to give up on the series...","review":"Hiromu Arakawa, Fullmetal Alchemist, vol. 4 (ViZ, 2005)Something happened between Fullmetal Alchemist 3 and this volume.

I've been using it pretty heavily for the past 1.5 months, and it seems to be dealing with everything I give it. The size is small enough to fit in a kitchen drawer and the mortar is perfect to fit in my [adult male] hand firmly. By far an amazing product especially for the price I paid. The pestle handle gets slightly slippery after a bit if you're really going at it. So I attached some drumstick tape I had laying around to both the handle and outside surface of the mortar, which seemed to fix things well.

She includes a lot of relevant and important Wiccan lore BUT it's all over the place. Early on she is writing about spells, but has parenthesis referring to see page 64 .... or you'll hear more about this later on in the book. Personally I do not like flicking backwards and forwards in a chapter supposed to be about one thing, but with all the info located somewhere else. There seems to be no logical sequence to the chapters and I feel that she covers the titillating bits first and then polyfillas them in as she goes. I really thought I was going to like this book a lot and buy it, but after having read it I realise there are so many better ones, and I'll return the one I do have back to the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5 star book","review":"This book really caught my eye on the book shelf. I grabbed it and knew i had to read it. I found that it is mostly a personal journey of Fiona Horne, the witch. I enjoyed reading this book and I keep it here on my shelf at home. The only drawback of this book, for me is the fact that Fiona Horne is Australian and writes as such. I am American. Some of the things she states in the book are pertaining to the Australian aspects of the Craft. If you overlook that, it is a great book and I gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I initially ordered this book because I have been a fan of Fiona's for quite some time. However after reading the reviews here I began to question if I'd actually enjoy it?Turns out I was worrying needlessly because this book is fabulous! It's easy to read, and touches on a few topics that you'd never find in other books on the craft. As much as I love Silver Ravenwolf her writting can be very dry at times. Reading Fiona's book felt like having a conversation with a friend- easy flowing but lots of information.I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was all about herself","review":"This book was terribly disappointing - all about herself; she is very much in love with herself and gives little guidance on spells, no examples of her own workings and a scant overview of basic witchcraft rituals and sabbats. Although it's healthy for everyone to feel good about themselves, she's over the edge and the center pages of photos of course are not about magic but her in bed, getting up, she thinks she's a model of some sort. Full of fluff and no witchy substance as all. Very disappointing. It should be called \\"Wanna be Model Pictures and Essays about Me!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome for Solitary beginners","review":"This book is very informant in the craft and helpful in knowledge of the way of this life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close","review":"Only thing that I can point out, because this woman stuns me so much... she's a writer, writing about Wicca... yet she doesn't believe in a God or even a Goddess, not to mention she's said in interviews that she only writes the books for money, she doesn't even like to write them! How does that make for an informative and even slightly correct interpretation? I'm 20 and have been Pagan for 7/8 years of my life, and I could even write so much better than this woman. What a shame, to have our representations reduced to this. I hope to see that people like Horne are out of the public view by the time my young son is old enough to understand my Path. (Just look at her website... spells for explicit usage designed for children??? How degrading!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Magical Journey\\" is a Winner!!!","review":"Her personal experiences with wicca were both insightful and entertaining. I loved her stories about climbing trees by the light of the full moon and such! Although this book gives only a general overview of wicca, it serves as a wonderful inspiration for pursuing this path. Some people have a problem with the fact that she writes about hexes and hallucinogens and sex during ritual. However, I loved that she was willing to talk about these things! Many of the topics she covers are practically taboo in the wiccan community and it was wonderful to find someone willing to talk about the more subversive elements of a magickal life (she's not telling you to do these things, she's just letting you know what's out there -- besides, knowledge is power!) This book, together with The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wicca & Witchcraft make for an excellent introduction to wicca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violates every rule of responsible witchcraft!","review":"What a load of tripe! Anyone who seriously uses this as a model is headed for heartache. This is a writer who has no trouble putting the Wiccan Rede on one page and a four page hex on the next! Full of \\"cutesy\\" chapter names, meaningless illustrations and decidedly nasty hexes, spells, and retribution this is an effort best consigned to the... We read this aloud at a Wiccan gathering and howled with laughter - until we realized that this was not a satirical piece and the author was serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great one for any witch","review":"This is an amazing book which is different than most how to books on wicca.

Reading it is a wonderful experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"fiona is a lovely woman","review":"I think Fiona Horne is a really nice and intelligent lady,but her image for witch craft of blonde glamor ignores the dark haired ladies of exotic extraction who pursue the craft.I was given this book as a gift and while I find it entertaining,I have read it all before.The only thing that is a little different is the author's rock background,but hey Stevie Nicks has done it all before.I would like to see Fiona broaden out her work as I believe she is a very good writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violation of Wicca Creed","review":"Any of the people who give her a good rating cannot seriously call themselves a Wiccan. Fiona's hexes and spells totally violates the Wiccan creed \\"Harm None, do as Ye Will\\" also the threefold law of what is sent out come back to you threefold. This book does not give a true impression of what Wicca is truly about. Read True Magic by Amber K if you really want an understanding of Wicca."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Must Have In A Collection!","review":"I have a large collection of Pagan/Wiccan books but this one seems a little different. Maybe it's because she from England or maybe because she is young & hip.

Excellent musical talent. The back and forth between Lucky (is he really?) and Miss Carmen Getit (who usually gets the better of Steve) is hilarious.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any cat or kitten out there!","review":"This cd swings daddy-o but it was a sort of dissapointment, because I have three of there songs already on other complitations. So it sort of made this cd a less of a necesity to have. But \\"Where's My Gravy\\" and \\"Down Boy\\" make this cd worth while. And to all the hep cats out there who don't have any of there songs on a cd this cd really is a killer-diller. With songs such as: \\"Jumptown\\", \\"Daddy-o\\" and \\"Do the Pup\\" tearring up the house like few bands can do.

Cashing In","review":"A Santa Sabina \\"Greatest Hits\\" album is a good thing, even without any tracks from their latest, and best, album \\"Mar Adentro En la Sangre.\\" The earlier group material retains an intense edge, and still sounds fresh today. The problem with this collection is that after the band left the BMG label, the label was able to put this album together without artistic input from the players. As a result, the artwork and presentation are sub-standard by Santa Sabina standards. They remain one of the most potent rock combos around, so anyone with interest owes it to him or herself to seek out \\"Mar Adentro En la Sangre,\\" \\"Simbolos,\\" \\"Babel,\\" and \\"MTV Unplugged.\\" The other 2 albums aren't bad either.

I plan to drive Ireland on my next trip and this book offered the best tip of all the books I have read. The website for AA of Ireland (ww.aaroadwatch.ie) is a goldmine. I can now get directions, distances, and times to use to plan my drive.This book was also great with it's ratings of overrated sites, and recommended stops.I have bought many guide books, but this one has jumped to the top of my list. I will not be leaving home without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best information in a easy to read format","review":"I will be taking my 6th vacation to Ireland this summer. I have used Birnbaum, Rough Guide, and Fodors. None come close to Frommers in giving me the information I most need. All the great places to see are easily found and marked. The hotels are truly gems in many price ranges and the dining recommendations are only second the the famous Egon Ronay Jameson Guide which unfortunately went out of print in 1997.So if you like staying in hotels instead of youth hostels and b&bs,like eating really great food and don't want to follow the average tourist, go with this guide. Don't get me wrong you don't have to spend a fortune but the recommendations cater to the 2-4 star crowd. Works great for us.The first review above is right on the money. And yes don't buy this is you are on a tour group and need something to read on the bus or want a lot of pictures of the places you might visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best information in a easy to read format","review":"Stop the presses. I used the new guide this year and was disappointed, not nearly as good as in the past. I tried posting a review but it did not make it to print. There are major mistakes in the book of venues that have been closed for over a year. Better to stick with another guide.Restaurant info must also have been based on visits in the past as many of the recommended places offered poor service and high prices.

The footage of erupting volcanoes in Virunga National Park is awesome! Also, the Carl Akeley biographical sketch describing how he founded Virunga National Park to protect the rare and endangered mountain gorillas is a worthy tribute to a great man who tried very hard ot protect his beloved apes. This is a \\"MUST\\" for any teacher to show geography, social studies, environmental science classes from middle school through college. Great video! They should make it available in DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire and Ice ( an excellent entry into fantasy)","review":"First off I would like to say that Fire and Ice by Frazetta and Bakshi is an excellent addition to any fan of the fantasy genre. This area is sorely lacking in any entries. I liked the movie because of Frazetta's art Which translates very well onto the animated screen. The only problem with it was that when characters are running it looks fairly awkward. The fight scenes are excellent, but the sorcery seems to be lacking in potency. I must say that this is one of the best examples of animated fantasy. Of course there aren't many other examples to compare it to. It's too bad they didn't do any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"All In The Mind","review":"I'm not going to say much here; Only that this book may be the least interesting autobiography I have ever read. You know Carrol from \\"All In The Family\\" moreso than any other role he has portayed, yet he avoids discussing his tenure on that ground-breaking show from the 70's, instead telling us many things about his early history.It appears he may feel the show overshadowed everything else he did, so to answer that, left it out of his book.I was disappointed reading it and would not recommend the book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Man, Not the Character","review":"I recently purchased Carroll O'Connor's autobiography, I Think I'm Outta Here. I love this book! I have been a fan of his for many years but was always curious about the man behind the character. It was very interesting to learn about his life both before and after Archie. He spun his story in such a way that you felt you were right beside him, experiencing it all. This is never more true than during the last chapter of his book, which deals with the escalating drug use and eventual suicide of his beloved son, Hugh. He brings the pain, anger, and anguish full force, telling it as only a parent could. Sparing parents the pain that he and his wife Nancy went through became his personal crusade for the rest of his life. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is even the slightest fan of Carroll O'Connor, a man with a big grin and an even bigger heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carroll O'Connor inspires, touches, and makes one laugh","review":"I have never been so enthralled in a biography. O'Connor's honest, poignant, and witty account of his life touched my heart. The book has such a strong voice-- well written and very personal. Shrugging off his foibles, proud of his strengths, and forthcoming with his regrets, O'Connor lets us in a little closer to who he is. I couldn't put this down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carroll O'Connor's Memoir of All My Families","review":"As a very big \\"All in the Family\\" fan, I was looking very forward to reading this book. It is really good because it goes deep into Carroll and you find out who he is and what is about. As previous readers have stated the book can be slow and rambling, but you have to be prepared for things like that in memoirs. Overall, I thought it was a very good book that should be read by Carroll O'Connor and All in the Family fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, slow moving","review":"Having grown up during the Archie Bunker years, I was expecting more than the book delivered.

I have respected him as an intelligent man, nothing like the buffonish Archie Bunker who he played so well.I was deeply disappointed in this book. Mr. O'Connor is extremely impressed by the sound of his own voice and he goes through one self-indulgent monologue after another. His diatribes against the press are tiresome and his political views, that of a limousine liberal, are quite hypocritical.The worst part is the dealing with his late son's addiction. The diary format late in the book is a litany of where he eats and his friends, all of who the reader can care less.Didn't an editor read this book???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving, honest book","review":"Any fan of Carroll O'Connor's terrific acting will be grateful for this fine, sensitive memoir -- the insights into art and life are original, well-spoken and worth long thought.

He was very concerned about his posthumous reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Likeable Chap","review":"I didn't come away w/ any sort of a warm feeling towards O'Connor. He takes absolutely no responsibility whatever for the demise of his son, instead choosing to blame a pusher. Arrogant and self-aggrandizing, O'Connor seems to view himself as the world's foremost actor and social critic. He seems particularly impressed by his skill at feigning an Irish accent, which is less than entertaining to listen to. He reminds me of an uncle that no one likes, but has to be invited to social occasions because he's family. He comes across as depressed, embittered. He certainly lowered my mood. Get some Paxil, Archie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good case, but a little small.","review":"The speaker gives great sound quality and the case is functional. The elastic netting holds the mp3 player securely. I have a Dell DJ20 and it ONLY just fits inside. My old case, while not having a speaker, used to also fit a set of over-the-ear headphones whereas this case is too small inside to fit these (because of the room the speaker takes up). With the speaker plugged in, I cannot zip the case all the way closed as the connector sits too high, so using it outside (e.g. at the beach) will not fully protect the player. If it was just a little bit bigger (taller) it would be perfect. My wife has a Dell PocketDJ which is the smaller 5Gb MP3 player and it is perfect for that. Maybe even some elastic around the zipper to allow it to stretch (being a hard-side case there is no give) would give it some more room. But overall, it is a great case - the sound out of the speaker is a good quality, and it is useful having the ability to play music out loud where ever you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a sales pitch for CCM","review":"Not a genuine anaylsis and discussion of all the different types of calcium at all.

Not only will you be amazed and amused, you will marvel at the means by which the author and the subject survived their respective journeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horwitz only gets better","review":"Tony Horwitz continues to prove his amazing writing ability in Blue Latitudes. It's a study of Captain Cook's voyages across the Pacific, along with an indepth character study of Cook and an updated look at the places he visited as Horwitz travels in his wake. Although the language gets a bit foul at times, Horwitz does a terrific job of showing the argument between making Cook a hero and a scoundrel. He looks into and relates the deep felt feelings on both sides and tries to get to the root of the anger felt toward him. Horwitz makes some deeply insightful comments about white colonialism and the effects it has left on the indigenous cultures it dominated around the world. Horwitz is thoroughly readable and entertaining while being scholarly and wise all at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"Readers interested in a pure historical perspective of the three circumnavigational expeditions of Capt James Cook may be disappointed and justifiably critical of this book. Tony Horwitzdoes, however, present here a very entertaining and informative rendition of what modern day influences and current opinions (good and bad/ deserved or undeserved) Capt. Cook and those voyages may have in the regions he explored. Overall, it is well written and engaging. For those who may seek a more formal and classical history of James Cook, those works are abundant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding history and travelogue","review":"I loved this book. It grabbed me from the moment I started it through the end. Horwitz gives you history of the European discovery of the Pacific, what it was like to be on a ship for months at a time in the 18th century, as well as a feel for the islands and indigenous history of the region. He mixes Cook's journal and experiences with what he finds today, and the local population's perception of the events of the time, and the lasting impact of the meeting.In addition, it's a fun travelogue. Horwitz and his sometime traveling partner from Australia, Roger, romp around the Pacific taking in and enjoying the people and cultures -- and the alcohol. His insignts in to the cultures are perceptive and witty.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and highly recommend it. If you ever dreamed of taking off for Tahiti, after reading this book the urge will be irresistible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel, history, geography -- all with good humor","review":"Blue Latitudes was my \\"subway\\" book last week. (See, I am a traveler too!)I loved the unusual structure of the book, loosely alternating history of Cook's travels with descriptions of the author's own visits to the same places two centuries later, and then having the author (\\"ego\\") taking his ne'er-do-well travelling companion (\\"id\\") to compare impressions of the locations which, depending on your point of view, were discovered (\\"ego\\") or spoiled (\\"id\\") by Captain Cook.The travel reporting is in the Paul Theroux mode; Horwitz is often unromantic, even cranky, about the project and the places he visits. However, he is always witty and perceptive. The history and geography research is fascinating, especially when Horwitz turns up Englishmen, Australians and Polynesians, all Cook hobbyists, with strongly held but magnificently divergent opinions about the facts and impact of the Voyages of Discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue latitutes not Cook history","review":"I was expecting more info on Captain Cook and his exploits and not so much on the author and his buddy flying around visiting depressing islands and talking to people who had nothing to do with Cook and what he accomplished. The book was a rambling travelog and not much value if you are interested in what happened over 200 years ago. Although there was some interesting history included, it makes up less than half the contents of the book.The author missed an opportunity by not expanding on what Cook did, how he did it, the tools he used, and how hard it was to do in the world in which he lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doldrums","review":"Sorry to say this, I was looking forward to a wonderful read. Instead I found a badly formed narrative, loose ends, bad writing, a dire lack of wit and style. This guy can make any place look boring and dumpy. He doesn't give any insight into Cook or the South Pacific and ultimately the book reads like an early chronicle. Also Horowitz needs to learn what a reader wants to see focused on. We don't need a three page diary of his friend's drinking spree. His original week on a ship from Seattle is never brought up again, nor is what he learned applicable (in his mind it seems) to the either the other boat trips he took or the ship captained by Cook. If he had a rollicking story we might forgive him (as we do Grisham) but instead this is dull plodding, a sea of doldrums. Had he submitted this to New Yorker, it would have been rejected, and if not rejected edited considerably. It needs it. I had to tap into a Cookian mania for finishing a project just to get through it. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the Edge of the World sinks Blue Latitudes","review":"I decided to read Blue Latitudes after reading a review from an Amazon \\"Rate It\\" patron.

It's a good idea, and it's interesting (if depressing) to learn what Cook's stops have turned into. (Tahiti, once a paradise, is now a shabby tourist trap.) Horwitz's own explorations are given equal time to Cook's, which means that the biography of Cook is somewhat less detailed than you might want it to be. But he's an engaging writer.Check my list, \\"Books About Explorers,\\" for more recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and informative","review":"This book is a truly an easy, fun read. Not a biography of Captain Cook, it is a compelling hybrid of two genres: travelogue and history. It's informative and interesting, while managing to maintain a light touch and breezy style. Not unline Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" in its mix of humor and serious observation. One other similarity is the presence of the quirky friend. The quirky, hard-drinking, church-avoiding Roger provides comic relief and genuine insights which occasionally escape Horwitz.My main complaint with the book was that I wish Horwitz was a photographer as well as journalist; I wanted to see the places that he visited."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vision","review":"What a wonderful trip for me.

In that you have a fun read about two mates enjoying life on the road. However with the notion that the book was about Cook, the strong start by Horwitz became quickly disappointing. A strong miss by Horwitz is being ambiguous about his own feelings about Cook, especially as Horwitz's view may have been modified by the travel.There is the sense that Horwitz was writing a series of travel stories into which he wanted to interject Cook as the reason for the travel. There is a savior of sorts in Cliff the Cook history buff who joins them for a memorial to Cook's tragic end in Hawaii. For a good historical read go to Beaglehold, else enjoy this for what it is, a series of buddy travel stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough, multi-reference on Cook's journeys","review":"There is a lot of documentation, some very dry, when it comes to reading about the adventures of Capt. Cook. Horwitz pulls from a ocean of material to bring us a thorough, multi-view account of the captain's escapades. Horwitz does a very respectable job of keeping the story very light but very deep in historical and chronological facts all while staying interesting and enjoyable to read. Great book for the first-time Cook explorer or the seasoned sea dogs looking to tie up some loose ends about the captain. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Latitudes","review":"Less about Capt. Cook's voyages and more about the exploits of the author and his drinking buddy, Roger. By way of example, a half dozen pages describing Cook's 3rd voyage (of four years) and many times more describing a few of the sites visited by Cook as they are today. The book was written in an easy style, but failed to describe at all many of Cook's significant exploits and discussed others in a superficial way. I found myself skimming past the drinking episodes to read the few pages about Cook. The book had some good (but less than complete) maps of the voyages, a postage stamp sized reproduction of a portrait of Cook on the inside leaf, and no other photos (one would expect a few pictures of the more memorable sites visited)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quark Xpress 7 used/mint condition.....

The business model does not fit the Church. When will people learn that? We have a vision: that the glory of the Lord will cover the earth as the waters cover the seas. We have a mission: to make disciples by evangelizing, baptizing, and catechizing. Everything else is fluff. What is particularly offensive about this book (and others like it) is that when it does throw in the occasional Scripture, it horribly isolates it from its context to make it say things it is not intended to say.

His descriptions of various controversial medical themes and dilemas evoked many of my own experiences,emotions and my own impressions of how it is that we solve our daily medical mysteries that rarely conform to the textbooks. I've recommended this book to my son who is contemplating a career in medicine, I think he'll understand better what he might be getting himself into. I am anxious to follow any subsequent writings of this writer to see what I think will be an interesting evolution as he becomes first an attending physician and then deals with many more challenging experiences that will leave him even more perplexed,doubting,dispirited,uncertain but at the same time elated by his many clinical triumphs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"This book, \\"Complications\\" was not at all what I expected.

First of all, this book is well written. It is not necessarily \\"enjoyable\\", because some of it is emotionally painful to read (when discussing pain!), but it is truly compelling. It is definitely a reality check and can even empower one to know what to ask and how to ask their doctor for options. We should see our doctors as human and science as less than perfect.I am familiar with prayer that I interpret as not asking God to heal us, but rather to pray for doctors to have the strength of their wisdom. That is what this book is all about - a lay person's perspective on the realities of doctors and medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book","review":"Complications was a very well put together book. Gwande did an excellent job of presenting the uncertainty that is an everyday aspect of medicine. He did so in a way that can be understood by anyone who's ever experienced uncertainty in anything they've done. He presents it in a reassuring way to those who are not in the medical community, I'm sure anyone whose read this book will have a better understanding where their physician is coming from the next time the visit the doctor's office. For those who are in the medical community, it's nice to hear that others go through the same struggles and have come to terms with the fact that they might not always feel comfortable or know the \\"right answer\\".

This book revealed several rather significant misconceptions I previously held concerning surgeons and surgical practice and exposed them as myths using real-world examples and statistical evidence. My primary conclusion after reading this book is that caveat emptor (buyer beware) holds as true in the arena of surgical medicine as it does at the mall or supermarket. I would strongly encourage anyone who is considering undergoing a surgical procedure or who may be in the unenviable position of having to make a surgical decision on behalf of a loved one or relative to read this book in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"As a pre-med student I try to soak up everything medical that is available.

Instead, he is a down-to-earth, straightforward writer who is happy to pull aside the curtain and let us all take a fascinating glimpse.My only problems with the book were a few chapters that seemed to bog down with meaningles detail, and a syrupy, pointless chapter about an upper-middle-class woman's fight against severe morning sickness.Other than that, this book is a keeper.

It might not interest the Stephen King fans or the hard-boiled Crime/Serial Killer readers. It's is more about humans, architecture, and the soul of city on the crossroads of history... I highly recomend Erik's Larson's book, next to Akmal Shebl'sThe Human Effectwhich has the same spooku vibe but about Cairo and Egypt, and of course the all time favoriteThe Fountainheadby Ayn Ran.Great Book, I am looking forward to reading other Erik Larson Books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but needs more illustrations","review":"I found this book fascinating.

But I was anticipating much more information about the serial killer, Dr. Holmes, and how he was related to the World's Fair. As it turns out, Holmes and his horrific activities were not really related to the Fair at all, except by proximity and time. It's two interesting stories, not one. The book is primarily about the Exposition and it's an intriguing story, no doubt. But the story of Holmes has little to do with the Fair. It's as if someone wrote a compelling story about the Seattle World's Fair and tried to weave Ted Bundy into it because he had once lived in Seattle. It would be easy to believe that the author first wrote a history of the fair and then added the serial killer hook because his editor said it would punch up sales.

So it's not a page turner for a fiction reader like me. But it tells a very interesting story, and where the author brings inhistorical characters that you'll know of, it did expand my knowledge base.

Interspersed the reader gets sometimes as little as a page and half devoted to the \\"murderer/devil.\\" Furthermore, the only thing this murderer has to do with the Fair is that they happen around the same time!

Joe invented it prior to the fair when faced with painting the huge basements at the Marshall Field's store where he worked as an engineer.After all, the spray paint gun is called a Binks, and the fact that Joe's invention made the White City white in an incredibly short time is what made his company, Binks Spray Sytems, later Binks Manufacturing, an international success shortly after the fair.

Then I fell for it. Learning about Buffalo Bill, Cracker Jacks, and The first Ferris wheel and how huge it must have been. Damn, men where brave back then to build something that big because I hardly doubt any architect would build a Ferris wheel as tall as 300 feet with cars big enough to hold 60 people per car and have like, I don't know, 30 or more cars on the wheel. Truly amazing! I wish there were more facts on the infamous Dr. Holmes, but I guess that is the way the cookie crumbles.

I was surprised to learn that the the first Ferris Wheel was invented by Mr. Ferris from Pittsburgh for the fair to outdo the Eiffel Tower which had been built previously for the Paris Exposition.At the same time, there is a serial killer of young women in the area, which only adds to the story. In some ways, I think that the fair helped to make the killer's deeds go unnoticed for so long a time.It is a riveting story that makes you want to keep turning the page to find out what's next!!

I was more interested in the people side.The good thing is that I now know that I won't be spending any more of my $ or time on his other books, which previously, I had been wondering about."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite boring","review":"I believed this book to be a mystery novel. It was infact a doco type book on the world fair in Chicago and with a side story of a mass murderer. No mystery at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"The devil in the white City","review":"This one was a little hard to stay interested in. It jumped back and forth from the story of the Chicago fair and all of the key players involved with it to the plotting and planning of the murderer. I was looking for more of a \\"thriller\\". Not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally engrossing read!","review":"Devil in the White City is one of the most engrossing books I have ever read. It takes us back to the 1890's following the World's Fair in Paris that had just captivated the world . It was a hard act to follow and Chicago, a comparatively unsophisticated city at that time, won the bid for the next World's Fair. Imagine at this time how difficult it was to dream and build architecturally magnificent edifices but indeed they succeeded! So many interesting historical people are introduced, such as the landscape architect who had designed Central Park in NYC was hired to do all the landscaping at the White City, so named because all the buildings at the Fair were white. Interspersed with the preparation of the site is the counterpoint of a diabolical serial killer who is actively seducing and killing many young women. It makes for a fascinating reading experience and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Serial Killer of the modern age","review":"This book actually focuses just as much attention on the World's Fair as the serial killer who haunted the south side of Chicago in the late 1800's murdering at least 9 people, if not more. However, the murders are much more interesting, memorable, and shocking. It is amazing how these hideous acts have been forgotten yet Lizzie Borden is remembered for only killing her parents. Unfortunately, there arent' many primary sources for the author to work so he focuses a great deal more on the World's Fair. The murders are a strange, yet facinating, tale of how naive young girls allowed themselves to be taken advantage of in the bustling city of Chicago. However, the aspects of the World's Fair are a bit overwhelming to a non-architect which makes reading the book more laborious than it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated","review":"This book had a great deal of potential. The two topics covered are extraordinary. Very different and very interesting. The coverage of the fair is superficial and boring. A significant majority of the topic is spent talking about one person's obsession with the landscape. It seems that the author found alot of material regarding this individual and focused the account on grass,plants, water, etc. Too much foliage.The coverage of the mass murderer is also superficial. It seems the author is filling in a great portion of the account and the rest if left up to the reader.I am 3/4 done with the book and desperately want to throw it out. Unfortunately, I keep reading it, mainly because the topics are so interesting and I hope to get to the good part of the book. Disappointment. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!!","review":"Really informative. Great duel story about serial killer who should be very well known but is not and the makings of Chicago's world fair. Holmes was the devil."},{"rating":"1","title":"see the other review of hh holmes stuff","review":"This was so boring I couldn't finish it. I normally like murder books but this one was too... Preachy? I don't know. I wish he would have just told the story instead of trying to juxtapose Holmes' actions against the worlds fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is laughter or tears appropriate?","review":"This snapshot of history reveals amazing people in their ageless pursuits of glory and acclaim and personal satisfaction, not simply an article from Architecture Digest. For me, ambition means knitting a pair of socks. For these guys, it's building the first skyscraper. It's developing electric light. It's performing Wild West show stunts for audiences. It's mindless serial murder of helpless women.What a fascinating look at the spectrum of possibilities people are capable of through the relating of historical true events. The telling of how the Chicago World's Fair came to be and of the most interesting luminaries and rogues intrigued with the possibilities a fair offered for their particular hopes to advance their visions, this reader was surprised at how the nuts and bolts of engineering, both political and physical, relied just as much on the personalities of people as it did on personal skills and education.This is a terrific book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hoping for more after In the Garden of Beasts","review":"If you want to read every last minute detail of the building of the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, this book is for you. As a bonus, you will get strange factoids that don't even jive with the part of the book into which they are inserted. The best parts of this book are the \\"serial killer\\" sections. Unfortunately, they are very short and are found among volumes of world's fair history. This book needed an editor. If I had read this before In the Garden of Beasts, I would not have read this. I really liked in the Garden of Beasts, but this is not an interesting or compelling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on World Fair, not so much on HH Holmes","review":"Could've used more devil, less white city. I don't think many people search for this book hoping to read up on the Worlds Fair and the majority of the book focuses on that. Holmes is sprinkled throughout and at last dominates the last small section of the book. Four stars due to the crazy amount of research it takes to write a book like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I loved that so much history was included in this book. It was an interesting story, and I felt like I learned a lot about Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in the White City","review":"Decided to read because I've heard rave reviews from a variety of personalities. The architectural history of the Chicago World Fair is fascinating. The dark events happening during the same time period are very disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World's Fair visited by the devil","review":"Erik Larson does an amazing job at combining the process by which a team of architects sought to build the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, led by one man and the coincidence of an evil serial killer who builds a home/hotel and starts killing inoocent people. The author expertly gets behind the scenes with the World's Fail bueracracy, failures, expenses, politics, celebrity and general mayhem. At the same time he is able to reconstruct how the serial killer financed the building of his house of horrors by ripping peopl e off and killing others to gain their death insurance.This is a great book. One that was written with a masterly skillset by the author. The footnaotes at the end are even interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the photos and illustrations?","review":"I've just finished this engrossing, delightful book. Larson writes about history in a lively, skillfull way.But I am puzzled why there are so few photographs and illustrations of the two fascinating subjects of the book--the fair and the serial killer. Surely there must be plenty of this material available."},{"rating":"2","title":"History and Murder","review":"I don't leave many reviews, but this book is definitely review-worthy. If you like history and/or true crime books, you will LOVE this book. I found the lengthy detail of how the Chicago World's Fair came to be was engrossing and eclipsed the other story in the book. I never thought something like that could be so fascinating. However, both stories were intertwined masterfully. A lot of interesting historical facts, developments and coincidences that take place in this book, too, and are brought to life in rich detail throughout the story. It's a real page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best non-fiction I have ever read!","review":"Erik Larson paints a detailed picture of the trials and tribulations of the men and women who created the 1893 Worlds Fair, the White City. He also interweaves stories about the seedier side of Chicago where the fair was held. The stories all revolve around the famous and infamous who would eventually have a profound effect on society in one way or another.I loved this book because it reads like a fiction novel but is absolutely non-fiction. It had as many actual quotes from each character as possible, mostly taken from letters. This makes the book much more believable and interesting.It was a time I was not familiar with so I was intrigued instantly. The people and events were bigger than life, awe inspiring, and sometimes horrifying. This book has opened up a new world for me. I hope to find other historical books that are as well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Read","review":"I could hardly put this book down. I read three books aweek and this is the first book that I'd re-read in a minute. Beautifully written - includes everything - history and intrigue!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not even finish the book....","review":"I am at a loss as to all of the accolades for this book. I found it to be slow, plodding, and hard to read. Like one other reviewer said - if you love architecture or find it fascinating to read pages and pages about plants, then this book is for you. I started skipping paragraphs, then pages, until I just quit around page 270."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I really liked the combined history of the Chicago Worlds Fair along with an intriguing story involving a true life crime at the turn of the century. For some reason this book has stayed with me. Not sure if it is the disturbing murderer or the awesome history. I think more the history-facinating!! If you like this I am sure you would like the book \\"The Professor and the Madman\\". Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"solid, interesting","review":"I found this book immensely interesting, yet I cannot in good faith call it a \\"page turner\\". It tended to be a bit dry at times. On the plus side was the surprisingly interesting account of all the details that went into the creating of the 1893 World's Fair. One certainly gets a flavor for this time period in our history. The sections on Holmes are, not surprisingly, more interesting (as well as disturbing of course). Personally I would have preferred more on Holmes, as a proportion of the overall tale. And I don't know what this says about me, but I would have preferred more of the gory details. We seem to get a somewhat sanitary portrayal of an unbelievably unsanitary soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner!","review":"Author Erik Larson has written a historical novel which reads like a mystery and builds suspense on two levels. Very few authors I have encountered have been able to accomplish this. I could go on and on but simply want to say, read it, you will be very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical and very Interesting story presentation","review":"This book is written in an interesting format and kept my interest to the very end. The storyline was through and complex in details with good continuity in following up on the never ending plots with a variety of the characters who seemed to have touches of reality and boldness beyond my expectations. I never guessed many of the outcomes in the various journies written for the main characters. The suspense was just enough and kept me reading without realizing I could not stop reading each section. Of course knowing the fair did suceed could have spoiled the reading but none the less I did not know the \\"behind the scenes\\" dramas.I would recommend this book for anyone over 17. Some material is not appropriate for mid teens or younger readers unless a parent has read it first and thinks their child can deal with this material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and suspenseful history","review":"This is what history should have been in school! Thorough research, crisp writing, and a flare for the well told tale. Erik Larson does it again and follows up Issac's Storm with another historical suspense novel that read like the best fiction.Set amongst the Chicago world's fair in the late 1800s, Larson's research and writing offer teh reader a great insight into America's second city just prior to the turn of the last century. He captures well to feelings of the city and of the organizers of the fair and all that everyone hoped it would be. But that story is reflectd in the dark side of the fair that is a killer stalking his victims.Larson is a great story teller and is really carving out a great niche with these non-fiction work set around this time frame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I found this book to be a fascinating journey into a period of American history I knew very little about. Larson's well researched novel style will draw you in and paint the entire picture, leaving no detail uncovered. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful tale that brings history alive!","review":"This extraordinary portrayal of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair is told through the lens of its famous architect, Daniel H. Burnham, and its infamous opportunist, H.H. Holmes. These two men left an indelible mark on the World's Fair. Burnham's vision was expansive and lives through these pages. It's quite amazing to realize people like Susan B. Anthony, Mark Twain, Helen Keller, Theodore Roosevelt, Thomas Edison, and others were there at the same time. The story of Holmes is equally fascinating. How he was able to dispose of the bodies, swindle people out of their money, and get away with murder for so long illustrates his clever understanding of late 19th century's social norms. The decision to tell the tale of the World's Fair through the lives of these two men is flawless. My only criticism is that I wish there were more pictures in the book. I wanted to see the Ferris wheel and people enjoying the different parts of the fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This was a wonderful book. I usually do not read non fiction but this book was recommended to me by a friend so I gave it a try. It was truly wonderful and I learned so much about a city I grew up around that I never knew before. I would recommend this book to any fiction fan as it reads like a great mystery novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"A captivating book for those interested in architecture and the great Chicago World's fair and the sights and smell's of Old Chicago come alive in alarming clarity.....subplot the serial killing and you have the makings of a fascinating read.

I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's the parallel story of Chicago's preparation to host the World's Fair in 1893, and the story of a psychopathic serial killer living at the same time and place. The writing is good. The history fascinating. Larson tells the horrific story of the murders without lapsing into sensationalism, and paints the majesty of the World's Fair and the effect it had on the people of Chicago with a wonderfully vivid brush. Were a similar fair to take place today, it would seem overly extravagant. Were a madman to create a house of torture today, it would seem yet another sign of our degenerative times. But in 1893, the extravagance stems from a sense of civic pride rather than corporate greed, and the murder spree is so out-of-place that it does seem like the work of the devil. Two great stories that, juxtaposed, stand even stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two parallel stories make a fascinating read.","review":"When I first started reading this book which had been recommended by a friend, I wondered why he had enjoyed it so much. However, the further it progressed, I found it more & more engrossing. The new inventions used in the exposition & the names that were involved that later were to become famous in various fields of endeavour were quite amazing. At the same time & within a very short distance of the expo. a mass murderer was committing the most hideous of crimes. The book was based on historic facts which makes it all the more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story; well researched","review":"Even tho the title put me off somewhat, since it was a selected book for our bookclub, I ordered, read it and found it's aptly named. It held me spellbound as I followed the 'devil' and the amazing story of this fantastic fair. I had previously read of Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla in their struggle to bring electricity to the nation. Now to have other parts of the story played out, I found the book to be very well done and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in the White City","review":"This book runs two great true stories in parallel.

About half the group did not even finish the book.The book follows two historical figures. One great, the other evil.I did enjoy the historical fiction regarding the world's fair in Chicago. I did not enjoy reading about the murders of all the innocent people in Chicago at the time.

Larson does a tremendous job of weaving together the story of the 1893 world fair in Chicago, and the story of a serial killer who preyed on fairgoers.This is a very interesting read. Not only do you get a lot of the history of Chicago, you also get a look inside the mind of a serial killer. Who would of thought these two things would go together so well. A great book to take with you on vacation or to keep you busy in your lawn chair in the summer.

Intriguing premise sells books. Essentially two stories, one about the world's fair and one about a murderer residing in Chicago at the same time. Albeit non-fiction, the writer fails to intertwine the two stories within the story. If you read on, waiting for some culminating point where the author brings it all together, you'll be sadly disappointed. It doesn't happen. Larson obviously must be good at deciphering old letters and then translating that into a book. If you want to learn about Burnham and the early days of architecture in Chicago, buy another book.

It starts out ok, but the \\"history lesson\\" gets so long and boring that I started to flip ahead and just follow the story line that involved the murderer. However, that was also very vague and told almost as an afterthought. It also didn't make sense at times. I think this book's title is misleading, it should tell the prospective reader that it is not really about \\"murder and mayhem\\" but more about the construction and background of the World Fair. So unless that's what you want to read about, SKIP this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"All these people say it's an amazing read and a nail bitter or that they can't put it down but in reality this book it nothing but a waste of time. The two stories that are entwind are both a bore. I was hoping this was about a serial killer in Chicago during the 1890's but it turned out to be more about the fair then anything. Understandably you can not have one without the other but my goodness. The only thing nail bitting about it is possibly nail bitting out of sheer boredom.

Unfortunately, it was a negative reaction. This was the dryest, dullest, most tedious book I have ever read. I was so disappointed after all the great reviews and accolades. I find it amazing that someone could possibly make a book about a serial killer completely boring, of all things.A majority of the book focuses on the contruction of the fair, and it's completely repetitive and flat. The only thing more tedious to read would be if they gave us a stack of blueprints of every building there for us to muddle through. The parts that dealt with the killer were uninteresting. His character was completely undeveloped, and the details were bland. I have a degree in English, and I'm an avid reader in my spare time as well, so I have read many, many books.

Larson's hero is architect Daniel Burnham, who overcame huge obstacles to bring this project to fruition. Larson is persuasive in describing the achievements of Burnham and his allies, but less convincing when he argues that this extremely ambitious fair marked a turning point in American history. In parallel, Larson describes the actions of mass murderer H.H. Holmes, who was killing women in Chicago at that time. This seems an odd conjunction, as if the author were trying to leaven the Fair's history with a frisson of horror. A more serious criticism is that Larson invents the thoughts, feelings, and oral statements of many characters, apparently based on his own speculations. The book would have been interesting enough without going beyond the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Non-Fiction Tale of Two Cities","review":"Larson captures the best and worst of mankind. Two bigger than life men, Daniel Burnham and H.H.Holmes set about creating beauty or destroying life on grand scales. Both were successful and both had setbacks.Burnham was the visionary who was largely responsible for the success of the 1893 Chicago Worlds' Fair, commemorating the 400th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the New World. Holmes took advantage of (mostly) vulnerable women who made their way to Chicago on their own, killing them when he tired of them.The story of the fair or of the slaughters would have been interesting books on their own. Weaving the tales took away from the story of the fair. While the fair was the background that enabled Holmes to have his pick from thousands of potential subjects, the detail of the how the fair developed didn't add to the story of the slaughters.Larson is a good writer, but I would have preferred that he wrote two separate books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting history","review":"Slow read, but interesting due to the detail and facts.

The book does an excellent job of capturing the mood and thought processes of the age just before the turn of the century. The reader is offered a perspective on American history that is not offered in most history books, and it does so in an interesting and intriguing way. The killer in the midst adds even more to the imagery provided by the author. The authors writing style adds to the creepyness factor quite a bit. Not only was this an enlightening book to read it was equally engaging.

Holmes must still lurk in Chicago. They will haunt your memories of this book. I cannot add much to what other reviewers have outlined, except that I was fascinated in this read by two subjects that I have had zero interest in, architecture and serial killers. Thankfully, the author does not concentrate on the \\"grisly\\" aspects of Holmes killings, but on the hypnotic man himself. You shudder to think there are many \\"Holmes\\" out there today walking among us. As for the Columbian Exposition, it just confirms my earlier suspicions that society was reaching a crescendo at the turn of the 20th century and has since went into decline. A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving, Revealing--Even Haunting","review":"Erik Larson's book succeeds brilliantly on multiple levels--as a period piece; as a history of 19th century industry, invention, and architecture; as a revelation of civic pride and conflict; and as a glimpse into the mind of a psychopathic killer. What one can learn from this book is remarkable, stretching from the invention of the Ferris Wheel and electric lighting to the introduction of such Americana as Shredded Wheat and Cracker Jack. By any measure, \\"The Devil in the White City\\" is a rich, rewarding read. I haven't been so entranced since...since I took my first Ferris Wheel ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, to see the White City...","review":"This book really makes you want to be there. The recount of the creation of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair is very vivid and well-written. As I've read in another review, I wish there were a few more pictures to match the grand descriptions captured in the book. This book really explains how this fair has changed America.The book follows two stories, Daniel Burnham (the fair's architect) and H.H. Holmes (a serial killer). I actually found the story concerning Holmes to be a lot less interesting than that of Burnham's. Burnham's story of struggle and triumph to create the fair easily ecipses Holmes' murdering escapades.As someone who has just recently started reading nonfiction books, I would recommend this book to anyone. The information is very detailed and interesting. Those scared of reading nonfiction should not worry as it easily reads like a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn something about which you know nothing","review":"I'm so glad I read this book. The competition for which city would host the first U.S. World's Fair, the incredibly brave and brilliant architechts who somehow brought it to fruition. The obstacles and pitfalls were amazing and the outcome spectacular! That a serial killer was cruising the city was neither here nor there for me. I knew that story, but the World's Fair story...now that was something! I just bought this book for my father. It's different, historical and richly rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracking a Serial Killer in the Midst of the 1893 World's Fair","review":"This well written and researched book is appealing as a wonderful account of both the funding and construction of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 (The Great White City) and the Chicago Police's efforts to track down a serial killer who preys on naive young women who come to Chicago looking for jobs during this exciting time. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and almost compels reading in a single seating! I found myself so facinated with the Chicago World's Fair that I have spent considerable time studying it further. Google it and you will feast your eyes on the remarkable architecture of this World's Fair and imagine its profound impact on architecture all over the United States and the world. For example, many cities in New England and elsewhere in the Northeast have buildings that were strongly influenced by this World's Fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Worth all of the praise it has received--extremely well written and fun. The descriptions of the architecture and architectural influence of the fair are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story!","review":"This is a wonderful book written about this part of our history. It is written in an interesting fashion. My only regret was that there were very few photographs of the facinating collection of buildings. I had to add another book with pictures to my library to complete my knowledge of this event. This is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil in the white city","review":"Excellent recount of the 1893 Chicago Exposition, and also the detailed pathology of Herman Mudgett. Eric Larson is a master in writing non-fiction like a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"Larson can not only tell a fantastic story, but he's also an incredible writer...(\\"The light had faded to a thin broth,\\" \\"Cicadas scratched off messages from every tree,\\" etc.) which made the book such a joy to read. He is a talent.There is only one thing that troubles me. Larson took great pains to maintain historical fidelity except on one note - Minnie Williams seems to have been, from other sources I have read, more of a co-conspirator than Larson lets on.I thoroughly enjoyed the book in all other aspects. Larson really captures the spirit of the age and the satanic virtue, as it were, of turn-of-the-century Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Anything by Erik Larson is a must read, and this book is no exception. I love the way he takes true events and tells the story that makes you not want to put the book down. This is truly one of the greatest authors we have been blessed with. Read all his books. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brain Candy","review":"Incredibly entertaining. Multiple perspectives of a point in time (1890's Chicago) are presented in such a way that you never grow bored with any one thread. The author deftly toggles two not entirely unrelated themes (the building of The Chicago World's Fair and a serial killer), keeping you chronically curious about what's going on in both places at once. History and intrigue for the masses and nobody gets cheated. The building of the Columbian Exposition was amazingly more mind boggling than the story of H.H. Holmes - a ghoulish murderer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"The two separate stories never really come together. It has some interesting historical info but that's about it. One of the very few books I just couldn't read to the end.... Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but.......","review":"A very interesting historical study of events that shaped the Fair in Chicago in 1893, as well as the fictionalized account of Holmes. A very well thought out and researched story. In many areas, excruciatingly boring as it explored the minutia of the planning of, building of, and preparations for the Fair. I almost gave up on this book, as it almost began to read like a technical manual. Although it was very interesting when dealing with the descriptions of the events and the bizarre life of Holmes. My advice is to enjoy this work, but skim in when you must."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil in the White City","review":"Great book! Lots of information that I never would have know about the fair and what it brought us. The writer is fantastic and at times had to keep reminding myself that this was a true story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing time in history","review":"Did doesn't sound like there could be much of a story but Erik Larson does a fantastic job making this entire book interesting and entertaining. It is about the 1893 Chicago's World Fair and how Chicago undertook the responsibilities of having to create an amazing \\"city\\" in only a couple of years. It also has the parallel story of Dr. H.H. Holmes and how he became one of America's first serial killers. This was a time of amazing developments and technologies that we take for granted today. This was really an eye opener and should be read by anyone who enjoys history and how it impacts the future. Great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book-The Devil's in the Details","review":"I first heard about this book when Erik Larson was interviewed on talkradio in the Bay Area awhile back. My parents are from Chicago,and having visited there several times, I've always wanted to find out more about the \\"cultural\\" history, and this book does it! I love architecture, history and a serial killer doesn't hurt for a storyline. Having read the review by a reader that some of the inclusions of famous people such as Lizzie Borden could be inaccurate, it did make me wonder if that was an aberration,not a pattern. Overall, I loved the book, but another reviewer pointed out validly, that there could have been more pictures, so that's probably my only major criticism. I would definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing...","review":"A wonderful read, bought it on the way to Jamaica this week and absolutely couldn't put it down. Great storytelling, the descriptive passages regarding the serial killers actions and timeline are incredibly chilling. Equally interesting is the backgound details of the fair, a native Chicagoan, I am embarassed to say that I knew little or nothing about the fair, let alone HH Holmes. Yes, a little repetitive at times but a fascinating look at Chicago, its artists, its work ethic as well as its seamy underside."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring!","review":"I only bought this book because I like Scott Brick, but even his narration couldn't save this book. I have never read (listened) to a book that was so full of minutia before. At one point, the author goes so far as to provide a list of the frequency of illnesses caused at the fair, including one case of extreme flatulence. UGH! This was awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATED IT","review":"THis book was written like a research paper. I want the plot to go somewhere,and didn't really care that this or that train car origionated here or there or was used for some other purpose. I didn't care what it took from Lawyers, Bankers, Planners to get the worlds fair off the ground. I wanted to know about the serial killer and in the end read every other chapter so I could keep up with that... giving up on all the other INFORMATION stuffed between the pages. If I had wanted a research paper to read I could have found one... without being secretly wrapped in the pages of a NOVEL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating minutiae - gag me","review":"I'm used to reading real history books with their infinite detail - but this one goes tooooooo far - and it's not even a history book. I gave up on p. 69 when I had to suffer thru this totally worthless, useless detail about a non-character in the whole scheme of things -\\"Pitezel was plagued with various maladies: sore knees from the installation of one too many floors, a wart on his neck that kept him from wearing a stiff collar, ...\\"After 110 years the author thinks I need to read about an incidental character's wart - listen - I have better things to do with my time - and you probably do to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly.","review":"Overwritten. Deadly. Wordy. Boring. Extraneous material. What more can I say? The worst part is that it's on my Kindle so I can't even turn to the back page to see how this (yawn) book ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not buy because text-tos-peech not enabled.","review":"I give this product one star because my principles would not allow me to purchase a text-to-speech disabled book. Too bad as I really wanted to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it! What a waste!","review":"Do yourself a favor and walk by this one! I can't believe I finished it. I didn't enjoy it at all....I would not recommend this book at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of two great subjects","review":"I've sat through architecture lectures that were better prepared and more riveting than this dull recitation of facts. The characters never came alive, and the tenuous connection between the World's Fair and the serial killer were not enough to hold my interest. The total lack of drama makes the enjoyable detail of the Fair almost too hard to find. Don't kid yourself, there are better murder mysteries out there, and the only reason this book shot to the best seller list is the lure of Continuing Education Credits for the country's 75,000 architects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Alert","review":"I was really excited about reading this book because it sounded so interesting and had received such wonderful reviews. I was sorely disappointed. I found the endless details of the construction of the World's Fair to be so boring that it might actually be a new cure for insomnia. It was completely lackluster and dull. I was intrigued by the tale of H.H. Holmes, the serial killer, but his role in the book was entirely too small and not enough detail was given about him and his crimes. I think Larson tried to accomplish too large of a task with this novel. He should have written about either the fair or the serial killer, but not both. I think a little dose of fiction would have been OK too. Sometimes the reality of a tale doesn't make for very interesting reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"fraudulent title and boring to boot.","review":"the title 'the devil in the white city' would have you believe that murder, magic and madness occured at the great world's fair in chicgo in 1893. not the case at all. here is the extent of the connection between the killer and the fair: THE MURDER LIVED IN CHICAGO AND MAY HAVE ATTENDED THE FAIR. yes, that is it. pretty thrilling, eh?? did he murder anyone there? nope!! did he haunt the fair and terrorize folks? not at all!! did he drop a great chandellier on the symphony crowd? not in the slightest!! the worst of his doings is that he might have gone to the fair once or twice.but the author, to sell a vapid treatise on the fair, spices it up by connecting falsely the fair and the killer. in fact, this is the most boring book with a chicago theme next to the phone book. totally secondary research from papers and letters on both subjects and rather poorly written as well. not 'the phantom of the opera' in any stretch. dgs"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil in the White City","review":"This was an excellent book, both historically and the thorough story told. It provides an inciteful look at what Chicago was like in the late 1800's and about some of the colorful characters that lived there....both good and very evil. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in history, strong characters and murder. A top notch book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Research, Way too verbose","review":"I eagerly began this book over Christmas break, hoping to love it. The problem for me was this: the author describes the building of the fair with so much unnecessary detail that I start to feel sleepy every time I pick the book up. How many times can one just reiterate the long, drawn-out process of fair-building? Apparently, an entire book's worth....BO-RING. I do agree with another reviewer who stated that the Holmes story was more interesting -- this is true, but I don't think I can finish this book. I am more than half way through and just bored to tears. The author knows his stuff, and some of his descriptions are really cool, but the over-abundance of detail diminishes the impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having trouble getting into the book","review":"According to my Kindle I'm about 15 percent into the book and I am bored by it and I'm almost to the point of giving up on the book entirely. So far it's like reading a history book, not a novel. I love reading historical fiction, but this is too much fact not enough story line. I'm going to read a bit further in the book, but so far it has not kept my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an ok read","review":"I was expecting more from the Devil in the White City other than a overly pedantic telling of the building of the Columbian Exposition with a police type report on the murders. I have to say I enjoyed what I read about the building, but I grew very tired of the writing style. I knew I was in trouble when in the first chapter, the author had to tell me the police call box number.No where does the author get into the mind of the killer. I have no idea of the motive or what possessed him to do the deeds he did. This is no \\"In Cold Blood\\".I was expecting more from the hype and came away disappointed. If you are a fan of World's Fairs, it was a good read. If you are real crime buff, it was ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Stories in One","review":"This should have been written as two separate tales. The politics, mystery, creativity and drive to stage this World's Fair during the industrial revolution was a tale unto itself. The unpleasant story of the serial killer would be suited to those who want to read murder mysteries and tales of gore. All in all it was a good book, historically interesting. Unfortunately, my copy was missing about twenty-five pages that included the first murders in the \\"castle\\" and the opening of the World's Fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil in the White City","review":"Wonderful blend of technique and the attention to historical detail was gripping. I immediately purchased Larson's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in the White City","review":"I learned a lot of things from this book. Not life things, but historical things. It was well researched and although it took me about 80 pages to get into it, it was well worth reading, and extremely interesting, as it took you to 1891 - 1893 and the architects and planners for the Chicago Worlds Fair, and it interlaced a second story (about every other chapter) about a real serial killer that preyed upon people, women, men, and even children. Products that came from the fair included Cracker Jacks, Shredded Wheat, and the Ferris Wheel! I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading Devil in the White City, I am very shocked by all the great reviews it has received. I found the book very slow, tedious, and repetitive. Unless you are an architecture buff, the details about the planning and building of the fair are long and slow. The story of Holmes was very repetitive. Also, I became very tired of hearing over and over again about Olmstead's aching teeth. Finally, the book wasn't particularly well written, although the author seems to love his large vocabulary (or just a great thesaurus). Ouch! This might be harsh, but if it wasn't for it being a book club selection, I wouldn't have wasted my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil in the White City.","review":"Had some bad spots on the CD so we had to skip through some chapters. We like the author and the story is great, but we hated to skip through some of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil killed the editor?","review":"I agree with the other one-star reviews here. A friend recommended it to me because I love Caleb Carr's \\"The Alienist\\". In contrast, this book is plodding and painfully repetitive. I could've easily made a drinking game of the times Larson uses the phrases \\"his blue gaze\\" or the words \\"Chinook\\" (as an adjective) and \\"macadam\\". Larson has a gift for painfully awkward descriptive phrases and I'd say half of the material in the book didn't lend itself to the story at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too much detail.....","review":"our book club chose this - at least a few of the gals said they just couldn't get through it- and I made it to page 200 and just couldn't wait any longer for it to really hold my interest. The parts about Holmes were intriguing - sad that in those days there was no technology/means of tracking vanished people. Sorry, the general concensus of our group was a thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A deeply disturbing book","review":"Our book club chose this book, so I felt I had to read it --- but found I simply could not force myself even halfway through it! The two stories included are supposedly connected by the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, but the connection is tenuous at best.Telling how the World's Fair came about, from start to finish, could have been accomplished in a couple of short chapters. Instead, the writer drags the whole thing out, detail by tedious detail, in an incredibly boring and depressing narrative.The \\"true crime\\" story of Dr. Holmes, on the other hand, is horrifying. I am appalled to find that this book appears on many student \\"recommended reading\\" lists! \\"Recommended\\" for what earthly reason?! It is shock writing, cheap and tawdry.Surely the reading public can set the bar way above this kind of pretentious trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil in the White City","review":"For a book that received so many accolades, it was, well, just plain boring! Haven't even finished it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are buying Larson's research notebook","review":"The book had incredible potential with all the rich history and interesting personalities. Unfortunately what this book -really- is Larson's fascination with the fair and Burnham, however he's clever to use details about Holmes to drag the reader through his notes. Yes, the book is basically a huge research notebook of non-fiction which as a work of history was poorly written. I appreciate the notes an bibliography in the back. Overall Larson wanted the best of both worlds, history told as relaxed fiction and he ended up with a mess. I think many readers here did not actually read the same book as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected.","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I got it thinking it was a great murder mystery but instead it was all about the construction of the buildings of the time. I tried my best repeatedly but was unable to get past the first half of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrifit","review":"I did not receive the book I ordered.

I looked forward to each chapter and in finding out what happened to the evil man who committed these crimes in Chicago over one-hundred years ago. I learned about the book while on a city-wide bus tour in Chicago and I'm glad I listened and bought it. I have loaned it to one of my Chicago friends to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery and History","review":"This book is a good read if you enjoy a true tale murder with architecture in the 19th century.

I recommend the book as a BEST read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but Kindle version has problems","review":"I haven't seen the paper version, but the Kindle version seems to be missing hundreds of commas, all of them from introductory elements of sentences.

Look forward to reading his other books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil in the White City","review":"I admire the author for his extensive research on the Chicago Fair of 1893, but, unfortunately, that's where my admiration ends. For me the fascinating story was muddied by excessive details. The \\"teasers\\" at the end of many sections went from interesting to irritating. I was mentally pleading for him to move the story forward. The conclusion that provided details about the characters almost seemed an afterthought and could have been handled much more creatively. It's worth plodding through for the fair details - would have been so much better without so many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough About The Devil","review":"First-I really enjoyed the book. I loved the historical aspect of both the World Fair and of H.H. Holmes aka Herman Mudgett aka about twenty other aliases. However I really had to force myself through it. I found the majority of the book to be mostly about the architects and it was really quite boring to me. This book was recommended to me and since I wanted to read it so badly I recommended it as my pick to my book club. I figured since I recommended it....I better finish it! I really am glad I did!! The ending was much better and focused a lot more on Holmes. I honestly believe that if the author would have put more effort on Holmes he would have pulled more readers in and left them satisfied. Sickening as the man was, people have a human nature to want to learn more about the things we don't understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few interesting facts spread over far too many pages","review":"I live in Illinois. I love Chicago. I was ready to sit back and enjoy a great local read. Unfortunately, the author spent far too much time on mundane and repetetive details which could have been condensed by more than half, and the interesting bits were left almost incomplete, as if he didn't actually have the \\"whole story\\". I was bored through hundreds of pages of monotony, then lured into a few quick pages of half revealed story, and back to the monotony. Not to mention the random unrelated facts that he would often just throw out there. Something that happened and was totally unconnected to the fair or Chicago in any way. Why? I haven't a clue. There was a good story in there -- somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing for me.","review":"This book was suggested to me by a family member as a real page turner. In my opinion not only was it not a page turner, I had to go back and reread some of the book in order to keep up. There are several characters to keep up with and the book kept going back and forth between characters. I wanted to read it because it was a true story but I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in the White City","review":"This was not only an interesting true crime read but a fabulous history lesson and great architechural record of that period. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil in the White City","review":"This was a very well researched novel set in 1890's Chicago. It gave an accurate picture of life then and mixed in a murderous villain which made the book read like fiction"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil in the White City","review":"The World's Fair of 1893 was a heady time for Chicago. Architecture and a serial killer compete for your attention - The intrigue of the World's Fair, obviously well researched and documented, outweighs the story of the twisted mind who could lure so many naive and trusting individuals to their deaths. Although a true story, more could have been made of the murderer and less info about the dental pains of John Olmstead. Still a fast and good read though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIGHT IN MY OWN BACKYARD!","review":"Over the years I've read small articles regarding the activities of H.H. Holmes. I have also read many accounts of the world fairs held in Chicago. This book is fascinating because it shows the very dark side of the activities of a serial killer and pits it against the construction of a larger than life mini city.The descriptions of the fair are lush and extravagant. The details of Holmes atrocities are dark and putrid. When blended together, the stories are both intertwined with one another and are most engrossing.I've lived in Chicago my entire life, but this book presents a world and a time that seems very far removed from what I know as 'home'."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNBELIEVABLE!","review":"I can't believe I had never heard of this crime until I happened on this book. This book artfully balances the chilly story of the gruesome murders committed by Herman Mudgett with the beauty, majesty and accomplishments of the Chicago's Columbian Exposition as a background. If, like me, it stirred additional interest in the Exposition itself, be sure to watch the \\"White City\\" DVD narrated by Gene Wilder. It is astonishing what they created, the sheer number of exhibits from all over the world and the celebration of different people and cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, you will want to read this","review":"I won't describe the story, all the other reviews do that. The question is, should you get this book? The answer is yes.Here are the reasons why:1. It is a true story, which makes it that much more enthralling.2. It describes what Chicago/US was like back in the 1890s. I never enjoyed my history classes in school, but if they had involved novels like this, then I would have aced those classes.3. It tells you about the actions of one SCARY individual in Chicago at that time. Why he isn't more famous, even today, is a mystery.4. Much like The Garden of Good and Evil gets you excited to visit Savannah, this book gets you excited about seeing Chicago and what remains of the fair's buildings."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get better than this","review":"The best book I've read in years!

Reads like great fiction!!","review":"I had debated about buying this books for a couple years. I would look at it, and then put it back. Finally, I decided to just go ahead and buy it, and I am so glad that I did.This book is wonderful! It is entertaining, suspenseful, and educational. That is a fairly difficult combination for fiction and nearly impossible for non-fiction. I had to keep reminding myself that this was, in fact, a non-fiction book. I really enjoyed the way the author wove the two stories together throughout the book. I would highly recommend this book if you enjoy historical fiction or historical non-fiction books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay. Not at all what I expected","review":"I purchased this book while traveling, I had a very long layover. It definitely looks interesting, and the synopsis had me intrigued. What I thought would be a book centered around H.H. Holmes, it is in fact much more focused on the building of the World's Fair. I found those chapters to be quite boring and frankly a drag to get through. Yes, there are definitely aspects of the true crime, and those parts do read like a novel. But I thought there would be much more to that part of the story. Most of the book is the mundane details of the buildings, dates, and architecture. Obviously many people enjoyed reading about that, but I found it difficult to get through. If a book interests me enough I will stay up until 3 or 4 am, just so I can finish it. I have read MANY novels in just a day or 2. This book took me more than 2 months of evening reading to finish completely. Informative about the fair, but it really left me disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, Unbelievable, and yet true! Rarely is Non-Fiction THIS Incredible! A FABULOUS READ!","review":"Amazing in every regard! And yet, I almost MISSED this book! I picked it up quite by accident, started to read the first few pages and was HOOKED, right from the start. Mr. Larson's story works rare magic in its historic account of the brilliant 1893 World's Fair in Chicago, where nearby a truly heinous predator hones his evil in its shadows. I was transported back to America of the 1890's, saw a different view of our country, and marveled at the brilliance of the architects who conceived the Fair and struggled to make it a reality. The terms \\"skyscraper\\" and \\"serial killer\\" are both introduced into our language at this remarkable crossroad of history. Every page is beyond-belief fascinating! Thank you, Mr. Larson, for one of the MOST intriguing and thrilling books that I've ever experienced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Historical Book","review":"A very interesting, well-written read. I learned a lot about the World's Fair in Chicago, the challenges involved in making it a reality, and the products that were invented for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Must read","review":"Fascinating account.

This was one book I should have left on the shelf at the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What it Seems","review":"I got a third of the way through the book and chose to end it there before I went any further. I dove into it believing it would be a good read. I was mistaken to say the least. I should have read the reviews, I would have saved myself some time. While both stories are entertaining I wanted more of Holmes and less Worlds Fair. I believe it was a great time in not only Chicagos history but Americas as well. Sadly too much time was spent on detail that left me bored and when Holmes came into the picture I felt deceived by the title. If you looking for a book about Holmes look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"One book...or two?","review":"Maybe I'm alone in this opinion, but this reads like two separate and distinct books that only share a setting. I have to confess that I'm only a bit over half way through the book, but so far the story of building the fair and the story of Holmes the serial killer seem to stand so separately that I can hardly see the justification for the two stories to share a set of covers.While I am finding the story of the fair's construction to be a very good read, I can't say the same for Holes' story. Larson seems to be reaching here, desperate for real blood curdling details that he just doesn't have to give.I seem to be in a minority with this opinion, so perhaps a miracle occurs in the second half of the book that brings these two stories together in a meaningful way...hope springs eternal..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil in the White City","review":"Great book! Written very well,he helps your mind to come up with the mental pictures that you need for the turn of the century 1890 - 1900.

When I should have been sleeping, I found myself captivated by the stories of Burnham and Holmes. I lost sleep over this book and could not put it down.At first I found the way that the chapters alternated odd, but as I continued with the story, the format grew on me. The way that Larson blends other historical figures into his work adds to the interesting setup of the story of the fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"The book goes into more detail than what I care for, but it is very very interesting in everything you learn about American History"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Belonging to a book club for several years, we all agreed this book rated as one of our top ten books. Not only was it historically accurate but it was written in a style that captivated the reader with a serial killer on the loose and a race against time to accomplish an almost impossible feat. A book to be read and reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent storytelling","review":"I generally abhor history - but someone recommended this book to me. It was so compelling I could not put it down. Larson flawlessly weaved the two stories together, demonstrating his incredible talent for storytelling. It is definately a great -and quick - read for someone who does not know a whole lot about the events of the fair, judging from some of the other reviews however, maybe not one for Chicago history buffs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Stop Listening!","review":"Short and to the point: I purchased the audio book of \\"The Devil in the White City\\" after reading a review in 'Bottom Line.\\"It's absolutely the most riveting listening I have ever heard, and it's some of the most fascinating, factually-driven prose I've ever listened to.Do yourself a favor. Buy the audio book, but do not make the mistake of listening to it in heavy traffic.It will take your mind off the road more than a cell phone,squawling baby and drippy cheeseburger combined.This is an audio book meant to be heard while driving on theopen road, at night with, perhaps, a little rain to heightenthe mood.Guys like Erik Larson amaze me. Where do they get such wonderfulideas for books? Then, where do they skewer up their talents andguts to put it all together??A wonderful listen. You will not regret it.

I also didn't get the correlation between The World's Fair and H H Holmes other than they both were in Chicago the same time. I would have enjoyed the book more if it were just about H H Holmes. The Fair stuff was sooooooooooo boring, and confusing with all the constant name dropping . Most of these characters never evolved throughout the story. If you are considering getting this book, consider skipping every other chapter about the Fair and just read about America's first serial killer, H. H. Holmes. You won't miss anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had high expectations for this book but I found it boring and too steeped in technical details.

I know the loss of this one sale doesn't impact the publisher, but hopefully others will refuse to purchase from publishers that over-price Kindle books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devil in the White City: Murder, Magic, and Madness","review":"I gave this book five stars because I couldn't put it down! I was utterly fascinated by the time, place, innovations and \\"firsts\\" of all sorts that appeared at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The end of the 19th century is awhirl in historical happenings, invention and change. The city of Chicago was put on the map by this World's Fair and deservedly so. The most well-known and famous architects, designers and builder's were assembled to build it, the wealthiest and famous would attend it, and the first American serial killer would stalk it. Truly amazing read, I recommend it as a window into that world where one could embody the devil himself and seem like the most respected and successful man about town; where Cowboys and Indians battle it out for the price of admission; and the men who constructed the 'White City' would throw their entire beings into it's near failure and it's ultimate success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible history","review":"In our modern day of Disney World and adventure parks on every corner many Americans have no idea of the impact the Chicago Worlds Fair had on our culture. While it was a time of great accomplishments it also revealed the dark side of our culture as well. Well written and intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my new favorites","review":"Not only is this book now one of my favorites, I am continuously throwing it in my friends' and coworkers' faces: \\"HEY, WANT TO READ A BOOK THAT WILL KNOCK YOUR SOCKS OFF, LAUNDER THEM, AND GIVE THEM BACK TO YOU??!!\\" Most of the time they say yes.What Erik Larson has done here is nothing short of spectacular. I live in Chicago, and work in Burnham's last building, right next to where his office was at the top of the Rookery. Larson has opened my eyes to the old city inside my new one. He tells a story of complete truth, dutifully cited and explained, and backed with volumes of notes, but it is not tedious. It is not textbook-like. It is told how history should be told: like a story. Because history is a living breathing thing, too. Mr. Larson knows this.I highly recommend this read; from the beauty and wonder of the fair and a city on the brink of making it, to the dark secrets of a man too charming for his own good, this is one devil of a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb and surprising history of Chicago","review":"Erik Larson does an exceptional job bringing to life the characters who put Chicago on the map just a decade or two after the Great Chicago Fire nearly wiped the town off of it. It really is the remarkable story here, contrasted against the tale of a serial killer who was operating in Chicago at the same time - but that sensational story is somehow less interesting than that of the characters who put the World's Fair together in a matter of months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately poorly-written history book","review":"This book has so much potential, focusing on a part of American history which many people know so little about. The problem is that the author, who indubitably did thorough research, tries to fit in as much detail as possible and sacrifices the narrative to this purpose. The final chapters are the only part of the story that truly engage the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting account of Chicago","review":"I found the history of Chicago, with the background of the murderous Holmes fascinating. Hard to believe that no one knew of his exploits, but sometimes serial killers are indeed charming, and folks often see, but don't really observe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Fiction at its (Almost) Finest","review":"I read The Devil in the White City at the recommendation of a friend into historical fiction, but don't go into it thinking you're getting more of a story-driven novel, because you're most certainly not. However, what's here is strangely compelling in a sick, twisted sort of way, and it's difficult to wrap your head around the idea that monsters like this actually exist. It doesn't do much for entertainment, but it's still incredibly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space, place and crime","review":"The Devil in the White City is a ripping good read, but it's also chock-a-block full of information. Where other reviews mention that Larson's work tells the story of two men, they seem to overlook that it tells an equally fascinating account about architecture, geography, urban planning, political machinations, civic rivalry, and social conditions, as well as marking a pivotal turning point in the way the Western city is imagined and constructed. I wonder if it is, in fact, only in such an urban environment as the Black City (Chicago beyond the grounds of the world's fairgrounds of the White City) that such horrific crime can occur; in the smaller towns and villages, hidden murderers could benefit so much less from the anonymity of their victims. Perhaps it is the post-White City urban world that has allowed the serial killer monster to thrive, where we knew them not before that time. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who wants a page-turner that also makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I read this book not knowing anything about it as it was chosen for our monthly book group read. Reading the book is quite a history lesson. What wasn't invented in the 1890's? The book swithches between two corresponding stories quite deftly. I would put this book in the \\"can't put down\\" category. I very much enjoyed it and it was a big hit with our book group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"If you want to hear about all the minutia of the Chicago World's Fair, then this book is for you. It took forever to get going and then I found it very dull, not what I expected based on the synopsis of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick. Blah.","review":"My friend recommended this book to me and we had read a bunch of the same books so I trusted her on this one. What a disappointment this book was. The author at most times sounds snobby and pretentious and annoying. Like \\" oh I just learned a new word, how can I insert it into this boring story??\\" I've never had to use the kindle dictionary so much on one book. The only reason I got through the whole thing was because the serial killer part of the story was interesting. I just wish I could have read that part by another author. I'm mad I spent money on this one. I've read much better free kindle books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste old Chicago with this gritty tale","review":"History really comes alive, jumping off the pages in this gripping story of old Chicago. The author paints a vivid picture of life in and around the World Fair leaving the taste of the stockyards in your mouth and the grime of downtown on your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left wanting to know more about the Fair","review":"I thought this was just the right amount of mystery and history in The Devil in the White City.I am very intrigued with The Fair and will research more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Gripping and Amazing Story","review":"The time Larson has put into researching this book is astounding. There are two incredible tales in this book, each which is told beautifully. First, the incredible Columbian Exposition constructed at such a rapid pace to meet impossibly short deadlines, and the beauty which resulted. Secondly, the eerie tale of a serial killer who seduced beautiful women into coming to Chicago, only to kill them later.The book is written beautifully and is neither too short nor too long. I would reccomend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This changed my mind about non-fiction!!!","review":"Being a true fiction devotee, I picked up this book only because I'm originally from Chicago and it is a city near and dear to my heart. How glad I am that I did! Larson's writing is spectacular. Vivid descriptions, lively characters, and a quick pace keeps you interested the entire time. He alternates between the creation of the Chicago Worlds Fair and the dark descent of a serial killer living during that time. I learned so much about architecure, history, and Chicago and I just felt like I was reading a great story. I would definitely recommend this book as a great read for fiction and non-fiction lovers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Unique","review":"Erik Larson's tale of achitectural brilliance mixed with murder and mayhem is like nothing I've read before. But it is undeniably a success. The most difficult part to believe is that the story is factual and not a work of fiction. The World's Fair was at a crucial time and place in American history and Larson has done a fine job of laying out the details in interesting prose. Playing back and forth from Burnham's determination to see the project through, and Holmes'ghastly predation of young women will keep readers glued to the pages. First rate work by a first rate author.James Hart IsleyAuthor of The Bear Hunter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceiving title","review":"This book was too long, drawn out, and boring. The process of building a fair from beginning to end is not interesting. The title lures you in and is deceiving. There is no devil. There isn't any magic. The murder is barely touched upon. The story was about the problems the architect had getting the plans through so it could be built and then how long it took to build. I suppose if you were a builder or an architect it could possibly be interesting. I felt let down after I finished it. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"About Quality","review":"The book was advertized to be \\"used and in good condition.\\" It was not in good condition. It was falling apart and had been liberally highlighted throughout the text. I liked the story, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting piece of history","review":"It is a shame that such worthwhile aspects of our culture and history such as The Devil in the White City are not explored further during our education. Larson does an excellent job of taking us back to the 19th century at a time when America was young. The savagery of Chicago during this time was never known to most people, as well as the savagery of H.H. Holmes. If I had one thing negative to say about this book it is that Holmes' pychosis along with the detective who tracked him down should have been explored further. The again, maybe Larson included all of the information that was available. Excellent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but stop and start stories don't jell","review":"Describing the Columbian Fair would have been monumental in its own right. To add a serial killer to the mix, that was icing on the cake.The problem is that I felt the icing was just that. Both stories were compelling on their own. Putting them together, a little overwhelming. I was very pleased with the coverage of the Fair and the herculean efforts to bring it to fruition. I was hanging with the Holmes parts until the last part when it seemed as though Larson rushed through the details of Holmes crimes. I was left wanting to know more about Holmes and the trial and Pinkerton's investigation.The book is well researched and written well but hurriedly brought to conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The city is the star","review":"This is an engaging recreation of Chicago in the 1890s, with deftly interwoven mini-biographies of a handful of movers and shakers, some now venerated, some almost forgotten.It may seem an odd comparison, but in that respect this book reminded me of \\"Seabiscuit\\". (I wasn't particularly interested in horse racing or the architectural history of Chicago, but in both cases, the authors did such compelling research, I became engrossed.)I think the only readers who might be disappointed are those in search of a gory account of the crimes of Mudgett/Holmes. The hardcore true crime fans might prefer Harold Schechter's \\"Depraved\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misrepresentation","review":"As I read this book, I could not help but feel that the author had done a great deal of research about the Chicago World's Fair, but felt it in itself wasn't interesting enough. So, he added a little spice -- what more appealing (in his eyes) than a serial killer who preyed on single women and children, coincidentally at the time of the Fair? My advice is if you want to read an in-depth (and I mean in-depth!) history of the Fair -- and one without too much literary merit at that --read this book, but skip over the chapters about the infamous H. H. Holmes. If you want to read about this serial killer, you can learn as much from a quick Internet search and won't have to scour the book to find the chapters that refer to him. This book smacks of sensationalism, as does so much of today's entertainment, and that's unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although the book is well written and researched, I was disappointed that the focus is more on the architects of the fair and less on H.H. Holmes, the murderer. The book is 95% about the building of the fair and 5% about the evil that lurked beneath it. I felt tricked by the title and the advertising about what I was buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow - Boring - Misleading Title","review":"This was one book I couldn't WAIT to finish...not because I was so interested in how it would all play out but rather just to be done with it and move on to something engaging. The title should have been something along the lines of \\"The Creation and Construction of the Worlds Fair...and Minor Other Tidbits\\". The first 3/4 of the book deals with the idea, planning and creation of the Worlds Fair...it isn't even completed until the last section of the book!There is really not much information on the murders referred to in the title, just little bits and pieces. Unentertaining to the fullest. I'm bitter for having wasted so much time with this book waiting for it to get better...which although it did get mildly better at the very end, not nearly enough to carry the entire book and make it worth while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true crime book","review":"This book would be good for someone interested in learning about the Chicago World Fair and the people involved but it was definitely not a true crime book. More than 1/2 the book was about the Exposition and the parts about the murders weren't even facts but assumed truth. If you want to read a book on true crime Ann Rule is good and it is true facts. The only real facts of this book was about the fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I was looking for.","review":"I purchased this book because I thought it was totally about H.H.Holmes. It is NOT. It is 75% about the head architect and the ins and out of constructing the Expo. And then 25% about H.H.Holmes. I have read numerous books about serial killers, I know weird, everything the FBI's BAU has, Mindhunter and so on. This is by far the worst one. O'well live and learn. I think this guy got all his info from newspaper clippings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition not lendable.","review":"I had heard that Kindle books can be lent. Only a few of them apparently.

The history and the mystery made it a real page turner. I have visited Chicago before, but next time it will be far more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical narrative at its best","review":"This is the perfect example of narrative nonfiction that reads like a novel. Larson has woven together two seemingly disparate tales that build to a shared climax. He skillfully relates the trials and tribulations involved in launching the 1893 World's Fair in Chicago--a monumental event that earned the city the respect and prestige that it had sorely lacked--as he dissects the twisted machinations of one of Chicago's most notorious serial killers. Although Larson never overtly suggests any sociological link between the two phenomena, the juxtaposition of these stories implies that the evolution of \\"civilized culture\\" can help cultivate the most base and evil aspects of human nature. Larson's style is clear and captivating--I wish more nonfiction writers possessed his flair for language. My close proximity to Chicago is an added treat, since I recognized many of the geographical allusions to the state of Indiana (one of the killer's victims was a Lafayette native)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Please just read the book. History is not much of an interest for me, but I learned so much about the World Fair and the way life was lived during the turn of the century. It is a very well-written novel.

At the end of each chapter, I wanted to continue the story being told, but I was also eager to continue with the story left at the end of the preceding chapter. The story of the architects of the White City was as compelling as the murder story. Upon ending the book, I was sorry it was over; I wished there was more to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good background","review":"Good backgroundThis book was a good background book. You'll not walk away with all the details of the World's Columbian Exposition. You'll not walk away with all the details of H. H. Holmes. Yet you'll walk away with a greater appreciation for the City of Chicago. As a Child I always loved the museums, I was always told they were from the World's Columbian Exposition. Yet my favorite was the only one really. The Palace of Fine Arts or as we call it Museum of Science & Industry building is the only one left. Last time I took the kids I went looking for the photos they have of the World's Columbian Exposition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as many have said","review":"I had seen this book on the shelves of local bookstores and on \\"The New York Times\\" bestseller list before actually purchasing it. Due to this acclaim, I had high expectations for the book. It's not that \\"Devil\\" is that bad (I read it in 2 days); it's that it doesn't quite live up to the hype.As many have stated, it is a dual \\"biography\\": One story centers on the creators of the Chicago's World Fair at the turn of the century; the other, on H.H. Holmes, a serial killer who used the fair to lure his victims. Many prefered the story of the architects, but I found Holmes' narrative far more interesting and exciting.It is a definite page-turner (soon to be a major motion picture, so I've heard, starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Holmes); but overall, a book to read in the waiting room, not one that leaves you pondering once it's all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much detail for me","review":"The rest of my book club loved this book, and it is certainly informative, and makes you think about how much work goes into planning big events. He throws in too much detail for my taste. I expected to be able to get into the mind of Holmes and at least start to see why he murdered the women. I did not buy the author's thesis that he simply liked to have them in his power. Seems like if this is true, he would have easily been able to entice and kill many more women. My favorite part was learning about how novel the idea of city planning was and was utilized by Burnham in planning the Chicago World's Fair. It was brilliant that he thought to bring in fresh water to prevent cholera and have an on-site hospital, fire department, police, and child care."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Wonderful entertaing history. makes you want to visit Chicago to see the remaining buildings of the fair. think we will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Very enjoyable if you struggle reading fiction this is a great compromise.I really only read text books and struggle to finish fiction.

It was recommended as a great book. I guess if you are interested in architecture, it would be. I myself, like mysteries and thrillers, and thought there would be more intrique. Although I do like historical novels, this was very difficult to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, Fascinating and Intriguing","review":"True, the story is somewhat disjointed--almost without exception, the chapters alternate between the two storylines. Some may dislike this, but I thought it was great. The only true commonality between the two is that both were going on in the same city at roughly the same time, but I enjoyed the juxtaposition of two opposing storylines. One showed the grander side of human achievement while the other showed the darker side of humanity. However, they both showed the resourcefulness and ingenuity of brilliant minds.As a side note, I was also fully intrigued to see how the World's Fair in Chicago affected what we use in our day-to-day lives today.My only complaint is that the writing is somewhat sloppy--it seemed to get sloppier as the book progressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Yet another book where an author interjects a story he thinks will sell books with an unrelated tale. I was so annoyed by the pointless intercutting of the story of the building of the Chicago's world's fair and serial killer H.H. Holmes that I ended up skipping the Holmes' parts then returning to read them all at once, which underlined how slight this part of the book is. Maybe if Larsen had concentrated on the world's fair, he would have done a better job of it, instead of stringing together ancedotes and never giving me a good sense of the overall effort or the effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but so BOOORING....","review":"At first I was very excited to read this book. The author did a book signing in the area, and everyone was mentioning how great the novel was. As a result, I bought the book and struggled through boring chapter after boring chapter.Larson tells the stories of Burnham and Holmes in a series of alternating chapters. These stories are totally unrelated except for the fact that they share the same time and place. All the chapters are full of pointless details and \\"fun facts\\" that drag on the already slow pace of the book.You will love this book if you are riveted by disagreements over using steamboats instead of electric vessels, or if you are mesmerized by how foundations are constructed in the soft ground in Chicago.If you are looking for historical minutia, this is the book for you; however, if you want a thriller, read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"sooo sloow, have no desire to finish this book","review":"I got half way through this book and am throwing in the towel.

The Devil part of it was very engrossing, and it was hard to realize where it was occurring; it was like reading about our own Jack The Reaper serial killer who committed his crimes in subtle, yet disgusting \\"under your nose\\" methods.

The cover and description make you think its this huge murder mystery but its really just a well written history book. I think it may just be my dislike for the author's style personally. I like easy to read fun and interesting material that you can finish quickly. This took forever with the too small font size and the dull slow moving story. Overall, glad I read it but it's hyped way too much.

Holmes, a serial killer in Chicago at the time. The details told of the World Fair alone are quite interesting but if that seems a bit boring to you, trust me - this book is not boring. The tale of the serial killer will keep you reading. His crimes are shocking and horrifying, and even more shocking and horrifying is how long he continued to get away with them before being caught!

And once I got into it, I found it fascinating. I like \\"true crime\\" genre anyway, and the idea that this sociopath/psychopath was able to get away with so many murders is stunning. The main story about the Columbian Exposition was amazing too--a whole chapter of American history that I had very little knowledge of.

Two stories that had a great premise never reach their potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"So interesting","review":"I couldn't put this book down, so interesting and informative. I think some might be annoyed with the constant change in the narrative about the fair vs. the murderer but I didn't mind it because the storytelling was so engaging. I definitely recommend it for someone looking to read an interesting account of a real life serial killer and how the first World Expo was built in America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and True","review":"I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy history, murder mystery, and criminal psychology.I am originally from the Chicago area and I learned more about Chicago in the early 1900's than I have from any other source. This is the first novel I have read by Erik Larson and I cannot wait to read more of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I found this book to be extremely entertaining. Despite the disclaimer at the beginning of the book that the story jumped around from person to person and place to place, I found it to flow wonderfully. The only problem I had with the book was that it sometimes went into too much detail about the buildings and landscape. I have absolutely no knowledge of architecture or landscape, so I often times became lost in these descriptions. Other than that, I couldn't put the book down due to the fact that I couldn't wait to find out what Holmes would do next. The last section of the book that deals with Detective Geyer's quest to find out the truth was the most entertaining part of the book in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Devile in The White City","review":"A good read. Historically very informative and entertaining. Made me want to find out more about the history of the Chicago fair and the protagonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"High School Students","review":"I was very happily surprised at intensity of Erik Larson's research. I enjoyed the book very much and learned a lot. I would suggest this book/author to High School students. They would benefit in many ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hit and a miss","review":"I thought this book was an act of vanity on behalf of the author. It's as if he couldn't decide whether to write a historical account or a novel. I love dry history books, and this was dry and repetitive. The details of the Chicago World' Fair were amazing and the history came together beautifully, if not somewhat with some presumption at times. I applaud the author's research and detail of historical accuracy brought to life, but there was something about this that was overdone and thereby lacking a grace or ease in how it was written. Though I enjoyed it because of the element of history, it was cliche at creating suspense with cliffhanger last lines here and there as if it was a soap opera. Worth the read if you love Chicago and American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"I rarely read nonfiction - okay, this is the only NF book I've read in years. But it reads like a novel; all the more terrifying because it is history. The style, the real people involved, the grandiose plans and murderous intentions ... it is intertwine with skill and talent. Much of what happened is fascinating, sort of like gawking at a car wreck. Yet it is also beautiful, especially the chapters of the world fair. Seems surreal at times, which makes the book that much more amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO STORIES FOR THE PRICE OF ONE..A GOOD DEAL","review":"This is a most interesting story of how the worlds fair of 1893 in Chicago came to be. As usual, there is one person that had to fight to see that it happened and it was not easy..for sure. It is a story that should hold your interest from beginning to end and you will learn snippets of information like: this was the first time for Juicy Fruit gum, Cracker Jack, Shredded Wheat; the first time where a zipper, the Ferris Wheel, the Kodak camera and the electric chair first appeared. At the same time you have a story of a serial killer that is stranger than fiction. This is a grand read well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable read with many interesting facts about the Chicago World's Fair. Adding the mystery of an actual serial killer really helped move the story along. I recommend this book even to those who are not history buffs. I breezed through it and wished for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected at all","review":"With all the great reviews for this book, what I expected was the \\"nail-biting storytelling\\" of the two intertwined characters, Burnham and Holmes. Instead, this is an overly detailed, slow, and rather mundane story of the Chicago World's Fair. Most of the book is extensive research that describes more of every minor complication to the fair, while only a small part describes the murders. While some may be interested in all the inner workings and architecture put into the fair, for me this read more like a history textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subscribers of Architectural Review will love this","review":"Anyone interested in holmes, his actions , his psychology not so much.This is in fact an incredibly wordy historical review of the chicago world fair at the time of holmes crimes and the architecture of the time. Reading the first few.. no.. most of the book feels similar to reading one of those college textbooks required by professors who happened to have written them.If you would like some actual concrete reading on Holmes you can order Depraved from amazon or other worthy books on this sociopath. This however seems simply to have been the tacking on of the name of a serial killer (and a horrific one) in order to sell a high school term paper on the chicago worlds fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Dull.","review":"Yes there are some fun facts that emerge from the book, mostly having to do with items that were invented for the fair, but it wasn't enough to make me find the book as compelling as many others have. Combining the story of how the fair was created, with that of a bloodthirsty serial killer, with nothing more than the city they both resided in being the common thread, is flimsy at best. The killer gets an occasional chapter here and there, with the final thirty pages devoted to him. The rest is the story of Daniel Burnham, the mastermind behind the entire fair, and his various subordinates. The book isn't bad. I just never felt the need to get back to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational AND fun","review":"As an urban planner, I found the history of the 1893 World's Fair fascinating, but what was great is that this book was a good beach read. So the other plot of a Jack-the-Ripper (true story) murderer spiced things up.It's amazing what a huge effect that World's Fair had on our lives even 110 years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Enjoyable book about a criminal who until this book has generally just merited a \\"mention\\" in books about serial killers.Very interesting back/side story about the men who planned, designed and built the Chicago's World's Fair.My only criticism of this book would be the development of the tie-in between the fair builders and the criminal. It wasn't wasn't well developed - it was difficult to discern what the author's point was using this style of writing and joining the two stories.Overall, however, I would highly recommend this book. Fortunately, both stories are interesting in and of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look into history","review":"I very much enjoyed the book. I love history and have read quite a bit about Hitler and Germany leading up to the war.

Wanted it to never end. As an enthusiest of non-fiction, I was pleased with all of the interesting tidbits of history as well as the main \\"plot\\". I never review anything but this is worth spreading the news about. Read it 1st, then get the audio CD for a trip. I could read it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tearing down and building up","review":"Creepy Holmes, the doctor and murderer, is busy destroying and his antics are juxtaposed with a fascinating exploration of the planning and building of the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893. Both storylines run the course of the book and occasionally they are intertwined. The detailed research on how the World's Fair came together was very interesting; I was enchanted with the description of all the electric lights and can imagine what a sensation that was at the time. If you enjoy explorations of the sociopathic/psychopathic mind you will surely find Holmes worthy of your disdain or admiration; he is a cunning, twisted character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and tedious","review":"I was excited to read this book after all the wonderful reviews and my book club selected it, so I dove right in and was almost immediately bored to tears. I kept waiting for the thrilling part to start but it never did. I was much more interested in the serial-killer side of the story but the author barely went into it and not really much at all until towards the end. If you want to know every freaking detail about the architecture of the Chicago's World Exposition, go right ahead and read it. I however, did not need THAT much information about it. There were interesting tidbits here and there, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 but it was overall tedious, needlessly intricate about the architecture and construction and disappointing on the \\"devil\\" part of the book. I can't believe I made it all the way through and am sorry I did, one of the least favorite things I've read and I read a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and slow moving","review":"I bought this book because of the great reviews and also because I liked the authors other book 'In the Garden of Beasts'. Reading this book was like pushing mud uphill because it was such slow going. In excrutiating detail it describes the evolution of the Chicago World Expo in the late 1900's. There are endless boring details that drag on for whole chapters about meetings and infighting with the fairs organizers. The subplot about a serial killer seems like an afterthought to sell the book.I would not recommend this book unless you are fascinated by fairs and what goes into building and organizing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely gripping!","review":"I loved how the book toggled between hope and despair, good and evil.

The author seems to have had some level of success with some ASD children by using potential special interests to modify behaviour, by telling that \\"a Spice Girl\\" would never do that..The idea is good and might help sometime, but I found th book extremely narcicistic and belitteling.It should have been a 3 page note instead of a book, and it would have been better for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read ALL the 1 stars before you buy!","review":"We LOVE Franklin, but this is NOT a typical Franklin story. If you love sweet Franklin stories don't buy this one! My son gets very absorbed into any video he watches and I regretted letting him watch this one.

I totally agree with the other reviewers who commented on the mature story lines: granny reliving the story of her parents dying in a fire upset my son so much that he did not want to watch the rest of it. I convinced him to keep watching, saying that when movies have a sad part, a happy part is to come, but then there were some sad/scary sub plots as the gang went on the hunt for the time capsule -- Snail gets carried away by a bird and almost eaten! I guess it has a happy ending, but at this point, my son did not want to finish it! The animation is definately different, as well as some of the voices, but this doesn't really make a difference for those who are used to the tv show. Might be ok for kids a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turtle Lake Treasure: Paganism for Beginners","review":"I generally like the Franklin videos because they usually communicate good values in the context of situations that kids run into in real life, only Franklin's a turtle and not a person. While there are rarely ever any themes of spiritualism in Franklin, with such themes this movie is fraught. The Turtle Lake Treasure turns out to be a talisman in which resides the life force of all turtles that Franklin must use to heal his sick grandmother. And, in finding the talisman, he must receive guidance from a witch, who, upon hearing she's a witch, Franklin is reassured by his mother that \\"she's really just a healer\\". So, unless you are raising your kids to be little pagans, this video is not for you, and definitely not for your kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franklin turtle lake","review":"This is a favorite with wonderful lessons.

It has a grandmother who is dying. And she also tells the story of her parents burning to death in a fire when she was a child and they went camping... why on earth they would make a movie for young children with that in it is beyond me... now any kid who watches this will never want to go on a camping trip with their parents for fear they will die!!!

So there's been no serious update of the text since 1986, when the high-Tc superconductors started being discovered.2) The illustrations and captions are often mismatched. For example the illustration for problem 1.35 is not related to it, and the captions for illustrations 2.20 and 2.20' are switched.If a casual reader can quickly find errors like these, there must not have been a very thorough editing job.On the plus side, the writing style is clear and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful introduction to Electricity and Magnetism.","review":"The units used in this book are completely outdated and not standard at all.

Well - I can say with absolute certainty and first hand experience that this movie is 99% Hollywood and 1% Truth.If you really want to know about what happened aboard the USS Iowa and why it may have happened you are much better off reading the book, \\"A Glimpse of Hell\\" (which still has its faults and problems, of course) and forgetting about this farce of a movie.Who am I?

This is an arbitrary list, of course, and some of your favorite classics may not be included. Out of curiosity, I compared these titles to those on the Random House list of the 100 best novels. 20% of the Random House titles were included here.This volume is a sort of abridged Cliff's Notes in that it covers the historical background, summary, major characters and themes, symbolism, style, and a critical overview of each title. Reading this book is no substitute for reading the great classics themselves.

Throughout the entire CD it maintains a high bpm energy that will keep you listening even if the actual melody in the backround gets bland.

Martinez is sympathetic to them (as I am) and seeks to bring out their plight.But Martinez's good intentions are let down by his prose. The narrative skips from one person to another, one theme to another. There is no thread, nothing to draw the reader on, just a confusing and ultimately uninteresting assortment of encounters, impressions and comments. I found the book almost unreadable.I would recommend instead Ted Conover's Coyotes, an older book, published in 1987, but still revealing--and a far better piece of writing. Conover joins some illegal immigrants crossing into the States and shares their experiences. His account is gripping, sometimes amusing, and humane.

However, portrays the issue from only one side. Doesn't explore the causes of the poverty or the complete and utter failure of Mexico to address the issue. Doesn't explore the impacts on American society or economy. Rather, this is a 330 pages of why Mexican's should be allowed to violate US law and why the US is wrong to exercise its right to defend its border.Having lived in CA my entire life, I was aware of the poverty that drove such proud people to such deperation.

But, the way it was written failed to grasp me and pull me in, in fact, it had me nearly strangling myself as I struggled through pages upon pages per chapter.My advice for reading this is the same they gave me at orientation: If you want the big picture of the book, read a few chapters from the first half (when the author is in Mexico) and a few chapters from the second half (when he's in the U.S.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a Bad Book.","review":"I decided to quit by page 100.

It was so amazing what people went through to have a better life for themselves as well as for there families. Many cross the border risking everything that they have for a CHANCE of a better life. After they pass the border, it doesn't get any better because they have to deal with lots of racism and bad treatment here. IT's hard getting a job in america without speaking english.Comming from immigrant parents i got a deeper repect for them as well as many other immigrants. A lot of times we all take for granted what is available to us being american citizens, not realizing many die to get what we have, our citizenship!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent read for adults, especially with the historical backdrop the author provides","review":"Ruben Martinez's engaging and authoritative account of the Chavez family's struggle to live in Cheran, Mexico and work in the U.S. illustrates how the long-time U.S. message \\"We have jobs for you\\" has changed to \\"We have jobs for you, but you'll have more trouble getting across the line.\\" Three Chavez brothers were killed as victims in a high-speed chase crossing the border. Martinez followed migrant workers to California, Arkansas and even Norwalk, Wisconsin where he found the Enriquez family working the night shift in a meatpacking plant. Martinez, whose grandfather came to the U.S. as a field hand, brings the readers right into small village life in Southern Mexico--through the treacherous border crossings and into the toxic fields where migrants toil. This is an excellent read for adults, especially with the historical backdrop the author provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keenly Observed, Passionately Written, Highly Important","review":"Crossing Over is perhaps the most beautifully written and moving testaments to migrant experience i've ever read, and it fills a critical void in contemporary discourse on (Mexican) immigration.

As a college professor of Latino Studies, I have taught this book in several courses. I will continue to share this book with readers in the years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eloquent and accessible","review":"Crossing Over teaches us about the migrant trail by sharing -- with great sensitivity -- how the participants themselves experience its tragedies while searching for hope and better lives for their children.

A lot of the diets are lower refined carb, this is good, BUT then he allows free foods such as artificially sweetened foods and drinks and BBQ sauce, ketchup, etc. that are FILLED with sugar or raise insulin although there is no sugar content. I don't think this author did much research, except for copying ideas from several different diet books that were also not well researched.

I don't go by the awards people win because in the Downbeat Poll years ago a bass player named Stubby Jackson kept winning for best bass player year after year mainly because nobody seemed to know anyone else to vote for.

Auster's hand is sometimes perceptible, smoothing and refining these tales, but his presence is even more evident in the similar feel of the stories chosen. For instance, many blend irony and chance; a number emphasize shame for youthful prejudice; and over almost all hangs an indefinite non-theistic spirituality intended to strike a cord with the post-modern reader.

Perhaps we needed to wait to face the terrible mistakes made at many levels before, during and after the sinking of the Indianapolis.

He tries to give it historical weight with some footnotes and light discussion of the sources, but the book is almost pure narrative, which Stanton pens excitingly with a clear eye to the individuals who endured the ordeal of their ship going down and spent days afloat. It was harrowing: sharks, no food, no water, few lifeboats, dehydration-induced hallucinations. And Stanton captures the drama, the fear, the horror--and the joy of being rescued.

I had it tested locally and they said the Voltage Regulator is bad on it. Also realized that there is NO WARRANTY on this part, they use that two year roadside assistance warranty as a distraction, which is deceptive IMO. Called the 800 number for tech support and they went to voicemail and called back an hour later, but were useless.First, Amazon has very fast fulfillment so I received the alternator very quickly! I have Amazon Prime so I paid 3.99 and got it overnighted and had it the next day! It has a great warranty, including roadside assistance reimbursement if the product fails, so they must be confident in the quality. I will follow up on the review in a few months since the Alternator has only been on the car for one day.

I've been a fan of the various versions of WordPerfect for more than a decade and it's still my word processor of choice -- and would be even if I weren't rebelling against the dominance of Microsoft.

There is seemingly endless repetition of unstimulating sequences of foliage being attached to a pumpkin in vain attempts to decorate it. In addition to producing some very unattractive results it is repeated past the point tolerable even by a 2-year old. Worse still, when the pumpkin is delivered to Teletubby Land, the Tubbies never actually have contact with it. This is frustrating to the children who identify themselves with the Tubbies because they, the kids, are deprived of the vicarious experience of interacting the the pumpkin.

This was a total waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"17 minutes of 1970's technology--find an alternative","review":"My biggest problem with this DVD is that it is so incredibly short. They claim 32 minutes play time, which is a complete lie. A good part of that is commercials and credits. We clocked just under 17 minutes of actual entertainment. The commercials weren't even good ones that entertain. Credits can also be fun, but not in this movie. The kid is not interested.My next problem is that the DVD is very old. The audio is chalky. The audio quality sounds as if they took an old video tape and digitally recorded it (as opposed to 'digitally remastered').There is no menu and no chapters. You can't fast forward to the actual movie, you have to manually forward the movie. It's as if they took an old VHS tape and put in your DVD player. One would think that Sony could invest $20 in software to make the few adjustments necessary.I think that this DVD is worthless. Do not be taken in by its low price. $1 is too much to pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible Audio Quality","review":"This DVD has the same audio problem as \\"The Best of Elmo\\". I am very disappointed about the audio transfer. It's completely distorted and way too loud. The sound of Elmo actually scares my 1.5-year-old son. Try it from a video store first. Don't waste money on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!","review":"I don't let my 17-month-old son watch much TV but he clamors for this DVD and the \\"sequel\\" (plus Best of Elmo). He actually goes to the cabinet with the DVD player and tries to turn it on while reaching for his DVDs. He then sits mesmerized in front of the TV for the duration. What I like about this particular DVD is the combination of songs and dialogue...he got easily bored with some other SS productions because there was too much talk. This one keeps moving, and I haven't gotten tired of it yet (well, OK, maybe a little). He's had it for at least two months and still loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I was amazed at the response my 11 month old daughter gave me the first time I showed her this video. She loved it! The songs are the traditional kid songs we all love.

Secondly, there are no Sesame Street songs on the tape, and only one sketch from the show - which is the \\"Oinker Sisters\\" singing \\"This little Piggy.\\"These songs are better learned from you directly or in preschool. My toddler isn't very fond of this video, either - he knows what real Sesame Street is! If you're looking for preschool standards, I'd recommend \\"Sesame Street Sing Along\\" which has both standards and Sesame favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as...","review":"This version is not nearly as good as the Kids Favorite Songs 2.

In the end, this just fell short. Way, way short! The movie is way way too short, for starters.

Educational and entertaining AND 30 full minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content, bad quality","review":"The DVD is entertaining to my toddler, but I can't stand to listen to the extremely poor quality audio track.

Our daughter is 2 and really loves sesame street."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Spanish on this DVD","review":"The DVD is just fine. However, I gave this product 2 stars because I bought it specifically because it lists Spanish under the language, as well as English. I am trying to teach my daughter Spanish, and I chose this DVD specifically for that reason. There is no Spanish language version on this DVD. So, if you are considering it for that reason, then do not buy it. Otherwise, it is a fine Sesame Street video."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your kids love to sing....","review":"they will love this DVD. My 3 yr. old loves Sesame St. and loves to sing. This was a birthday present received the end of July. He (and his older sister) liked to watch it almost daily. Unfortunately, this past Sat. we left it at a beach house. So....I'm ordering another one! The kids are still singing the songs, but they miss the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 17 month old's favorite","review":"This is another Sesame Street favorite (the other one is \\"1 2 3 Count with Me\\"). He likes the songs and often dances during the songs. I love it when he turns to me with a grin, almost saying \\"isn't this neat\\".It's simple graphics and a nice mix of muppets, people and graphics. And it's short -- about 30 minutes. But perfect for a little one's attention span...for a while he would watch only 15 minutes at a time.From my perspective, I don't find the songs grating (nor do I sing them in the middle of the night when I can't sleep). I highly recommend this video for your starter library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good...","review":"My daughter did not take to this DVD as well as usual. She is an avid Sesame Street fan. However, there is a bit more talking in this one. The singing and characters keep her attention and there is less of that in this one than her others. We barely ever play this one. I would recommend the 25th Anniversary and What's the Name of that Song. They have nonstop singing and characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor audio quality","review":"The audio on this DVD is completely unacceptable. The VHS version might be ok, but the DVD is very hard to listen to. It's loud, distorted, and easily the worst sounding DVD I've ever heard. It's worse than AM radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD for toddlers","review":"I got this DVD for when my 2 year old cousin comes over to visit. I just pop this in and she is captivated by Elmo. She loves to watch it and everytime she comes over to visit, its the first thing she requests.I must say that I enjoy watching it also because there are classic songs that everyone loves, like Row Row Row the Boat, and ABC's, and Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. It also repeats the numbers 1 through 10 all the time so that she can actually follow along and say one through ten now, and she only just starting speaking! My little cousin loves to dance to all the songs on this DVD. She watches it at least three times every time she comes over.This DVD is a GREAT gift for those with a little one in the family."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"I bought this for me sister's child and then bought one for mine. It is great fun and the kids love it. The fun songs and wonderful colors are great learning fun for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"My niece absolutely adores this DVD. She's transfixed by Elmo.

He relies much too heavily on disreputable, gossipy accounts, like the \\"unofficial\\" fantasy book by Dr Li. There is nothing but personality analysis here, and no account of Chinese society at large, what the masses of people were doing, what Mao's deeper, social and ethical motivations were, etc.Overall, too much money and too many useless pages for such a breezy, crappy book.there simply no good bios of Mao, at least in English"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler, Stalin, ...

Human life falls under a boot heel like rice."},{"rating":"2","title":"In depth, but not too in depth, basic, but not too basic","review":"This extremely researched chronicle teaches you everything you would want to know about Mao. But theres more to it than that. What this book tells you from the very beginning on the inside flaps of the hardcover addition, is that Mao is the father of modern China. Many Chinese in America act as though Sun Yatsen or Chiang Kaishek of the Guomindang was the father of modern China but are lying to prevent hostility. What this book also mentions is that Mao was responsible for cultural change for the better: women were out of the homes and into public life such as in medicine, politics, and society. But this is not a pro-Mao book. I wouldn't speak highly of it if it was. Mao was responsible - as this book mentions - for the deaths of millions more people than any other person in human history.My favorite part of the book is the conclusion. It explains how Mao is viewed in china today.Read this book if you like history."},{"rating":"1","title":"He has done much better","review":"There's not much to say about this recording, because there's not much happening. The majority of the tunes are based on one chord. The melodies are non-existent. It's more of a soul/funk cd. The grooves are played well, but they don't swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven On Earth","review":"I was in my car, driving along the frozen lake, when Soul Makossa came on the radio. It instantly brought me back to the time when soul meant alot more than just something you take to church...then came Maceo & I was so totally funkafied that I started to cry from the sheer beauty of it all. These cats can blow, man, even on a supposedly 'commercial gig' like this.Got home, went to the radio station website, then quickly to Amazon & the rest is history. Now, I'm putting the old band back together because my inner funk has been brought back to life and needs to cut loose. If this cd was an LP, I'd have worn the damn grooves right off it already. Thank you Rodney & Maceo, just for being who you were meant to be. Feel the power of the Funk & go with it, baby...I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"direction-less","review":"There was a lot of buzz on this CD in the internet. It seems that guitarist Rodney Jones has produced a CD that is groovingly soulful and fill it with enough improvisation to make the CD worth my hard earned cash. Unfortunately it's not what happen. Despite the musicians he hired for the CD, the groove sounds monotonous. The first track fades out in the middle of his guitar solo. The other tracks sound like they were in autopilot mode, running their licks here and there. Not groovy enough for a soul music, not jazzy enough for a jazz CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read before you buy a car","review":"This practical guide to buying, financing and insuring a car (new or used) comes in compact format, so you can bring it along as you go car-shopping. It gives comprehensive coverage on negotiating on a deal, choosing the right financing alternatives, shopping for insurance, and even has a chapter on selling your car. While price negotiation coverage is not as deep as that in the excellent \\"What Car Dealers Don't Want You to Know,\\" this book explains clearly the myriad terms used by the car industry, terms that are designed to confuse you into paying more than necessary.Armed with this book, you'll be able to better understand how to get the best deal for the car you want as well as gain the confidence to do it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need a power cord for this camera","review":"This is a fine camera if it were not for its hunger for batteries.

However, after a while, I have noticed the sound isn't as rich as I would like at the mid and high end, at high volume. It's become a compromise between hearing more subtleties in my music and hearing the mids without that hollow sound, when the mid range is turned up. The highs can screech, as well, but only at the loudest volume. If you're using a stock head unit or under 200w unit, these speakers are also excellent because the volume doesn't have to be turned up any more than with the stock unit.Overall I don't think I could have gotten a better speaker for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"ussr police report","review":"this is the most boring book, poorly written, no style, just a standard police report! and that on one of the most fascinating decennia of twentieth century history. this book is so dry that it burns your cornea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure propaganda","review":"This book is a attempt to make people believe the \\"red menace\\" line of thinking, it never says that the soviet union was a defensive nation, it's nuclear and conventional forces were all defensive, while nato and the US forces were always offensive one may look no futher then the american and soviet navy, the soviet navy was built as a defensive force using cruisers as the back bone of their navy with defensive missles, while our navy used aircraft carriers which we see today in the illegal invasion of iraq as tools to launch invasion from, Turkey 1961 anyone? yet another location was armed and placed within firing range of the soviet union, what was the soviet unions response to that threat? defensive missles placed in cuba to counter the aggressive american(and nato) approach"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange, disorderly writing","review":"Before writing anything, it is probably useful to say that I have very little knowledge of the USSR in the years of its demise -- the very subject of this book. For me, Stephen Kotkin seemed to constantly lurch from point to point, only rarely making the connections between events explicit enough to form a cohesive narrative. Of course this was a tumultuous period in history, but I could not help but have the feeling that I was being presented with a series of jumbled facts only half-related to one another. The section on the attempted 1991 coup, for instance, was particularly intolerably obscure and uninformative, and I had to resort to other, more readily available texts to have an understanding of its events."},{"rating":"2","title":"History's Truths Revealed","review":"Kotkin is a first rate historian who dispenses with the slogans, cliches, and jingoism that often cloud Soviet studies. Armageddon Averted is superbly titled and succinctly written. The author takes less than 200 pages of text to explain the ending collapse of the U.S.S.R. - the \\"death agony of an entire world comprising non-market economies and anti-liberal institutions.\\" It's a pleasure to read history that so elegantly summarizes complex and world changing events without mischaracterizing them. Many \\"experts\\" not only failed to anticipate the changes that occurred, but subsequently gave the wrong reasons for them. Kotkin's breadth and depth of knowledge allow him to avoid such blunders. Most highly recommended. Additional plusses are the Notes and Further Reading sections.

I especially liked the fangs and the spider. I think the Biddles have come up with some creative origami designs that I have never seen elsewhere.

Having read a number of positive online reviews (a suspiciously high number, now that I think about it), I really tried to find something to like about this book, but I found it a chore to read.

I had noticed Might Leaf teas for a long time but mainly because of their name. I thought that it is a clever name. Typically we don't think of leaves as mighty (maybe the trunk of a plant but not the leaf).Then one day I found myself with an upset stomach in a coffee shop. Coffee was not an option so I was asking for Chamomile Tea. Indeed I was offered Chamomile Citrus from Mighty Leaf and fell in love with it right away, never mind my upset stomach. Since typically chamomile is my least favorite tea I tried the other flavors too. My absolute favorite is Green Tea Tropical. Summing it up: Mighty Leaf delivers tea the way it ought to taste. Once I drank it I understood why people have been drinking tea for thousand of years.

However, for those who have seen it, they may tell you just how deserving of acclaim this gem of a film is. The best part about the film is how it tells an unusual story in such a simple and straightforward way, leaving its many interpretations up to the viewer. Besides its terrific acting/directing, the script quenches the minds of the moviegoer and presents them with a totally new and fresh idea. For those of you who are willing to ride, LAWN DOGS will not be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Simplistic","review":"From the glowing reviews I was expecting a thoughtful and interesting movie. Lawn Dogs is quite disappointing as the characters are so unbelievable (except for Rockwell's) as to render the film preposterous. The anti-yuppie bias would have been tolerable if it wasn't so asinine. You think even a craven father wanting to be on five boards would overlook someone hurting his daughter because his dad \\"might\\" send him some business? Or Mom's scenes where the 11 year old fully understands (and accepts) what is happening, and yet she carries on with an entire party possibly walking in a door. We get it--all the poor people are good and the rich (or wanna be rich, especially) are bad. Very believable.The only reason I don't give it one star is the acting of Rockwell and to some extent Mischa Barton (although the dialogue and character is way too old for her age)."},{"rating":"1","title":"snooze","review":"This movie was recommended to me by a friend who said it was \\"better than American Beauty\\" but I completely disagree.

And the girl herself was a real sweetie, and a good actress - perfect for the part. In fact, the acting all around was admirable.But the script! Yikes! Not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did. People acting awkward or mean (in fact, just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean), or spiteful, or stupid, for no reason at all!It seems as though somehow, the movie could have been good, but didn't make it.

I cannot create new directories or write any files to the drive...at least I can read my files. This is the exact same failure I had the first time. Be careful, these drives only have a one year warranty, after that, you're in big trouble if they fail yet again.A co-worker of mine had two Maxtor One Touch drives sitting under his desk.

Her analysis of race, class, gender and neighborhood politics is excellent. We learn that neighorhood context has important ramifications for how local politics are expressed, but still, grassroots activism emerges where inequality is found. The only weakness in this book is the occasional redundancies in the discussion, particularly where latter chapters seem to repeat earlier ones. But, as a book that expands the discussion of both gender and race in the context of urban social movements, this is one of the best. It balances case studies and well developed grounded theory well. Moreover, the book appeals to a broad audience in academic settings and the broader public."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 OUT 10 REACHED 2500 mAH","review":"These batteries were good a few years ago (the blue batteries).

I stumbled onto Still Life With Crows by accident one day and have read everything they've written since. I'm a big fan of Agent Pendergast and will probably continue reading whatever they crank out, although in my mind I have not read anything that tops Still Life. Perhaps it has to do with the fact that that was my first meeting with Pendergast and he is indeed a very rich character. Dance of Death pits the able agent against his sinister brother, Diogenes. There are some nice twists, and I liked that instead of a classic denouement, the authors opt for a continuation. Stay tuned because the brothers Pendergast will, most assuredly, be back"},{"rating":"1","title":"These boys have some 'splaining to do...","review":"I have enjoyed Preston-Child books ever since I read Relic. Full of action and adventure and even some gratuitous violence and blood thrown in for fun. I had always thought some of the peripheral characters would be explained at some point in time. Unless I've missed something, the history of Constance and Wren have still not been explained. It's starting to get a little annoying.I feel that there were also alot of other loose ends just in this story alone, including the psychological profiler....why even include it? And the Margo Green issue was just a cheap shot that wasn't even explained very well.Furthermore, the latest books by this team are lacking the intense scare factor of earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"I put back food to buy this","review":"I saw this book at Costco and put back food from my basket so I could buy it - after the last installment, I was on pins and needles to see what happened to Agent Pendergast. And it was worth it! This story deepens the character of Pendergast, giving him a more vulnerable dimension, while introducing the nasty Diogenes, and bringing in the courageous Viola. I look forward to seeing more of her in future books. My one nit was the Kiva mask subplot, which went on and on, and the twist with a particular female character involved in that subplot. Sometimes authors need to brave enough to really knock off one of their favorite characters to gain a level of legitimacy. I felt a little cheated, but who cares, I'll be first in line (or close!) to buy the next book!

I can't take that away from them. And they've managed to take many of the characters from the other novels they've written and spun them together into this one. So had you not read from Relic to now, you might miss out on some of the character interaction. They try to keep you up to date but it just doesn't quite work without remembering how character X was in Y novel and have Z adventure.That being said, this is a fun book.

Very nicely done, good ending, satisfying characters, and plenty of mystery left for lots more sequels. Not sure about D'Agosta & Captain Hayward's weird relationship.But the title was so un-Preston/Child. Yuck. I loved their other titles, so unique and catchy. This title is a dud.

These guys had to work with an excellent character (refined, rich, supersmart special agent Pendergast), his mirror-image villain (true, a little too mirror image for my taste...) and a decent story - and, yet, managed to ruin the whole thing by turning a one-book-story into a trilogy!There are chapters and whole subplots with only marginal impact on the storytelling - chapters that could had been easily ommitted.For example (no spoiler, not to worry): Smithback gets committed to an insane asylum, attempts to escape, manages to do so so easily he could be simply exiting a ...hotel! Value added to the story: zero.They most probably did not telephone this one in, yet there are plot corners left unfinished. Diogene's motive is at best shallow and unworthy of his intellect for example...OK for a gloomy weekend, but definitely NOT ONE OF THEIR GOOD ONES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Pendergast fans","review":"Once again Preston and Childs and their protagonist, Pendergast, have kept me up at night. The tension builds until you have to put the book down for a few minutes. Pendergast is almost a Houdini in his escapes from danger. All of our old buddies are once again in this book and I won't tell you the ending, but I smell a sequel (or is it triquel) coming up. Can't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancing in the Dark","review":"The Pendergast series has always been a little far fetched, but this one goes beyond the beyond. The superhuman villian with malevolence in abundance gives this book a dark cast that makes it less than enjoyable.

I did not finish the book simply because I didn't need the negative feeling it engendered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwarts without the charm","review":"Dance of Death is a windy comic book founded on silly characters, an implausible plot, and banal dialogue. The hero is a take off from Batman, the villain a less believable Voldemort. Both hero and villian rely on preternatural abilities and unbounded wealth to achieve thoroughly implausible feats of mind and matter. The supporting cast is no more plausible or engaging.This material would be low quality adolescent fiction.Adult readers beware. The cover is intriguing, the novel is not. There is one minor saving grace. Nested in the book, with little connection to the basic plot, is a thought-provoking discussion of the ethics of collection and display of indigenous artifacts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn....","review":"By about chapter thirty I was so annoyed with suposedly genius characters pulling stupid and pointless tricks that I gave up and skipped to the end to see how it all turned out.

I won't be following their works unless they can regain their skill and creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I Read the Same Book?","review":"These guys have obviously run out of inspiration for this storyline. It seemed almost as if someone else was trying to emulate their writing style and failed miserably. I can't explain why there are so many positive reviews for this book. It lacked the mystery, surprises, historical information, and scientific backbone of the others. Brimstone was a stumble; this was a flat out disaster. The book had a few interesting moments, but as a whole, it was far subordinate to their prior efforts. It felt more like they were just trying to pay the rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be Bored To Death","review":"A cousin introduced me to this writing team with their first book, Relic, and I was hooked. However, all through this series, I have watched with growing dismay as our hero, Special Agent Pendergast becomes a more and more improbable character. The man is brilliant, charming, debonair, rich, sensitive, deadly and in this book, verging on the edge of becoming a cartoon.Please, someone give Preston and Child a copy of their first book and tell them firmly, this is how it's done! Unless you are a rabid Pendergast fan, pass on this one and try a James Rollins book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this was Preston and Child","review":"I had to give this 1 star because I didn't read past page 100. How boring and predictable! I couldn't believe it was from the same authors that were among my favorites. I loved \\"Brimstone\\" and most of their earlier stuff. Actually, I wouldn't give any of their previous works less than 3 stars, but this book, I couldn't get into at all. And after waiting 2 months on the \\"Reserved\\" list to get it from my library! Definitely not worth the wait, and with other reading material awaiting me, reading to page 100 was enough time to give this. Just nothing interesting or compelling or new about it. You knew the plot was just going to be those close to Pendergast dying in succession, with him chasing his brother. Pendergast seemed like a caricature of himself, and the other characters had nothing to commend them; there was no reason to take an interest in them.

Something even more evil I'm sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"I have been a tremedous fan of the series, but this one is a true disappointment. Dumbing down your characters, killing off the good character I was so thrilled to bring back into the fold, and giving so much attention to Smithback, who is nothing but an idiot and irritation. Nora Kelley as a sanctamonious scientific prig, Pendergast as a bumbler....I am very sad that Preston and Child have developed such a condesending attitude towards their character(s). I will miss Pendergast, but I don't see myself picking up a Pendergast novel again, unless it is a copy from the library to see if the authors ever raise the intellectual level back to one that I am more comfortable with. There are an incredible number of dumbed down novels on the market, that I have neither the time nor interest to waste upon.

This one gets a serious downgrade because of major logical flaws. So much of the risk and suspense is generated by characters' confusion when they are told by Pendergrast, \\"I can't tell you more [about the super secret plot of my evil brother] or it would endanger you.\\" That makes no logical sense in the context of this book, as the \\"evil\\" had nothing to do with knowledge of the situation.

Its predecessors were very entertaining and provided a great setup for a knockout finale. However, the payoffs seem overly contrived and the writing here seemed a bit self-indulgent as the ending to this book should have come about 30-35 pages earlier. I have read nearly all of the Preston-Child books and would recommend most of them. However, this was one of my least favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as some of his other books","review":"I read all the books featuring agent Pendergast and liked most of them. Usually there is just a hint of supernatural and that's what's makes it interesting and exciting. This particular story, however, is too far fetched for my taste. Pendergast's brother is the Devil himself and has the same ability to vanish at will. That just doesn't quite cut it for me. I mean, I can understand that he could be a brilliant criminal but his escapedes go way beyond that. All in all, this is still an interesting book but I think that authors have crossed the line here-its just too unbelivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad acting","review":"It was definitely not worth the rental price of 3.99.

It pulls at the heart. It was a little too close for comfort to me yet it helped me somehow make peace with an area in my heart still wounded. The reason I gave it 4 starts was because it just makes me sick that they have to put rated R scenes into a movie for no reason at all. It did not enhance my viewing pleasure or the story- only turned my stomach. Some ideas can be inferred; they do not have to be in your face. Overall, I liked the movie. I wouldn't probably watch it again because it hurt too much and why would I want to do that to myself? I got the point. The acting was great. The story was complete and the ending unexpected.

The story isn't very believable and has so many plot holes you'll find yourself screaming \\"that could never happen\\". Schmaltzy, Overly-sentimental and at times lacking a clear narrative.

I happen to love flawed, funny characters, and \\"People Like Us\\" revolves around flawed and funny folks. The viewer cares about each of the people in the film, and this makes it absorbing and enjoyable. The plot is informed by a compassionate view of the craziness of human beings and their families, and the actors skillfully bring it to life.

It's a genius idea, and when it is fully inflated, it is fabulously comfortable for me, a pregnant belly sleeper. What is most unfortunate is that it does not stay fully inflated for long. In fact, I have had to re-inflate it once or twice PER NIGHT as it loses air so quickly. I have continued to use it, despite this absolute nuisance, because I can't get to sleep any other way. Having to spend a minute or two re-inflating, a couple of times per night, is still better than not sleeping. But, that said, it seems quite ridiculous that an air mattress should go flat that quickly. They should have created a better-quality product, especially for the price. I definitely have a love-hate relationship with this mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must purchase for soon to be mums that are back and tummy sleepers","review":"Purchased the Gentle Air matress about 5 months into the pregnancy and wished I had purchased at month 3.Pros:Airmatress was high enough that you did not feel like you were sleeping on the floor.

The \\"One Touch\\" backup app., a customized version of Dantz Retrospect, is much improved, ie easier to use. Even though the unit still runs a little hot, the new aluminum case is an improved heat sink and it is quiet, quiet, quiet.The problem, however, is that with, at least, Windows 98SE it does not reliably load at startup. At first I thought the problem was related to the timed spin down which can be set through a desktop utility, but proved erratic in operation. After exhaustive troubleshooting, however, the issues proved to be independent. The only substantive fix that Maxtor can recommend appears to be a Microsoft Supplement for Win 98 which did notwork.The \\"One Touch\\" has the potential to be a great product once they shake out the bugs. My advice, wait until later in the product cycle to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low noise & High performance External Drive","review":"When I bought this drive, I was a bit skeptical after I read the reviews on this page.

I just wanted to grab him by the shoulders and yell, \\"GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER ALREADY!\\" but at the same time, he's kind of likable. He's funny, honest, he sticks up for his own principles and never feels particularly sorry for himself.

Also, the fables seem to have been modernized; for example, the \\"Boy who cried wolf\\" is said to have had \\"too little drama in his life\\" which caused him to play tricks on others by falsley calling for help.

I Love It."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was pleasantly surprised","review":"I purchased the i560 under protest, my BJC-2000 finally died and I needed a new printer NOW! I first checked my ink supplier to see which inks were the least expensive, Bingo, 1.09 each for the i560. I read the reviews and was concerned about the noise level. Not to worry! It is not that noisy at all! And the print quality! I am so impressed with the quality and the speed of printing. Documents came out crisp and sharp, it came with sample picture paper and on a whim I printed out a copy of a 40 year old black and white picture. WOW the quality was superb! I would have given it 5 stars but it did not come with the printer cable and so I had to use my old parallel to hook it up. Shame on Canon. My Canon scanner came with the cable and the printer should have too! But all in all, a great purchase at a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for home printing !!","review":"Awesome ! Just bought this and printed a few 4x6 borderless pics on Canon PhotoPlus glossy papers that came with it as samples and the result is unbelievable for a $85 printer !! It's fast.

Very happy with it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Printer - Great Value!","review":"Really needed a new printer since our old NEC laser would not work with our newer PC and XP. I did some research and narrowed it down to two printers: the Canon i560 and the Epson C-84. We don't need anything fancy, just a good solid printer to do quality text and prints. After a couple of months of reading the Amazon reviews on both printers, we decided to go for the Canon and ordered it here. Received it two weeks ago and am extremely pleased. The setup was so simple it was up and running in about 5 minutes. While I think that Canon should include the USB cable, the cost was minimal so can't complain. So far everything we have printed has come out perfect - from text to photos. Very pleased with the speed too! I highly recommend the Canon i560 to anyone looking for a great printer that is a GREAT value for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Printer I've Ever Owned","review":"Just bought this printer (...)(.

I finally decided to upgrade to the i560 in order to do better photo printing. Wow, I realized that this was an upgrade but the printer itself is in a class that is not just 2 levels up but in an exclusive club. The photo printer is as reported below - just awesome - and the printing itself is very quiet in comparison to the i320 I had. The shelf space is about the same as the i320 which in itself is an achievement for such a higher quality printer. I love how the design of the outfeed allows the door to be completely closed and leaves the printer looking very tight and clean. Great execution Canon on a great design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down!","review":"I've read many thriller/mystery books, and this was not one of my favorite.

Favorite and familiar songs performed in a unique way with some of the most amazing jazz guitar work you will get anywhere. You do not have to be a guitar player to appreciate the great tunes and musical genius captured in this collection. You don't have to even recognize these songs to love this music, but chances are you will do both again and again! This is the Really Good Stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles don't work...","review":"The cinematography is top notch. I could taste the dust and sand by watching the movie.The problem with the DVD is no working english subtitles in the movie (spoken in French, I believe) using the WINDVD program in Windows XP. The movie is dialogue-driven, so watching the movie takes a lot of guess work to understand what's going on. I stopped watching the movie as I burned out in guessing the storyline in the movie. If someone has a better DVD player program to properly access the subtitles menu, go for it. I recommend finding another foreign title to purchase other than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact or Fiction?","review":"I'm in this book and know many of the pro-life activists described. If the accuracy of the episode involving me is any judge, the book is more fiction than fact.Painting this episode as a cloak and dagger conspiracy illustrates the bias of these authors, which is amply demonstrated throughout the book, as well as in the title itself.My advice to potential buyers?

Joy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Tim Powers have an editor?","review":"Earthquake weather can best be described as a \\"sequel\\" to the author's previous Last Call and Expiration Date; particularly in the sense that one should not even bother to try and read it without having finished the other two. Unfortunately, rather than returning to the rich vein of modern mysticism that worked so well in Last Call, Powers buries an interesting premise under page after page of mind-bending self-reference. (Witness the \\"houdini-hands\\" phenomenon, a barely explained plot point from Expiration Date that repeatedly inserts itself into the story.) I began the trilogy with no expectation or preconception, was fascinated by the first volume, confused by the second, and frankly annoyed by this final installment. To those readers new to Powers - finish Last Call and walk away. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"Earthquake Weather is the final book in Powers Fisher King trilogy, which begins with Last Call and continues in Expiration Date. Earthquake Weather is a very satisfying and totally gripping conclusion to the story, with a wide scope, ranging with Powers' usual eclecticism, from ghosts to winemaking to electroshock therapy. His fully believable characters include a 14-year old boy destined to be the next Fisher King and a woman with multiple personalities. He intertwines a complex plot, supernatural events, and historical background in a thoroughly satisfying structure, keeping the reader in suspense and caring about the characters throughout the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A typically great Tim Powers novel","review":"This book requires that one's read Powers previous two (Last Call and Expiration Date). A lot of it makes very little sense without that. So I would not recommend this novel to new Powers readers. This book isn't quite up to the hight standard set buy 'Last Call'. It's a terrific novel if you view it on it's own merit, but measured against Last Call, it's a bit weaker. The beginning is slow and seems a bit unfocussed, but about halfway through, all of the seemingly irrelevant characters and sub plots come together. The ending a terrific - much better than that of Expiration Date. Overall, a terrific read and one that won't be overly dissapointing to most Powers fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and overlong","review":"I expect great things when I pick up Powers. I've read most of his novels, including hard to find ones like The Drawing of the Dark and Dinner at Deviant's Palace. I expect to learn about some area of mythology while being swept up in the new world he synthesizes from the material. I consider Last Call and The Anubis Gates to be two of the best fantasy books of the last 15-20 years. But it took me three months to force my way through Earthquake Weather. All the parts were there, but it couldn't hold my attention for more than a few pages at a time. Maybe I'm tired of the sameness of Powers's characters and plots, or maybe there was a decent 450-500 page book buried here. Maybe it's because I live in the Bay Area and the sense of place didn't ring true. [e.g. I don't know anyone here that refers to freeways with the definite article. That's an LA thing...] I don't know. I hope there's more enthusiasm in his next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and crazy but I read the whole thing...","review":"This is the first Tim Powers book I've ever read. His style of writing is eclectic and although this book did not live up to the expectations I had, I'm willing to give him another try. I found the plot to be completely confused. Perhaps if I had read the previous books in this series I might have enjoyed it more. In fact, I think with this book it is a must since I had no idea what was happening or why nor was I very interested by the end. Mr. Powers penchant for getting off the track of the story were by and large indulgent and unnecessary and added to the problems I had in finishing the book. In fact, there were several times I simply put the book down and started another. The funny thing is however is that even though I disliked this book, I did come back to it. This must be a testament to the excellence of his writing, although I cannot pinpoint why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite weak, in comparison","review":"Too much exegesis. Too much boring talk about revolvers and their various types of ammunition. Not enough of the kinds of characterization that has made Powers.The weakest effort yet. Go read \\"Anubis Gates\\" or \\"Dinner At Deviant's Palace,\\" or, if you can find a copy, \\"The Drawing of the Dark.\\" Or even \\"Last Call\\"; it's a far stronger book."},{"rating":"1","title":"clogged","review":"To cite just one problem: The dialog sometimes involves 6 or 7 people at the same time. Coupled with the often obscurely allusive text, the result is prose so constipated it simply doesn't reward patience: the payoff --what little there is-- simply isn't worth waiting for. Powers' earlier works are well worth the effort, but this mess --along with other, equally disappointing later efforts-- tells me his his good work is behind him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impenetrable","review":"There ought to be a law against publishing a book and not telling you that it is a sequel. This story cannot possibly be read on its own...Don't try. I am on page 100 and almost nothing makes sense. Even though I bought this for a bargain rate, I still feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Serious?","review":"I enjoy reading books because they are either: (a) well written, or (b) interesting. This book is neither. If this plot were in the hands of a capable author it might make a mediocre book. As it is, we are treated to the author's analysis of his own plot on just about every page, because, apparently, we, the readers, are too stupid to figure out that a character is being obsequious or insincere. This book is where subtlety and craftsmanship come to die. If you enjoy being told what to think, by all means, read this book. If you enjoy thinking for yourself, do anything else other than reading this book--staring at a wall, for example, or alphabetizing your hats.Oh, and if your name is William E.

The first song \\"Hell to Pay\\" is a reminder of the consequences of sin. \\"M2\\" is an anthem that seems to have been written to convince Marilyn Manson that God loves him despite his sin. The production by Travis Wyrick is phenominal. The musical style is best described as metal for the person who is concerned about morality and Christian values. This music is not for the average ccm listner. It is recommended for those who love the hard rock music. No questionable lyrics will be found in this album. My applause goes out to the band as they have created an excellent follow-up to their first release \\"All Washed Up\\". This cd rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious! A MUST read/sing!","review":"I have about 10 Alan Katz books - these are just hilarious songs! \\"Where Did They Hide My Presents?\\" is probably my favorite one, just because I love Christmas songs. But all of his sing-along books are great! I read/sing them to my students at school during story time, and the kids just love them. When the students get to pick a book to read, these books are usually the first to get picked!A few of the tunes are unfamiliar to me (may be a generational thing), but with the internet now, it is super easy to google the name of the song and learn the tune quickly. Often times it is just a matter of reminding myself how the whole song goes. \\"Where Did They Hide My Presents?\\" is probably the easiest to sing of the Alan Katz sing-along series.Buy this book! Seriously! You will find yourself singing the Alan Katz versions of the songs more than the real versions. They are a great treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This get \\" Take Me Out Of The Bathtub \\" instead","review":"I bought this book without having read it in advance.

Of course, if for some reason you were hoping book two of the Alex Reynold's series might center more on Alex and Peter (they even LIVE with Mom), might have a little more spice and less sugar, might develop and expand what is a sorta interesting plot...uh,keep hoping. Hunter seems set on playing to every stereotype of a gay man. He goes for straight laughs (pun intended) and doesn't bother breaking it up with any tension or excitement.

Now I use a $4 Wolverine leather hammer loop that I bought from Home Depot. I gave up on this holster because it's really annoying to have such a big non-flexible object around the waistline when I'm walking up steep slopes and hopping down ledges. Also, the hammer is way too loose in the plastic enclosure so there's a lot of noise generated from even gentle walking. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it did last me 2 field seasons which I did not expect from a plastic object. Save yourself the annoyance and go to the hardware section of Home Depot and get a belt-loop hammer holster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holster is bulky","review":"For work out in the field, I find this hammer holster bulky and uncomfortable.

Yes, like most of the masses, I was pissed when he struck out on his own, but got over it after listening to this album & Human Touch a few times. The first 5 songs are outstanding as well as Leap of Faith. The album ends a little bit weird, with pseudo-love ballads similar to Tunnel of Love. They seemed like 'filler' songs, but won't get you laughed at if you're listening to them in your car or dwelling.
