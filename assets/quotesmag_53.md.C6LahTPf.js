This guy David Hasselhoff has it all- talent, guts, and a little something called talent. His collection of songs rivals those of Frank Sinatra, Frank Zappa, and Frank Stallone. The sweet delivery which he brings to each song are like kisses from an angel, and a warm cloud of musical talent hangs about his head and mouth like halitosis. The way he barks out the lyrics is poignant and moving, not unlike the sound a mastadon with its foot caught in a beartrap makes. Just fantabulous. I would go so far as to rate David Hasselhoff among the top 600 best singers out there today. And the song \\"Hot Shot City,\\" well I think that there song is particularly good, right there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hass is a Gass!","review":"\\"Don't Believe the Hype\\" is a message Flavor Flav will have you follow, but for this music reviewer, you can believe all the hype surrounding David Arnold Hasselhoff! He is a force to be reckoned with when it comes to music, and you can bet your bottom dollar that he will reign supreme for decades to come! Yeaahh boooy! David Hasselhoff is truly a talented singer, blurring notes so that you can't tell whether he's singing on key or not. And the way he sings, man, it's like someone dropped a really heavy object on his foot by the way he wails on \\"Dance Danice D'amour.\\" He wretches and huffs his way through some beautiful songs on this album, and I can't recommend it anymore.

This CD is SO good, it is worth getting it by any means necessary. Even if it means using 'extreme measures.'To listen to these 18 songs of pure, magical bliss is an experience so mindblowing and ecstatic that it is worth knocking your grandma over to turn up the volume. The musical arrangements and production are so revolutionary, it is not beyond good taste to punt your Dad in the jewels in order to listen to these tracks over and over. And to get swept away in David Hasserchief's voice- a voice that some claim sounds like a gazelle spanking two donkeys- is an experience so orgiastic and fanastical that it warrants torching a hospice.

So tell your mama to stop smoking that crackpipe and listen to these gorgeous tunes by David Hopperfleef.What you and your mama will find is that each song is a golden link in a brilliant, shining chain of song achievement, a chain that is worn by an oiled up, bronzed faux-bodyguard. That gold chain hangs from David's trapezoid of a neck, shining forth like a beacon in the fog of pop music. And every once in a while, VOOM, the lighthouse shines forth with a new hit:VOOM- \\"Dance Dance D'amour.\\"VOOM- \\"Freedom For the World.\\"VOOM- \\"Flying On the Wings of Tenderness.\\"VOOM- \\"Je T'aime Means I...\\"VOOM- \\"Wait, I didn't finish the last...\\"VOOM.VOOM.The song \\"Hot Shot City\\" is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yanking the chain to my broken heart","review":"Almost two decades after releasing his first album, \\"Highway to My Heyhey,\\" David Hankerpants has remained a fixture in the firmament of pop stars. His long, illustrious career has covered everything from standard blues rock on the 1975 album \\"Tongue In My Peephole\\" to experimental Far Eastern influences on \\"Curry On My Wayward Son.\\" The sheer breadth, depth and girth of his catalog of work has yet to be exceeded by anyone from Baywatch. (Pamela Anderson released a double album in 1988 named \\"Tweak These,\\" but only sold about 40 copies.)But volume aside, the quality of his hits are exquisite. Sinatra would kill to have the series of songs that David has hit out of the ballpark, Frank. \\"Flying On the Wings of Tenderness,\\" or affectionately known as FOWT, is a treasure, a standard that crooners at every karaoke bar jockey to sing next. And the other songs are good, too. But I'd have to say that \\"Hot Shot City\\" is particularly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, poetic fisting","review":"Words can hardly suffice in describing the pure joy I felt when I first heard this marvelous collection of rock hits. David Horkenhants fulfills all my desires in music, with touches of melodrama, a pinch of seduction, and a whole lot of synthesized drumbeats and whammy bar guitars.

However, I had to cut it down to four because upon listening to it for the first time, my brother shrieked with joy then collapsed into a lifeless pile on the floor. At first I was taken back by this, but then that sweet, sweet Hasselhoff sound entered back into my brain and I was put to ease. The autopsy revealed that my brother died of bliss, so that is why I am only giving the CD 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Music' is too small a word for this.","review":"When Hasselhof released 'Hooked on a Feeling' in the Spring of 1999, the world gasped as one. Musically speaking Everest had been climbed, the Titanic had been raised, AIDS had been cured.But then came 'Looking For...'.Nobody had expected it. Nobody had dreamt of it. Nobody had even wanted it! But David Hasselhoff has done it. He's gone one almighty step further. With 'Do the Limbo Dance' he's jumped off the snowy peaks of Everest into the waiting arms of angels; with 'Hot Shot City' he's stuck an outboard onto the Titanic and by God he's gonna sail that damn ship into harbour; with Looking For-Best of David Hasselhoff, David Hasselhoff has concocted a medicine for death itself.Immortal.

With just 18 songs with 2 chords, David Hashbrownhoff has wiped out every boy band poseur out there, replacing them with songs of character, of devotion, of emotion, with lotion.But lotion aside, there is a deeper enjoyment to be had with this CD. To wit, a way to plumb the inner workings of humanity and love through his voice, a voice that some may compare to an angry wild turkey chasing a baby goat.And as third paragraphs go, I must say that the other reviewers out there are spot on about their assessment of David's gifts and the songs that found their way onto this CD. Don't think, just listen. And be swept away in the same way Madonna and Guy Ritchie did in that movie, \\"Swept Away.\\"That movie had \\"Hot Shot City\\" on its soundtrack.

Jetzt ist es Zeit für Amerikaner, diesen großen Künstler auch zu umfassen."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning, simply stunning","review":"For years Hasselhoff has been dealing with the inevitable and yet tedious comparisons between his body of work and that of the Beatles. I am delighted to see that David's finest ballads have finally been amalgamated into a greatest hits collection, one that will once and for all prove that Hasselhoff leaves the Beatles for dead in terms of musical depth and song craftsmanship. Only in his wildest dreams could John Lennon have written a song of the sublime beauty of \\"Do the Limbo Dance\\" or \\"Danice Dance d'Amour\\". So let us put this utter mismatch of 'Hasselhoff versus the Beatles' to bed for once and for all: One were a talented (if somewhat limited) four-piece. The other is the greatest song-writer the world has ever known."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm swimming in delight!!!!!","review":"Critics everywhere from Nairobi to Tazikistan are raving about \\"the greatest CD ever to grace the shelves of record stores.\\" And performers as well, from Norah Jones to Vienna Teng have named David Hymecort as their primary influence. Street performers have adopted David's catalog of timeless hits and reinterpreted them for their own use:Joe Mack at the Thorndale \\"el\\" stop in Chicago loves to play \\"Flying On the Wings of Tenderness\\" on his chest with spoons.Fla-Cake in Times Square, NY has a rousing rendition of \\"Dance Dance D'Amour\\" with some naughty new lyrics.The Electro-Twins at the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, MD bring the crowd to their feet by singing \\"Je T'aime Means I Love You.\\"So David has obviously touched more lives with his music that people, Hassdunktankpf included, have not realized.

I bought this album, as I simply adore David, and to be honest I didn't know what to expect! Well I wasn't disappointed, this defintely has to be my favourite album, ever.

It definitely explores every little tangent on the subject in colonial history...which might be a bad thing. It gets a little repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlas with a huge crack","review":"This atlas is a major disappointment. I received it as a gift and was very excited to start avidly pouring over the satelite images and maps. I have enjoyed other books by this publisher. Not only is this atlas unwieldy (many of the maps require that this huge book be turned sideways to properly view) but the crack down the center swallows up big chunks of the image, rendering the cartography all but useless. It seems that with a little advance planning and forethought the maps could have been oriented in such a way so that the information was legible. I guess I will attach legs and use it as a 'book coffee table.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chevy 350 and 400 (Musclecar and Hi-Po Engine Series)","review":"The book is very informative (on the basics) for the beginner.

But....There are many good explanations on why a part was used, this will help a person to make a better decision on what part to go with themselves. There are a lot of good pictures, diagrams and technical notes to help, also many phone numbers to call for parts and help. 21 projects in all, if you have a 350 - 400 Chevy and need to find out where to start this is a good place to go to get some ideas.

The author's knowledge of the Church, the Vatican, the Trapist Monks, the CIA and an esthetic's life in India are impressive. The well drawn characters driven by the hunt for the two page letter play their parts in seeking, hiding or destroying The Secret of Fatima. The book is a monumental research task which, in turn, makes for a fast paced, compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"captured my imagination","review":"Anyone who misses the old cold war spy thrillers will likely enjoy this story of good and bad agents working for the CIA (not to mention the VIA [V for Vatican!]) I especially enjoyed the segments about the trappist monk/former agent. While I doubt the trappists would actually take a person who was not yet a bit further a long the path, so to speak, I found myself willing to suspend disbelief to enjoy the book. I do hope the author gives us more books with these characters. It would make a nice film, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better ones out there","review":"Mediocre output from a band that put out some really good albums. Its self titled cd is arguably their best, and this is just awful compared to their earlier recordings. Keep a Secret is really bad and seems kind of forced to go forward. It is almost as if they just playing the same chords over and over until it mercifully reaches its conclusion, which is really weak, needless to say. Got to Be Real pretty much covers the same pattern as far as lacking a lot of power. Highlights on this one is Lonelier Now and Too Late. On Lonelier now, they got everything right for the most part. Too Late is just a catchy tune. Unlike their earlier releases, this one lacks any kind of power, to say the least. If you like this band, stick with its self titled or Flat as a Pancake to get a flavor of how good this band can be. This cd is a poor representative of this band's true talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Self Help","review":"I've read a few Guy Finley books before and have seen him in person. In my opinion, his teachings go way beyond other self-help and spiritual ideas/systems. I think this new book of his is the best yet. It is written differently from other self-help/spiritual books (I've read a lot), and is a mix of poetry and regular writing. I learned a tremendous amount about myself and about Love from it and have used a lot of the information to help the relationships with my family and my partner. I would recommend it to anyone young or old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I think I must have missed the part in the description of the book about this being a bunch of sappy poetry.

I'm not real happy with this particular order."},{"rating":"1","title":"50% moderately useful info, 50% personal rant","review":"I enjoyed about 50% of this book. The author gives some good practical explanations of why materials, such as the hull of the Titanic, fail. As a layperson, I found this very interesting. However, I found his personal rants about the politics of scientific research and his personal tales of life in graduate school and beyond really, really tiresome. In addition, the title and book cover (a picture of a bridge failure) are a come on which have almost nothing to do with the contents. The science in the books moves from the macro to the micro, which makes a certain amount of sense but I found the topics to be really poorly organized. I would not recommend this book unless you have lots of free time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too focused on the author's personal life","review":"This book contains a few interesting interludes, but keeps coming back to the author's personal history. Where he went to the graduate school and the people he met there, where he was when the Challenger exploded, and so on. It's more of an autobiography than anything else.For much better presentation, look at J.E. Gordon's books, particularly the New Science of Strong Materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts Promising, Ends Up Whiny","review":"This book starts promisingly. The introduction to materials science from prehistoric toolmaking is fascinating, and coupled with fun anecdotes about the author's childhood interest in materials. It's fun to hear about the way he tortured a shatter-proof bowl into breaking, and to get a very readable explanation of the science of what went on.What's not fun is the account of his later career. While at the very end he reveals that he meant this account to be a critique of the American system of funding technological research, it comes off as a whiny account of why the author didn't get the post-docs and grants and academic respect he should have gotten. It's the worst sort of academic pomposity.On the other hand, he manages to make some complicated science about materials fracture quite understandable and interesting. So if you want to learn about that, then get the book and skim through the parts about the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely obsolete now (2009)","review":"I didn't notice that this pocket reference was still in its first printing, from January of 2002. As such most of the content is now obsolete. Specifically the author devotes a lot of space to comparing the Rule-Based and Cost-Based Optimizers, and points out the clear superiority of the latter. This was big news when Oracle 9i was about to be released, not so much now.As to the rest, there are 22 pages (out of merely 102) enumerating the many hints one can apply to SQL. There's not much here that isn't already available from Oracle documentation directly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Cab","review":"This Cab is the bee's nees!

I have read and studied real estate off and on over the years and this DVD mainly focuses on low-budget touch-ups to do to a cheap tiny foreclosure for flipping. It claims to have insights as to Where to find Foreclosures - but if you can't find them without tripping over them - this video won't be of much more help.And later at the end, Carlton supposedly interviews a married couple about their investing - Mike and Francine (sp?). The wife looks like a nice person - and Carlton Only Directs All of his questions to Mike the husband. Francine looks pretty and all dolled up - and seems to be very nice - But Carlton Completely Ingnores her!!

Cooper's reluctance to follow trends, his insistence upon the details of historical encounters, his attention to history of colonial studies prior to the rise of postcolonial theory, and his illustration of the questions that are closed off by postcolonialist texts like Chakrabarty's Provincializing Europe, all make this an essential read for anyone working in the social sciences or humanities."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 player mode","review":"I played this game for 5 minutes and i realized that this game is basically just hitting enemies and thought the makers of the game thought all they needed to do was put in a 4 player mode and the game will be good.

Dary builds up wonderful images out of a lot of meticulous detail. It is solidly researched; Dary has been a historian (and lover) of the West all his life. That shows, as does his journalistic background as a storyteller. The book is also well-produced by Knopf, with a large number of fascinating illustrations, most from his own extensive collection of Western Americana. The book does need more and better maps, in my opinion--the one on the endpapers is very handy but more pretty than useful. I enjoyed the cumulative effect of his details. True, any one of the paragraphs could be expanded into a history/biography of its own, or a novel, but the purpose here is a comprehensive and readbale history of a major part of the growth of this country, from 1492 to the present day. I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dary Misses The Trail","review":"What should have been an exciting book about a place central to the mythology of the West is instead a boring compendium of facts.Dary commits the cardinal sin of storytelling by not placing his details and facts in a narrative context. His book is essentially a time-line on which he hangs dates, names and numbers like so much laundry left to dry. There is no perspective, drama or insight. This book was a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trail to Nowhere","review":"Life on the Santa Fe Trail was no doubt dramatic and colorful, but you would not know it from this book. More than 300 pages of stitched together factual recitations and short anecdotes, the narrative lacks any central characters, themes, or ideas. None of the individuals featured in the book survives more than a few pages, and just as a story starts to draw in the reader, it ends, only to be followed by another quite similar episode, and another and another. Great events dominate the times, but the book seems to separate life on the trail from those events, making the trail itself seem to be almost boring, which it surely was not. The largest contribution this book can hope to make is to point another writer to promising source material with which to bring the story of this trail to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing and Tough to Get Through","review":"I agree with other disapointed reviewers that this is one tough book to wade through - even as a history lover. While well researched, it is a monotonous read and will test the patience of even those who have a love for the subject matter. It attempts to cover too much at once and never really succeeds in connecting all the dots in an entertaining fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Slightly Offensive","review":"Reading this book was like slogging down the Santa Fe Trail in the 1830's. Occasionally, the author gives excerpts from diaries and letters that bring life on the trail to life. But generally, what he seems to view as important are factoids: how many wagons there were in the caravan, how much merchandise it carried, and the value of the goods. Each caravan gets a dutiful few paragraphs summing it up.The offensive part is the treatment of conflict with the Indians. It's straight out of old Western movies - caravans are attacked by whooping columns of Comanches. There's no attempt at understanding the conflict, even from the point of view of the whites. Just savagery. I didn't think this sort of history was still being written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haujobb is reality","review":"One of my favorite Haujobb CDs, more developed than Homes and Gardens, but not worse than Solutions.

In recent years I have also attended non-denominational churches that focus on God word. I study the ENTIRE bible, not just a few verses. I was told by a Facebook friend that this was a MUST READ. I only made it through about three chapters as I quickly identified that this author was running down a rabbit hole based on the euchrist. Having a relationship with God is personal and this book focuses on one man's obsession with the euchrist. I do not recommend this book and have REAL issues with the misguided teaching of the Catholic church. This book basically said in the few chapters I was able to digest that if your not Catholic... Your not \\"being feed\\". I couldn't more disagree with this man. BTW... I don't ever recall throwing a book in the trash.

What happened? Where did Earshot run off to? This album is not close to their first in any way and quite frankly it sounds like one long drawn out waste of studio time.I wonder how they feel about it. I'm not impressed. I see that some people were and I wish I could see why because every song sounds the same to me.

I always thought Sandman is so rich a mythology surely they could someday release a paint-over of the material as rich and artistically skilled as the material is imaginatively written. Well, this isn't it. The \\"recoloring\\" is just a bunch of Photoshop gradient color fills, and at that the job seems very amateur. If you're going to use gradients, AT LEAST know how to use them to create depth and roundness and shadows... this is just straight drops of color change... very boring. I know this won't bother everyone, people have different takes on art.

I have read a few other of Gaiman's works and have found them lacking as well. I don't want to bash the author or any of his other works but he is not my cup of tea.

This version is enlarged, re-mastered (so to speak), and the paper quality is great. That being said, they charge you $75 for a product with a glued, not sewn binding. What this means is that if you read it carefully, once, the pages might stay together. If you read it twice, or open it too far more than once or twice, the pages WILL begin to fall apart.

The art seems to be clearer (maybe it's just larger) and the coloring has been \\"sweetened\\" or maybe \\"fine-tuned\\" would be a better term. The book doesn't look like it has been re-drawn; it looks like the same art, only better.The Special Features are also quite good, showing the history of the development of Sandman and the genesis of the \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\" Story.This book is worth every penny.If you are looking for a Christmas gift for the comic-book geek in your life (whether he/ she is into superheroes or art comics) this is the perfect gift.

If that's the case then it's trully a remarkable acheivement. The fact that this book comes under the auspices of 'Janes', one of the most accurate technical series in the world, is a disgrace.

The East Texas that Elvis and company traversed in the 1950's was (and mostly still is) marked by piny woods and red dirt roads - not too dissimilar from the rural areas of Louisiana, Tennessee and other southern states where Elvis kicked off his career.The fact that the book description references tumbleweeds and rattlesnakes sends up a red flag for camp journalism.Having said that, if you ever do make it far enough into West Texas, New Mexico or Arizona to actually see tumbleweeds, don't bother swerving your vehicle to dodge them; they're pretty harmless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarcastic author sounds unprofessional","review":"I bought this book because I'm writing Faron Young's biography and needed information on dates Faron and Elvis worked together.

I actually ended up fast forwarding just to get through it. I expected a true documentary with maybe a few interviews with people who were there, with the firemen, or anyone at all but the video is mostly silent. I can hear the fire fighters radios but most of it is so staticky it's hard to make out. The film has a few comments by the person taping it but that's it. The film also pretty much stays focused on just a couple of areas of rubble. I found nothing at all in this film that brought any emotion to me other than boredom. I own several other documentaries that I watch over and over as I don't want to forget the feelings I felt on 911 but this film is lacking greatly in bringing any kind of human element to this horror that was inflicted on our country.

Nothing breathtaking, a bit like watching a construction site.Nowhere does this video convey the horror and the awe of the day. There's a sequence where we see fires raging inside Building 7 (which would collapse later on in the day) but that's pretty much it as far as action is concerned.As for production value, this DVD is a straight transfer of a videotape (complete with glitches at the very start, as the VCR is ramped up in playing mode). There is no commentary (aside from a short voice over there and then) and very little thought has been put into the editing.Bottom line : this looks like the unedited footage as shot by an amateur videographer on a tragic day. Completely unenlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this DVD as I'm looking for good insightful information re 9/11, especially in relation to the collapse of Building 7. I'm sorry to say I was very disappointed and really learned little from it. It is like a home movie in real time. Could be edited to a fraction of its length and not loose much. Yes, devastation was shown but that alone is not sufficient to make it worthwhile. Of course Steve Spak did not know WTC7 was going to collapse but one reviewer referred to the fires in it, as though there was significant information in the DVD about them. There is not. No hard feelings but I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely interesting - huge historic value","review":"Not the fast-paced high-energy 9/11 footage that you're used to seeing, but extremely important to see.

The DVD was filmed immediately after the collapses of the Twin Towers. The radio transmissions are crisp and clear to me, You could hear the Maydays! from trapped firefighters and the fact that the 2 water mains feeding lower Manhattan were damaged!

Like the rest of these authors' work, the writing and characters are absolutely fantastic.

Unfortunately that return was an unpleasant and very unispiring reunion. The characters we once loved do absolutely nothing to motivate us, while their offspring never come to life. The convoluted plot seems slowed by the doggmatic adherence to formula. Regardless, it was a book worth reading, yet it doesn't beg one to miss any sleep. Perhaps its just that I've come to expect more from Margaret & Tracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Outstanding!","review":"While, I don't quite like the way that all the characters I have come to love have been killed, it was inevitable, and it was done in a way that I could not help but have tears fall from my cheek.

I ended the book with sorrow, both at the finish of such a fine book, and at the finish at such fine characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a Superb book!!","review":"This book, Dragons of Summer Flame, is now one of my favorite books out there. I thought that the action was great with the battles in all of the battles with Chaos' forces, and well written. And although I wasn't that happy with all of the many hero deaths, it was Really cool to see Raistlin again. Tasslehoff was more humorous than he's ever been, and I liked all of the mystery behind the newer characters Palin, Usha, and Steel. Unfortunately though, I hadn't read the Legends series yet, so I was kind of left in the dark about Raistlin, and all of his business with Caramon and Tasslehoff. Also, all of the gods were portrayed excellently. The ending disappointed me a bit, but every event leading up to it was superb. All in all, I can say that the book was well narrated, had a good progression of plot, and was very interesting. A must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wholesale Destruction, and for what?","review":"Although it's been over a year since I've read this book, I feel compelled to warn true fans of Dragonlance about it's true nature. This book ruins everything the authors took years to build!All I can say is Amen to the reader from San Diego. Everyone I know who has read this book, including me, dismiss it as having anything to do with the previous two trilogies. Whether from some contractual dispute or other bizzare scenario, this book just screams out loud and clear that something was wrong with it's creation.I did not even care that much for the other various authors (Preludes, Meetings Sextant) who feebly tried to recreate the characters that only Weis and Hickman should have claim to, but they were at least tolerable.Let us hope than somewhere someday this one 'truly does not exist' and that a character will wake up from this terrible dream and go on with the true spirit of the original books. Despicable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"\\"Dragons of Summer Flame is a good book.

The hero Palin, a white mage, get's help from many unlikely people including the Dark Knight, Steel Brightblade, the rambunkchous kender, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, and a mysterious girl whose name I cannot place at this moment.

The characters are pretty good but the story is horrible. I suggest to anyone who has read the Chronicles to read the Legends which are maybe even better then the Chronicles. But don't read this book it will taint the greatness of the other two triologys. All in all this book sucks because their are far fetched elements in the plot that are just dumb.

It lacked the action, adventure, and magic that made the first three as popular as they are today. It was hard to grow attached to the characters, probably because the book centered more on the Second Generation then it did on the original Companions of the Lance. It was Very depressing and frustrating. Any loyal DL fan should read it, though, because, despite what some people say, there are going to be other DL novels, and having read Summer Flame will make things a lot easier to understand.

My theory is that there was some contractual obligation here so Weis and Hickman thrashed Dragonlance. How this book got published is beyond me. TSR must have wanted that cash bad.

It destroys everything and everyone that you ever loved about Krynn. There are so many things wrong with it too, in that i mean, things like the greatest of all gods not noticing some people just because they were hiding in a bush????? There are good parts to this novel and some things that i think you really should know happened (if you are as die-hard a fan as me), but i wish i could just tell you those things and not tell you the rest so that you would still have an unwavering optimistic view of the once magical world of krynn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... so MW and TH are fallible after all...","review":"I read this book over 2 years ago and had been a big fan of the Chronicles and Legends trilogies which I read back in the late 80s.

This book, however is incomprehensible to me as the writing style, characters and plots are but a mere shadow of previous publications. It seemed the authors had tired of the series and wanted to wash their hands of it in a sloppy way. If they had not been who they were, this would never have gotten past the high-school student interning at the publisher's office.Keep the beauty of their other publications pristine. Don't ever read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to give it 1 star???","review":"This book has nothing that made Chronicles the excellent series it was. Characters are dull and lifeless, plot is juvenille, and the writing style is amateurish. I don't know how Weis & Hickman could have wanted their name on it.

Did they miss destroying something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Krynn is destroyed by its Authors","review":"I have to qualify the summary by stating that I loved the original Dragonlance Trilogy. I have read and reread the books and have never tired of wandering the realm of Krynn.The ho-hum efforts of the legions of well meaning authors of the spin-off novels were bearable. This effort by the trilogy's original authors is not. Yes, the Dragonlance series has spun on too long, but it surely the world of Krynn we know and love did not deserve to be destroyed so callously.I found myself grimacing at some of the hackeyed plots involving the gods of Krynn and despairing as one hero after another is killed off in uninspiring, unheroic fashion. The truly sickening end to many well-loved characters made my stomach turn.Do yourself a favour, throw this book into the Abyss. Then re-read the original Dragonlance Trilogy and revel in the magic and spendour on Krynn as we know and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out On My Ear","review":"I enjoyed reading most of this book. I burned through it in three or four days, and I'm not a very fast reader. The deaths of major characters were actually a plus for me. I thought they died heroically well, and each instance added to the drama. The central character tensions involving Steel and Palin hold up as well, or better, as that which we've read before involving all the old favorites.It took a very demoralizing ending to pull my rating down as low as it is. \\"The Age of Mortals\\" does the trick. My experience of reading this book was like being at a nice party with old and new friends; and then, at the end of the night, getting punched in the gut, kicked out of the house, and told to \\"never come back!!\\". The authors might just as well have added a postscript saying \\"Dear fantasy junkies, The fun is over. Go get a life.\\"I am a believer that all good things come to an end. But, in my opinion, reducing Krynn to Mundania was a poor way to go about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book brought me to tears but for all the wrong reasons.","review":"Why or why did they have to destroy what so many of us hold so dear? Dragonlance and the world of Krynn meant more to me than a story. It influenced my life and helped me grow as a person.

I can't help but detest all those responsible for taking this away from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"They do it again","review":"I have been following the books of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman since the mid-80's.

The plot is excellent, the characters are portrayed well, and it kept me in suspense. I hadn't realized that the Knights of Takhises were such nice people up until now. And at first I was shocked to see Tanis die but I guess it had to happen someday. I can't think of anything wrong with this book. I've always liked Fizban in particular. He's just so silly and I can never tell if Paladine has a wierd sense of humor or if he's actually serious about being so silly (I hope he's got a wierd sense of humor, otherwise Krynn would be in big trouble.) The best part was when Raistlin enters the world again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. A boring waste of time","review":"This must be what happens when authors grow to hate thier creations. This book generally has nothing to recommend it. The plot is weak and full of holes. The new characters have no depth and little motivation. Old characters are brought out of retirement just to satisfy the lovers of the first trilogy, and the ploy fails miserably. Other characters were unceremoniously killed off screen with little or no effect to the plot except to get them out of the way and raise the body count. I can only imagine that Weis and Hickman were bored while writing this, because I was sure bored while reading it. I don't recommend this book for purchase, but if you must read it get it from a library. That's where my copy ended up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a shame...","review":"Don't read this book... it kills all you ever stood for!!Just read the Chronicles and the Legends (and eventually other good DL books like the Tales or Defenders Of Magic) but just pretend this one never came out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dynamic Duo for many Years!","review":"This fantastic writing duo has continously given readers awesome fantasy epics for awhile now.

But I got really disappointed when I finally read it, the sole purpose of the book seems to be making room for the 5th age by killing the old characters as well ending the world of Krynn as we know it. Killing the old characters may have been unavoidable but the drastic changes to whole Dragonlance universe destroys the whole balance in the previous books. If TSR wanted a new world why couldn't they have made a new one instead of destroying a old one?The whole book have a \\"rushed\\" feeling about it and the character development is very weak. The old characters seems to be missing some of their charisma, especially Raistlin which return but without his magic which was very much a part of him and without it he's only half the man he used to be. Even the villian, Chaos seems very flat and boring so if you liked the other books in the DL series DON'T buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing end to a great series","review":"(spoiler review)The overall sense I got about this book is that the authors were pressured to put out another volume in the series. Their response? To virtually kill off the world of Ansalon as their readers know it. Sure, it survived, but it's not the same world it was -- all the gods are gone. Killing Tanis and Tas might have seemed like the final nail in the coffin, but I could have dealt with that had they provided better characters to take their places. However, the only truly complex character (Steel) dies in the final battle, leaving us with Palin (who somehow isn't terribly believable) and the fairly one-dimensional Usha. Very disappointing. All good things must come to an end; I just wish this had been a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly a disappointment","review":"I was disappointed in the conclusion of this book. Many of the companions that we have come to know and love meet an unfitting fate. Heros are killed off uselessly and dishonored. I loved the trilogy.

I did not like the finale to the heros of Krynn."},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of Krynn?","review":"Since Dragonlance Legends ended, and Weis and Hickman left for bigger and better things, there have been few Dragonlance books that were truly enthralling as Legends and Chronicles. A few of the anthologies had a couple of good stories.In a couple of the short stories written by Weis and Hickman, we get introduced to some of the children the Heroes of the Lance.Hooray for the return of Weis and Hickman! They use these children as the main characters of Dragons of Summer Flame. Fate has pulled these children together to fight against something greater than the heroes fought against. The heroes fought against the Takhisis, the Dark Queen. Their children fight against a threat that Takhisis, Paladine, and Gilean all fear.Be prepared to say goodbye to old friends, hello to \\"friends\\" you thought long gone, and radical changes to the World of Krynn that will effect all the books that follow in the Dragonlance series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting history lesson, but very dissapointing","review":"I was so excited to read this book and all (or most) of the characters i have come to love in Krynn. So instead i read about Palin, who was boring yet the most interesting of the three new heroes. Steele sucked. and Usha could have been much better. What i got out of it was the history of the creation of Krynn. That's all i really liked about it. More problems - Disabeling Raistlin seemed just too convienent for the plot. Oh, and after everything is said and done for, we get some wussy world with no resemblance to the one we all love. The only thing worth mentioning is that it will make an impact on you one way or the other.

(and even here they only care because of previous works) Palin is boring, Raistlin is interesting, but he's disabled and just wastes away. And killing off Tas in that redicious manner...revolting.

Without giving too much away, they kill off most of the remaining Heroes of the Lance, dispel the gods, and dispose of entire class - the magic user. Lord Soth makes an appearance as well (but he was trapped in the Ravenloft world forever a few years ago - he must have found a way out). The do delve into the next generation of Heroes (Palin and Steel) but at what price - the total restructuring of the entire Dragonlance world? Too bad that books aren't like cars, this one needs a recall. I beleive that this book suffered the same fate as many succesful series.

Crank out too many sequels and you are going to have a dud. This one is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a longtime fan and follower of the Dragonlance Saga, I can only call this 4th and heavily belated installment of Chronicles to be a major disappointment. Gone is the sense of purpose and adventure that made the original Chronicles and Legends trilogies so gripping. In its place is this, which almost reads like a comic book, with characters coming back to life and being taken away just as quickly. Most of the \\"offspring\\" characters developed in the Tales stories are killed off rather quickly, and other characters like Palin and Steele are not dealt with well either. Add to that the almost total destruction of the Krynn we all know from prior novels, and this is one fantasy disaster.For my part, I've tried to forget this was ever written, and until better comes along am sticking with the Legends trilogy as the final major chapter involving the heroes of the lance."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book Ruined everything the others had made","review":"I picked up this book and after about 10 minutes of reading about Usha and the oh so broingly Irda I almost fell asleep.

Dragons of Summer Flame reeked of outside influence because i have never before seen Weis or Hickman write so horribly. The whole world was ruined so that 5th age (what a dumb name) could come into existance. The world is left with no magic, no gods, and hardly any people. The only thing that could ever redeem my faith in this is if somehow, a new DL book came out that restored a lot of the things that were so unjustly taken away.

Perhaps the worst part of this book is how frivilous the lives of people are. those whom we've come to endear are slain without much thought. The valor or purpose seen in Sturm's death is absent in Summer Flame.I was hoping for a lot more in Summer Flame. And although it is a decent book, it does not live up to the standard that Weis and Hickman set in their original two Trilogies. this book should have been told in a trilogy itself, taking time to fully develop characters and such, but instead, we are given a very shallow view."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King is dead - not long live the King","review":"This is the book that really began Dragonlance's downfall... It's as if the authors or whoever decided to make the book wanted to revitalize Dragonlance, and instead ended up ruining most of what made Dragonlance fun. Still, I'd have liked to give it 2.5 stars, but since I couldn't, I erred on the side of condamnation since the book was such a disappointment. After DoSF came the horrible Fifth Age. *shudder* Well, I've moved to Forgotten Realms, so Wizards is still getting my money.Despite the failings of the story, Weis and Hickman were up to their usual standards of writing, meaning DoSF was still more enjoyable than nearly all the Dragonlance spinoffs.Speaking of the spinoffs, there was one phrase in the book said by Astinus, \\"but this is another tale\\" when speaking of Crysania or something similar. If that wasn't a hook for a spinoff, I don't know what was. Sure enough, in time Tears of the Night Sky was published."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was wonderful one of the best dragonlasnce books yet","review":"this book had evey thing in it. it tied up loose ends for the older age and started on the new age im sorr but it was 1 of the best books i have ever read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not like the ather seris.","review":"I liked Gdil because he is olmost the oldest figher in this book and i liked him in the over books of this seris.

Not only is it bad, it's a poor excuse for a \\"series end\\".You know, the short stories of the \\"kids\\" that were in the compilation books were better (like \\"The Legacy\\" in the Magic of Krynn or whatever, and that one with Caramons' kids and the dwarf guy in Kender, Gully Dwarves and Gnomes...)...both of those were actually good!Unfortunately, nobody stuck to that style or format with this book.

(Unlike Sturm) 4) Introducing the Irda was a mistake. 5) Having Raistlin's daughter turn out not to be her daughter was pretty weak. 6) Raistlin without magic is like Dirty Harry with no guns. 7) Death Knights weren't as awesome as they were supposed to be. 8) The other books were good, why did this hafta suck?? 9) Palin is not Raistlin. (and is boring) 10) Chaos didn't really do much..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragons of Summer Flame does not exist!!!!!","review":"The chronicles, great, Legends even better. Dragons of Summer Flame utterly pathetic, and very sad to see how authors of such notability could have possible dreamed up such a weak plot. Weis and Hickman had better damn well be ashamed of themselfs for selling out millions of fans. This book was clearly written for $$$$$$ I will never read another DL novel again. the magic is gone. Who cares about the Fifth age? It's only been written by other authors who are too thoughtless to create there own fantasy world.

I love Weis and Hickman's creation and still can't believe how they could destroy all that they built with one miserable book.

I was physically angry as I finished this book. Do not read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull story. . . . Terrible end.","review":"The DragonLance Chronicles series built up a powerful storyline, and kept readers coming back for more. The Legends series was and interesting twist, but it ended leaving fans in suspense, with no sense of closure. This end was to come in Dragons of Summer Flame. The book started out strong, and I just couldn't put it down. The storyline was intricate and captivating. . . then came the end.Although this did not lead to the end of the series, as some initially feared, all books written thereafter were very different; it might as well not even be the same series. Still, it is a must read for any DragonLance fan, and it has some powerful moments. But expect to be ultimately disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"***** + *","review":"Totally awsome, I like it a lot, if you liked this book, read on, get the next book in line, and find out if Palin ever lives through the horor of losing his ability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at building, bad at deconstructing","review":"Weis and Hickman are two of the best world builders out there. Chronicles was amazing. Lengends was even more amazing. This book was horrible. Nothing leaves a worst taste in your mouth when you read a book by authors who don't seem to care about what they are writing. What a hokey way to show that Palin was the \\"greatest wizard of all time\\". <bleach> The reformation of Krynn, to me, sounds like at least a 3 book series. This book seemed very rushed, and had a weaker ending than even the DeathGate series, another group of books with the most amazing world-building I've read yet, and a most amazing let-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Which Weis and Hickman go on a rampage.","review":"I honestly think Weis and Hickman were so peeved at being buffaloed into doing another book by T$R that they decided to go on a killing spree of the main characters, which fit well into T$R's plans for Fifth Age (There's no gods! No magic! But look at that handling!). Tanis' death was tolerable, since he went out in a noble way, the writing style is as descriptive as ever, and it's always good to see Raistlin, but Chaos is a lame bad guy (He needs to summon armies of goofy creatures? Ao of Toril could snap his fingers and fry the Realms!), Caramon's kids are dumb, and all the Irda -an interesting race- get roasted. I dunno. Its greatest fault is making you think, \\"You mean all those damn Dragonlance novels I read were pointless?\\"Oh, and I don't care what Weis and Hickman say. Usha IS Raistlin's daughter; they made that clear in Tales. Or was that more meaningless crap like Summer Flame? Oh well, back to the Realms..."},{"rating":"2","title":"DragonLance Dragons of Summer Flame","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. It had the most amazing characters out of the entire series. My favorite characters were Palin, Usha, Raistlin, and of course Tasslehoffe. The book also had its thrills and some really sad parts to it. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman are the best DragonLance authors that there are. Summer Flame was the best one of all of the chronicles series as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good although rather dissapointing","review":"For a real Dragonlance Fan, this book isn't quite in the spirit of the series. However, the book was well written and the story in itself was preety good.I always liked Raistlin as a character and it's pretty dissapointing that he comes back powerless. Although this does mean that Weis and Hickman aren't writtinganymore books, there are many stories which could branch off of this. Still, if you ask me, the Dragonlance Series is already overdone. There are just way, way ,waytoo many stories in the series now. Personally, I think that we don't need all that many novels in this series. I gave this book an 8 because the story was well writtenand it gave us a much better look at the god whom we never really find out much about."},{"rating":"1","title":"An endless disappointment to a proper Dragonlance fan","review":"The book is quite well written, and is sure to provide good entertainmentfor any non DL fan. Having read most of the DL novels,I feel qualified tosay that this novel is not written in the DL spirit. It seems obvious thatthe book has been written on request, rather than on inspiration. In mostof the book they do everything to please the DL fan, like reviving Raistlin,and giving most of the old heroes an appearance. But in the end the authorskill the DL saga, probably to please TSR, so that the company can createanother roleplaying game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a REAL WINNER! Of the worst dragonlace book...ever!","review":"If you have ever read a dragonlance novel, then you know what to expect. I am a Weis & Hickman fan. I own 10 of their books, and this is the book that took a flop. It has no plot, and it is not relevant to the rest of their books. Except Palin Majere is introduced, who is Raistlin's nephew. That is ALL you need to know. I promise. But this is the most plot depressing book i have ever had the nerve to read. I gave the book away. If you are looking for a book that will let you down read this. If you are looking for a good epic fantasy series, read the Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy by Tad Williams. It is Better than Tolkien,....seriously.The main reason i would not recommend this to anyone is, compared to great stories like The Lord of the Rings and Memory Sorrow and Thorn, this book was written by a 9-year old neanderthal boy. This book has poor sentence structure, no mysteries, nothing exciting, and no plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of place with chronicles","review":"I loved the chronicles, read all three books more than once in the space of 9 years..but I couldn't finish this one. Why? It seems this book was made to kill off everything on Krynn and start all over again, not what I and other Dragonlance fans wanted.What we wanted was an adventure that reunited all the living heroes, and with the spirit of Raistlin battle an evil and powerful foe from the Abyss..or something like that. I was shocked when Tanis was stabbed in the BACK!!! My favourite hero killed by an Orge for gods sake!!TSR YOU owe us fans an explanation, or a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but needed even more magic!","review":"This book was one of the best of the Dragonlance series, second only to Dragons of Autumn Twilight, which set the scene and was, in my opinion, the best of the series.

Of course he would have won."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest Dragonlance books ever writen","review":"I loved the book. Palin Majere returns to the Abyss to get his uncle to help.

The Gray Robes would have been destroyed by Raistlin.By making Raistlin weak and powerless allowed Weis and Hickman to actually make a story out of this plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near as good as the first three","review":"I read the first three books in this series in no time at all, I could not put those books down. this one is slow and quite boring really...I have had it for probably 6 months and still am only a hundred pages if even that into it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I made the mistake of reading this, so help me God...","review":"It warms my heart to see so many DL fanatics agree with me about this stupid, mindless piece of crap. Maybe Weis and Hickman didn't write it of their own free will, but who told them to go back to T$R? This book just can't be forgiven. The plot is ridiculously exaggerated. If someone like Chaos really decided to destroy Krynn, what chance could there be for anyone to do anything? And I also agree that killing off every single interesting character isn't a good way to finish a book.And what about the moral of the book? I nearly bit my nails off in frustration when all those goody-goody characters kept thinking: \\"OK, it seems the bad guy got lost somewhere on the way, but since I promised I wouldn't run away, well I guess I just have to go back and search him so I can be his prisoner again.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book","review":"If you worshipped the Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends novels as I did then DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. My favorite series of all time was the Chronicles. This book ruined it. Heros and villians that the reader has come to know and love were killed off and horribly dishonored. Each character seems to meet an unbecoming fate. This book is the worst conclusion to a great series. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Imagine your own ending to the compainions of Krynn. You will be much better off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Where can they go now though?","review":"I thought this was a great book, but I feel it should have been at least two books really. For me the magic of the first trilogy was discovering the Gods and the worrld with the charecters yet in this book the authors pretty much distroy it all.The main story was good, many people disagree with the death of some of the old characters but I think for the seris to move on they did not need to have things or people pulling them back to the last age. I do disagree with the way the death of Tanin and sturm was brushed over though.I really did enjoy the return of rastlin and his interaction with caramon. I do not see how Dalmar could fool any one into thinking she was raistlins child though becuase she had no magic at all not even the natural Irda magic.So all in all it was a good book but you have to ask where do the authors have to go now, the world is left God and magic less. The next novel will mack or break the dragon lance world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, but waits too long to cut to the chase","review":"This book is very exciting. It's bigger then most dragonlance books, which makes it all the more better. However, I do not think the writiers did enough with the extra space. The actual Chaos War does not occur until the final few chapters, which is a big disappointment. However, the rest of the book was good enough to stop it from falling all the way to 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can someone give me a synopsis?","review":"I confess that I'm not a huge fan if the Dragonlance Series.

Unfortunately, it's taken me almost 4 years to get through them. I've finally made it to Dragons of Summer Flame.And I just can't take it any more. I really just want to skip back to War of Souls, but the compulsion to read books in order is just to strong.But I cannot get through this book. I made it to page 90. Just past the deaths of Sturm and Talin, which pretty much did it for me. Topped with the Usha character and her potentially for unlimited whinning, I just can't make it any farther.So if someone could just give me a synopsis of the important events, I'd aprriciate it.Because this book is just not worth reading.

On this their debut, we get the classic line-up, guitar and vocals Ted Turner, guitar, vocal Andy Powell, drummer Steve Upton and vocalist,bassist Martin Turner. This band formed in 1966, but released their debut in 1970. On \\"Wishbone Ash\\", we get the boogie riff rocker \\"Blind Eye\\", the hard hitting \\"Lady Whiskey\\", Andy's solo is great. \\"Errors Of My Ways\\", has gotten a load of satellite radio play, folky-rock number and the classic \\"Phoenix\\", a 10 1/2 minute song on vinyl, which could stretch up to 20 some minutes live.

I was glad that Josh pointed out the lovely bass playing of Martin Turner at the beginning of \\"Handy\\". While he is over-shadowed by the guitarists, Steve Upton gives excellent support on drums. The only thing I would add is that the harmonized singing on \\"Errors of My Way\\" are equal to anything done by Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young.This is a fantastic rock album. I eagerly look forward to getting more albums from Wishbone Ash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This being their eponymous debut album ranks amongst the best in my collection.

McLeod rather define the Sikhs according to his bigoted viewpoint of a missionary than refer to the Sikh scripture and historic Sikh tradition.

That film had a very withdrawn, simplistic approach to genre material and Ti takes that approach even further with this film. I can see why people wouldn't like this film. The first half hour is very slow, but it builds to a tremendous payoff! When the violence strikes, it's quite shocking. The location work was breathtaking, especially towards the end of the film when our hero wonders through an adandoned factory. The film does require patience, which will probably be met with a lot of disdain for today's A.D.D. cinema-aficionados, but if you're looking for a different kind of movie-watching experience, I whole-heartedly recommend this flick!

The dvd made no sense and was so boring and poorly done that I had to fast forward through it.

My only problem was that one pole attachment was broken in one set that I ordered. This was due to the fact that the manufacturer's packaging is more for retail stocking and not so robust for UPS shipping...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why We Read Historical Fiction","review":"Baltimore's original Raven fans could not be more compellingly imagined. This romantic and richly detailed story of Poe's struggles with alcohol, ambition, creativity, loyalty, and multiple loves not only introduces readers to the wrongly forgotten poet Frances Osgood, but also brilliantly illuminates 19th-century American culture, especially the competitive world of New York City publishing. The writing is fresh. The scandal is new. The book is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing!","review":"I was so taken by the world of this book-- the hustling and rivalry of the various magazine editors of the time, the heated, gossipy atmosphere of the literary salons-- all fascinating. And Poe himself emerges as an intriguing character. Despite the fact that he's one of the pillars of American literature, Poe & Fanny shows his all-too human sides as well as his constant struggles for both financial solidity and literary reputation. And I was torn as a reader between Poe's love for his sickly young wife and his soulmate-like passion for Fanny! The pages flew by as I was drawn into the author's delicate resolution of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received","review":"My mother inlaw need this for a book club meeting, we ordered from the sell and never received it.

Although I have lots of other Hawkwind albums from the 70's and 80's (which I still listen to and enjoy)I never tire of Space Ritual. Hawkwind's sound, thanks to Dave Brock, is so unique that no other band comes close when it comes to space/fantasy rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album of all time","review":"They reckon Astounding Sounds is bad but this album would have to rate as one of the worst pieces of crap of all time.

Not that this is harmful in any way... it's just that it is really, really awful.Lemmy is the only one in the band that could play with any facility or sense of melody, and even he wasn't exactly at his best then. The drummer is an unsteady, two-lick metronome, and Dave Brock continuously uses a wah pedal on his guitar solos to try to cover up for the fact that he sounds like he's playing with his toes. Overlay it all with undifferentiated sonic sludge, add a flute/reed player who seems to have never learned half the notes on either instrument, and sprinkle with \\"cosmic\\" lyrics that weren't so much goofy as stupid - that was Hawkwind.Don't buy the hype. Hawkwind was always terrible, if terribly sincere. They were a joke then, and if you pay what they're asking for this idiocy, the joke's on you. Want space rock? Buy Gong, or even Planet Gong, not this mud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal on the edge of space","review":"Got headphones?To many people 'space rock' means the monotone drone of new age, HW is anything but that. They combined the sounds of Lemmy & Motorhead with the free form sax of Nick Turner. Long before the name was they were playing speed metal with the psychedelia of Pink Floyd, Moody Blues, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"..and the walls come tumbling down...","review":"This is a digitally remastered (1996) offering with considerable improvement on the sound quality of the vinyl copy (my 2nd - the first wore out) that I own. Lemmy's bass lines drive the whole performance along and you can hear them crisp and clean on this CD. This is a monster album to shake the walls.Play it loud in the car so that the bass makes doors and floor reverberate and the rest of the Hawkwind sonic assault washes over you.I agree that Space Ritual is 'a brutal sensory onslaught'and is best listened to in its entirety when in the right mood.It is not everyone's cup of tea.It is difficult to pick out highlights from this one but if I cannot listen to all of it in one go I tend to go for Master of The Universe , Brainstorm and Space is Deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band, Great Album, Great Music","review":"This band has brought the world another damn fine album.

Lemmy plays a mean bass, and you can hear where the roots of the live Motorhead rhythm section came from on this LP and \\"Hall of The Mountain Grill.\\" Disc two is largely superflous."},{"rating":"2","title":"As close as it gets","review":"Space Ritual is about as close as it gets to being at a Hawkwind gig. Have been in The States 20 years and haven't seen them for a good while but my old mates still hit the annual tour. I've seen Hawkwind many times both at festivals and theatres. Space Ritual brings back memories of the long-haired, chemically altered, whirling dirvishes, lasers, lights and Newcastle Brown Ale that accompanied their shows. It is a magnificant moment of musical history, a bookmark in my life, it is bloody brilliant (and Lemmy's base playing holds the whole thing together). If my life could be any album it would be Space Ritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enduring yet underappreciated classic","review":"This is one of the finest documents of Hawkwind as they were in their halcyon years. It transcends the limitations of the labels traditionally attached to this band, and is simply a classic album of great rock music performed by a band near the zenith of its form. Frankly, it's as important that you have this in your record collection as it is to have Led Zeppelin IV, Dark Side of the Moon or Disraeli Gears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime is the best!","review":"I use 'Prime' as it is the best value.

I have had a hard time getting control of the water in my tank. I used two cap-fulls in 20 gallons for weeks when my nitrite and ammonia levels were off the charts. It saved my only remaining fish. I didn't discover this product until most of the fish were dead. Now I use this regularly for water changes and when there are problems in the tank. It is hands down the best product out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"I've used Prime for the past 15 years on every fish and shrimp I've kept. It is by far the best on the market, and the most affordable. There may be conditioners that cost less, but consider that normally you need one cap full for every 10 gallons. With Prime, you need one cap full for every 50 gallons or so! For big tank owners, that means I can do a 50% water change on my 120-gallon and use 6ml of Prime vs 30ml of any other product. Even the smallest bottle (100ml) will treat 1,000 gallons!I've read some complaints here of the smell, and it does have a sulphur-like smell. The smell is NOT transferred to the water, and of course goes away when you cap the bottle.This is the only conditioner I'll ever use... it is effective, safe for even my most delicate ornamental shrimp, and by far the most cost-effective product on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as described.","review":"Claims to remove ammonia.

It's worked well enough for turtles, corals, freshwater and saltwater plants, discus, and my puffer fish.The ability to detoxify ammonia and nitrites in an emergency is a nice feature too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"This stuff is PERFECT for those with larger tanks. It treats much more water with much smaller doses. I have a 125g and have to use 2.5 cap fulls to treat my tank with water changes.

This is the best stuff around for De-chlorinating water in any size tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best stuff on the market","review":"This product cannot be contended in terms of its quality.

In some cases the errors are of such a nature as to make reading the text impossible.

I've heard the usual \\"This game cheats!\\" line before, but that saying is defined in whole new light in this game. In most games the CPU is annoying and is usually overcome within a few tries. NOT this game. To move around the board you roll a die, problem is, you NEVER move. I'm not lying either. Roll the die whenever your turn comes, it'll always fail. The opponents are sure making progress, but you're stuck in the same spot until Lady Luck comes to save you.

Its a tragedy more Americans don't understand the origin of THEIR bible. I beg to differ with Mr. Bobrick's conclusion that the English language bible is the basis for American traditions found in the Bill of Rights. I feel he over looks the fact that German Americans are the largest ethnic group in the country (if not a significant minority at the time of the revoluiton) and that the Reformation began as a grass roots rebellion in Germany. I would argue the basis of American institutions of freeedom have more to do with the traditions of German protestant settlers than the King James verion of the bible.

Until I read this, I had no idea of the sacrifice, the political and social impacts and the precarious development of this most cherished publication. Wycliffe, Coverdale, Tyndale, More, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, James I, the politics of court and canon law all play intiguing roles.

The author states that Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury Laud was trying to drag England back to Romanism(?!?) when he was actually just trying to enforce the use of the Book of Common Prayer and KJV of the Bible.

The point of this book is that Dr. Phil is an aggressive bully, and the authors could have developed that point in about five pages of text.

By the end I could not figure out whether this was a long rag page on Dr. Phil or if they were recommending his strategy for success. In the end, I do not know if even the author's were sure.For as great a self-help author as Dr. Phil is and as open as he is about his life I thought it was odd that this book said that they had a closer look than anyone has ever had before.

There are disturbing themes from incest, abortion, and murder.Tony Marsiglia is not a conventional writer/director.His movies most of the time are usually loved or hated.This is a vast improvement from his last film released by EI cinema(Now POP cinema) Lust for Dracula. Sinful is not a total T&A; fest like his previous offerings.Yes there is nudity but not used for the purpose of arousing the viewers. This film is one of the darkest and macabre films i've seen. The plot revolves lilith and her desire to become pregnant and have a baby.She meets Aisha who becomes pregnant and befriends lilith. Lilith becomes obsessed with Aisha and then becomes envious of her.The film creates a mood that is melancholy, hopeless, and bizzare."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those wondering, these are initialed (not signed) by Abigail Ybarra","review":"Just bought these in mid-Feb 2012 to get my hands on a set of initialed set of AY strat pickups since I hear she is retiring soon, or has already, so she will no longer be involved in any part of the production of these. Nothing in the product description here, or in the reviews, mentioned Abby, so I took a chance. I was happy to find them initialed by her. Of course, they're not as coveted as ones signed/wound by Abby, but she's still part of the process, for what that's worth (and it might not be much). -1 star for only coming in white.

Its only competitor in my experience is the \\"Ox-Bow Incident.\\" However, Bergon's novel, which is based upon a real event, is still better.The action, which is set around the Nevada town of Winnemucca in the year 1911, revolves around the pursuit of a Shoshone Indian family from Idaho accused of killing some white men. Told from the perspective of several major characters, including the Winnemucca Sheriff, a Basque immigrant, and the Shoshone Indians, this novel really shows the ugly underside of the West that never appears on the movie screen or in Louis L'amour's novels.This is novel is not a celebration of the old West, but it is a page-turner and well worth adding to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real fake!!!","review":"The only problem with this book, is that it isn't true.

There is nothing worse than investing time in a book only to find out you have been had. The prose and style of this book are ok.

I found another book on the \\"Last Indian Massacre\\" by Dr. Effie Mack, and learned the truth about the underlying story of Shoshone Mike.

Pipes is anti democratic and sponsors a bigoted campaign against scholars who disagree with his highly pro Islraeli views.

The amount of fiction included in this book which he tries to pass as fact is laughable.

However, this book was just a bunch of nice sounding rhetoric. I got to page 22 and just dismissed it.

The fit on it is fantastic, but it does scratch easily; I found that after 2 weeks of use there are quite a few scratches on the back. I wish it had a square hole in the back for a belt clip. You may run into some problems if you have a large headphone adapter. The one in my car is has a very thick base, and with this case on I was unable to plug my cable in. The cable is routed through my dash to the back of my stereo, so it isn't something I can easily replace with a thinner cable. I used a handheld rotary tool (Dremel type) to shave some of the plastic on the case (around where the cable plugs in).Review summary: Looses 0.5 stars for missing belt clip hole, looses 0.5 stars for headphone adapter spot, and looses 1 star for easily scratch.

Just about every one of my favorite songs are on here though I would have liked to seen a couple more included. Still what is on here represents the very best of the best music that Cowboy Junkies created during their early career. For anyone who has never heard of this group or are only slightly familiar with them, this album will serve as a good retrospective on the career of the Cowboy Junkies as it shows how their sound has evolved over the years.

The immediate response by our 10-month old lab mix was to sniff them and then ROLL around in them! However, in the past two days, none of those holes have been re-dug.We did have concerns about the features saying that this was a \\"long-lasting\\" product.

I think the fact that the book is out of print right now is the public's loss, and if James Patterson ever reads this, I advise him to re-publish it in softcover like he did with \\"The Jericho Commandment\\"/\\"See How They Run\\" I had to read a library copy of this book, and I'd really like to have my own so I can read it over and over like his other novels I've read. \\"Virgin\\" is definately a favorite of mine of Patterson novels outside of the Alex Cross novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, plot holes, unsatisfying ending...","review":"But other than that...! Really, this book was so badly written, the story was full of plot holes and awkward devices, and the ending was ridiculous. I would have stopped reading long before the end, but I was reading on the recommendation of a friend who wanted to discuss it. I can only assume at this point that I must have unknowlingly offended her and this was my punishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Patterson","review":"Pleased with book. A bit different than what I was expecting, but still glad I now own it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"made for Tv movie was better!","review":"One of those rare instances where the made for TV movie that came from this story is better than the original source material. Stay away! Stay far away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense View on Slavery","review":"I have used this book for years with middle grade students. It is to be used cautiously, I think with younger readers. It is an effective way to introduce the truly unthinkable aspects of slavery: the middle passage with human excrement falling on helpless captives, being stripped of clothes and dignity, and being owned by another human being. Julius Lester is a master wordsmith and he brings this forth on every page. The book is told from three different voices: The slave master, the slave and the narrator. These voices allow the story to be told so as not to offend, but to enlighten. The illustrations are strong and grounded images of slaves--it is like the ancestral souls have been painted on each page. I highly recommend this book, especially for teachers of US History. It is even useful in high school classrooms--where they can have even deeper discussions about the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Overly - Guitar EncycloMedia","review":"With his impressive book Mike thoroughly explains all the musical tools you run across as a guitarist - scales, intervals, pentatonic, arpeggios, chords, etc... the list is endless. It is one of the most complete reference book I have come across, equally addressing beginners and advanced players (although I think that it can be somewhat confusing to absolute beginners due to the huge information flood).The strength of this book lies in it's timeless topics, meaning you can look up a topic when you want to learn more about it (or need information about it), rather than studying the entire book in one sitting.<P rating: good, logical guitar specific reference book.Prerequisite: Personally I suggest that you have already spent some time with your guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only they lasted!","review":"I was in love with these nylons! I bought two pair one in black and one in nude, they felt great, my tummy was tucked, my legs looked fab. However, on day one I had a run two hours into my work day, and with the second pair on day two I had a run 5 hours into it. So, over $50 for two pairs of nylons that couldn't even last through the work day. :( Real bummer because I LOVED them! I would definetly reccomend these if they would only last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"all the way tummy control","review":"These are very strange. I like them and I hate them all at once. They do tuck you in all the way, but they are incredibly hard to get on. They are not \\"sheer\\" like you might think, either...of course, they are heavier than most sheer panty hose because they tuck you in so tightly.Don't dismiss them - they are great under a thin dress that shows bumps and bulges - there are no bumps and bulges with these hose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive, easily developed runs--don't bother","review":"Overpriced for what it is, given they developed runs the first time I wore them.

I would never buy them again. And, because I put them away and didn't try them in the first 30 days SPANX refused to refund a penny.

I expected better for $72."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great keyboard design","review":"I recently purchaced a logitech MX1000 laser mouse and I bought this combo just for the keyboard. It's works great with the mouse with no conflicts. After checking out all the logitech wireless keyboards, I think this is the best. The keys have a great soft feel, the volume buttons beat the volume wheel any day for ease of use. I love the calc button too. (...). Overall 5 stars for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems so far","review":"I have had this unit just about 3 months. So far so good. I have not experienced the keyboard failure that many have posted reviews about. The wireless keyboard and mouse combo is a nice set. The keyboard has many nice shortcuts built into it. The only problem I had with it during set up was that the transmitter has to be somewhere unobstructed. I needed to move it a few times to get a good signal. Ultimately, I put the transmitter less than a foot away from my keyboard and mouse. This was not at all what I was expecting from a wireless system. Also, the mouse seemed overly sensitive when I first set it up, but it was correctable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited Range","review":"I got this keyboard to use in my Living Room. I have to be less than 6 feet from the sensor or it does not work. The range on this keyboard is absolutely terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Product!!","review":"I've had this keyboard/mouse combo for over 6 months and it has been rock steady...no issues what so ever"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I bought this as a gift for my father and no complaints so far. I think it's a great deal for the money. Also, I chose the free shipping and it still arrived withing two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"mouse and keyboard have mechanical problems","review":"This unit combo looks nice, but I have had problems since new - almost 10 months ago. I think I got the setup by luck because it did not react anything like the setup guide said. The battery life has been pretty good though; I eat a set about every 3 months.The space bar sticks constantly, and the mouse does not respond to the left button click, and often does not track correctly. I can't figure it out. I've really got to pound the mouse button to get response. \\"Why not send it back\\" you might ask? Well, truth be told, it is a work computer and my boss is just kind of dense, you know, like a fence post. So I need to cough up the cash myself and today I just can't take it any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard-to-see letters and weak wireless reception","review":"The letters printed on the keys are tiny and hard to see, especially in low light. Older buyers beware of this!Also,the wireless receiver is weak. With keyboard and mouse two feet to one side of the computer tower, and with the little wireless receiver plugged into a front USB port on the tower, mouse movement was often not picked up by the receiver. Very frustrating. Plugging the receiver into a USB port on the rear of the tower gave even worse results. Now using a Logitech VX220 wireless mouse which works much better, and got a wired keyboard which is backlit and has large letters (Saitek Eclipse lighted keyboard). Outstanding!Saitek Eclipse Keyboard ( PZ30AU )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very durable or reliable product","review":"About three months after my wife and I purchased the LX300 Desktop, we experienced a complete keyboard failure. After performing everything suggested on the Logitech website, no luck. It had worked well for those three months and we were very disappointed when it stopped working. We completely felt dupped by Logitech on this product. You might want to take a look at a better quality product made by another manufacturer. Avoid the headaches we went through trying to get this one fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"microsoft +There","review":"There was no alarm for low battery warning. On the keyboard the hot keys marked so it is easier to find them. ( and I need that)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK...","review":"This is a decent product, but does have a few problems. There does seem to be interference that prevents the mouse from functioning fully and the range does seem limited. The mouse and keyboard do not work well enough for extreme gaming--there's too much delay and \\"skipping.\\" The most recent problem that prompted me to write this review is several keys now stick and do not pop back up. The space bar is one of them. That is extremely frustrating. It either doesn't work because it's stuck half way down or it's stuck down repeatedly creating spaces. I didn't spill anything on it--I don't eat/drink around my computer. It just seems that it wasn't made to last for the long term."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a problem","review":"My brother has this keyboard and mouse. I really liked it so I got one for me. I have not had a problem with it. The last wireless pair that I got ran out of batterys too quickly and kept lossing the connection. I am very happy with my new wireless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best low-budget wireless Keyb/mouse combo","review":"This is by far the best value you can get, Logitech quality wireless, both the mouse and keyboard works perfectly, very confortable mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid performer - no setup hassles","review":"I own a number of wireless keybord/mouse combinations and this is one of the better ones. Setup was hassle free and the features seem about right to me. It has enough \\"extra\\" buttons for the common functions that I have grown to use on my keyboard, for example the media control capabilities, without being overwhelming. I have not experienced any interferrence problems and the response of the mouse seems adequate. The tactile feel of the keyboard is solid with just the right amount of \\"noise.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Value and better performance","review":"I bought this combo a few months ago to replace an earlier version of Logitech desktop combo which the mouse somehow died after 2 years of service. The LX 300 is much more easier to install and immediately recognized the mouse and the keyboard. The transmitter is much smaller too. I love this product. I appriaciated this more after a recent experience with the Logitech V200 laptop wireless mouse. The V200 was very slugish with the mouse movement. In comparison, LX 300 is just like a wired mouse and desktop."},{"rating":"1","title":"To each his own!!","review":"Initially, I thought this was a fabulous product, but after a couple of months the mouse started 'acting up'. Changing the batteries only helped for a short while so I went back to using my corded mouse and keyboard. I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So good..I bought a second one","review":"I purchased one of these for our office manager. it worked so good, I bought one for my home use. I have used now for 3 months with absolutely no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I already purchased one for myself a few months ago. This one was a gift for my sister in law. She's a computer wiz and didn't have a wireless one. She is blown away with the special features & hot hey options that come built in.Installation is a breeze and the overall use is wonderfully simple. The advantage of wireless will make you want to throw your traditional keyboard and mouse out the window. I am talking to my boss to see if we can get these for everyone in my office. Buy with confidence as this is a great product from a great company. Bravo Logitech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time!","review":"When I got the lx300 from logitech it was working great especially with games.

We only used the keyboard and tossed the mouse in the trash as we had another option to use there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mouse is excellent, keyboard design is a bit messy","review":"Well, the logitech wireless mouse and keyboard is realy cool. the black color is eye catchy and the mouse sensitivity is excellent. the keyboard is very good too, with a lot of controls, but i would have preferred keys with softer touch and a better design to rest my hadds. u can do away with the extra wrist rest though, and then it works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Watching this dvd is like going hawkwatching without a telescope and see all birds far away.

Thats why they created a frustrated, unwanting game that everybody's waiting & dying to buy it! But when it comes to put up or shut up, then they get tired of it because it lacks & it sucks! This game gets so boring easily they even do a shortcut to get rid of this game & you know how they do it? They crush it with utensils, thats what they do!

The CPU's act like child like crap & hardly ever fight you in the ring. They'll take advantage of you though if another dude hits you from \\"behind\\" like a motherf^^king coward that he is or make a mistake & crap like that. I played The Rock against a created supertstar & I got my ass whipped by that dude & he pinned me 1-2-3 for the pin fall & I was pissed off. If you have temper problems like me, then don't even buy this game at all. I broke this disc in half & threw it at the poster of Vince McMahon that money hungry motherf**ker.

WWF always made great games but now they've changed the title. That means Vince & THQ decide to make lousy baby games for now on with WWE crap.

Smackdown vs. Raw is on the PS2, and the sixth time's the charm.The Smackdown games were godly creations if you were a wrestling fan, but they just got better.Smackdown vs. Raw is the complete package. It has a solid career mode, where all the characters have voice-overs from their respective Superstars (except for you, what you say is STILL captioned). It also has a variety of different matches that dig deep into WWE's history, while still getting the more recently added matches into the picture. Also, if you have an Ethernet modem that can hook up to your PS2, Smackdown vs. Raw has Online capabilities.Overall, Smackdown vs. Raw stretches the greatness of wrestling.

If you're a Mudvayne fan, then get, L.D. 50, The Begining Of All Things To End, The End Of All Things To Come, & Lost & Found! The music is more important than this WWE whatever you call it.

This game isn't even close to that like Here Comes The Pain had. Even with Shut Your Mouth had a hell lot of offerings than that tarnish SvR 1 crap. SvR 2006(formely known as part 2) had more advance over this one & can't say likely that this game right here doesn't have that. Most of all, this game should of been improved like their older stuff that had been in past WWE games, but no, just new boring material crap which reeks & definately sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything could be possible, but not with this.","review":"You have to wonder that THQ & Vince McMahon gave up on their video game WWE fans that they've sort of well mostly let them down in one shot by making this game a low rated version with post pone bad reivews. They indeed let the fans down with this crap that had to be released. It was supposed to be originally Smackdown! Word Life which would feature John Cena on the front cover & man that'll been different if they didn't change the title or stupid features in here, dang! But no, they had to do it anyways. TNA kicks more ass anyways, stick with TNA please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope to WWE that they stop making video games soon, cause I can't take this anymore.","review":"First off, I don't what happened to Vincent McMahon, after all these years with good games until this, this piece of crap had to come along out for this system! If theres one thing that I hate the most is this corny crap disc. No one here likes this game & is a bad rate quality hands down. Go buy Here Comes The Pain & Shut Your Mouth, a double packed gift for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kick this game out the window if you have,....... Don't stand there, do it now, DAMNIT!","review":"DO, NOW DAMNIT IS WHAT I MEAN NOW DO IT DAMNIT! Really, this game does need to be tossed out the window cause 4 things! Its boring, it sucks, it lacks, & its pointless to name 4 at least but theres more than just those 4 words to it. Now, everybody just need relaxation by killing this game first then you can go home & do what you normally people do. But first things first, SHOVE THIS GAME IN VINCE'S ASS!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little attention here if I say.","review":"Thats what everybody says about this game, it stinks as hell broke loose. This is why everybody sold this piece of giraffes turds back to the store where it rightfully belongs, not in your houses folks. No mistaken that what THQ created with the past WWE games, they rock! But this game isn't the sort though, this one doesn't rock your socks off, it sucks! You won't find anything interesting what this game has & no it has no fun in it, just to let you know that before you can get your hands dirty on it. Make sure your hands are clean before you even touch the poison of THQ's evil demonish shceme! Don't even buy this lacklust at all & won's hold your interest very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"WWE FANS GET BROKE WHILE VINCE & THQ GET PAID, GO FIGURE!","review":"LUCKILY FOR ME, I PLAYED THIS AT MY FRIENDS PLACE & BOY DOES THIS GAME ROT. HERE COMES THE PAIN & SVR 2006 ARE GOOD GAMES FOR WWE FANS & MYSELF AS WELL. I CAN'T BELIEVE & IMAGINE THAT VINCE & THQ GET PAID JUST BECAUSE THEY MAID A GAME THAT LET ALL OF THE WWE FANS DOWN, DON'T THEY KNOW THAT? WELL I GUESS THE OLD SAYING GOES \\"ITS ALL ABOUT THE MONEY\\", YEAH I FIGURE THAT BY NOW!! THQ & VINCE ARE MONEY HUNGRY, THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU WWE FANS. DON'T EVEN TRUST GETTING THESE GAMES FROM MONEY HUNGRY PEOPLE ANYMORE."},{"rating":"1","title":"THINK FIRST, THEN DECIDE!","review":"THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU GIVE IT UP FOR A STUPID WWE WRESTLING GAME LIKE THIS TARNISH JUNK. BEFORE YOU DO GET THIS GAME, LET ME TELL YOU THAT YOU WON'T FIND ANY ENJOYABLE THOUGHTS IN THIS GAME. ENOUGH SAID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If WWE cares about the fans so much, then how come they don't have these things that the fans want?","review":"Really, I don't get it a bit. Its like if Vince & THQ forgot without us, this game would be much worse for them to make. Not only that does the game lacks all the time but it hardly have good rates for this. Just to let y'all know that TNA is having a game soon for the PS3! Looking foward to getting that instead of WWE game crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the time of the get-go!","review":"No its not & not even a step up situation for its right price. I have no clue when or why this was released 2 years ago cause it really wasn't supposed to be released until the number of characters where in this game! Theres only 30-40 characters in this game but it was supposed to be originally way more than 70 superstars! Hell yeah it was. Not only that, but the matches where gonna include are Ambulence, Fork Lift, I Quit, & so much more but no, it stinks ass! I can't imagine why Vince & THQ would turn those things down like that as if they're ignoring the fans or something! But who cares, I like TNA anyways! Who cares about WWE, I don't need them neither does TNA whos beating WWE into a ratings. GO TNA GO!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye SvR, you're history!","review":"Thats exactly what I said and what I say always come true so don't deny what I have to say about that. You don't know whats it like to be in me & my shoes. Not to only that, but to make right decisions like to dump this game into to the dumpster of Vinces *******************!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ridences for this s^^t!","review":"Everytime you go to a match, the CPU always takes advantage of you even if you're on easy mode! That difficlty is not easy, its hard, really hard. I doesn't have standouts & sure as hell doesn't have your type of taste for gameplaying! All this is just another typical sellout game that'll make you waste your money for craps like this! I can't imagine the destruction that Vince McMahon fell to. He completely, thrown this game into flames of hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You will not be happy ever again after this!","review":"I said it correctly didn't I? What I say is always true, this game is not for you & definately not yours to hold your interests really long! Crappy graphics, gameplay, models, creations, build up, and everthing is downright ugly & pointless here! So do get games that'll hype you up, but no this. This game won't hype you up at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exterminate & destroy!","review":"The game that everyones been bargained for is coming to an end! This game will not bring you joy & peace at all. It will not even give you a chance to have everything that'll offer you at all. Nothingless, it is not optional for choosing games that'll bore you to death & having to sit your lazy butt on the couch & starting to think, what the hell am I doing? I need to get my life started again, not to destroy it! But ever since I turned this game in, I was joyful & happy that I got my credit cash back & boy I'm glad I didn't miss that game at all as I spend it for my favrorite metal band of all times, Korn! Getting that game was my big mistake of my whole life, and it'll sure ruin your life once you buy it & then you should sell it back to the store were it rightfully belongs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this game is an option, nothing else people!","review":"This game that will bring you two things only, hate & stupidity! Thats to name two at least but theres more than hate & stupidity in this game that'll bring out more anger out of your system that you wanted to break it with your clutched fists! Having to know this, but its worth saving your trouble than to cowardly hiding it! But I'll do it anyways by taking my anger out on THQ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of wacko freaks! Yeah really!","review":"Kids if you're watching this, don't try this at home, okay? Cause this game will teach you how to be a bad mannered person, and thats what happened to me because of this game right here SvR+THQ+Vince=sh^t! Thats right children, this game is for y'all children right there! For you children that are small, this is like a little toy so pay attention! Grab this toy, and shove it down in Vincent Krappy McMahon's ass like y'all never did it before!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who in the green hell are these jackasses think they are?","review":"The game is wack thanks to these jackle asses THQ and McMahon! Vince on the cover looks like he's on drugs or something and the colors are messed up on front cover! Its not even straight up correct! Its mostly red than blue when it should of been between! This game is also a joke to every person in the world here today and trying to make us like we're damngone fools or something! I can't believe Vince & THQ thought they can get rid of the stuff from other past wrestling games & put it like its some kind of side show! Thats Unbelieveable, it really is. I'm tired of baby games, this has have to stop here & now! No more will THQ & VInce gat any respect from me again! Hey THQ & Vince, if you're looking at this review, read this sign language down below!

I THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE AN INTERESTED GAME FOR SOMEONE WHO REALLY WANTS TO PLAY WITH, BUT BOY WAS I WRONG. THIS GAME CAN'T EVEN ELECTRIFY ME OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU UP! YOU THOUGHT OTHER PAST WWE GAMES COULDN'T DO IT FOR YOU, BUT THIS ONE IS BY FAR THE WORST GAME OF THE HISTORY TODAY! THE GAME HAS DEFEATED ME SO BAD I CRUSHED IT WITH MY BARE HANDS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"one word divas","review":"now i like the new dirty and clean meter but what were they thinking when they were making that season they potray the divas like slutes but very good lookin slutes and shawn micheals is hareier than a gorilla now the upper part about this game was the divas"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star only people, just so you know!","review":"Yep, only 1 star club only pals! This is for the ones who says this game is full of lack which it is. No one here wants this game anymore. I don't even think this game is worth more than 50.00 bucks! I don't give a damngone about this crap, screw this game and screw THQ with Vince too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good money, but not to use for this sh^t!","review":"You people with good money better watch yourselves! Not because of someone try to rob you, its just this game is a fraud & it only temps you to buy this game just because of a stupid commercial! It mostly temps you to spend your moeny on this crap, but keep that in mind before you're forced to get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the game I was looking for!","review":"This game is what I call boring! Not only that, its has no good features, gameplay, creations, or any other sercumstances! The game is full of crap junk & nothing else that is good! If you want a game that'll give you energy & fun, then get HCTP & SYM! Possible that you can get this game and do something else with it, like shove it in [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kick this game right in the ***!","review":"You don't even know what you'd expect to see in this game! Junk, this game is full of junk! I hate games that are junky and funky! Stupid ass THQ can't ever make anything good like they did with HCTP or SYM! We would probably never see those features never again in the future from the past!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We have to go on stike, NOW!!","review":"Lets go on strike so we can put an end to THQ's misery of game making! Them punks screwed the game up like its some cartoon network show \\"Powerpuff Girls\\"! Seriously, those clowns can't even make a good if they even try to bring HCTP back! Thats never gonna happen again thanks to crapHQ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If WCW was still alive, WWE wouldn't have no chance in hell! Mainly Vince though!","review":"WCW back in the days had much class act mature shows, but now its all gone, vanished, dissappeared, and most of a, VAPORISED!!! Thanks to Vince McMahon, he now has WCW in his hands so he told Shane to purchase WCW back in 2001 and those crappy McMahons has WCW in chains and locked up forever! I'd like WWE, but its just Vince and McMahon family that runs the whole damn show, and his style for his wrestling business is out of date than WCW's! If WCW had ever put up a big fight, which they did! Then WWE(mainly Vince) would surrender their rights, HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!! But that wouldn't happen at all now that Vince so-called killed WCW, but the wrestlers from WCW are surviving but slaved to WWE! But at least they don't have nothing to do with McMahon at least! Who cares, WCW rocks and always will!"},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"Who cares what other people have to say about good things for this game, all it is like a stupid ass Gamecube wrestling games, and thats what is all about! Theres no hiding your actions no more, so you better reveal y'alls true self and put Vince and THQ out of misery! Make'em go out of business and I don't care if WWE go's out of business, TNA is a whole lot better and more class acts than this clowny show WWC for World Wrestling Crap! I wished that WCW returns to kick not WWE wrestlers, but kick Vincent Krappy McMahons ass!!!!! How do ya like that Vince?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATING ME!!","review":"THIS GAME IS HATING ON ME, SO I TOOK IT BACK FOR MY LUTE IN RETURN! YES, THIS GAME DOES SUCK A LOT CAUSE THERES NOTHING FUN IN THIS GAME! ITS A WHOLE LET DOWN TO ME, YOU GUYS, THE SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT, AND MOST OF ALL, WWE THEMSELVES AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES VINCE AND FAMILY! THIS GAME IS LIKE A HACK THAT CAN'T EVEN GET HACKING, GET IT! HERE COMES THE PAIN WAS OFF THE CHARTS AND IT HAD GOOD EFFORTS WITH THAT GAME AND NOTHING LESS AT ALL. NOT ONLY THAT, IT HAD GOOD WWE CHARACTERS LIKE AUSTN, LESNAR, AND GOLDBERG! BUT NOW, GOLDBERG AND LESNAR WILL NEVER COME BACK AGAIN! BUT AT LEAST AUSTIN DID WITH SVR 2006! ALTHOUGH, DON'T PHRASE JUST BECAUSE HE'S BACK CAUSE HE'S NOT EVEN IN THIS GAME!

I felt that after this one they did not improve too much on the series and it just did not grab my attention anymore.

Those where off the chain! But you can't go stage to stage to stage no more, that reeks! Plus theres only one backstage place but theres not much fun about it! Not only that, theres no title matches in exhibition mode, that really reeks! Remeber I Quit and Lumberjack matches? Those where the best matches ever to set foot in the WWE games! But Lumberjack only lasted in SYM & HCTP! Same thing with I Quit, that only lasted in Selftitled Smackdown!, KYR, JBI, & SYM!

The story mode in this game is also out to date, but SvR 2006 is a lot better. Also to tell you the truth, this game doesn't ever hype me up like part 2 does!

Whats funny or not is you spend your money and waste it for just crap like this. You would never have an opportunity to having to give in or out for this game, but I prefare give out. This game won't give you energy at all and it certainly won't have much of your time neither! So do this and walk out, this is the part of this game you won't like! Trust me, this is nothing like Here Comes The Pain, the past WWE games or SvR 2006!

The original version is something like 6:00, so there's nearly two minutes missing from the song. Otherwise, most of the must-have Heaven 17 songs are here, but all the shortest versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uccchhh, they called these three \\"the talented ones\\"!","review":"I ask that because the male lead singer of one of the '80's best contributers to the synth-pop genre, Human League, said that on the audio liner notes portion of their \\"Very Best Of\\" album. The three former members of this group left in the early '80's and formed their own music group, being Heaven 17. I'm sorry to say that, having listened to this album one night this past week, I find the CD's entire song selection, in my opinion, to leave a whole lot to be desired. I don't even remember any of the titles, and I can't understand how any of these purely mediocre tunes ever could have been a hit in any country. That is essentially it for me, the reason I didn't give this album only one star is that, thankfully, it's not the absolute worst I've ever heard. I don't think that my taste in music could possibly be that bad, I've got taste, decency, dignity, integrity, and a reputation to uphold after all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Milestone Book","review":"This book has contributed more to the understanding of myth and the passing of time than anything since Robert Graves' works. It is a difficult book to read. But, the implication of the authors, that astrology/astronomy and the passage of time were the 'grand backdrop' for all of human history, has profound meaning to all who study it. As mankind passes from one Great Age to the next, he is charged with reinventing himself and the cosmos. The changes hold until the next Great Age, when chaos sweeps away the old systems, and once again all is made anew. This theme echos back through time, we find it most everywhere in the world, in the myths and tales of every people. One of the most important books of the twentieth century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myths and astronomy","review":"I first learned about this book in Graham Hancock's Fingerprints of the Gods. De Santillana has a way with words but the thread comes through that all myths worldwide speak of the same event: the Precession of the equinoxes. Myth is like the language of dreams: though apparently nonsensical, it tells of something beyond the meaning of its words or images. But still, where does the knowledge of the precession of the equinoxes come from? De Santillana does not delve into this mystery, leaving it perhaps to Hancock and Sitchin to solve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked Structure","review":"There more than enough interesting material here for a good book.

Too often many of us confuse talent with genius. I prefer to elevate under appreciated works like, The Man Without Qualities; better yet listen to Berg or Varese. The \\"Theory\\" of Post-Modernism is just the playing out of inovations stipulated by the \\"Modernist\\" movment in The Western classical music tradicion (either that or Mallerme and Duchamp). Unfortuantly the Dutch language is under appreciated. If you can find a translation (or know Dutch), read J.C. Bloem. I was prompted to set this review by going over other ones present here. I must say out of them all, I think the best remark was the fictious paper title:\\"Finnegan's Wake: I Understood the Whole Thing\\". All and all, I find Post-Modernism highly bankrupt. I for one get tierd of read some architectonic work about the \\"qoutidian\\" world (Pynchon fits in here). And by the way Tom, that recluse act was best done by a more entertaining author, B. Traven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read other Pynchon, please.","review":"This is his first book, he was young, mid-twenties. Of course, it's pynchon, so it's STILL a great book, but all his others are more evolved and thought out. Here, he starts dealing with his classic themes: obscure place, allegories, fractured characters, dark humor, cyclical time, relative space, etc.The problem is, it's confusing in a naive, over-zealous way. (Unlike gravity's rainbow or mason & dixon, which are confusing in an ultra-rational way) Pynchon's technique in all his novels is to create an experience that becomes a consciousness through reading, instead of linearly narrating a story, he gives us impressions only, and a truth evolves. The truth becomes part of the reader, not just part of the pages or the author. It's like pynchon lets the reading write the novel as the novel goes along.Pynchon is a genius, he will change your life. Just don't start with V."},{"rating":"1","title":"?????????","review":"Ridiculously convoluted tale held together by the most tenuous coincidences. As for the \\"message\\" of the book: you tell me.

If I had any criticism of this book, it would be that there wasn't enough of it. I wanted to know more of Vheissu and of Mondaugan and the many players who, put together, made V. into flesh. Gravity's Rainbow was more than I needed, but V. made me hungrier. Maybe that's the beauty of the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read almost anything else by him","review":"As somebody who holds Gravity's Rainbow in the highest regard - and no, I'm not in higher education - I have to admit that this one defeated me. It had some good bits up until the point where I gave up, including a stomach-churning description of a nose job, but compared to Pynchon's later stuff (and indeed earlier stories) the prose is clunky and unwieldy. Significance is all over the place. It's not especially funny. If it were by anybody else, I might have rated it higher, but I don't think (and neither, apparently, does the author) that it's up to his highest standard. One day I'll finish it, but if you're a Pynchon beginner, I wouldn't start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed and funny","review":"To borrow a Tolkien-ism, I have a cordial dislike for symbolism. Put another way, I don't mind it being there, but like fins on a car, I don't want it to get in the way of driving the thing with the top down and the wind whistling through my hair.And \\"V\\" is like that -- a breezy and high-spirited ride, symbolism or no. That's why I think all the grad-student rhapsodizing in the collected reviews here are a disservice to Tommy P.'s \\"V\\".Sure, there is symbolism galore in \\"V,\\" but it is nowhere near as goose-steppingly intrusive as you would guess from what you read here. Matter of fact, the book, while containing ample evidence of its author's youth, is fast, funny, and accessible.Read the book. Give it a chance and it will catch you; it will move you in strange and spooky ways. Years after reading \\"V\\" I still remember scenes like the wreckage of a Greek island, or Pynchon's unerringly funny slapstick, often set around one his many Profane dopplegangers.Read \\"V\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT ~~~ but readable - no","review":"Brilliant writer, amazing complexity, symbolism galore. Call me crazy, isn't readability supposed to enter in here somewhere. Its just not an enjoyable read. Having read other great 20th century writers like Mahfouz, Kawabata, Marquez, Saramago, Hesse(to name a few), I find this book unreadable and fragmented. I get that Pynchon is brilliant but in my opinion his brilliance is gained at the sacrifice of simple good story telling. Can't there be a marriage of the two? Maybe it captures the essence of 20 th century apathy, but I found myself not caring a lick what happened to any of the characters or the plot. Ultimately causing me to set the book aside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written, but who cares?","review":"On almost every page I encountered passages of beautiful, witty, amazingly written prose. But, after about 200 pages, I just couldn't care less about any of the characters, or what happened to them. I am a well-educated person and have read most of the classic \\"western canon\\". I appreciate many \\"modern\\" authors like Marquez, Roth, Walker Percy, Bellow, Updike, Joseph Heller, etc. But I find that my life is too short to persevere with Mr. Pynchon when I neither like or dislike the characters and couldn't care less what happens to them. Based on my experience with this book I have shied away from Delillo since they are always compared similarly. All you guys who believe Pynchon is a great 20th century author can have him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Reading V I found myself thinking 'Who's Pynchon writing to?' Then I'd realize I'd been thinking about what's for dinner instead of being involved in the story.The guy's certainly not writing to me.Pages would pass when I'd discover a new character was introduced somewhere back in the chaos.I guess this stuff is over my head.I'm not being daft. I'd even give it another shot but if this is Pynchon's 'accessible' stuff, I'm in trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God for the last chapter","review":"I like this book. After I read the last chapter I loved the thing. It's not the most compelling read as you're going through, and half of the time I was asking myself \\"why keep reading?\\"...Then I finished the book (more importantly the last chapter) and it was as if a switch had been flipped in my head, the whole book is wonderfully collaborative and makes complete sense. The only problem was getting to that particular point.It is quite the opposite of what happens when I usually read a book, you don't want it to end, and when it does you're disappointed.I sincerely wanted this book to end while I was reading it, and once I was finished I wanted to re-read it because it was so refreshing and it just makes sense. If it weren't for the end I'd have given it three stars, and if it weren't for the rest I'd have given it five, go figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Small characters that stand for too-big ideas.

His music is all heart, and you can hear that in every line he sings. His style of music is the pinnacle of singer-songwriters.

I'm very \\"classic country\\" and somehow this didn't appeal to that thread in me. I like gritty, but I also love melody and this cd somehow missed it on combining the two.

I'm totally satisfied with the song, thus the CD was worth it for me. Unfortunately, nothing else in the collection impressed me much. It's a matter of taste I'm sure. Some folks will love it.

After much discussion, we concluded it is a liberterian O/S. It's all about freedom and responsibility. You can't have one without the other. As to this book, it's full of lies and outdated, over-simplified examples. I had to double check to see if it was written by the same people who now run the Democratic Party as it tries to make its feeble point by spreading fear and misinformation.Granted, Unix isn't for everybody. Neither is driving a car. That's why we have Macs and busses. I challenge any of you out there who dislike Unix to take one of my classes.

While it certainly not even nearly \\"genius\\" much less in the realm of great YA literature, it isn't awful. The sad thing is that it is actually a very mediocre book-- it is just that the subject matter-- a gay teen novel not going into over kill on the angst element-- hasn't yet been exploited, so the book, on first look, seems to be more than it is. But the writing is very middle of the road, as is the naive and slightly silly 'optimism' presented here. The book is sadly, in the end, a very mediocre piece of literature. It is a lesson in that mediocrity can be masked by the right packaging, topics of shock, hype or marketing hook."},{"rating":"1","title":"lighthearted snooze","review":"The immediate feel to this book is warmth and joy. You love all the fun, interesting characters and how life is grand. Then after about 50 pages, that wears off. The remainder is boy loves boy drivel for about 150 pages that borders on boring. Though nice to see an optimistic gay teen novel, this one was hard to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Appropriate","review":"The setting is a fantasy world where everyone in the high school is 100% accepting of gayness. One of the characters is a drag queen football star, for instance. However, except for a brief kiss, there is absolutely no sex. As an adult, this book was pretty boring. But I kept thinking about a gay teenager reading this and how upsetting it would be. There's no emotional truth: the kids don't want for money; they're all artistic; they speak like adults; they listen with deep empathy over herbal tea. I don't know any teens like this and it breaks my heart to imagine a gay teen reading this balderdash while all his girlfriends are going sex crazy over the Twilight books. Straight girls get sex hungry vampires and gay boys get, what, dinner and a movie?This is too light to be of interest to adults and too devoid of truth or sex to be of interest to teens.I would recommend Boys on the Rock instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's mmmkay","review":"It's good if you are about 12.

No such luck--it was a meaningless, not even faintly enjoyable bit of fluff. The gay paradise-type world that Levithan creates isn't cute or funny. It's just annoying.And so is the rest of the book.Why is it that GLBT novels for teens are so focused on confronting the issue of HOMOSEXUALITY that they forget the other essential elements of good fiction--namely plot and at least semi likable,well-developed characters?Oh, and good writing would be nice too.Boy Meets Boy has none of these.Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fantasy Novel That Pretends to be Real","review":"If I wanted to read a total fantasy novel, I would pick up another author.

The way they had a group narrate this it became a play that I couldn't hit pause on. The main reader was amazing and engaging but the whole thing was dynamic with just enough touches of music to make you want to be there with them. Paul was such a teen in the way he handled relationships, which was what he was supposed to be. Noah; I wanted to be best friends with him in high school. Vague spoiler sentence: When Paul got his bad note, I cried, and when Noah showed his four pictures I cheered and cried. In the end I wanted to be there longer.

A place where sexuality is accepted, where the Boy Scouts become Joy Scouts after the boy scouts decided gays weren't accepted, and where acceptance is unconditional.This is the first of David Levithan's book that I've read and I will definitely be reading more! His writing is witty and humorous, and the characters just came to life off the page. Boy Meets Boy is just a really fun teen romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Worth Staying Up Late to Finish...","review":"This book will steal your heart. Paul, the central character, lives in a town that represents the world as it should be, and as we all wish it could be. Infinite Darlene is the prom queen and the high school quarterback; the Boy Scouts became the Joy Scouts once the Boy Scouts rejected homosexuals; and Paul has known he was gay since kindergarten, when his teacher wrote in his report card that \\"Paul is definitely gay.\\" This is a charming, wonderful, sweet, enchanting book. You'll root for Paul and Noah the whole time. I couldn't put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gay kid's Narnia...","review":"I got this audio book on a whim after reading the descriptions. For one, yes, some of the actors, especially the narrator, verge on annoying. I suppose it's the unrealistic optimism and hope that exudes from every word. However, looking past the almost child-like whining, you get a sense of what life is like if you were born \\"normal\\" by today's standards. Growing up gay can be one of the hardest things for any youth, especially as it seems harder and harder to suppress yourself. High school can be a cold, unforgiving place for those that fit in, and shockingly bad for those with a secret to hide.I think this book offers a glimmer of hope, if not a way to escape into the fantasy of living your life without judgement or persecution. If you're an open, caring parent, buy this for your son or daughter, gay or straight. Let them know that their actions can help make someone's life easier, just by accepting who they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Only Life Was Really Like This...","review":"My literature professor recommended this book, and I actually really enjoyed it. The fact that the teens are openly gay and the rest of the high school kids couldn't care less is fascinating. I love it! I wish it were really like that.

I would give it 5 stars except that after a year I'm noticing a little bit of rust on the bottom. But they're near the sink and getting wet a lot, so this may not happen if you're using it as a spoon rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I purchased this for my daughter's Human Anatomy class, thinking that it would assist her with her dissection. She didn't even use it after opening it to check information. She stuck with her Gray's Anatomy (Student's edition). Unless you just really like long, drawn-out explanations, this is not the text for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues...","review":"This book was pretty cool. Max Allan Collins was commissioned to write three books initially so this will be his last one, and probably the series last one if it doesn't sell well. Unlike 'Skin Game', it wraps up most of the loose ends from the show. What the snake cult is after? What part Max plays? It still leaves a couple of items open and even throws an unexpected curve at the end. Overall, not a bad addition to the Dark Angel collection, but it probably isn't Collins best work as he cut it short (about 260 pages, he was probably trying to get the contract over with) and it occasionally shows that he's not a big Dark Angel fan or 'true believer' as Stan Lee would say. Worth buying for hardcore fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark angel rules!!!","review":"The tv series was cancelled and left many questions unanswered so I think it\`s good to have a closure.

She is also a big fan of Jonathon Swift.Things start looking up, as the serial killer in the last episode, a shapeshifter, actually ended up taking out Logan's virus.However, a gang then kidnaps Logan, and things go crazy.It seems that the problem with centuries-spanning breeding cults, is, well, that they are a cult. Made up of people. With politics, power plays, etc.The transgenics do not have this issue, and are able to use factional splits, and even Ames White, via his missing son, to cause a lot of problems for the Familiars.Freaky prophecies about comets bringing death plagues are perhaps not too likely, either, they should keep in mind for the future.A fun book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Angel: After the Dark","review":"If you love Dark Angel then you will love this book.

I found the characterizations very true to those in the TV series. I was, however, quite disappointed in how quickly, easily, and unbelievably Max's deadly virus was \\"cured\\". With such a large part of the TV show working around that, I was unsatisfied with the solution especially since the best part of the show was the way Max & Logan had to dance around each other. There was not enough build-up to the solution in the book series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Lifting Deal Ever.","review":"Purchased for $349 with free super saver shipping. This is an awesome piece of equipment with incredible quality, even at twice the price. Dip and pull-up bars included which saves space and money. If you add the high low pully, matching utility bench, barbell & weight, and a set of dumbells you suddenly have a very respectable hard-core gym. The grey baked on paint is prone to scraping when moving the spotting arms, but the scratches are silver, so hardly noticable. Still, this is the best power rack for the money-a steal at $349 shipped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Here's the deal. The movie is very plot heavy and happens in a high school scenario. It has more to do with the origin of Ichi's skills and propensity for violence, along with his sexual fascination with death. It isn't a gore fest, and is only suggested for those who enjoyed Ichi as a story and not an excercize in gratuitous violence. I enjoyed Ichi because of the plot first, and the gore second. If you're looking for a movie that is realistically violent, but you don't care about gore, go find Flower of Flesh and Blood. You'll love it. However, if you enjoy the characters and story of Ichi the Killer, and don't feel that you NEED all the gore, go ahead and give this a buy, it's superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment.","review":"When I first learned of this movie, I was ecstatic to be able learn about Ichi's past and how he became Ichi the Killer. Unfortunately, this movie was a complete let down.The quality of the film was very cheap and amateur, and its focus didn't really seem to be about Ichi at all. What seemed to be the main focus was another character's insecurities about his strengths and reputation of being a tough guy (the story was extremely weak). This movie barely touched on Ichi's development into a killer and I regret ever buying this and watching it.If you are a fan of Ichi the Killer, I strongly suggest you stay away from Ichi-1. If you're not a fan of Ichi the Killer or don't even know what that is, you should avoid this movie too."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"The only reason I gave this movie one star is because amazon won't let us go into negatives. It is appalling that Ichi the Killer's reputation as an amazing gore-fest from an amazing director is tarnished with this horrendous prequel. It looks like a young child went to school with mommy's camcorder and asked people to pretend for a little while. The fight scenes are laughable, the gore is non-existent and the only relatively bloody scene doesn't happen until the last minute of the film. For fans of Ichi the Killer: STAY AWAY! For fans of crap: enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what were to happen if a retarded asian made a film","review":"well, it would be this film.one of the worst movies, if not the worst, movie i have ever seen. miike is one of my favorite directors of all time...if i were him i would not only take this film as a insult, but also possibly kill the director and eat his innards.if you are retarded: BUY THIS FILM NOW!

This particular flavor resembles frosted and chalky, crumbly drywall with a layer of pink paste in the center. Heated it's a little softer but not much better. As one reviewer pointed out, it's a lot of calories and sugar for something that doesn't really taste that great. If I am going to have junk food I will at least pig out in style and get something tastier!

I know many people are angry that songs like Eaten Alive, Pieces of Ice, Up Front, Touch by Touch, Telephone, All of You, So Close, Dirty Looks, Tell Mama, Mr. Lee and Shockwaves aren't included, but after a few times of playing the album; the songs included on the album works just fine without them. Swept Away, Chain Reaction, Muscles, Missing You, Why Do Fools Fall in Love, Mirror Mirror and the solo version of Endless Love are all great, but what surprise me were the songs from her '87 critically acclaim album-Red Hot Rhythm & Blues. The 5 songs from this album are great to listen to. Tell me Again, Summertime, Selfish One, Cross My Heart and It's Hard for Me To Say should have made Red Hot Rhythm & Blues a major hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"RCA 1981-87 -- All For You ----------Not!","review":"I've read the previous reviews and I agree with most of them. Diana went to RCA which to many fans would condider a \\"music wasteland\\". Just glancing at this collection says it all.I did find out what many people were wondering: All For You duet with Julio. The song was released as a COLUMBIA single instead of RCA; thus RCA did not own the rights to the song. If Diana ever did the duet with JULIO live, then they should have included it here. Does anyone know if a live track exists?If you have her box set then you don't need this collection. Her RCA years should of been better and I did not blame her for going back to MOTOWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Pieces Of Ice\\" is missing!","review":"The liner notes for this compilation CD admit that the single \\"Pieces Of Ice,\\" was the highest charting single from Diana Ross's 1983 RCA album \\"Ross,\\"...and yet it is nowhere to be found on this collection disc! Instead we get \\"Love Or Lonlieness,\\" an album track that was not even released as a commercial single. The fact that \\"Pieces Of Ice,\\" a brilliant, spooky track, is missing is a real disappointment...only made worse by the fact that the original CD is out of print! This compilation was a fan's last hope for \\"Pieces Of Ice,\\"...but no such luck. No wonder the 1983 CD \\"Ross\\" sells for $50 to $100 a piece on eBay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the hits?","review":"I give this 1 star only because it is Diana Ross. Diana herself, of course, is a five. But, the adults at RCA must have been on vacation and let the children take over when this hits compilation was put together. That is the only explanation for such a poor RCA greatest hits package. It is missing WAY TOO MANY hits. While all of the LP tracks are fair to good on this compilation, they are not the best LP tracks and certainly not the hits. When are record companies going to start putting THE HITS on greatest hits and best of packages? That is what the consumer wants, not the record company's idea of what they think is best. Diana is still supreme but this RCA supposed-hits package is better left in the bargain bin. You are better off getting her complete RCA albums on compact disc, even though some are difficult to find. RCA should take tips from Motown which has done a much better job of compiling her Motown material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avid listener","review":"Whilst Miss Ross' stint at RCA was a relativley short one she did make some great records there with a lot of them being absent from this enjoyably about average album.

Ok so who agrees: where is Dirty Looks,Stranger In Paradise,Sweet Surrender, Crime Of Passion, Shine, i could go on.

Diana has admitted not being able to remember the hits of some of her Supremes days, so maybe its omission is all for the best, as she would be forced to own up to it in concert and probably does not have the recall at her age to do so. Some of her fans who bought such a 'Greatest Hits' compilation may expect it-even if, arugably, it was not one of her classics. Its mere appearance on a Greatest Hits set does make it somewhat mandatory for concerts, though, and my intuition tells me that \\"Pieces of Ice\\" is something she would rather forget-even if it was progressive '80s music. On the brigher side, classics \\"Muscles\\" and Daryl Hall's \\"Swept Away\\" are here though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Overview","review":"If you want to know about Diana's 5 albums with RCA, here it is; the overview.

The book also gives a very candid look at the breed's pros and cons.

(And yes I am partial to Boxers.)The book contains some great insights into the peculiarities of the breed's behavior and the writing style is not only informative without it being over-bearing, it can at times be funny and has provoked a giggle once or twice.

There are stories of breastfeeding adopted children, older children and triplets. There are stories about the pressure to breastfeed versus bottlefeed, breastfeeding while you work and learning how to breastfeed.

The second insert recommended that I contact iriver via e-mail if I had a problem. I did contact them, over a week ago, still no response! The product is terrible! It copied my whole MY documents file. I tried to delete it, it wouldn't allow me to do so. Now, when I return the product for a FULL refund, I have to make sure the salesperson can delete my files in the H10. Also, EVERY time I tried to download files, it froze my computer! Absolutely the worst! Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first player. Experienced no problems.","review":"While I wasn't ecstatic about receiving an iRiver (I wanted an Ipod), once I started using it I really loved it. It works well with Windows media player, I didn't have to download any software and moving around the menu is extremely easy. I didn't have the charging and battery problems everyone else had, but maybe that's because I read the manual. You don't have to connect to the computer to charge it; you need only connect the mp3 side of the usb cable to your player and THEN connect the ac adapter to player/wall. The only thing I needed to do to my player was update the firmware, which was easy if you can follow directions. Songs aren't always played in order (kind of annoying), but not so much that it ruined my experience with the player.

This means you are forced to used Windows Media Player 10 in order to sync files with the player. When you do try to sync albums to the H10, they do not automatically play in order.The time and date on the player was always a day or two off. This is a silly bug that should've been caught before they released this product.The sad part is the iRiver has released firmware fixes for their International and Asian version of H10, but they completely ignored the USA version. How can iRiver release a product like this and expect it to compete with such products as the Creative Zen Micro or Apple iPod?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORST MP3 PLAYER EVER","review":"I've had several mp3 players for about 4-5 years now.

Then one day all the mp3s on it just dissapeared!!

They clearly do not have answers to the problems with playlists, etc. My inquiries via email have been unanswered.It is clear that the product was prematurely launched to coincide with the Napster to Go campaign.It is a nice paperweight, if you can afford to spend over $250 for a paperweight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Great - But Deeply Flawed","review":"Beware!This is a great-looking player - sleek, color screen, and so forth. But, as of this writing, it has serious flaws in functionality and sound.- Any significant bass distorts when using my Koss Portapro headphones (I've used them for many other players with no problems). I'm not talking thunderous bass - just typical stuff, with equalizer set flat.- Player only lists (and plays) songs alphabetically, rather than by track numnber, which has proved to be even more annoying than I thought it would.- Player can take a long time to skip from one song to the next.It is possible that these problems will be fixed by a firmware upgrade (that does not yet exist). It is possible that they cannot be fixed by firmware, or that iRiver will simply choose not fix them.

I installed Windows Service Pack 1 (as suggested by Auto Support) and still nothing. I went to download the latest firmware but when I installed it, now my computer couldn't recognize it.2) Also this player is supposed to be a hard drive too, but auto support stated that ALL the files have to be transfered using Windows Media Player. I think that's really gay and it's a classic example of battles between corporations. iPod is the same way since you have to use iTunes to transfer anything to it. Microsoft wants to make you dependent on their software. In my opinion, Windows Media Player is a low quality program full of garbage advertising ads. Winamp and DivX are wayyyyyyyyyy better!!!I would look for a better alternative (avoid anything with the letter i)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, awful","review":"I bought this because I wanted a cool MP3 player. Ugh, bad move, should've got the iPod mini or the Rio Carbon. From day one I've been having problems with this skipping. I'm not even moving the unit, and it skips. WTF? I pressed the reset button more times than I could count. The website states that players skip. Okay, well then the least you could do is add a decent hard drive, not one that is cheap. Now, I can't do anything but listen to the FM tuner or view photos. I formatted the hard drive (2nd time), and now all the player displays is this Chinese lingo I can't understand. I'm returning it, and hopefully this was a bad apple. What sucks even more is that they sell like hotcakes, so it will probably take another week for me to get one. If the next player still skips, then I'm buying a Rio Carbon. Hey, iRiver, why don't you make decent hard drives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to love it!","review":"But now its gone bad!!

It froze on the boot up screen, after waiting only ten minutes for technical support we went through various fixes before I was again informed that I had a bad unit.I'm now returning the units for a refund. I don't have any confidence in the quality of the H10 and it doesn't help that included in the paperwork is an orange flier with \\"STOP\\" typed on it, instructing you to contact iRiver support before returning the product.

If you're thinking about an iriver... don't bother. I've been SO disappointed with this little booger of an mp3 player.

I have a constant reoccurring problem where the device will hang when you select a song or playlist. The hourglass (initializing) will remain until the unit runs down the battery. The only solution is to reinstall the firmware which also deletes all your files. You have to use Windows Media Player to transfer and sync files. WMP is clumsy to use. It is not user friendly at all. Anyway, after the firmware reinstall it will work for a while and then just start hanging again.

He came onto the stage singing \\"More\\" in that powerful voice that caused goosebumps and ended the night with \\"Softly As I Leave You\\" which could bring tears to your eyes.Some thirty years later (1994) I was once again able to attend an in person performance by John. The audience was comprised of people of all ages but, I believe, most of them were fans from the very beginning of his career. There were many with those twenty and thirty year old LP's waiting in line for an autograph.Was so pleased to find some of his albums on CD's through Amazon.com and hope there will be more in the future.If you purchase one of his CD's, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wonderful voice of John Gary","review":"Anyone who appreciates a beautiful singing voice will appeciate these cd's by John Gary.

I was 12 years old and was then, and still am, a music lover with very conservative tastes. I concur with many of the other reviewers that there is not nearly enough John Gary CDs out there. This one is a good start. It is contains my absolute favorite of John's songs, \\"Unchained Melody\\". Anytime that I felt the need to convert a friend to John's type of music, that was the one I used. They were doomed! It always worked. The rest of the collection is wonderful, and would be an asset to anyone's collection. And, I wholeheartedly agree with several of the other reviewers in the request to Lee or RCA or whomever, please release John's Carnegie Hall album and his Christmas album. My old LPs have been played almost to extinction! I will always cherish those lucky times over the years that I was able to see him in person. He was a gracious and dear man.

Nu metal has passed, and Metal-core has failed. With that in mind, the sound of Seemless goes beyond today's standards of instrumental music. Which has probably reached an all time low. Think of it this way, if Soundgarden was known for being the second coming of Led Zepplin, then Seemless could be known as the second coming of Soundgarden. However, Seemless is a group that mixes all that is right for rock, and combines it with their own sound. So you now have a band that will and should build its own legacy, such as the previous bands mentioned did.

I thought that one song was extremely impressive, but the rest of the album left me hanging almost all of the time, and Leach's vocals never reached the extreme limits that they once did.

Its sounds like Godmack playing on Qotsa's equipment...this would fit in better on the radio alongside Staind and Creed, which is not to say that there aren't some good elements of this album, but overall this is simply mediocre AOR radio rock. You could consider this an extension of bands influenced by the Seattle sound, Qotsa, and Sabbath that just don't have the original or artistic slant of it's predecessors!

It is a sturdy rack and a lot better than the ones I've seen from other manufacturers. A couple of points that I can make about it are that the hitch bolt/pin is longer than I'd expect it to be for a hitch this size. About an inch and half protrudes pass the opposite side of the hitch. The rubber piece which slides over the pin on the opposite end is a good idea however. The cotter pin seems a bit flimsy but will do the job. Another issue I found was related to the straps. They were coated with a heavy wax. Although washing in hot water and soap did the trick of removing it, I wonder why it's was used in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bike rack for $.","review":"This is the best bike rack I could find for the price.

Very few metal parts, and lots of thin plastic ones, just waiting to break. I had to pry the cassette out of the holder - I couldn't even make the retention mechanism \\"let go\\".

The color of the juice and flavor were amazing. I have been looking for this in the US and when I found this product on Amazon, I had to order it. It arrived and when I opened it, I noticed the color was brown and not the deep red pictured on the product page. When I tasted it, while not spoiled, it tasted more like really sour grapefruit juice than blood orange.

I found this book by Shusterman to be very entertaining and compelling, until it got to the end. I felt that at the end it all kind of fell apart and became truly unrealistic. I am writing this review to show my sixth period class how to do an online review. I think it's an excellent way for students to do real-world publishing and share their opinions with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Side of Nowhere","review":"This science fiction novel is written in informal style. The story is told from the point of view of the main character, Jason. The contemporary setting is a small U.S. town named Billington. The theme is: what being human really means. Young adult readers would identify with Jason at the beginning of the story when he feels that he lives in a dull town where nothing exciting ever happens. This soon changes as exciting facts are revealed to him. Even his ordinary parents are not what they appear to be. The main conflict is man against himself. Jason and other characters in the novel must ultimately decide whether to remain human or prepare to join the Warrior Fools in their alien take over of the world. This book would probably appeal to reluctant readers. The fun of seeing the mystery unravel provides enjoyable recreational reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"This book was really great. I borrowed it from the library and read it in one night. I just couldn't put it down. I think if anyone wants an exciting book they should read this one. After reading it, I just had to get it.

How he seemed to be able to describe a normal teenager's life..until Jason discovers something so different from his little boring town, Billington. This story is so great because it keeps u reading it. After every sentence, you want to read another until you get to finishing a chapter..then you want to read the next.

Really, Clyde doesn't even play himself very well, but he's a circus performer not an actor. His duplicious assistant undercuts him at every turn, loosing a lion on him while some unexplainably present children gawk, and engaging in some unnecessary animal cruelty. Is any animal cruelty actually necessary? Clyde's aloofness with his gal is amusing, and the scene where he tames a cage full of dozens of animals (even bears) at once is certainly impressive.

It is ten years or so later, and Nancy is just as silly, affected and garishly gauche as ever. Her relatives and acquaintences tiring of her sponging off them, she takes a position as a paid companion and has various adventures.

Read it, and you'll know a lot more a bout Sonny Bono."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Sonny Bono has done it again in this funny book. To me, he's never stopped me from laughing at him because I have seen his variety show with Sonny and Cher and I can't stop laughing at him. He does have quite a sense of humor. He and Cher have been one of my favorite singers from the 60's/70's, even if I'm only 29 years old. I was introduced to Cher in 1998 or so before he died, I think. I did get to see her when she was doing the Farewell Tour in New Mexico, so the drive wasn't that far from my state. The reason I said not far was because I do live in the 4 Corners. I am an avid reader so I do enjoy the music history from the 50's - 70's and it stops there so yes, I do know a lot and enjoy it but I have lost touch of it lately sadly but I haven't lost my touch. This was a funny read but it does make me wonder what Sonny would've thought about his daughter turning into a man.

He really lets loose on Cher as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Riveting Moments","review":"Difficult, erratic, brilliant--Nina Simone is all those things. Her recorded work is also a testament to the fact that popular music does not have to be bland, market-tested or safe. It also needn't be too pretty. Nearly every track on this compilation album has a kind of edginess about--even jazz standards like \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\\" or a sunny hippie anthem like \\"I Got Life.\\" Several tracks here were culled from a live performance recorded the day after Martin Luther King's assassination. Her readings of \\"Sunday In Savannah\\" and \\"Mississippi Goddam\\" take on a particularly riveting quality in light of that event. Simone's righteous anger is contagious...even 34 years after the fact. This CD is a good introduction to the work of a major artist. Both her unique way with a standard like \\"I Loves You Porgy\\" and her more politicized sensibility, represented by the Martin Luther King \\"trilogy,\\" are well represented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent involved plot.","review":"However the writing style is rather amateurish.

This is Grace Slick and Paul Kantner at their very best - political, poetic, and just plain weird.Of course, it takes shots at the expected government and church alike, as the first track The Ballad of the Chrome Nun 'Anytime I laugh I got religion' In the early eighties a reverend actually protested a Jefferson Starship concert because of the band's lyric implications.The second track \\"Fat\\" is a classic Grace Slick, with then unknown The Pointer Sisters on background vocals.Other great songs on this album are Harp Tree Lament, fishman, and Sketches of China.You gotta ride this music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AND I THOUGHT IT WAS NOT AVAILABLE","review":"I had just done a review of \\"Sunfighter\\" and was gloating over having this on CD, thinking it was no more. Guess I didn't scroll down enough the first time. While it's not quite up to snuff with \\"Sunfighter\\" it succeeds on another level by not really sounding stuck so much in an era. Sure, there's plenty of political and religious tomfoolery, but it's more general here than on Sunfighter. In a sense, it's much more of a Jefferson Starship album than Airplane. \\"Across The Board\\" is Grace's all out best rocker, bar none! There are a couple of weak tracks and the vocal mixes are muddy. Also, David Frieberg was no substitute for Marty Balin's vocal ability, but when Marty did return later on, the shmaltz factor was too much for this listener. At any rate, Frieberg sounds great at the end of \\"Sketches of China\\", where you really get to hear him. \\"Sketches of China\\" remains one of my favorite Kantner/Slick pieces. Something I'll always return to."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mind has left the building....","review":"First the negative. The digital remaster falls a tad short in dynamics.

He does treat some of the history and critical issues throughout, mostly he does this in the beginning. However, historical-critical is not his concern. Johnson effectively unfolds, in a very helpful and introductory way, the theological flow and cohesiveness of the New Testament. If you are looking for a commentary or a historical critical treatment of the text this is not your book. If you are looking for an introduction to the theological themes and structure of the New Testament that is thoroughly aware of the difficulties and limitations of the historical-critical approach yet still utilizes the method in reasonable ways this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Theological Introduction.","review":"The thing I liked about Johnson's approach in his intro to the world of the New Testament is that it is more of a theological introduction. It provides a nice variation from the standard NT Intro (such as Carson and Moo) which deals more with the text critical issues such as authorship, date, provenances, etc. Instead, Johnson deals more with the larger issues of the NT and the larger issues of each book. Not that the typical issues aren't important but Johnson's work provides a nice complement to the standard NT Intro.Johnson is Catholic, I am Protestant, however, I did not encoutner anything that I thought was unnecessarily pro-catholic or over the top. In fact, I found I agreed with most of what Johnson wrote and learned a few things in the process that greatly helped my understanding of the NT.

Second, repeat (as many as five times, no more) and take the average since the data points vary over a three pound range. This process seems to get a consistently accurate approximation of your true weight on a day-to-day basis.Do not try to repeat for more data points because the scale \\"crashes\\" and goes into a weird mode where it just starts counting up in .2 pound increments ad infinitum.

Part of the problem, at least for me, is I guessed very early on in the novel the big ending. I have never seen the movie and Im not claiming Im the most perceptive reader in the world but the author gives very obvious hints, expecially the name of the client, throughout and the ending wasnt so shocking, at least not to me.Its well written from a first person POV, the descriptions of 1959 New York put you there and I thought the characters were nicely drawn. There were some surprises and it was a fairly quick read but the big payoff at the end was the payoff I expected so it wasnt as powerful.Definitely worth the read, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very noire","review":"If you are a fan of B/W mysteries, a.k.a.

Maybe the effect would be even more shocking if it covered more details and elaborated more on the narrator's reactions and reflections.

The part that slips over your belt or pocket bends out at the slightest tug, making it not secure to your belt or pocket. The hole for sliding the clip of your tape measure in is too small for 25 ft. tapes. Just barely big enough for 16 ft.

It is. The notes can be copied, but no one will hit the tones with the same energy and timing as Kossoff.

This is most especially true about Express Pass which is now a huge ripoff. The free guide you get at the gate is really all you need. By the way, I thought Universal Studios sucked except for a few movie theme rides like Jurassic Park. My kids, however, loved the rollar coasters.

It is short, bright, and attractive, supposedly geared to kids. However, there are no basic instructions, mostly just cute ideas of things you could do if you already knew calligraphy, and those ideas are not particularly unique. Examples, at best, show complex letter forms that they haven't shown you how to do, at worse they do not match the text. For example, they recommend \\"using two pencils\\" to draw double line letters, but then picture an outline letter form that could not have been made with two pencils.

The book tells us of Emily's struggles to fill the void left after graduation, after leaving high school behind and being left behind by her friends. When I was at a point in my life where I felt that my life was empty of everything except for work, I read this book over and over again. It inspired me to fill my life as Emily filled hers, with worthwhile pursuits and interests. Betsy does make an appearance in this story, and you will find some other familar faces as well.

The plot twists are so many that it's rare anything is straight-forward, and, remarkably, it's never too much for the reader to handle. His writing is both complex and refreshingly simple. This small group of stories are all perfectly able to be read alone, but the more Jeeves and Wooster stories you read, the more interconnected you realize his works are. Bertie is delightfully dense, and Jeeves always holds up the proper feudal spirit. There is almost a deeper sort of unspoken friendship between them, Jeeves almost a parent figure. Wooster's friends (and protagonists) are also just ducky. All great, unforgettable characters, and the names are very, very British (20's-30's era). I also love the phrases that pop up throughout the dialog (And Bertie's narration). If you've never read Wodehouse, I suggest that you start, and if you have, I suggest keeping it up.

He knew the value of directness. These poems are like little jewels of human wisdom. Human Effort, I Am As I Am, Song of The Jailer, etc. There are many highlights in this book. This often maligned, overlooked poet deserves to be reread today. Many who give this book a couple honest reads will probably be impressed by the sheer poetic wonder of this volume.

This is an ability that I greatly admire in a poet, and Prevert has the gift of being able to illuminate the beauty that passes us unnoticed at all times. If you are a long time lover of great poetry or are simply looking to expand your horizons you will not be disappointed with this book. Prevert and his poetry span the entire range of humanity--the young love him as well as the old, the academic as well as the average reader. He is accessable to all, and loved by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apple Has Another Hit","review":"Apple has done it again I'm so pumped that now I can listen to my radio stations 93.9 WKYS and WPGC 95.5 on my ipod nano man this picks up everything in clarity.

I love apple but the fact that they didn't want to give me another one makes me not want to buy there product.

Creative and Sandisk both include this, and consequently a $50 add on, clunky headphone is needed to get FM reception.Obviously Apple knows they could easily and inexpensively add this to their Ipods, but I suppose since Ipods are selling like hotcakes, they feel that they can slap the cost on to the consumer.I like the product overall but it does irk me that they do this, because in effect, Apple feels it can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product with an excess of wires","review":"This remote radio works great with the station being displayed in the Nano window.

It's nice that it comes with a new pair of headphones, as my old ones had gotten worn. I hardly use the radio feature, but it's nice to have, plus absolutely seemless, like true mac stuff always is. The best feature (which never mentioned) is if you snag it, it breaks apart! Now that sounds bad, but it does it so a simple click puts it back together with no wires to break as everything is just on one side (and when put on pants or something, you'll snag anything), so it's tough as well.

I would say this is really built in with the video ipods and the nanos. This overpriced remote is just used to activate the FM tuner built in the ipods. I'm saying this because I'm comparing it with my cellphone, Nokia 7210. It has a built in radio but it can only be used when the headset is plugged in at the bottom of the phone as you would plug in this remote at the bottom of the ipod. This is also the reason why this will only work with video ipods and nanos, not with the old ipods. Because the old ipods doesn't have this fm tuners built in, only the new ipods have.And I agree with all the reviews that by using this overpriced remote all other accessories that uses the dock become useless, like the speakers with docking station."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to review - don't believe 2-3 day delivery in item listing","review":"I ordered this on 11-Jan, and figured if not on the 22nd when it was released, then I'd have it soon after - my order was updated last week to a delivery date of 11-Apr - that isn't a typo, and that's after trading emails w/Amazon staff.

Any research or offerings on Russian prisons is extreamly valuable to those interested in this subject.The video's sequences seem disjointed and thrown together, probably because of the restraints that the film crew must have been under. The video has an odd way of drawing you into the personal lives of inmates and staff, but then aburptly jerks you onto another subject.Of course the inmates have mostly positive or noncommital things to say about their situation. So, unless you can read between the lines of what the inmates are saying, you will be mislead. It helps to have correctional experience (either as a staff or inmate) to see the truth behind the words.Rarely can we witness the personal impacts of incarceration, free from media hype and stereotypes, that this video delivers.

The chapters on former UA President George H.

There is also some more pop influenced songs which I really dig like \\"Crawfish,\\" \\"Lover Doll,\\" and \\"New Orleans.\\" The only throw away track on this album is \\"Steadfast, Loyal and True.\\" It's a pretty lame song.

Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie, is trying to get RCA and BMG to take all of the unreleased takes and songs out of the RCA vaults and release them all. I hope she succeeds. Right now, Follow That Dream records and RCA have relaesed six new CDs where everything is previously unreleased material.

The song \\"In the Forest of the Dreaming Dead\\" is quite different from the rest of the release as it uses clean voices and tones down the brutality a bit.

Instead of just going through the war, this book gives you an interesting look into colonial society around the time of the revolution, allowing you to understand the mindset of our colonial ancestors as they set off 'into the whirlwind'. The book's coverage of the battles, both military and political, are extensive, and I especially enjoyed the section on the War in the South, which a lot of accounts on the revolution don't elaborate on. This book is a wonderful account of the war, bringing in all the major players and the events they orchestrated, allowing the revolution to be better understood. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the war and the politics behind it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This is simply the finest, single volume history of the American Revolution ever written.

Although not as quickly paced as Bobrick's earlier works on Russia, \\"Angel\\" is well-written and quite enjoyable. I was particularly impressed by the effort to provide background and context for the events of 1775-1783: the first 20% of the book gives information on life in the colonies and the evolving (i.e., deteriorating) relationship between Britain and the future US. The first shots at Lexington green don't appear in the book until page 117 (of 495).All the characters and events one would expect are here. I have two quibbles with the presentation: (1) It would have been nice to see more discussion of why the British gave up after Yorktown; and (2) (as with almost every book of this type published today) More maps are needed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best shades in town","review":"The Blublocker shades are the best I've ever used, and they really did it with the Viper style."},{"rating":"2","title":"He likes them!","review":"Bought these for my husband for fishing and he actually likes them.

Lisa has been shown to be fluent in the language in earlier books, but here she's as clueless as Stevie. Maybe she's just holding out on Carole. Who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was boring.It almost put me to sleep trying to read it.I have an objection.I think Max is to strict.I think the rule he has about how you have to a C-average or you can't ride.Why should he care what your grades are.Plus,why do Stevie and Carole(not Lisa,though)always worry about whether they can ride or not if they get a bad grade?All they have to do is not tell Max if they get a REALLY bad grade.I mean what does do,go snoop in your bookbag for your report card whenever your not looking.That's just plain crazy.

Anyone ever hear of editing? Her chapters from the POV of Vincent/Reeese are stunningly inept. Those basketball scenes? God, it reads like 8th grade fiction.The coincidence that Ben is in the same town makes me think the author must despise us all, and think we're as stupid as the publishers who bought this. And Beth, what a terrible mother.You all know that Ben would have been better offwithout this abusinve, self-absorbed witch. America, are these people your heroes? Why are you all buying this? I'm sad.

Beth is not a very happy person and uses her son's kidnapping as an excuse to be an even more miserable individual. She takes it out on her family, a lovable bunch.Beth is the woman of the 90's you love to loath, selfish and narcissistic. In stark contrast her husband Pat is Ward Cleaver all over again. His heart attack gets her attention and sympathy but only briefly.Don't waste your summer reading on this one--you'll spend way too much time waiting for it to get interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little slow start...but worth it","review":"I don't even have children, but when I read this book I felt totally like I was experiencing all the emotions right there with Beth.

I really enjoyed reading it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerfully true to life","review":"Although many readers did not like the main character, Beth, I felt as though the author had incredible insight as to what a mother might go through in which is what a mother's worst nightmare.When I first realized what the book was about, I put it down for several days and decided not to read it. Who wants to read a book about the very thing you fear the most? But, since I had nothing good around the house to read I picked it up and spent the next several hours crying and reading, reading and crying.A friend of mine lost a child under very similar circumstances. She was what most people would consider an ideal mother, however, her reaction was so similar to Beth's. She also abandoned her remaining children for a period of time, withdrew from friends and wanted to stop living. I now understand her so much better from reading about Beth."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but frustrating","review":"Having had a high school reunion in almost the same location described in the first chapters of this book, I was immediately drawn into the story. As a mom I was horrified by the kidnapping. However, the character of Beth was frustrating at times. I thought Vincent's character was complex and interesting, and Mitchard's language and description--choice of words-is often beautiful. The ending was fascinating and horrifying at the same time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"We are supposed to believe the police would just ignore a tip from someone who thought they saw Ben. Not only the police, but Beth too. I kept wondering why she didn't just drive up there herself and scour the city looking for her son - and Candy who says she looked for him in every city she went to - why didn't she just look in a city where he'd actually been spotted.Despite the obvious flaws - too many characters of which to keep track and unbelievable plot twists - I must admit I finished the book in two sittings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!!","review":"I was surprised to learn that one of Oprah's Book Club picks was Toni Morrison's Song of Solomon. I wrote my thesis on Morrison's novels and am a huge fan of her writing. I figured that Oprah might be on to something, here, and so I decided to pursue The Deep End of the Ocean. After all, it was holding its own on the bestseller's list.Little did I know the nightmare I was in for. This novel was so bad, I rushed to finish it just so I could put it out of sight and bemoan the amount of time I had squandered while reading it. Not only was the book completely unbelievable, without the benefit of science fiction thrills and chills, but the timing was pathetically slow, the characters, unrealistic and obtuse (and in Beth's case, melodramatic in the extreme), the dialogue, slow. I'm scared to think that this is what the American majority wants in its fiction. I wonder what Toni Morrison would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"I purchased this book not only because of Oprah's book club, but also because of the strong recommendation it received by my mail order book club. What a disappointment!!! Putting aside the fact that Beth is so unlikable a character, the prose, particularly the dialogue, was monotonous and contrived. How can anyone who is actually well-read have praised this awkward attempt at literature?

Please don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book kept my attention...","review":"The first half of the book has you frantic, where did little Ben go?

I am not a mother, however I wonder if a mother in Beth's situation could really have such a lack of compassion and blatant disregard for her childern, her family, her marriage, her friends and herself!! Enough chapters about how long she sleeps!! Was anyone else wishing that maybe she would just sleep herself to death to put us all out of our misery??!!

Gee, was I ever wrong! It was awful. The pace was slow-moving and the author seemed to not care if we connected with the characters. I did feel a tad sorry for Kerry. She seemed to gain no attention from anyone. Beth was a selfish person- even before the kidnapping. Pat was a wimp. Why did I finish it? Only because I always finish a book no matter how bad it is (and I kept hoping to find some redeeming quality to this book). Why did I give it 1 star? Because I wasn't allowed to give a 0. I am glad to see I wasn't the only one who thought it should've stayed unpublished."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fairly uneventful story","review":"I decided to read the book instead of seeing the movie. I should have waited for the movie. There are those works of fiction that make better movies instead of books, this is one of them. The story while interesting was not very compelling. The book offered very little in depth to the true aspect to the emotion of grief. What I thought might be a profound testment to the human heart was really nothing more than a story of grief in the form of total abandonment of her other two children and her own selfishness. I was ready to put it down but after I had invested the time in reading over 200 pages, I trodded along to the end, which left me very unimpressed. The point at which this story ended really should have been it's climax. Like I said I should have waited for the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Drove Me Crazy!","review":"I figured I better do a quick read of this story before going to see it at the movies. Glad I did -- I will probably not subject myself to the frustration again! I just could not figure the mother out.

The mother was unbelievable. She was like a stork with her head stuck somewhere that it didn't belong. She didn't behave like a parent whose child had disappeared. I said that it was the worst book that I have ever attempted to read because I could not force myself to finish it even though it was going to be discussed at my book club. I put it down after reading one hundred pages. A week later, I picked it up and decided to do something that I had never done before. I skipped all the way in the book to a point that was about four chapters from the end. I did find out what had happened to the missing child but the book was still unreadable. I didn't even read the last two chapters. Pure nonsense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIVETING","review":"This book captured the intense grief parents feel in losing a child. Ben, suddenly disappears in the midst of his mother, Beth's high school reunion. The focus was largely on Beth's feelings of guilt, anger and even loathing for all that is not Ben. The other children, the eldest in particular see that their mother has also left. Her daily life becomes a struggle in an effort not to follow her lost child to the unfathomable limbo he has disappeared into. The family is shattered to pieces and their relationships with each other experiences a slow and painful death. When Ben is found, it seems that salvation has presented itself and hope arises. However, reality refuses to erase the past. And again they must come to terms with another form of death. The death of hope that their lives and family may be reconstructed to what it once was before their nightmare began."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed on two levels","review":"While the storyline was somewhat predictable I couldn't help but get caught up in the plot and the characters.

Here are just a few of my frustrations with this book: Why were some chapters named (Beth, Reese, etc.) and some not? What was the point of that anyway? Why does the author think 7 year old children like opera? Why is she so interested in the way everybody smells? Why was Ben really kidnapped? Why didn't Pat leave Beth? Why, Why, Why was this book a best seller??"},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon, Oprah...you can do better than this!","review":"I started out reading this book with high expectations. Ichose it mostly because of it being on Oprah's list, but was prettydisappointed in it. For one thing, if my 3 year old had been abducted I think I would have gone berserk, not sat at the bar downing drinks. It didn't seem that she was all that concerned about her son being missing. Besides that, it was a pretty blah storyline. Kind of a disappointment like Oprah's other selection I read, \\"Map of the World\\". END"},{"rating":"2","title":"DO NOT READ MASS MARKET PAPERBACK!

As I said, I read the HARDCOVER version and it did not have many editing mistakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good books aren't supposed to always be easy to like","review":"Some of the reviews for this book are amazingly harsh and mean-spirited. I think the book is an amazing first novel. As a mother of toddlers and a pediatrician, I could relate to the not always picture-perfect glimpses of the feelings that mothers often have. Being a woman, a wife, a mother and trying to be a person as well can be difficult; Beth is a realistic, wonderfully flawed character, not a supermom. There are no supermoms. I've read Mitchard in the Milwaukee paper for years and feel I know her; when you read her columns you understand immediately that 1)being a mother is the absolutely most important passion in her life and 2)it ain't always fun or pretty. I can't believe the reviewer who says there was too much description. Why would anyone read a book otherwise? That's what comic strips are for"},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel does not live up to its billing.","review":"I purchased THE DEEP END OF THE OCEAN right after Oprah recommended it, but just got around to reading it last week. I thought the entire book was too contrived and I had a hard time plowing through it, even though I was determined to finish it to see what happened. I thought some characters, like Pat, were not sufficiently developed, while others, like Candy, were over-developed. The character I felt the most empathy for was Vincent, who never had a chance once Ben was taken. He and Kerry had to make it on their own, and where was spineless Pat?

Oprah!","review":"Well, the story was boring, Beth was the most awful, selfish, self-absorbed person, whom I hated throughout the whole novel. Her character went dead, she refused to do anything to find Ben and she also ceased to be a mother to her two remaining children. I could NOT identify with her at all. Her obsession with the other guy?! What was that?

I have always enjoyed the books Oprah has chosen until this one. This book was very hard to follow. I had a hard time getting into it. Jacquelyn Mitchard's writing leaves a lot to be desired. I don't like her style of writing - it's very hard reading. I read A LOT and have NEVER disliked reading a book as much as this one. This was the first and last book of Jacquelyn Mitchard that I will ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story, but poorly edited!","review":"I agree with another reviewer when he said finish whatever you have to do, because you will not be able to put this one down. That said, the typos and mistakes (at one point she says something about \\"Candy's hair\\" ( the hero) and they mean \\"Cecile's hair\\" ( the villan) - what a mistake!, and the poor grammar - it is disturbing that it was put out this way. But, I would definitely read her next novel. She seems to have \\"been there\\". Riveting. Wonderful and upsetting story. I think it will make a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the best of the Oprah books...and it ain't good","review":"Yep, Beth, is cold, unlovable, and unlikable, which is the reason that reading the book is such a chore. If she would ever have made an attempt to help herself, to try to look outside of herself, the reader would be able to empathise. As it is, she is not a mother that anyone would like to have and I ended up feeling like the lost kid got the best end of the deal by getting out of the dysfunctional quagmire. I'm getting weary of the current literary obsession with victimization...give me a hero, and if not a hero, give me someone for whom I can at least feel compassion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the best of the Oprah books...and it ain't good","review":"Yep, Beth, is cold, unlovable, and unlikable, which is the reason that reading the book is such a chore.

This book has it's down side, as well. It should have had more chapters on what Ben, a.k.a Sam, is feeling instead of Vincent, the older son.

Firstly, the mother is unsympathetic b/c she just wallows in her grief instead of trying to help her (assumedly) surviving children deal with it. It's like the writer assumed that since she lost a child, the mother must be sympathetic. Instead, she's merely pathetic. Also, I found the blase racial slurs, like the Japanese one above, offensive. Also, there were numerous typos that should have been caught by a proofreader.For a much better book, tryRabid: A Novelby T.k.

It's terrible and I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Review-Diana, 11","review":"Just as ms. Midland told us below, I only finished it because I felt compelled to finish the book since I started it. Beth Cappadora is a horrible person, she doesn't deserve to b married to such a wonderful person as Pat, and certainly doesn't deserve to have children. I find myself feeling the urge to spit in Beth's face and yell \\"You deserve it.\\" She's not grieving, she's almost BORED, as if this was expected. I would have done everything possible when I found out my child was disappeared, put his face on the milk carton, all that stuff, not sit down and have a drink for God's sake. You feel the need to push Beth out of the way and call yourself the mother of the family as you watch the family suffer under her idiotic depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disapointing","review":"I only kept reading this book thinking it has to get better, but unfortunately it never did. What amazes me is that I kept on reading it, for what I have no idea. There was nothing of redeeming value in the story or the characters, couldn't relate to any of them, and didn't even care to. It was a waste of time. There are very few books I can't get into, but this one was just bad and boring as hell"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrifying look at pseudo-motherhood","review":"The only thing good about this story was Ben's abduction; at least he found love and warmth in the family with whom he was raised. I can not enjoy a novel if I can't relate to the characters, and I could not relate to Beth. I never thought I would feel that someone deserved to lose her child, but Ben was better off without her. I was saddened more by the fact that the other two children weren't spared her selfish, egotistical facade of motherhood"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Get Past Page Fifty","review":"The reason for this? The auhor appears to think the purpose of novels is to see how long one can drone on about insubstantial things. She does get around to a plot. This is true.

However, I felt depressed most of the time because of how Beth and the rest of the family felt when they lost Ben.

The writing was such trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting Tale of Parental Heartbreak","review":"Buy This Book! I recently finished this book and cannot stop thinking about it. Ben -- the toddler that is kidnapped and forever changes the lives of his \\"family\\". Beth -- a mother who is taking a lot a critism for being too real. Vincent/Reese -- the older brother who carries so much pain in his own guilt. Pat -- my least favorite character -- is so out of touch with family that he, too, is sadly believable. The only thing that would have made it a better read would have been if more of the storytelling had come from Vincent/Reese's viewpoint.

On a positive note, the prose was beautiful in many places and conveyed the sense of loss that anyone in this situation would feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could never recommend this book........","review":"There was nothing in this book that I liked. The mother was a wholly unlikeable character. She had no regard for her other two children or her husband before the baby disappered.

However, it was difficult to ever sympathize with the mother because she came across as so selfish throughout the book. That could be forgiven, but the ending (which I will not give away) was so ridiculously implausible that it ruined the entire book. By that point the story had pretty much run out of steam anyway, so it would have been difficult for any ending to wrap things up satisfactorily. This book would have gone nowhere had it not been pimped by Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Deep Alright.....","review":"The quote on the front of my book says \\"Riveting..twists that will spin you around.\\" I don't know who at Newsweek wrote that but I'm just an average Jane and not once was I \\"spun around\\" by something that happened. It was a very depressing book, not riveting. I picked it up and put it down several times, not really caring about the shallow, selfish characters and the only reason I even finished it was because it was the only book in my bag during a long plane ride.A child, Ben, is lost and found again after several years. The book goes through these years focusing on the mother (who doesn't seem to really love any of her children) and the older, tortured, brother who \\"told Ben to go away.\\" This 447 page book could have easily been trimmed down to 150 pages for a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"O God, what did we do to deserve this potboiler!?","review":"Be prepared for a journey to the shallow end of the ocean, or the baby pool as the case may be.

Remember, you can drown in shallow water just as easily as deep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad Beth was never my mother.","review":"I can proudly (or sadly) say I made it to page 356 of this wretched novel - it was an exercise in discipline. Trudging through quicksand would have been more exiting. By this time, I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, with the possible exception of Reese. It was depressing to reach this stage of the book, as it felt like the story had concluded, and yet I saw that I still had over 100 pages to go. Torture in the extreme. What could she possibly have had more to add to this poorly written and utterly improbable story. If you should find yourself stranded on a desert island and this is the only thing to read - build sand castles.

I guess I somehow missed the boat. If the author's intent was to provoke, then she achieved her goal. I was enraged by Beth, the self-absorbed woman indentified as the missing child's mother. It seems as if she never wanted her children in the first place..just some pretty, well-behaved, charming things to show off when it didn't interfere with her \\"woe, is me\\" routine. This is evident in her neglect of the first born child, Vincent. I never once expected a happy ending to this drama..just some growth on Beth's part would have been satisfying and would have provided some hope that her remaining son would not be in jail within ten years. Tragedy shows us sides of people that we cannot imagine nor can we understand. It is hope that gives us the strength to try"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was horrible. I have to say I did not like Beth (mom) Vincent (big Bro) or Ben ( lil bro).I think the mom is selfish, but I completly understand how when her child is kid napped she becomes a recluse and doesnt wanna see anyone not even her other children. She does some things in the book that I do not like when she gets her son back. No one would do that unless they like feeling sad.I hate The older son, it was his fault that the younger brother was kid napped, at the beginning he always looked at his mom like he hated her. Towards the end I liked him better bc i felt bad for him.I hated Ben, he didnt even think any bad thoughts towards the kidnappers. He said it was no thier faults, that made me sooo mad.I did like the dad Pat.He was always by his wifes side, and his kids. He was the best character.This book is not worth reading.

The beginning of the book was good, with the rest of it just capturing my attention only because I paid for the book and had already committed myself to reading it and because I did have great hopes that the story would come around and end up giving me a good feeling about the hours spent reading it. Needless to say, the good feelings never materialized."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a depressing journey with no way out.","review":"I couldn't wait to finish this book. It drug me deep into a depression hole with no light. The mother had few redeeming qualities and didn't do anything for her other children.

Frustrations were many--the main one, I haven't read from anyone else's review: I KNEW FROM THE BEGINNING WHO THE KIDNAPPER WAS!!! Didn't anyone else? It was obvious!

I felt there was just a little too much \\"undone business.\\" I am almost anticipating a sequel! All in all, I would and have recommend this story to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good title, but a very bad book","review":"I picked up this book because I was so intrigued by the title. It held such weight, I thought the book might have real depth and substance. Unfortunately, I was wrong.I despised Beth and her constant whining and selfishness. I was intrigued by Vincent, but wished his character had been developed beyond the stereotypical guilt-ridden \\"survivor\\" of a tragedy. The story-line amounted to nothing and kept going on and on in it's tedious rut. I continued reading the book in the hope that eventually someone in the book would wake up out of their stuper and do something memorable or notable or even just outrageous. Nobody ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good.","review":"It's intriguing and compelling, but it's not good. A good book affects you, changes you, and empathizes with you. This one did none of that for me. Curiosity compelled me to finish it out, but it was pointlessly depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a cherished read for any mother","review":"I found this book enthralling, unable to put it down. I find that alot of people dislike the Beth character. I found her very real, honest, and completely true to life. I have a 3 year old, and two other children. Personally how else would one react. The book was heart warming and emotionally draining at times, but also joyful and wistful. If you read only a few books a year I would truly recommend this be one of them.

WOW! I can't remember how many times I found the word THOUGH and it should have been THOUGHT. I also found the word probable and it should have been probably. When I read a book I expect the author to be able to spell. This author can't spell OR WRITE. Her style is bad, very choppy and boring. I guess she never heard of spell check. This book was very hard to finish because of the typos and the poor writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G","review":"Too wordy and detailed, dragged on and on. The story picked up just as I was starting to think about giving up on this book, only to fall flat again. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Postscript","review":"One last note: Vincent, the teenaged son, is really quite ridiculous. He is JUST the \\"typical\\" teenager. In other words, that stereotype of a teenager: overwhelmingly shallow, egotistical, and childish. Vincent's speech as Mitchard writes it is merely an extension of that stereotype. The stress Mitchard puts on the fact that Vincent is staying away from (oh no!) swear words, like \\"shit,\\" is a heavy-handed (and failed) attempt at trying to leave Vincent some scrap of morality. I would last like to express my surprise that so few people feel the same way as I do about this novel. (And no, I do not consider myself a \\"discriminating\\" reader, turning my nose up at anything not on the best seller's list, not a Nobel Prize winner, and not a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kidnapping forever alters a family's lives and relationships","review":"The disappearance of three-year-old Ben from the lobby of abusy hotel is the central event of this gripping family story.The story of the before and after unfolds from the point ofview of the mother, who is wracked with guilt and Vincent, herolder son, each of whom suffers in their individual ways.This very gripping story will have you on the edge of your seatand may keep you awake. Strong secondary characters flesh outthis story of an unconventional mother, a loving extendedfamily and a very determined female detective. If you do notlike books about sad human drama, this is not the book for you.If you like books about the strength of the human spirit and howfamilies work together, do not miss this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of human struggle for relationship survival","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read in many years. Mitchard writes in a flowing manner that awakens the readers insights. The author understands human fraility and the personal feeling of hopelessness and disbelief.I am from Madison, Wisconsin, home town of Mitchard, and found the story to be include many references to our lovely city. It's a \\"can't put it down\\" weekend read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this book!!!","review":"What a totally unrealistic, boring, and dumb book. The premise was great (son is kidnapped, family learns how to deal with it); but let's get real. At some point, why didn't somebody tell Beth to quit whining and point out to her what she is doing to her other two kids. Her husband, her friends, relatives, anybody! But no, they just tip-i-toed around her, treating her like a fragile piece of china. Break, already! On top of that, the book was boring, difficult to understand, had characters nobody could relate to. I am never, never going to read another book Oprah recommends again. On the contrary, if I see one of her \\"books\\", I'm going to run screaming out the door. What a waste of my time and money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was uncohesive; unsatisfying.","review":"Was this supposed to be a mystery novel, with clues duly planted? A harlequin romance, with that former lover/classmate thing? And what's with the random Vincent chapters? (Didn't work.) Were Mom and Vincent the only ones with feelings? Regardless, I couldn't feel sympathy for ANY character. Her writing style meandered irrationally, her plot twists were unbelievable (a quick photo shoot for Life Magazine, right.)I wanted to quit after the first 100 pages or so, but hoped it would get better. Take my advice, don't even start reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah Must Have Suffered from Temporary Insanity","review":"God almighty, what bad writing. I'm not talking about plot or characterization or landscape. I'm talking about sentence structure. Paragraphs. Grammar. The fundamentals. I couldn't find my way through half the sentences, they were so clunky and burdensome. She uses dashes with abandon, and parenthetical clauses that go completely off track. I couldn't get past page 29; it was too painful. Oprah did readers a grave disservice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the \\"rave\\" reviews the media has bestowed","review":"There was not a single enduring character in the story. The mother, Beth, infatuated me with her irresponsible attitude towards the rest of the family. The story was extremely choppy and hard to follow. I didn't waste my time finishing the book as I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. I cannot understand what all the fuss was in reguard to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinked, Stank, Stunk","review":"Tabloid Tearjerker. Can't find motivation to finish the last 100 or so pages. The story is silly, unbelievable and mind-numbing. Beth is a character I can find no sympathy or connection with. A wretched story, tabloid writing at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I haven't read a book in years that I disliked as much as this one. I never would have finished it except that my book group was reading it and I felt guilty that I had no sympathy or empathy for these people who had suffered such a tragedy. I felt cheated that the author took such a serious topic and didn't do any more with it.The writing was terrible as well. The book might have some value for writing instructors who need examples of bad prose. I'm going to go read some Jane Austen to flush this experience out of my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the movie!","review":"I have to admit this book was hard to put down. The first half of the book dragged a bit because it was so loaded down with depression. (Believe me this mother had a good reason to be depressed.) Many people I've talked to said they couldn't get in to it. If you can get through the first half of the book, you'll be carrying it with you everywhere until it's finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you start, you won't be able to put it down!","review":"Although I haven't finished reading it yet, this book is truly captivating. Although I agree that the mother is somewhat self absorbed and sinking in her own self pitty, she is HUMAN. The characters of the book have a very real quality about them. I highly recommend this book. Kudos to the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZ....","review":"Yawn. I just couldn't finish this book. The title is lovely, and the premise is fairly interesting ( a child vanishes.) But Beth Cappadora was one of the most boring characters I've ever met, and halfway through the book I plunked it down in disgust and checked out a collection of African short stories, which were infinitely more interesting and vivid than the travails of this white bread mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best part of the book was the ending.","review":"I read this book because I felt reading the book was a better experience than watching the movie. I think I made a pretty good choice. I enjoyed the book from beginning to end, but personally I thought it was a very long book. It didn't start off slow like most books, it went straight to the disapperance of Ben. The rest of the book talked about how each member of the family dealt with the incident. I thought it was too much. The best part of the book was the end, where it made me cry. I enjoyed the ending because it makes me think about my relationship with my younger sibling."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"I think that there were good and bad points about The Deep End of The Ocean. Some of the characters were outstanding, others were cardboard cut-outs. Some parts of the plot were inventive, some were predictable. Some of the writing was very good, and some was not so good. I would have enjoyed this book much more if I had been let more into the mind of Ben/Sam and less into Vincent/Reese, and more into what actually happens to the family. Vincent/Reese seemed like a way to kill time until another plot development could be made. I would reccommend The Deep End of the Ocean to anybody looking for a quick, but not entirely profound read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good but the printer doesn't like the taste.","review":"This printer cartridge arrived quickly and looks just like the genuine hp article.

My household consists of 4 women, ages 48, 21, 19, and 17 and all of us have found something in this book that we can use. I love all the skin care, makeup, and hair tips, but my favorite part of the book is the workout section because you don't have to buy expensive equipment or spend a lot of money to join a gym to be healthy and get toned up. the section about \\"how not to diet\\" has really got me thinking about what i put in my mouth and how i can make changes in my diet to be healthier. i really recommend this book to all women, and i'm pretty sure you'll find something in it that you can use, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really disappointed","review":"I thought this book would be full of his tips and tricks he uses on TV.

I guess I assumed the book would have similar stuff to what he was interviewed about. I was wrong. I thought the book was very elementary and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This book is AWESOME!It doesn't have as many tips as I was expecting, but what it did have was a cohesive message about how to be healthy and feel good about yourself. He ties hair and make-up in with a healthy lifestyle and eating foods that are good for you. To be honest, while I knew I wasn't the healthiest eater (I'll admit I'm a sugar addict and love certain horrible-for-you processed foods), the book opened my eyes to how make-up and hair can only go so far. An inner beauty radiates from you (physically and otherwise) when you eat well, exercise and take care of yourself.Kyan is a great inspiration to life balance - being busy successful and not neglecting your body. He admits that even in his own crazy world of TV show taping schedules, he slips up and will eat a doughnut. But he also knows the importance of re-finding that balance and not letting the little things take over your life.GREAT book. Great tips in this one. Definitely worth purchasing.

In the lastest album,they broke their rule buy selling 10 songs (Eventhough the song-Mrs.Lazarus used to be a b-side song of single \\"the pod\\"). Unfortunately,this album didn't have any songs in the pod-tune. --BUT-- It's still immensely wonderful. Not as perfect as last album for me but I still give five stars for HUM... I'm their real fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"\\"you'd prefer an astronaut\\" is one of my favorite albums and \\"electra 2000\\" is very enjoyable...however...this album...grossly disappointing. the lyrics compared to astronaut's clever metaphors are completely uninspired or in fact repeated. out of ten songs only two sound like the band tried. this is an afterthought of an album and i'd say pass on it and go listen to \\"you'd prefer an astronaut\\". and for the previous reviewers, you completely mislead me into believing this album was worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge, deep, and a little pop.","review":"Both the music or the lyrics by themselves have the strength to take you where the band wants and the combination of the two is stellar. Incredible, likable, original sound with loads of energy and poetic depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Looks Fine And Rested Well","review":"well, unlike all the other reviewers, i think this album is worthy of purchase for the track \\"If You Are To Bloom\\" alone... but almost every single track is pretty outstanding. They found a perfect mix of LOUD, crushing guitars and gentle, soaring vocals... like Foo Fighters with more distortion and grace... This album sounds amazing when it is played really loud. all the little squeaks and grinds really stick out... if you miss hard music, but dont want all power chords and rap-shock vocals, this might be the purchase for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the hidden gem of the 90's","review":"To keep it short, if you like alternative rock made between '88 and '95, this is the album to buy. No joke. It is so tightly performed that even 10 years after it was released, it still sits in my CD rotation in my car. 10 YEARS!!!! The most perfect album recorded, other than Texas is the Reason, \\"Do you know who you are?\\", as far as I'm concerned. Trust me, you won't be disapointed. God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa, talk about a bad change of direction.","review":"I hate to slam them, but Hum really let me down with this album. After listening to You'd Prefer an Astrounaout for so long, I was thrilled to hear some new material from the band. After several attempts of trying to get into the noise I found coming off this album, I eventually just gave up and put the damn thing away. I don't understand how such a good band could take such a drastic turn towards the worse in-between the span of one album. Downward is Heavenward is a big, slapped together mesh of static and sloppy guitar work. It's characteristic of something you'd here from Sonic Youth(ugh). After reading some of these reviews, I'm glad to see some people liked it. Maybee the band will stick around long enough to make something that hits my intrest again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"2 1/2Second-tier, first generation alternative band never was able to dig their way out of the generically noisy rut they carved out for themselves, though constant attempts, with some success, to contrast the choking distortion with more subtle and softer strumming keeps things moving along without too much apathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"But not for me. Too generic, too noisy, too much not a step up from their previous album (which needed it). The production is brickwalled along with most late nineties albums, and none of the songwriting goes any way toward being as appreciable as the catchy hooks from their previous album. In fact, not one song on this album is memorable. Compare that with the 3:1 hit:miss ratio of You'd prefer an astronaut and you have a loser of an album.Add to that the fact that none of the member have gone any distance toward improving their playing (bar the drummer) - the guitars still sound sloppy, the singer still flat and monotonal. And that was fine with the simplistic melodies and hooks on Atronaut - but here in the midst of attempted complex rhythms and harmonies, it just doesn't quite get there. Good luck guys on your future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big Disappointment","review":"\\"Downward Is Heavenward\\" was one of the few albums I had looked forward to, probably due to the fact that YPAA is a brilliant record. Unfortunately, Hum seemed to have run out of ideas, choosing to instead spin their musical wheels in songs like \\"Dreamboat\\", \\"Afternoon with the Axolotls\\" and \\"The Inuit Promise\\". All three of these songs showcase the main annoying thing about Hum: plodding brevity without any energy. Not to say that the album is all bad, as \\"Comin' Home\\" and \\"Ms. Lazarus\\" capture the feel of their earlier albums, while \\"If You Are To Bloom\\" and \\"The Scientists\\" show the band's sensitive (?!) side. All in all, a disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Cozzens tour-de-force","review":"Peter Cozzens does it again. In his series of books on the Civil War's western theater, Cozzens has shown a unique ability to convert detailed research into a gripping narrative.

Those were only bonuses, not the focus of the book. I bought the book for my year abroad in Austria and found it extremely helpful. For the time I had it I did not get lost following the maps and the information was accurate. Unfortunately the book is now in a river in Luzern. Ran after it for a long time with no luck. I replaced it with the 2001 edition and was disappointed to find that they cut out a city that I was planning to go to (Cesky Krumlov). I thought the 2000 version was good.

But I was pleasantly surprised with the first Jane and the Unpleasantness at Scargrave Manor. I liked the first well enough to indulge in reading this book, the second in the series - this one surpassed the original. More tension, more questions as to who is friend and who is foe, a little bit of romance, and the surprising twist at the end of who is the enemy and the aid of friends from the past. All makes for a wonderful book, a delightful mystery from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mystery and interesting glimpse into Austen's life","review":"This series of books by Barron incorporates the real life events of Austen and her extensive relations into an authentic mystery. The places, events and people are real to Austen (see her biography by Tomalin\\"Jane Austen: A Life\\") and the mystery plot is woven into the fabric of her life.

However, thecutseyness and derivative writing style so annoyed me that I had trouble finishing the book. For those who are real afficianados of Jane Austen and her work, this work is only the palest of camparisons. I could not detect any of the sparkling wit and very little of the sharp social commentary for which the real Austen is well-known. The mystery itself, while clever enough, is sometimes so farfetched that suspension of disbelief is impossible. In general, I found this book to be quite a disappointment. I think I'll stick to Jane, herself, from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somehow, this seems mighty familiar . . .","review":"Nice try, but a re-hash of the Darcy/Wickham story in a mystery setting is rather boring. In addition, Mrs. Austen is obviously modeled on Mrs. Bennet. Also, the author works a little too hard at trying to sound like Jane Austen. The style tends to take the spotlight rather than the story line. (This is understandable, as the story line is mighty thin).

The authors' approach is countertrend: even though I am more comfortable with following the trend, the authors make a good case for a sound countertrend strategy. They recommend, for instance, rigorously placing sensible stops. This book, in general, is applicable to more than just hedge fund managers, for the advice Connors and Hayward give is based on detailed research and backtesting. I would argue, though, that some of their approaches, while sound, may not be entirely original; one of their methods particularly reminded me of something Larry Williams labelled in one of his books as his \\"weekly trading tool.\\" Nevertheless, this book is a solid, clearly written, very practical tool for any technical trader. I am very pleased to add it to my own library."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too much technical charting from ancient charts/graphs","review":"half of the book is pictures of charts, and brief (paragraphs) descriptions of what happened to make the chart move, mostly it deals in commodities, and deals with the stock market from the early 90s, as we all know in the stock market, one year is like 10, so this is mostly outdated, i was very dissapointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"the title was intriguing, but it was downhill from there. the book had little to do with the title, which always makes me question the motives of the author. is there some message they are aching to express, or are they looking to simply enrich themselves?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depending on the reader...","review":"I bought this anthology when I was really into performing, and watching performance poetry, SLAM, spoken word, whatever you want to call it.

Instead, Gerard has a very narrow view of the field, limiting it almost exclusively to literary journalism. Many types of creative nonfiction (humor, reviews, opinion pieces, personal essays) are all but overlooked in this book. If you are interested in a more comprehensive treatment of creative nonfiction, look elsewhere. I would highly recommend Lynn Bloom's Fact & Artifact.If your primary interest is in literary journalism, you might want to read this book. However, Gerard does not just have a bias towards literary journalism, he also has a bias towards specific topics. Specifically, he writes almost entirely about war, Hemingway, risky activities, and nature. If you share most or all of his interests, you may be satisfied with this book. Otherwise, you might want to try reading something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"good advice, well written","review":"This book reads as smoothly as a novel,and you don't realize you are learning something.

You manage to make this fascinating genre sound dull and stodgy...middle-agey...ZZZZzzzzZZZzzz...The problem with cnf, in general, is that so few good texts are available for those who teach creative writing. Even the AWP book with co-editors Carolyn Forche and good old Philip Gerard is second rate. It doesn't have NEARLY enough essays on the how-to's of writing cnf, and includes some cnf essays that are wildly inappropriate, as if the editors had to flesh out the volume and just crammed some stuff in at the last minute.

As a young person, I could sing all of the words and melodies from any given album, but did not fully understand the deeper meaning of his lyrics nor realized the full impact of his loss until I recently heard them again on this set for the first time in several years.

Too far to enjoy seeing the water. It was hard to relax because who ever made this, never reviewed their work. If they had, they would have heard the LOUD non-ending sound of wind over-whelming the microphone. Instead of waves and birds it was a constant white noise like a vacuum cleaner in the next room. About half way thru, you hear a guy come up and say something like \\"you guys making a movie?\\" or \\"is this one of those movies?\\" and another male voice says \\"yes\\".

My baby is already responding positively to some of the massages we have tried and definitely needs the tummy rubs to help him with digestive problems he has. My only suggestion/dislike about this video is that there is one child who seems a little big to be in the video half naked.

I am a HUGE fan of John's work, but Desperate Living has to be my least favourite movie he's made. I didn't hate it (seeing as I gave it 4 stars), I just don't think it's as great as his others. It seems as though he was trying to rekindle the kind of decadent filth that could only be achieved through Divine's addition to the cast (a la Pink Flamingos). I think it's a great flick, just not the best! I reccommend it to round out your collection, but not to bow down to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Divine even without Divine","review":"At the time of its release, this was easily John Waters's most technically accomplished and professional-looking film. It's sort of a step or two away from his infamous trash aesthetic in that respect. The Baltimore maestro's first feature without Divine is also his strangest, basically a demented, surreal fairy tale, replete with colorful cardboard sets and colorful cardboard characters. Quite funny in places and highly original, I'd count this among his best films."},{"rating":"2","title":"The film that changed my life.","review":"The first time I saw this film, I kept thinking to myself \\"I've never seen anything like this before.\\" This is by far my favorite John Waters film. Everyone always talks about Divine, but this movie showcases the extrodanary talents of miss Edith Massey (to whom no one can compare). And let us not forget the beautiful and talented, Liz Renay who gives a steller preformance of Muffy St. Jaques, an extordanary woman effected by extordanary circumstances.

This demonstrates that by the early 70's, he hadn't lost his touch. The new releases, such as this one, \\"the alternate aloha\\", and \\"Aloha from hawaii (with bonus tracks)\\" have better sound quality and a more live feel. The crowd is wild on this one. As far as his performance, WOW! He sounds great. He did very well with the old rock n roll standards. I can't forget to mention the band. They sound supercharged. The drums and bass are tight and fast. Listen to \\"polk salad annie.\\" Although the performances are very similar to the evening show(released in 1972 as recorded at MSG) It has a new feel. It is done the right way, unedited, good crowd noise, and remastered. For anyone who wants to hear how Elvis Presley sounded live, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fab!","review":"This is one Elvis concert I would like to have been at! RCA have done a great job on the remastering of this recording and if you put your headphones on you'll think you're right in the midst of this concert. Elvis was in fine form and so was the band. Listen to the band when they do 'Polk Salad Annie'! How I wish they'd fimed this concert as part of the 1972 Tour filming, but since we can't see it you'll really love listening to this one. First class. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is one of the best commercially released live albums by Elvis. The sound quality is excellent, Elvis' performance is energetic and vital, the band is crack and the song selection is quite good. Anyone with the slightest interest in live recordings of Elvis from the early 70s would do very well to pick this up, it's much better than the other live record from Elvis' 1972 stint in New York, 'As Recorded at Madison Square Garden'. The main flaw, like all Elvis live records it seems, is that the 50s tunes are rushed through and not paid much attention (I can't blame him though, he must have been quit tired of them by this point). Best songs: Funny How Time Slips Away, For The Good Times, You've Lost That Lovin' Feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting from the historical perspective","review":"I picked this up on sale and thought it would be interesting, which it was. What it was not was a heartfelt performance by the greatest American rocker of them all. I wish it sounded like Elvis cares about the rock & roll songs here, but it doesn't. He's putting on a show -- not as a singer but as a STAR.You can't fault the band -- It great to hear so many top-quality musicians on stage. You will never hear a tighter group. It is cool that he merely tells the band the name of the song and they immediately dive in, tight as a drum.But Elvis seems only interested in the country songs along with Reconsider Baby and the American Trilogy. The rest of the time he's phoning it in. This is nothing like the Comeback Special where Elvis put it all on the line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotive..","review":"Despite the concert is quite emotive, the quality sound is not the best on this recording.

Most of this discussion is, in my opinion, too dated to be of direct use (DeMarco suggests, for example, that counting the now obsolete metric \\"frequency of compiles\\" as an indicator of software stability). But the true genius of this work lies in the periphery of his discussion--particularly insightful comments into what not to do when managing software development.

I found Live Licks, without the benefit of watching them, to be a sloppy mess with absolutely no cohesion whatsoever. Some of these versions are really alarmingly bad. None of these songs are as crisp as they once were. I'd suggest just pulling out Love You Live if you want the Stones at their best live."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is tough to listen to","review":"I have seen the Stones live dating back to '73. The band has been a 1 guitar band since '75 and it sounds like it on this Cd.Twangy sound and edited songs. I know they are still Rolling but why not capitalize on some of their live recordings from the American tour from '72 or European tour of '73. Do yourself a favor..get yourself an ebay account and bid on the 2 Cd Brussels Affair bootleg of their '73 performance. You will never listen to the 'new' live Licks stuff again."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a fan - don't buy it!!!","review":"I'm a huge Stones fan and just wanted to warn other Stones fans before buying this CD. Most of the songs have been edited to make them shorter. This has been done in a really horrible way. Just listen to the first opening notes of Brown Sugar and you'll see what I mean. But the absolute most horrible \\"cut\\" is in Rocks off. In the middle of a sentence the next chorus is started. So if you like long, original versions, you shouln't buy this CD. If you're no Stones fan, you probably shouldn't buy this eigther, but buy the (more expensive) DVD set Four Flicks.Only positive side: the uncut songs are pretty good. Street Fighting man is probably shorter than it used to be, but still sounds good. And Can't you hear me knocking also sounds great. But these are the only two highlights to me, so I am really frustrated after buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre Live Recording From A Great Band","review":"The Stones are a great band and as we saw on this last tour can still rock the house. Why they insisted on releasing a live album of edited versions of their recent live recordings is anybody's guess. After all this time they very well could issue a live disc or two of more unique material as they attempted with disc 2 here. They played the DC area on the Licks tour and included a great version of \\"Love Train\\" in the set list that did not make the cut here. I have every Stones album except \\"No Security\\" which like this CD is a big disappointment and not a worthy representation of a great live band. This set is more like fast buck nostalgia trying to cash in on half baked renditions of past glories. Stick with Four Flicks and then wonder why THAT material was not released, or better yet why not release a live disc from the great 1972 tour?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good album from a great band- calm down","review":"I like this album, it's not my favorite, but it is a good live album. I think it is my second favorite, after No Security, with Flashpoint at a close third. I have heard other live albums mentioned and I don't think that I have enjoyed them enough to listen to them more than once or twice. There appears to be some aggravated folks out there, but I don't see the merit of their complaints. First off, the Stones are, for good and bad, tied to their old discography. If there hadn't been the old songs there would have been people complaining about no old songs. They are fun, and expected, that's why they are on there. Jimmy Buffet can't quit playing Margaritaville, either. Second, the album does not say \\"All live and unedited like you have on your dvd.\\" It what it proclaims it is, a fun live album. This is still better than at lesat 90% of the rock stuff that is out there. So anyway, y'all, calm down, it's only rock n'roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Generally) Good Performances, Bad Editing","review":"Although this set contains too many of the same old songs, the Stones play them quite well. However, botched editing marred what could have been a memorable live album. \\"Rocks Off\\" is a prime example: Jagger badly muffs the lyrics, and the problem is compounded by the amateurish editing. It seems that it would have been better to have eliminated this cut, if a better version could not be found. Also, do we really need Sheryl Crow on \\"Honky Tonk Women\\"? I don't buy Stones albums to hear Sheryl Crow. Further, why is Keith Richards singing \\"The Nearness of You\\"? This song just doesn't fit in a Stones set. Aside from the less-than-careful song selection and dreadful editing, there are a few worthy moments here; unfortunately, there just aren't enough of them to justify buying this album. There are bootlegs which are far superior to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"How low can they go","review":"I am not a great fan of the Stones, however having seen them live several times in the 70's I thought a live disc might be the way to go. I added this cd to my Christmas wish list with the thought it will be easy for my kids to pick up for me. Well, it was, but what a mistake. I've stopped paying to see the Stones because $300 ticket prices (Chicago and Milwaukee) is just too much for any band, much less an over the hill group of seniors who are only in it for the money. This cd illustrates it fully. With one exception all the songs are 1981 or older which shows the band has lost its creativity. The vocals on some of the songs are so horrendous, particularly Richards, I played it for my kids as a warning about what happens when you abuse alcohol, cigarettes and drugs too long. I was hoping for a snapshot of what I remember to the world's greatest rock and roll band. Instead I got a reminder of why the state of rock and roll is so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoever wrote this review is a fool:","review":"\\"The Stones' by now overwhelming spate of live albums has consistently been the most disappointing part of their considerable oeuvre\\".Thier live stuff is the best in thier catalog, so it's obvious because the reviewer can't do what they do. I saw a tribute band not too long ago that was pretty phenominal even if they did miss a few notes. All the mannerisms of the guy playing Keith Richards were spot on and he even looked a bit like the younger version of him too. They were called \\"The Ultimate Stones\\". - The Ultimate Tribute to the Rolling Stones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All!","review":"While I agree with some of the criticim regarding the editing of this double disk, the sound is excellent and the performances are very solid. This CD is very representative of the Stones live sound and is a good listen. I've been a Stones fan all my life, I have every one of their albums, and I'm happy to add this CD to my collection. The first disk covers a lot of ground that's already been covered on other Stones live disks but the second disk especially will make a nice addition to any Stones/music collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIVE STIFFS","review":"When I first read the song list for this 2 disc set, I thought, great idea and excellent song selection! One cd of hits and the other of lesser played stuff - something for everybody, right? Wrong. Unfortunately, the boys have let us down. Most, if not all of the tracks here have been abruptly edited and/or shortened. And for no good reason. They could have actually fit more songs on to this collection, even with all of the editing. Brown Sugar and It's Only Rock&Roll have obviously been tampered with and the guitar solo is missing completely from Worried About You. Missing verses and badly mixed guitars plague this could-have-been classic. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: EDITED VERSIONS!!","review":"First of all, if you already own \\"Four Flicks\\" then DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!! But on top of that, MOST of the songs are edited and cut down in one form or another; and some of them POORLY edited at that!! \\"Brown Sugar\\", \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\", and the worst edit of all, \\"Rocks Off\\"!! When I listen to a song, I wanna hear the WHOLE song, especially when it's live!!I mean, some of the stuff on here really rocks, but a lot of it seems \\"run-of-the-mill\\", \\"paint-by-numbers\\" stuff. Even the packaging seems thrown together! And I'm sick of the SAME songs coming out over and over again. Instead of ANOTHER version of \\"Start me up\\", how 'bout a kick ass new version of \\"Midnight Rambler\\"; which we haven't had since \\"YA YA'S\\" 35 YEARS AGO!!I love these guys, but I get sick and tired of spending all my money on 'em!

For starters, if you own the Four Flicks DVD set, you already have all of these songs, video and audio. Secondly, the Stones have managed to destroy these songs with poor mixes and poorer editing. In Street Fighting Man, Mick's voice is mixed at the level of a backup singer. Keith's guitar sounds like a grainy piece of crap. On Rocks Off, the Stones' noticeably edited out the \\"and the sunshine bores...\\" verse out of the song. If these flaws weren't enough, the songs have no order or cohesion to them. Honestly, everything that was right about Four Flicks (cohesive, complete concerts with great sound) is wrong with this CD set. Don't waste your money on Live Licks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound but...","review":"Some of the songs & solos are cut short. Great rare stuff that you haven't heard in a while.

You can hear Mick running out of breath on Rocks Off. Everything Stripped was, this isn't. While it is nice to get some of the more obscure songs, this is for only real fans. There are plenty of other better examples of how great the Stones are live."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID ALBUM","review":"I can't stand these moron reviewers who have to critize bands.

Not me! I think it absolutely blows! It's so bad that it made me nostalgic for \\"Love You Live\\".The Stones made some of the greatest studio albums in all of rock history and, in comparison, this is an inexcusably bad addition to their legacy. This release can only be explained as another way to line the pockets of the former glimmer twins - at the expense of the fans.The total running time barely qualifies as a disc and a half and the production quality is pathetic.Yes, I bought it, listened to it twice, and took it straight to the used store as a trade in. If you're still really insistent on hearing live latter day Stones-ish material, then get a copy of Keith's \\"Live At The Hollywood Paladium\\" in 1988 with The Expensive Wino's. That'll cure you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, what is happening here?","review":"First McCartney now the Stones. They feel they need to issue a live record of every tour? The same songs over and over and over again? I dont care how good this album is or if its the best album since get yer yayas out. I am not buying this, I've had enough. Why not giving them for free at the concerts? After you pay 60 dlls for a ticket, a 3 dlls CD is not that much (that's preety much what these things cost to make). Most likely, Mick needs to pay another alimony, or Keith needs some pocket money to hit the strip clubs, and they released this piece of garbage to collect our money. Until they come up with something better, I am listening to Stripped again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things should be left alone - by an old geezer","review":"Imagine my excitement at seeing the second cd in this set, who cannot love Rocks Off - I only get my rocks off while I'm dreaming - or Monkey Man? However our boys are getting old, and while time is on my side it is not on the side of Michael Philip. I was disappointed in this as it lacked the vitality of earlier live albums such as Stripped, Get your Ya-Yas out and Still Life, Got live if you want it. Unless you really need this album then burn a few songs off their earlier live albums and have your own compilation.Sorry Keef, but it's time to hang it up. The memories are great.

I found the first two songs a bit too stylistically different from the rest, maybe they were from an earlier period? Appealing melodies, rhythmically and production quality spot-on tight. Gorgeous sonic textures of guitar, synth, brass and voices. Intriguing and beautiful overlays of e.g. bass and brass. Crisp (real) drumming, no drum machines apart from that mentioned above.

Can be a little overwhelming for someone who's been used to fully automatic point & shoot cameras. JUST DON'T BUY IT RIGHT BEFORE A BIG OR IMPORTANT EVENT. Get it and practice with the features first. The slow shutter features resulted in very blurred pictures of my cousin's wedding ceremony. Great color & light but very blurred.

It is a slow-building, stunningly beautiful song that has an air of resignation in it that is heartbreaking. Although it first came out in 1994, treble charger have re-recorded it for this album, and it makes an excellent addition to an excellent album. The album is uniformly good, but the best songs are \\"Friend of Mine\\", \\"Fade\\" and \\"Ever She Flows\\". The only song I dislike is \\"Christ is on the Lawn\\" because it is a silly title and it drones. Otherwise, the album is fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Redeeming Feature","review":"This album is comprised mostly of forgettable alternative pop. There is, however, one gem to be found on this album. The song entitled, 'Red.' It's a fairly soft song, and quite different from the rest of the album. It's low energy, but very nice in it's simplicity. It has a lead guitar solo which is short, straightforward, but soothing. 'Red' was accompanied by a video that aired on Much Music around the time of the album's release. I don't recommend purchasing the album, but give the song a listen if you have an opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"OEM compliant and a great fit","review":"I purchased this product to replace an original catalytic on my 4Runner, it fit correctly, all the holes lined up and it looked like an exact clone of my original, great job!!!

You can imagine how horrified I was to open a new bag today and find the treats covered with mold. Here is the really bad part. I called Plato to report this and their response was that they knew the batch I had (expiration April 2014) had a mold problem and they have corrected the issue that caused the mold. If they knew about it...WHY did they not notify their distributors to pull these bags from the shelf? The gentleman I spoke to told me he would send me a new bag...not good enough for me..my pet store can give me a new bag in exchange for this contaminated product.

Since one is allergic to chicken my choices are limited. These arrived today and my 3 dogs sniffed them suspiciously. I broke them in half for them and they decided to give them a try. They seemed to like them...they are different then I thought they would be. They are almost the texture of a soft granola bar and not like jerky at all. They are about 2\\" by .5\\" and the contents of the bag were not crumbly like some have described.

I figured when it didn't work with the first one that it was their technique at fault, not the method. After thousands of dollars, not covered by insurance, and absolutely zero results I gave it up. I had chronic back tension which I hadn't had before but no allergy relief. I did try Bowen work, which is a similar idea of opening the energy channels which doesn't involve the spine. After 10 sessions I could grow flowers again and have them in my house, after sneezing for 3 years solid. Another 10 sessions greatly reduced my asthma to managable levels. I didn't have further improvement, but by then I'd moved to another area and I think my Bowen worker had a different technique. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 0 stars-","review":"I didn't read the whole book, but I didn't need to, because what I did read made me feel suckered for buying this book. Drug-free was what I was looking for, but this is too much (or, too little). The muscle testing seemed unlikely enough, but when I got to what the NAET (Nambudripad Allergy Elimination Technique) therapy was about, it sounded even more so: basically, touching \\"reflex areas\\" on the abdomen indicates allergy to a substance being held, then acupressure or acupuncture treatment to that muscle cures the allergy, if you avoid the allergen strictly for 25 hours(p. 205). The author even believes in \\"surrogate testing\\"(p.32)--an adult touches a young child, who is holding a sample of suspected allergen, and the adult is tested for muscle weakness that proves the allergy? Oh, please! Maybe there are other good things in the book, but these methods of diagnosis and therapy seem all wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clinical Phonetics","review":"The book was delivered within a week.

This is not the only book you'll need but it is the one you must have. If you are new to CSS, you'll also be new to it's structure and syntax and this book explains this better than any others I've read. The classification of HTML elements into CSS element types (ie. block vs. inline) is hardly seen elsewhere.I think the extensive discussion on fonts was interesting and required for understanding how to code CSS so the browsers will display what you want or as close as you can get.

If you are serious about learning CSS, you need to understand browser implementations, and practical uses of the CSS spec. For example, the discussion on CSS-Positioning leads one to believe that this will replace HTML table alignment. It gives no indication to the usefullness of CSS-P to DHTML and such effects like drop-down menus.If you want to learn CSS, there are many online resources.

I didn't like the way Christy kept sticking up for her sister, making excuses for her and not believing what people would say about her sister. Too much boring conversation about Indian archaeology. Much of the book wasn't that interesting. Certain scenes didn't make sense for me. For example, Cain asked Christy if she would like to have sex. She said yes, they began, then Cain stopped because he thought she might be using him. The next day, he said he was wrong, and asked if he could he have a second chance. For clarification, this book was originally published in 1993 as The Secret Sisters under the author name of Ann Maxwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This was the first E.

Overall B+."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have read in a very long time","review":"While the plot itself holds some promise, the actual realization of the story is horribly bad with flat stereotypical characters and embarassingly bad romantic scenes. And the secret sister? We never meet her or understand the relationship this book is supposed to be about. The book is just absurd on many levels. I am sorry I did not give up reading when I first felt so inclined, instead following it step by trite step to the very end. I hope I save just one reader from picking this one up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"I'm sorry, but I could just not get into this book at all. It's so implausible, and I couldn't get over it. The main character ends up with the \\"hero\\" after he helps her escape from security guards after an attempted home \\"break-in\\". She does not know this man, but then lets him take her back to his house. An admitted murdered, he then proceeds to order her around and she follows blindly and cheerfully, falling in love with him despite the fact that he has technically kidnapped her. One of her reasons for following along? He wouldn't drive her back to her hotel (she could have walked, no? or called someone from her cell phone, which she uses to check her messages) I found the whole situation to be rather creepy, and the main character to be somewhat stupid. However, she did handle descriptions of the West and the Anasazi artifacts well.I wanted to like this book, but it fell short of my expectations. The whole story seemed kind of flat and uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but not recommended","review":"I've read other Elizabeth Lowell novels some are pretty good but this was is a real dud!

The new edition is well-updated (though John Gotti is now dead, and Vinnie the Chin was recently jailed).Sifakis' book is accurate without being too dull. The Mafia has the potential for humour (albeit rather black humour), as seen in Goodfellas. Sifakis doesn't get as \\"heavy\\" as some other books, narrating stories with a real verve - such as his description of Mad Dog Coll whistling when he heard his boss Maranzano was dead!Sifakis' information is very accurate, and is ideal for a crash course in Mafia history and practices. I am a little hesitant about his insistence that the Mafia is flourishing - it's very hard to tell, but I think most people think the Mafia is dying, and no longer able to maintain its old strangeholds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource and Entertaining!","review":"I love Mafia history.

For those of us with the complete collection already on DVD, there is nothing really new of interest. There is a nice NEW interview of David Selby, but it only runs a few minutes and leaves you wondering what happened to the rest of the interview. Just when you are getting into the interview, it chops off and ends. I guess they will be using the rest of it for some other re-issue down the road. There is also a funny 20 second PBS spot by Selby. Also included a a complete episode from the show. I would have left that off and included more of the interview, at least this way there could have been more new content on the disc. For the common fan who has not purchased all 20+ box sets, this is a good disc to get, but for those of us who regularly watch the episodes already on DVD, this disc will probably sit on a shelf collecting dust after the first viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"ComputerCOP is very good as a way of neatly viewing any picture stored on your computer, but as an internet monitoring program it doesn't work at all.

Truthfully I was bored and finished Jupiter by sheer power of will. The book never took off or found its footing and the payoff was not worth the effort of investing a few hours in this story. There were a few good moments here and there when it came to its descriptions of Jupiter, the titular planet that is \\"stranger than we can imagine\\" but overall this novel was a lot like a car without an engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well imagined!","review":"Reading this novel, I felt like I was transported to a science station orbiting Jupiter. Then, to the roiling sea and storms of Jupiter itself. Bova does a spectacular job of envisioning Jovian life in its extreme environment. The image of the alien protagonist Leviathan will stay with me for quite some time. Jupiter is not without its narrative and character development flaws, but these pale in the broader setting of a story very well told and richly detailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tour-de-force of science and religion","review":"This is the first book I've read by Bova, and I'm determined now that it will not be the last.Being a religious man (though not a fanatic), I am often turned off by most modern science fiction that tries to deal with religious topics. They invariably portray religion as an artifact of our \\"primitive roots\\", and imply (or outright state) that once our civilization matures, there will be no room of religious \\"superstitions.\\" Arthur Clarke is a prime example of this point of view.In \\"Jupter\\", Bova takes a refreshing stand, pointing out that there is no reason that religion and science cannot coexist peacefully. All it takes is an open mind and sufficient faith in God to acknowledge that the scientific principles we are discovering may be the very means by which He works His miracles.I do not know whether Ben Bova is himself a religious man, but I am certainly grateful for his refreshing perspective on science and religion. Three cheers for Bova!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Science Fiction","review":"A throwback to the science fiction I grew up reading - Heinlein, Clarke and \\"newer\\" hard science types like Niven. A fine blend of sociological and scientific extrapolation. Bova's characters may be underdeveloped and lacking depth, but all in all a very good book. Excellent for advanced youth or teenage readers as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best Written Bad Book I've Ever Read","review":"What an agonizing disappointment this book was for me. Ben Bova is an amazing author with great talent. The book instantly caught my interest and kept it rock solid till the end, when I wanted to throw it out the window. It's an adventure novel without any of the satisfaction I get out of most Sci-Fi books. If you looking to explore alien \\"ideas\\", \\"culture\\", and \\"technology\\" don't read this book. Bova has so many unexplored thoughts I wanted to cry. So good yet soooo bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassingly flat","review":"Bova gets points for creating a hero with religious convictions, but beyond that this book was startling in its general lack of imagination. The characters had no dimensionality, the plot seemed predictable, and the spirit of adventure and tense anticipation that could've been created by the exotic setting was M.I.A. In all, a bland and excruciatingly juvenile read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It seemed to be populated by characters I did not care for doing things I found unlikely, such as being only wounded when the submarine springs a leak while crusing in the ocean of Jupiter.It went into the trade-in pile after 150 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy but occasionally exciting","review":"Really unconvincing, stereotype characters with painfully corny dialogue. Solid, tense pacing though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read Bova's books on Mars exploration I was very disappointed in this book. It was not up to the standard he set with Mars and Return to Mars. I found it to be juvenal. It was hard to believe it was written by Bova. The characters were shallow and it contained goofy elements like a talking gorilla and dolphins on the space station. Much of the book was what I consider \\"fill\\". The whole story could be written in a few paragraphs and it was expanded to novel length by silly arguments and conflicts between the shallow characters. I know he can write a good yard and I hope he does better in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-Fi","review":"I was looking to read a good hard Sci-Fi story and Jupiter fits the bill. I enjoyed how Grant maintained his belief and challenged the idea that God could not create intellegent alien life. This novel brings up many interesting questions but at it's heart it is still a Sci-Fi adventure into Jupiter. Bova does a good job of making the reader want to find out what is going to eventually happen when the expedition gets deep into Jupiter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedestrian","review":"This is a first contact novel with a religous dimension. The protagonist is an ernest, actually bland, graduate student detailed to become a spy on a research station orbiting Jupiter. He is supposed to be spying for religous organizations who have come to dominate the politics of most of Earth. These groups are threatened by the discovery of new life forms within the Jovian system and immensely concerned by the possibility that intelligent life will be discovered on Jupiter itself. This is a good foundation for a book; a possibility to explore the relationship of science and religion as well as individual dilemmas of conscience. Instead, this is a conventional adventure story with pedestrian writing. A real lost opportunity. Readers interested in religion and the issues raised by first contact would do well to find a copy of James Blish's A Case of Conscience. This outstanding book, published over 40 years ago, has a similar point of departure, but is immensely superior to Jupiter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bova's best yet!","review":"I have to say this is Bova's best, without a doubt.

This book covers Ttouch, acupressure, acupuncture, shiatsu, theraputic massage, and a variety homeopathic and medicinal treatments.

(Actually, the subject matter is probably a lot more similar than many of us would like to admit, except apes learn that if you hit yourself on the head with a branch and it causes you pain and distress, it's probably a good idea to avoid doing it again - and Hornby would suggest that most blokes haven't quite reached that advanced level of reasoning yet).Highly recommended for anyone in possession of a penis, or anyone else curious about the owners of said organs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie is better","review":"Nick Hornby is a graduate of Cambridge, but the reader would not even begin to suspect that he graduated from Mississippi State as this book is nothing more than most novels published today, screenplay fodder."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most boring book I ever read","review":"The book about Rob Fleming is, in my opinion, bad.

For me it was too pretentious because I did not understand much of the vokabulary.I also find the characters of the main persons strange.

Reading about Rob's feelings and thoughts is interesting, because he discribes them in a very honest way, although he nobody else about them.The difference between what he thinks and what he says makes the dialogues funny to read.One thing I liked about \\"High Fidelity\\", too, is that not only the main characters are described in a very detailed way, but also the minor characters (Barry and Dick rule!), what makes the plot appear credible.I gave the novel four stars, because it's a brilliant book, but the ending is a bit disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight On","review":"'High Fidelity' the movie is one of my alltime favorites and now so is the book.The book is different from the movie in that the main character (Rob)lives in London and thus uses some english phrases not often heard in America such as 'bullocks', 'sraightaway', 'on about', etc. In this way the book was more funny to me.There are also some hilarious scenes that are not in the movie. The book is so much fun to read and I certainly related to Rob and his pessimistic, selfish, cynical views on his world and the people in it. I had to put it down a few times so that I could finish laughing without losing my place. I read the whole thing in two nights... it really is a page-turner.

But the stubborn high prices on ebooks is actually swaying me to NOT buy ebooks, and still even save money by purchasing used for UNDER A DOLLAR.Haha, sorry if this is confusing. I realize that ebook prices are not always Amazon's setting, so no complaints there. Just a general WTF, why is it SO EXPENSIVE rant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Male's Version of a \\"Chick Book\\"","review":"Got the book because I'd seen and enjoyed the movie. But, then, I'm a total hobag for Cusack (and his funny and charming sister, Joan). Alas,I put the book down about 80% through it and have not picked it up since. Go figure. I think this is a \\"chick book\\" for guys. I could not relate to the character, which I suspect is the main charm of the book. The audience (and rightfully so) for this book is, I assume, young men with large record collections (and the men who would love to have large record collections). But, then, I don't expect those same young men to like books similar to this whose target demographic is jaded women.However, that said, Hornby's dialogues are real, his descriptions of the settings vivis and his explorations into human feeling are deeply realized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read!","review":"A quick, fun read with sympathetic characters and great music anecdotes. By the way -- the movie is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining Book","review":"I read Nick Hornby's book High Fidelity which is a comedic book about a guy named Rob who has recently come out of a fairly long relationship. Rob analyzes his past relationships and tries to figure what everything means. From a girls point of view, this book gives you a look at how guys think and deal with relationships. Guys I'm sure will like it because they may have had similar experiences like Rob. I saw the movie before I read the book and I liked them both. However I think that the book is more detailed and funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It","review":"The novel &#65533;High Fidelity&#65533; by Nick Hornby is a true tale of males views towards the opposite sex and the understanding of relationships. Hornby puts the main character &#65533;Rob&#65533; through an all out search for love and how to find happiness. This novel will have you laughing as you follow Rob through his top five worst break ups while he seeks for what went wrong in these relationships. With this light humor, it very easily sucks you into the tangled web of Rob&#65533;s life. If you&#65533;ve seen the movie and liked it you must read this excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the kind of book I was looking for","review":"It was like reading a 'Catcher in the Rye' written by Murakami Haruki.

I want to understand myself and women in a relationship - as Rob does.We both have a great sense of humour - as Rob does. All our friends have now read this book too, and we all agree it's all true"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of the top","review":"High Fidelity by Nick Hornby is not a very interesting novel because it doesn't have much suspense and there are long passages in which he describes the shop or something else. That is boring but there are also a few funny passages, even if they are rare.The main plot is that Rob Fleming is dumped by all of his girlfriends and now he wants to see them again.Rob is a \\"macho\\" because he is egocentric and doesn't think about his girlfriends' emotions and thoughts.Laura, his last split-up dumped him because he didn't develop and she couldn't cope with this situation any longer.The language the book is written in is very colloquial. Rob speaks like a teenager. He isn't very respectful and mature. The language reinforces this and it shows Rob's emotions. This is typical of him.All in all, I think the book has a few funny passages but exept of these it is boring, but readers who like stories of not much suspense and many descriptions would like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Music Lover's Favorite!","review":"Nick Hornby takes the \\"geek-ishness\\" of avid music lovers and weaves a funny story of loves lost and the soundtrack to life. Each new character is described by the movies and music they love, which makes perfect sense to pop-culture junkies.It reads quickly and fluidly once you find the character's voices. The London vernacular and slang take a few pages to get used to, but once I read the book with an \\"English accent\\", the characters took immediate shape and depth.I would describe it as the man's take on Bridget Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Fidelity","review":"On the one hand I didn't like the book but on the other hand it was okay. Nick Hornby is a good author, I think, and he is very creative. His speech is funny and varied. He has chosen many different and also extreme characters. \\"High Fidelity\\" isn't a book like others. I think it is both, a diary and a novel because you find out a lot about Rob's thoughts and feelings.But what I didn't like was Rob's character. He often is selfish and egocentric. He can be a real macho and isn't interested in someone else than himself. But after a while ha changes. It seems as if he has matured. He develops from a boy to a man.All in all the book isn't the worst I have ever read. It has a few boring passages bur if you don't take Rob seriously the book is funny, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"1. It is very original; 2.

It was witty, exploring with a keen eye relationships and the reasons why men and women get together, and sometimes drift apart.'this is so nothing' yes i know hes successful......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I thought Nick's life was really depressing, even though it's probably the truth. I mean, his relationship is falling apart, he works in a record store and well, he doesn't think about anything besides his past failures. Also, he kept talking and talking about music, and which kinds are 'cool' or whatever. Overall, I really felt down in the dumps after reading this book because it made me wonder if my future will be like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Depressing...","review":"Ok now here is one book that is so sad it will make you want to snuff it!

It was an easy read, but did not deliver any of the promised wit and sparkle. In fact, it was rather dull. The arguments over musical taste were the highpoints, but otherwise, the characters and events were flat and boring. Plus the constant self-bashing, supposed to elicit sympathy from the reader, was pathetic. And no human being, no matter how dim witted, would lie in a muddy flower patch in their only suit to avoid being seen by an ex-girlfriend. No wonder she chucked him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob's psyche nearly mirrors my own!","review":"Hornby's book was a wonderful look into my own mind.

Loved them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightening!","review":"If your in your mid thirties and wondering why life isn't turning out quite the way you dreamt as a kid, read this book. A wonderfully crafted tale that strikes a chord on every page. It allows you not just to see the thoughts of the central character but to believe in them, to really feel their authenticity and the reasonableness, even inevitability, of their illogicallity. It casts a light on the thin line between success and failure, choices, the path dependency of life in general, hopes and regrets.

But he is a man, and men love their albuns and comics (and anything that can be collected) more them admit to love women. Men are just like children in a certain point. If you're a man, you know what i'm talking - but probably desagree. If you're a woman, you also know, and you hate men when they demonstrate that they can love their comics pretty much more than they love you. So Rob is just like me (and just like you, if you're a man). High Fidelity is about a 30 year old man that is understanding how much fool he is. And he loves rock. I love when the main characters learn things. As in The Catcher's in the Field of Rye (or something like it).

Hornby's ability to find the humor in all of our human frailties and the common struggles we all go through make the story of Rob's failing music store and love life a universal reflection of our own lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"High comedy with High Fidelity","review":"Nick Hornby's book is a must-read for any man, woman or child who has ever encountered that fanatical zeal common to musicians and record collectors alike. Having lived with a musician for years, and having a father with a record collection that is slowly taking over the house, I found this book with it's cast of characters somewhat re-assuring, as well as a damned good read. I love Nick Hornby, his characters are the Bridget Jones' of the male world: full of insecurities, obsessions and neuroses but ultimately lovable for all of the above. Read it and laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read, some thought provoking too.","review":"Never saw the movie from start to finish, so the book was fresh for me.

Yet, the upbeat, jazz-like rhythm of the intro gradually stumbles into a series of indistinguishable vignettes that progressively stunts any kind of character development, and leaves you totally indifferent about Rob's outcome.

It was witty, funny, enjoyable and engrossing. So I bought the book thinking that a book is also better than the movie, especially when the book came first. At first it was enjoyable, very similar to the movie, but the I came upon many scenes that had been left out of the movie, and for good reason. By the time I had gotten two thirds of the way through I had gotten so sick and tired of it that I had to put it down. In the movie you liked and hated Robert, but in the novel you just hate him. I could barely relate to his bleal outlook on everything, and many of the \\"humorous\\" lines which appeared in the movie and the novel didn't have the same feeling in the novel, the came off as sad sayings of sad people, not as abnormal sayings from abnormal people, which in essence is better than the former. It was in whole a dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top 5 Books to avoid","review":"The first chapter gives it hope that dimishes to a yawn by the second chapter.

I found this book extremely pretentious and boring. The theme of losers content with being losers is in all of these \\"slacker contemporary novels,\\" and it's getting so tiresome.

But who cares about the life of a midage loser called Rob, who lives in a small flat in a underpriviliged area of London. Do the problems of him really matter to me? I don't think so....but if you are in your midlife crises and you haven't enough problems by yourself, you should read this novel to get aware of Rob's sad life. May be you can relate with him. But if you are a younger person it is hard to beliefe in the things which are explained by Nick Hornby. Finally a little hint. If you are still interested in the story you should watch the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad...","review":"I don't like the book because it's too introspective. For me, the main character Rob Flemming is not very symathic and I can't identify myself with him. The story is very boring and too long. The only character I like is Barry, Rob's friend, because he's funny. I think, even a mathbook is better than this book. I would only read the book when I would live alone on an Island and this would be the only readable thing, and even then I would prefer to light a fire with this book. I gave this book one star, because of the character Barry, the rest is [bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Fidelity went a bit too long.","review":"High Fidelity started out telling the story of a young man and his two friends that all worked together in a record shop that the main character owned. They were men but sounded more like overgrown teenagers. They thought they all wanted to meet the right woman but when any woman entered their lives they immediately wondered what they might be missing out on. None of the characters had done much growing by the end and quite frankly it all got pretty boring and I was rushing for the ending. You get a feeling that the author really has a talent for writing but hasn't quite reached his potential. I had planned on giving this book three stars but that seemed a bit much. I read this book because I had previously read \\" How To Be Good\\" and I wouldn't recommmend either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"In conclusion I can say that Nick Hornby\`s book is not the type of book I like to read. In the book there are too many moods and thoughts and nothing really happens. You could take out half of the pages and you would not have problems to understand the book. The only really funny person in the book is Barry. He made me laugh one or two times when he made jokes about people who came into the shop. The funniest scene in the book is when Ian calls Rob and Rob thinks about some possibilities what he could say to Ian. I think that this book is for women because it has no plot but lots of \\"grease\\", thoughts and moods as in Titanic. I would say to every man who wants to read the book: \\"Leave it\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it! Read it!","review":"This is my first Nick Hornby book. I also have seen the movie based on the book several times and would say that it makes my \\"top five\\" movies, or at least top five comedies. With that experience, I have John Cusack and Jack Black quotes burned in my head and I was acutely aware of the differences between the book and movie (it does transfer well, though). So I enjoyed the book immensely but made comparisons throughout.The book has perhaps a little more acid to it - it's in a gritty part of London and the protagonist comes across as, well, less nice and less attractive than Cusack. I am not saying this is bad - the book perhaps has a more realistic feel to it. Hornby has a sharp wit and gets inside the 30 year old unmarried male brain perfectly. The book's language, while not particularly sophisticated (we are talking about an non-college educated record shop owner), flows nicely.Read this book (add a bullet for emphasis)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, Boys, the Secret's Out","review":"If you're a woman looking for insight into a man's mind that isn't some stupid Cosmo magazine thing, you have two great options right now: Hornby's High Fidelity and Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf. If you're a man, you should read them too, because you'll completely identify (my boyfriend did). Both books are dead-on hilarious portayals of the way slacker generation guys think, and both are my favorite books of the last three years -- intelligent, well-written, funny novels that confirm your best hopes about literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but essentially shallow","review":"It's easy to read and mildly amusing, but all these devotees of \\"High Fidelity\\" should read some classic literature before they start gushing about its deep insight into the male psyche.

The book is amusing, but remains on the level of a simple statement of facts (or observations) and never analyses any of them.

Lots of froth, but little or no beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm doing this for my Major themes in Literature class.","review":"Nick Hornby's High Fidelity was a laugh not only for its humor but also for its accuracy in portraying that segement of the male population that is utterly neurotic and wrapped up in some silly facet of pop culture as if it was what really defined them.

It did indeed possess comic elements, but to label this a comedy is missing the point. Rather it is a four-hour therapy session(or however long it takes you to read this book), poking and prodding the ins and outs of relationships between men and women. The book was not so much eye-opening as it was startlingly accurate. Rob is without a doubt one of the most concrete characters to come out of recent fiction. Still, I felt that the author let us down at the end, in not having Rob stay true to form. I can say no more without spoiling.

However amusing the content is, the book also has very serious aspects within... you'll have to read it for yourself to enjoy it the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really interesting","review":"I tend to read books from the female perspective but I like Hornby's insights on the English male perspective. As a musicholic who is married to a bigger musicholic I could relate, Having been in many independent record stores he was dead on with the descriptions of the characters and their obsessions with record buying and lists of favorites. Again he creates an interesting character study.

I flew through it in 2 days - would have finished it in 1 if not for babysitting. Suffice it to say, it proves to be a quick, easy, and hilarious page-turner. Hornby writes with his witty, British style that makes for a book that you will enjoy and fly through in a short amount of time.I particularly enjoyed the sadistic dialogue between Rob and his 2 dim-witted Championship Vinyl employees Dick and Barry. The totally unoriginal name for Barry's band made me laugh out loud seeing as it fit with his obtuse character - Barrytown. \\"Be afraid. Be very afraid. Here comes Sonic Death Monkey!\\" As Rob undergoes his belated rite of passage, he inversely states his previous motto into \\"It's not what you like, it's what you're like.\\" Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining read.","review":"This is probably one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in a long time.

I simply could not put this book down once I had picked it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"It changed my life","review":"What a great book. Some of my friends whom I've lent this book to have failed to relate as closely as I do, while others keep \\"forgetting\\" to give it back. I read it all in one sitting one night, ignoring my wife and children as they went through dinner, their nightly routines, and bedtime. A classic \\"guy\\" book. Superb use of writing techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the greatest books ever written","review":"In my humble opinion, this book captures the spirit of human subconcious and hidden idiosyncrasies more than any other has for me. I found myself, throughout the book, relating the character to myself and realizing that much of it was descriptions about those little things that many of us think but wouldn't admit to in a million years. It was almost comforting to read because it captures all of those things we keep hidden in fear that if they were exposed we would die a lonely unloved hermit. Bravisimo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The male Bridget Jones","review":"Definately one for the boys this one. I know a few men who Rob was so like in a number of ways. Thats not to say of course that being a woman I didn't enjoy this. Hornby has such a great writing style and wit that I did find it hard not to laugh out loud at the absurdity the situations he got himself and the musical snobbery. A book that is funny, honest and at times touching and which I suspect, Mr Hornby, was fairly autobiographical. You can't really ask for much more from a novel really can you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Then she asked me why I liked the book","review":"I recommended this book to someone I knew only through correspondence. When we finally met, she asked me (accusingly) why I thought she'd like the book, and indeed why I liked it. I knew then that things were going downhill. The main character, Rob, and his self-centered stumbling through life provide valuable lessons in how people view themselves and the world. Hornby gives away insights to male thinking that are tantamount to State Secrets of the Species. Have you ever kicked yourself for screwing up a perfectly good relationship? Read this book and feel a bit better about yourself knowing you were not the only one to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Romance","review":"High Fidelity is a glimpse into the way REAL relationships work. Throughout, the narrator, Rob, contradicticts the reality of love with the fantasy that he always thought love was. There are the mundane details of the break-up and the move out, plus the \\"lets still be friends\\" attempts that never work. Occasionally Rob seems like a bit of a dolt, and this observation makes one not always totally sympathetic towards him. His life seems to be drifting along and he doesn't seem to care either way. But this is the character and at least he is honest. I wouldn't call High Fidelity a \\"page turner\\". But it certainly is an easy read and a good one at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, Clever, and Fun","review":"The book is witty and very clever. The writer has a knack for being funny and lighthearted while making meaningful statements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good philosophical passages, but boring plot","review":"The book \\"High Fidelity\\" is about a guy called Rob, who talkes about his girlfriends and ex-girlfriends through the whole book. It's also a little bit philosophical, because he talks about death.I didn't like the book very much, because there's only a simple, short plot, and a lot of thinking passages. The story wasn't that interesting, but Rob's attitude towards and thoughts about philosophical themes were sometimes really interesting.Because these good and boring passages exchange I would give the book two stars.**"},{"rating":"1","title":"Middle good","review":"I would give \\"High Fidelity\\" two Stars. \\"High Fidelity\\" has not such an innovative and fascinating plot that you could give it more than two stars. But the plot is not so bad that you would have to give less than two stars. I think it is a middle good book. And because of that I give it two stars. I would not say that it is a must to read it, but you could read it if you like lovestorys and storys in which a character changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, painful and above all very recognizable","review":"Rob Fleming is in his thirties and the owner of an obscure music shop with 2 nerdy employees somewhere in north London. When his girlfriend Laura leaves him for the neighbour upstairs he looks back on his life, and especially on (the endings of) his relationships: what did he want from the relationships, when and why did things go wrong, how did or didn't he react. When Laura and Rob get back together, we follow the re-start of their relationship.The book is terribly funny, but also terribly recognizable. I bet most people of Rob's age will recognize at least part of Rob's behaviour as being very similar to how they react in such situations. Thus the book also works as a mirror that leads the readers to reflect on their own way to cope with one of the most important aspects of life: the way in which they interact with other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passionate about Life but annoyed by everything","review":"When I was 15, I thought music, cool music that is, was the most important thing in the world. The characters in this book still do and the results are hilarious. Read the first 20 pages and Rob's analysis of the previous relationships in his life will slay you. He is a self-centered dope, but his observations are so keen, so right on, so flavored with amusing top-5 lists (about anything), that you have to love him. He is completely obsessional, but at least he understands this, and it is this understanding that drives the book of this loser. Read it. You'll love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice effort","review":"i happened to hear a couple of their songs through one the sites i frequent. I decided to buy the cd based on that experience and that turned out to be a good move.

It's great for the time period that it was filmed and this should be the prospective with which to watch the movie. Having said that...I'm not certain if any editing was done from the version originally released 40yrs ago. I've heard that this is done when older films are released on DVD, which is a disappointment. The original should be left untouched. Since I have no comparison, the rating I gave it is based on my viewing this movie for the 1st time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't aged well","review":"The song is so famous I thought the movie would be interesting. Sadly it wasn't much more than a weak slapstick Benny Hill like comedy except with hot 60s women. Pluses for that but pretty dorky. Hopefully the song is not tainted for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funniest Movie Of All Time","review":"I have been a Peter Sellers fan since the age of 10. This movie is just plain hilarious. From the first scene to the last you will be rolling on the floor. You must listen to the dialogue carefully to catch the subtle parts! Every character plays their part with perfection. The overall atmosphere is very european, taking you back to a simpler and happier time. This is one movie you can watch hundreds of times and never become bored. Purchase this treasure and keep it in your video collection for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"second best movie of the 60s","review":"I consider this to be the second best movie of the 60s. The best is Casino Royal. This is the first comedy movie written by Woodie Allen and it shows great hand crafting with many little details. There are several sub plots that interweave and come together in the last 15 minutes. One of the most amusing parts is the famous homosexual woman, Capucine, playing a heterosexual nymphomaniac."},{"rating":"1","title":"This definitely was not a 'funny' movie","review":"And by funny I mean funny 'ha ha'. It had a funny beginning, but that was it. Very disappointed in buying this one, I thought that since Peter Sellers and Woody Allen was in it, it would be funny, but it wasn't. No funny lines, or any creative situations. Pretty bland movie. I'll have to stick to movies by Blake Edwards instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing's New","review":"The funniest part of this movie is the first 2 minutes of classic Sellers' comedy. After that it goes downhill fast and becomes a disjointed attempt to amuse. What was I thinking when I bought this one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"My \\"What's New, Pussycat?\\" Review","review":"Now HERE'S an absolutely uproarious 60's comedy featuring Peter Sellers at his peak and Woody Allen's first screenplay to a major motion picture. I also highly recommend Casino Royale, which also features Peter Sellers, Woody Allen, Capucine, and Ursula Andress (great cast, eh?). Although not rated, this film would probably be rated PG-13. It doesn't have much profanity or any nudity, but it contains adult themes that might confuse younger viewers. Woody Allen gets the most laughs in this movie, which came as no suprise to me when I first saw it. Highlights include Peter Sellers and Woody Allen one-on-one, and the ending is golden. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILLARIOUS 60's romp!!!!!!!","review":"This is a great movie with wonderful performances by O'Toole and Sellers. It is a must see movie for any fan of goofy 60's movies. It is worth watching just to see Sellers in his velvet suit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe it or not... it's terrible.","review":"The year: 1965. The cast: Peter Sellers. Peter O'Toole. Woody Allen. Ursula Andress. The soundtrack: Burt Bacharach. Tom Jones. Dionne Warwick. Manfred Mann. The movie: Believe it or not -- terrible. Really... as in unwatchable (other than the relatively entertaining animated opening credits.) Painfully unfunny slapstick routines, actors seemingly reading their lines off of cue cards, and no plot to speak of. Not even fun to watch for 60's camp value like The Party or Casino Royale...

I even tried to just watch a little each day, to see if there was anything remotely funny in it. I finally gave up yesterday, and erased it. I actually felt sorry for Peter O'Toole, that he had to do the unfunny things he had to do in this movie. Life is too short to sit through this thing. Amazing that some people think it's great. Unbearably bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful,, exhilarating \\"psychoanalytic\\" comedy","review":"Peter Sellers as well as Peter O'Toole and all the beautiful women: Capucine, Romy Schneider, etc, make ot his movie an extraordinary satire of the 60's. Was really that world that mad? Of course! You couldn't stand life without a psychonalist. Thus, the film reflects precisey that. The lack of self-confidence, the incapacity of accepting the values of that decade, till -happy ending, of course- O'Toole and Schneider get married and lived happily everafter. And everybody has surpassed their personal crises. Good for the movie. The humour is just wonderful.

It was one of my favorites when I was a kid after watching it hundreds of times on Showtime. It stuck with me and eventually became a huge influence on me and my franchise Gates, which is an online comic and transmedia franchise. The first part, the comic, is presented by Heavy Metal Magazine. [...]The story, the characters and the animation are really tight and very reflective of the 80's. Some people call it a Star Wars rip off but I feel it has many nods to classic sci-fi. And a dude falls in love with a robot chick so how bad could it be? Anyway, love this movie, it holds a dear place in my heart. Highly recommend.Thanks,Hal Hefner"},{"rating":"2","title":"starchaser","review":"I have been looking for this movie for several years.

Purple were on all cylinders, improvising and playing like no one's business. Personally, I'd rather hear Mandrake Root or Wring that Neck instead of the Mule or Space Trucking. Black Night is amazing with Ritchie stretching out - could be the best version ever! This version of Mandrake Root is without a doubt the best version ever!! Absolutely amazing! I'm not going to say that Speed King is better than Highway Star or Into the Fire makes one forget about Smoke on the Water or that this version of Child in Time is better than Made in Japan's, but I just think that once you have heard MIJ a dozen times, this album makes a great alternative.

One of the rare books that does not try to make it sound extraordinary; on the contrary, Mr Coleman's tone is simple and humorous. You just cannot put the book aside ... More than the witty writer, there is the profound, humble and kind human being and the wonderful teacher: a Vipassana meditation course as taught by Saya John E. Coleman, in the tradition of Sayagi U Ba Khin (his teacher) leaves an indelible impression. His teaching is unique and beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Testimony","review":"I have been seriously meditating over 17 years, and only discovered Vipassana a coupla years ago. Where have you been all my life? I appreciate Coleman's quest for a quiet mind, and I could write of such a journey myself. This book is a short tome covering several spiritual paths. I do somewhat agree with one of the reviewers who laments that it is superficial. I wish Coleman would have gone into much more detail of his experiences; he leaves the reader panting for more. Again, he doesn't say a lot about Vipassana. He would probably agree with me - it is something to be experienced, rather than read about. Read this book and take the 10 day course offered at several locations throughout the U.S. and the world. Very, very powerful; a life-changing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your bucks","review":"A real superficial survey of meditation techniques that the author tried to try out but never got anywhere with. The author is a typical American - intellectually lazy, privilidged and full of self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor","review":"I had this book for a class last spring. It is apparently one of the few books available on this subject so the instructor didn't have a lot of choices. The book is very poorly written. There are sentences in this book that are an entire paragraph long. An editor is needed to bring much of the list-type material into a table or organized bullet points.The point the author makes about the diversity of elders is well taken, but does it need to be repeated hundreds of times under every category? A special note to the author: Get an editor and listen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nihilism that isn't","review":"This book was fantastic in almost ever way. The plot was complicated and interesting. The characters a bit exaggerated, but solid. Motivations always lined up well with actions. And dig that authentic lingo!However, the best part of the book for me was it's virtual lack of any underlying moral judgment. Characters are shown as they are and their actions are presented without prejudice. No philosophical asides here. I found it extremely refreshing to be able to evaluate the morality of the characters without any sort of leading by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth about the Kennedy assassination","review":"A great book with a detailed view of the fifties, up to the assassination. A real inside look at the America of that era.Howard Hughes, Jimmy Hoffa, J. Edgar Hoover, the Kennedy brothersare all part of the script. A clear explanation of how the assassination was done and how it was covered up. An eye-opening book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great conspiracy theory. . . Thrilling!","review":"This is Ellroy at his finest -- he's a fantastic writer, certainly one of the best of our era. This novel assumes a broader perspective than his L.A. Quartet. His versions of JFK, RFK, Howard Hughes, and J. Edgar Hoover, the Bay of Pigs, etc. make for an intriguing look at American history! When I read this, I couldn't put it down and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of the decade","review":"Ellroy has an incredible gift. He can make history come alive for people who, like myself were not born for over 20 years after the events in this book took place. Granted that this is a work of fiction, it brings the feel of the times to the forfront with amazing style and grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellroy at his peak.","review":"James Ellroy and I share the same age, and many of the same experiences. Of all the books I've read of the tumultuous 60's American Tabloid stands alone at the top. (The rest of the trilogy is damn good, but American Tabloid is the best of the three.) It captures with perfect beats the times, the moods, the insanity and the changing of the guard. Also, happens to be the most convincing theory on the JFK assassination I've come across. It redefines the term page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellroy has myth of camalot destroyed with a nail studded bat","review":"American Tabloid is the most grusome book I have ever read. This is not a bad thing as the story takes the reader on an adventure of being inside the inner circle of Howard Hughes. The book is spellbinding in its violence. The political intrigue is solid as a brick wall. Also the nasty details of Jimmy Hoffa make the charactor more realistic. Big Pete Boudurant is the most entertaining of all the charactors as he rubs elbows and wisecracks with the elite of hollywood and washington."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but just misses greatness","review":"Ellroy is certainly a master of his medium - that is never in dispute. However, this book is in daanger of losing the reader with all of the subplots and supporting characters. Also, the characterisation is a bit sketchy. Perhaps I'm rating more against what I would have expected as opposed to how good the book actually is. Again, as with all Ellroy novels - it's worth reading for the payoff and seeing each character trying to redeem themselves before it's too late. Not bad, certainly an interesting view of recent American history. Definately worth a read - but the LA Quartet was far superior"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had To Give Up On It!","review":"When I first started reading American Tabloid I thought I was in for a real treat. However, after reading a few hundred pages, I started to realize I didn't care about the characters due to the one-dimensionality Ellroy gives them. Further, the plot, while moving at a fast-pace, was not well-developed and I was really tiring of Ellroy's writing style. While I pushed myself to read further(largely because I had already bought Ellroy's sequel to American Tabloid, The Cold Six Thousand), I finally had to give up on it after getting to the half way point. Now I have to see if I can exchange The Cold Six Thousand. I know many of you reading this review will be skeptical given the many very favorable reviews previously written about American Tabloid. The only thing I can say to this is if you feel you must read this book, take it from the library. Please don't waste your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every good writer is entitled to...","review":"...one poor book. And this is Ellroy's. Pretentious nonsense populated by one-dimensional psychopaths and their supposedly sophisticated, but actually incredibly silly, women. \\"Love\\" comes out of nowhere, at the drop of a hat. A weak-sister FBI agent begins a \\"relationship,\\" out of the blue, with a physically scarred girl who, up until that moment, had been his de facto niece. She writes him a note that begins \\"School bodes.\\" School bodes?! And she cries the first time he touches her scars. Yuck! Give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hardboiled for its own damn good","review":"This novel is fun for a couple of hundred pages, but Ellroy gets lost somewhere along the way. The plot took so many twists and turns that I decided to just go along rather than make myself seasick trying to keep the big picture in mind. One of the book's best points, the fact that it puts a human face on the mythology of the Kennedy era, is also a weakness: who cares what happens to these scumbags? Ellroy's perspective is interesting and his (near-)complete lack of moral judgment is impressive. It's too bad his self-indulgent badass style gets in the way; some sections are so clunky, they come off as self-parody. Still, if you don't let these things bother you, it's not a bad ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"started off rather interesting...","review":"Started off rather interesting, but degenerated into absurd non-stop cussing and comic book-style violence. It seems that every paragraph or two people were getting their teeth knocked out and getting casually executed by the \\"heroes\\". I finally discarded the stupid thing when Super-Pete knocked out this guy's teeth, and then kicked him in the balls, just to \\"test\\" him, to see if he was OK. What a crock! This guy should be writing comic book story lines, or wrestling scripts for the WWF.I also strongly object to his falsification of history, taking real people and putting them into his fictitious \\"docudrama\\" to get their teeth knocked out...I was overly generous and rated it a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The book was long. The price too high. Six hundred pages of writing like this. I want a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding book by an outstanding writer","review":"It has been interesting to see Ellroy's writing evlolve into being perhaps the finest example of modern noir. While more conventional than White Jazz, American Tabloid brings together all of the elements that have made the JFK legend what it is today. A remarkable achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing! Every character is not worth a penny!!","review":"Unbeliavable! Ellroy wrote a book where 99,9% of all characters are vile and mean, totally indecent and immoral, including the ones with real names!Kemper Boyd and Pete Bondurant are pure killers and even when Ellroy talks about the background of these characters, we simply can not care about their welfare: we just despise them. Ward Littel begins with a little more possibility of being a good man, but soon is also lost to \\"evil\\"...Totally original here is the courage to introduce real life characters as Hoover and the Kennedy brothers and insert dialogues in their mouths freely. Amazing technique, it works wonderfully!This is a great book, but don't go for it expecting to find nice words or poetry..it's about a society nasty, cheap and corrupt.By the way, even before reading this book, is there someone else out there that still thinks that Lee Oswald acted alone...?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut wrenching reading","review":"This novel about secret governmental departments and their unexpected activities is superbly written and rivets the reader to each page. Packed with action and nostalgia over history long past, it strikes chord after chord, as familiar events are given a violent twist by this story telling genius.Other reviews detail the characters and style; I can only add that I was astounded by the brilliance in which this novel was researched, written, and organized.In terms of crime drama, its tops, and a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid trash","review":"I heard an enthusiastic review on NPR calling it the best novel of the year! It is far from that. Even allowing for the subject matter (greed-violence-corruption) it is poorly written and only adds to our cynicism about our nation's recent history. I was very disappointed in the lack of imagination and poor handling of character in thiss tabloid novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting so much.....","review":"When I first picked up American Tabloid I expected the history lesson on the 50's and 60's that I didn't get in high school, instead I got something that is simply unreadable. The characters are exceptional and I found the progression of the plot to be good as well however the style of Ellroy is one that I have to admit I simply couldn't get past. I wanted to love this book but in the end it wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect title","review":"It reads like a long tabloid. I've never read any of Ellroy's books but I liked the movie LA Confidential. I had seen a program featuring Ellroy and didn't think much of him...but he can write. In this book there is a huge amount of violence/action, but so..so repetitious. And there are no good guys. Really. I kept putting it down, picking it up, putting it down... It's not horrible, but there's really nothing to reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"check your morals at the door","review":"This is a good book--if you're the kind who likes to stop and look at car wrecks. There's a murder a minute, and some multiple murders to make up for any minutes without one. I'm hardly a prude, considering \\"The Choirboys,\\" is one of my favorite novels, but this thing is loaded with gratuitous violence. The best novels are like long love affairs. This is a long, bloody road leading to nowhere, like a lengthy meaningless series of questionable, if not dangerous, sexual encounters with ugly people because you don't have the clout to rein in anyone better. the random madness can hardly be considered a plot, and you wouldn't mind if a nuclear strike took out all the characters in the book. I only gave it any stars at all because it was fascinating in its unbridled ugliness, and I had to keep slogging through to see what dead end lay ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the wrong flag, IMAGE IS NOT CORRECT","review":"hi, genius the EU flag has 12 starts in which ALL STARS FACE IN THE SAME DIRECTION"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book. I've been reading about the US Civil War lately, and I started wondering about American society prior to the Civil War, which is why I picked up this book. This book is just a wealth of interesting information. Best of all, it is written in a very engaging style. When I read a book like this, I'm amazed out how an author can make what could be a dry subject (after all, it is history) into something fascinating. It is written with a very Howard-Zinn-Peoples-Historyish flavor, which also appeals to me. It is always an eye-opener to see the devastation that has been inflicted on the Native Americans by American colonization.I am already looking forward to re-reading this book at some point."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same!","review":"The reviews of this book are greater entertainment than actually reading the book. It makes for hard going, however, the insights into the true American history are many. The threads of the migration of the indigenous population is more than fascinating and should be included in every textbook in schools. Yet the main disappointment, other than the fact many have complained about (ie: the death of Kamehameha), is that this a more of a professorial dissertation rather than a vibrant book, which a friend of mine from the long ago and faraway, Roxie Yonkey, also noted.

Oh and I forgot -the most unbelievable European accents ever to be mangled by otherwise fine actresses. The only departments to acquit themselves well were the wardrobe and props which are delightfully 1970's kitch. Finally, though I do not know much of the American legal system, whoever heard of a potential witness of fact for the defence trying to double as a lawyer?

There hasn't been a better pop song written than Don't Be Cruel, while the atmospheric Heartbreak Hotel still has the same impact when played today as it did in 1956 - an astonishing vocal performance by a barely 21 year old singer on the verge of greatness.

We have a Golden Retriever and needless to say we are amazed, every time we vacume, in the amount of hair it picks up. We have had this vacume since the beginning of April and use it no less than 3 times per week. I suffer from allergies and have seen my symtoms decrease in severity. If there is one thing I could change is the way you empty the container. I do not recommend emptying indoors or into a shallow bag because you still get the \\"plume\\" of dust. The container design is much better than other bagless vacumes, but there is still room for improvement (that is why I did not score it a 5 star).

The dyson dc15 is just awesome with the best \\"sucking\\" power out of all of the vacuums I've used. The construction of the \\"ball\\" vacuum is top notch. You could see its quality by just looking at the hosings, casings, and construction. You will need few vacuuming tries to get used to the \\"ball\\" movement...but after you get the hang of it, it is really easy. Ergonimics of the vacuum is also top notch. My recommendation: buy a dyson, vacuum your home with your old vacuum, then vacuum again with the \\"ball\\"...you will be amazed to see how much gets accumulated in the canister. As for the ease of cleaning, it is easy as pushing a button on top of your garbage can.

The stabiliser wheels are a bitch to operate, unless your feet are tiny - your toes get caught in the small space. the jolly green giant probably would find 'the ball' a doddle to manoeuvre - which it is if you're about 240 pounds. If you don't use the brushbar button, 'the ball' screams like a raptor in labour. But it doesn't lose suction. Not a sausage. My advice is:take weights training for six months or so, then buy 'the ball'. otherwise, it'll break yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I clean houses for a living, and I have used every kind of vacuum there is. All styles and brands. I have to say that this is the worst vacuum I have ever used. I have used both the ball version and the normal upright one. Although I dislike both, this is the worst of the two. This vacuum is way too heavy for the average women. Not only for carrying up stairs, but also for just pushing. After an hour of pushing this vacuum, my arm is very sore. I find the ball movement very akward too. It does not make movement easier in my opinion. It is a heavy, bulky, machine that is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype +Little Action +BIG chunk of change=LAME","review":"I've heard it all before about Dysons being great and above and beyond so I went with this one.

I looked at the salesguy and scoffed and decided that the yellow Ball performed better even though it felt awkward. This is hardly amazing and quite loud. When used on hardwood it makes an even more anmnoying sound. Not worth the monkey at all! below par, and very bulky.

Either that or everyone is afraid to say they got robbed!!! This is the most expensive piece of junk I have ever bought. First, it weighs too much. You have to really lug it around and it's HEAVY. Which also means if you accidently bump into furniture, and who doesn't, it can knock something off. Getting it up stairs requires a moving van. The attachments are cumbersome and exceedingly hard to use. You have to disconnect this and that and this and that to get the attachments on. It does get to the dust really well, but so did my electrolux. And although it makes alot of noise the suction isn't any better than a high quality vacuum you get at Sears for half the price. Do yourself a favor before you buy. Try it if you can.

With a baby in one hand, there is no way to fold the stroller. Even with two hands, it's quite difficult. You have to jam it into the ground, which wears it out. Given that it's not easy to take anywhere, it's not worth owning. I would suggest you get a stroller that has an easy-fold option. This stroller can be bought for $65 on many websites and is discontinued. If you plan to keep the stroller in the garage and take it out from there (and never put it in the trunk or fold it), I'd say go for it. For $65 it's fine until you have to transport it. It steers well, but the wheels will need oil to stock squeaking. I do think that the brake bar is too near my feet so it's awkward to walk, however.

The saw works great and the cuts are very accurate. Unfortunately, I also used it to make some cuts on some old subflooring that had floor leveling compound on it.

So unless you are making a 4, 5, 6, 8, or 12-sided item, you're out of luck. I needed to do 42 and 21-degree cuts. No dice.But don't worry, it won't even do a 90-degree cut correctly. The stock I tested it on did the 90-degree cross-cut OK, but it also added a 2-degree bevel. So if you-re planning on doing any work with stock much more than 1/8-inch thick, things will never fit together properly.This is probably due to the lame mounting of the vertical guide rods. The included allen wrench was make of metal so soft that by the time I finished tightening (finger tight only) the set screws for those guides, I had managed to put a 240-degrees of twist on the wrench.This \\"tool\\" is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic in all the wrong places","review":"I bought this stanley miter product to replace my Craftsman clamping miter, which I recently ran over with my car.

(My old Craftsman was all-metal and endured lots of projects before it met its untimely demise at the hands of mr. goodyear...)Now, the blade guides can get torqued on with some significant forces. Bad idea to make these plastic. (I won't even mention the other plastic clamping parts.) In fact, the one I bought had these broken inside the sealed box. I suspect it was a return item .

I purchased this model at Lowe's for $50. First thing I noticed was the \\"cam\\" clamps left indents in the moulding rails when enough pressure was applied to keep the wood from shifting while sawing. Second thing I noticed was it was nigh on impossible to get a square cut on small (1 inch) picture frame moldings. So the joins are not perfect enough to pass my standards. While a 1/64 inch gap on a 45 miter may be fine for carpentry, for picture framing the joins must be square, clean, and flawless. This product didn't do what I wanted it to do. I think the strange surfaces make it difficult to use clamps, the flimsy plastic parts have too much \\"give\\" to hold the steel parts steady, and the cam clamps are pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"Contractor Grade\\" as claimed, useless trash","review":"If a contractor showed up with this, I'd kick him out in a heartbeat!First off, it doesn't cut true (the 90 degrees setting isn't a true 90, the 45 isn't really 45 and so on). It has presets for 6 angles (90, 75, 67.5, 60, 54 & 45) and you can't set it to any other angle. There are so many plastic parts that the blade won't hold stable enough to cut a straight line and would probably break or wear out in less time than it takes to cut the baseboard for just one room (I gave up using it after 3 cuts). The dogs to clamp your work come loose in just a few strokes of the saw and are only good for items thicker than 3/8\\", they might as well not exist. The back stop is only 1-3/4\\" tall meaning that items much taller than that are not properly supported (not an issue with a power miter, but important with a manual one to get a clean and straight cut).Save your money, this is worthless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom B. is a joke","review":"As bigfoot researchers go Tom B. is a total joke.

Buy the record, but don't expect LTI, PB or CYH. Those days are long gone, and not for the better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this album. It sounds like they went back about 8 years in time and branched off from there. It doesn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"One song for 15$?!","review":"Ch Check It Out kills and the rest just fills. One lame, tired song with a tired beat after the next, you can't even tell them apart. If you want to spend 15$ for one great song and then listen to something that will bring a tear to your eye because it is just such a failed effort from the masters then this is the CD for you. It is a poor effort from the dudes who gave us Ill Communication and Check Your Head, it really is a fast food version of the Beasties. If you want to return it even though you have already opened it just take the CD down to your local store with the receipt, put the opened one in the bin, take out an unopened one and return that. You aren't stealing anything just getting your money back and rightfully so...this thing isn't worth .15$ let alone 15$!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You gots to C H I L L...","review":"I like this album.The B-Boys last two albums have grown on me after I have kicked back and gave them a true listen.There are political elements to the album, but that's part of their expression. I don't hear them endorsing any candidates, rather I hear disdain for the current way things are going.Really like the EPMD mixed up in there...Nonetheless, I think it rocks, and if you're a fan like I am, you could not let this one slip your collection.Bandas"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars to the 5 Boroughs","review":"The Beasties seem to have two personalities of late. One that tips it hat to the old school hip hop like Paul's Boutique, the other more experimental with new beats and rhyming styles like on Hello Nasty and Ill Communication. This album thankfully leans towards the former. Using \\"freshhhhh\\" several times makes one yearn for the classic 80's of Kool Mo Dee and LL Cool J. The three New Yorkers pay homage to the five boroughs with specific references like George Whipple, a hairy and lame entertainment reporter on a local but major news cable network. If you're not from NYC, you won't get that or some of the other references. But you will get the numerous attacks on the Bush administration, but that's okay because most Neo-Cons are too afraid of black people and their music to listen to rap anyway (and in case you've been in a cave like most neo-cons, the Beasties are white). There's a few misfires on the album, but Ch-check It Out for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen to the party!!","review":"What the . . . What happen to the party? The Beasties used to be unique and transedent of time and relative current events, now they are nothing more but another c average political science major. Their raps are nothing new. The protests have all been rapped before. Their beats are uninspired, and even though at first hint old school, that's just an excuss for nothing inventive or new. The Beasties inventive side is gone in this lackluster affair. I suggest Paul's Boutique or any other Beastie Boy album before giving this boring disc a spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"only 1 good track on it. they say there isn't any copy protection on it but the copy I purchased in the US has it.I think its hipocritical to speak out against the conservatives, while being a pawn for the RIAA regime.Their website says they had to go along with the labels policies but if they truely were against it, they could have found a distributer that wouldn't have included the DRM crap.This long time (cd buying) fan is done with being lied to and treated like a criminal.dl the album and donate the purchase price to eff.org"},{"rating":"2","title":"people please","review":"i know what's up with man from hillbrook, he wrote threeidiot reviews in the row, i guess he can not obtain autographs from the boys, and got smacked by the bodyguard instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diss-appointment","review":"Remember the beastie's b-side song \\"Boomin' Grannie\\"? This is like an hour of that. Sad beats from acid loops, not a lotta real samples. They keep using the same lyrics throughout the songs.By \\"The Black Album\\" by jay-z if you want real lyrics that aren't dopey and finely crafted old school beats.Don't waste your money.The upside: usually when the beasties throw out a clinker they're next one is supreme & The packaging is nicely done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment.","review":"I was so excited when I pre-ordered the new album 4 months ago. Then I got it yesterday. What a disappointment. First of all, they do not play instruments at all. Second, none of their songs have a chorus. And third, they need to bring Hurricane back. There is nothing original here. It sound like just another rap album. Very sad for a fan since 1986."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding???","review":"yes the beastie boys are talented musicians. Check out \\"check your head\\". or their album that was purely instrumental, a culmination of there instrumental tracks. (can't remember the name). But this album is a joke. It's hard to believe that three songs from this CD have cracked the top forty. It is complete Garbage. The use of the electronic beat box, cheesy synthesizers, and sub pare lyrics. Sounds like a Casio on auto play.What happened to these guys? Crap-crap-crappy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is horrible","review":"I can't believe this is the best the Beasties can do after 6 or 7 years. All their albums have been awesome and they have never let me down. BUT THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!!!! The lyrics are terrible and their attempt to go 'Old School' has flopped. They definitely sound old though. The only half-decent song is RIGHT RIGHT NOW NOW. the rest is garbage. B-boys are my heros and I gotta admit is heartbreaking to listen to this dismal record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid old-school Beasties with a smattering of political BS","review":"For those of us late 20-somethings who grew up with a \\"License To Ill\\" tape permanently inbedded in our tape players, this alblum is sure to bring on some feelings of nostalgia with it's old-school flavor. The only complaint I have about \\"To The 5 Boroughs\\" is the worthless left-wing political fluff scattered throughout many of the songs. Fight for your right to party, not campaign smear."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want music, not a message!","review":"This album is nothing but an anti-Bush soap box. I know other artists do it, but I never thought the B Boys - one of my all time fav bands - would put so many politics into their album, it's really bad. Second, most of the songs are just awful. Usually on every B Boy album I liked the majority of songs. On this album I only like 2 or 3 of the songs. Really, it's not worth buying. Just download the few good songs from iTunes or something. All the politics have got to GO. I want MUSIC, not a message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Worst Yet","review":"I think I may have already lost this CD, but I don't want to look for it because I may be obligated to listen to it again. With all of their non-sense, you would think they are trying to be funny, but then there are the Political one liners mixed in, so maybe they are trying to start a movement. Maybe that is what I am missing this isn't a CD, it is a movement. Happy 65th birthday, AdRock, I think you have lost touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The heck?","review":"Is this a Beastie Boys album or did some 15 year old sit down with a Mixing program, the lyrical tracks and some ripped off, cruddy Hip Hop backdrops?I don't even give a flying monkey about the politics. It's like... something that someone who enjoys media will have to endure for the rest of eternity now, but this is just... generic.I think the BB's have forgotten that MC's are a dime a dozen, even when they're some of the oldest and most revered MC's in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck happened?","review":"Every Beastie Boys CD earned my approval until this piece of trash came along. I expected to love it, but in reality I rather hated it. The main problem is the lyrics, which suddenly are unbelievably terrible. Their lingo on here sounds like things a sixth grader would come up with. They took a huge turn for the worse here, and it's quite obvious why the Beastie Boys ended their career after this album came out. The only good track is \\"Triple Trouble\\". \\"Ch-Check It Out\\" has no reason to be a hit because it's so awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Lyrics are terrible.

I don't care to hear their views about a world that they don't really live in. They live high on the hog and to me seem a little naive, don't they realize all three put together pay more taxes that some small Iowan town. They should be trying to keep their money in their pockets instead of giving more, which is what Kerry's plan calls for. Same old Beasties for the beats and mixes. That's worth a listen to, but the lyrics pretty much kill the album. Remember Beasties the youth that fell in love with you are now 30 or so and making middle income wages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This album is not woth buying, I only like 3 songs on the album and I also don't care to know or hear the Beastie Boy's political views.

It is a barometer as to how far american civilization has declined and these hams are listed under ALTERNATIVE MUSIC....PLLLLEASE.... And now they rap about how bad bush and the war is.... and they are JEWISH AND THEY DON'T LIKE THE WAR HUH!!! Very trendy thing in h-wood and the music biz to slam Bush... They should take a walk in Iraq and see what it's like to get taken hostage.... Yea...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think that 2 stars is being generous","review":"The Beastie Boys have finaly lost it. The quality of their albums have gone down hill since check your head.(although Ill communication has some really good cuts) I think they stopped making worthwhile music when the quit using drugs. This CD has too many political statments on it. I don't care about their political views. When I listen to Rap music I want to either hear about \\"partying\\" or \\"thuggin\\". I don't want to hear about how they think that the President is doing a bad job. It's not like any of them have a masters degree in political science or anything. Infact I would be surprised if they have anything other than a GED. Enough doggin' the B-boys... If you really want to purchase a good disc I would reccomend Paul's Boutique. That is one of my all time favorite CDs. Check your head is really good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"dumb with a capital D!","review":"This cd is so stupid!If anyone knows what this song is called, please tell me.it goes like,\\"you gotta fight...for your right...to party.\\"Thanks in advance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Country Music Is Better Than Rap!!","review":"I get made fun of a lot for listening to country music and Japanese techno. People tell me to listen to rap and rock music. One of the people I know at school listens to rap and rock music and he told me that the beastie boys were good music. I dont know about that! There music dosent make a twanging sound like country, so it scares me! I love Toby Keith though! I have one rap album and that is the Baha Men, that is good music, just like Toby Keith!

I am appalled that today's youth seems infatuated with the Beastie Boys and I fear how that will effect the future of this country. I'm just glad that no one over 20 takes these chumps seriously. I have nothing against so-called rap music, in fact I consider myself a woman of color at heart. But these guys are whiter than Pat Boone and are sending a message that the United States are unfit to live in. Shame of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"White is not the color of rap!","review":"What happened to the Beastie Boys?!

Although, I don't agree with all the political views of the Beasties I respect them completely and it doesn't take anything away from this old school masterpiece.In fact it makes this album stand out from every other hip-hop album out there. The ryhmes are dope as ever and the beats aren't bad either. This album was well worth the money and anyone who is into true hip-hop put down that Chingy album and pick up To the Five Boroughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please....","review":"Who wants to buy an album that loads spy ware on your computer?

I am hurt and feeling very alinated by there decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the FUDGE!!!","review":"I'm a huge B-boys fan, but this is their worst album ever. Their political views really distract from the album. Who wants to listen to that 5 years from now. The whole album is samples and flat rhymes about endless Political Crap. At least with Mario C you got some of their instrumentials. They must have sold their instruments to produce this album.They went from Rappin about Girls, White Castle, and Beer to rippin on Bush and the war in Iraq. What the Fudge Happened here.Just proves that teh B-boys couldn't produce a quality album on their own. Mix Master Mike Has Got To Go.B-Boys, Please Get Mario C, DJ Hurricane, and The Dust Brothers Back!!! You Really Need Help. I could have produced something better given 6 years time."},{"rating":"1","title":"-","review":"This album is childish. It sounds like the crumby battle tapes we would make in 5th grade.

Buy the used ones and save cash--your gonna buy this anyway no matter what I say, but buy it cheap then go get the blackalbum or something with the cash you save."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know it's all ball!","review":"It has been a long time since I liked a CD this much. To me it has some of the same feel as Check Your Head. It's neither as raw nor as gloriously juvenile as CYH, but a tight, mature CYH is a pretty great thing. And I don't think that the fact that they have a political agenda to push really detracts from either the music or the overall message. Although here isn't a single that will hold the radio like Body Movin or Hey Ya! on the album, top to bottom it's better and more listenable than either Hello Nasty or Outkast's Speakerboxx/The Love Below--both of which were great albums. Anyway, I was sold when they rhymed about Riunite on ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its worst crime? It's boring","review":"To the 5 Boroughs proves that the further away that the Beastie Boys move from Paul's Boutique, the album I think they peaked with, the less interesting they become. I had a lot of expectations for this new album but I came away bored by this. Rote lyrics combined with a drum machine make this very uninspired effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the Dali llama thinks it stinks","review":"It's time to call it a day home boyz.

This cd is not so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing funky fresh here","review":"Uncreative and unoriginal. The Beastie Boys have joined the ranks of michael moore - feeding the minds of Americans with mush. I was hoping for another hip-hoppin', fun and original album from the trio from New York; my expectations never materialized. Ironically, I was stoked to see the Twin Towers on the cover, yet the lyrics mention nothing of 9/11 and how America has/is going after these thugs that have killed thousands of New Yorkers; instead, the Boys use their rhymes to bash the President. The Beastie Boys were known to have a leftist agenda (ie: MTV music awards speech), that is fine with me, I still liked their music; but when the agenda becomes the driving force in the creation of a work of art, well the art is lost. This album would have been great, if the Boys focused on the hip-hop instead of the GW-chop."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I might even goes as far as to say that to the five boroughs tops off license to ill. sure the beasties got a little political here, but whats wrong with that? For me this album displays the most empathy over any other beastie release. The album just like any great piece of music can truly bring a number of emotions out of you. Whether it be bliss, sorrow, or just a feeling in your stomach that wont go away. The beasties have keyed in on something remarkable, and im going to savor it. Who knows in 2004 it might be a while before another good record even comes out at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is DOPE!","review":"I was genuinely surprised at how good the boyz' latest product is. I liked Hello Nasty, but felt that they lost their edge and swagger. They got a little too clownish. I hate to say this, but there wasn't any profanity at all on Hello Nasty, not that you need that for a great album, but that's just not the Beastie Boys. Well, To The Five Boroughs to me is a cross between License To Ill & Paul's Boutique. They got their swagger back but it's more mature. After all, when your pushing 40, you can't keep rapping about partying, women and whiffle ball bats. That would just be silly. Instead, they are able to express the social and political climate of our times in the context of Hip Hop while still throwin' out goofy lyrics and great dance beats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beats can only hold you attention for only so long","review":"Well in the overall scheme of things, the Beastie Boys are back to making rap songs that seem to entertain little purpose. They've harnessed all their creative energy into ruining okay beats. Maybe I'm ignorant to their message but every song I hear by them seems to have none. They just say whatever they can to establish a ryhme. Sometimes the lines are ironic or odd but mostly ignorant. And some of these reviews say they make gangsta rap. Three White Jews don't make Gangsta Rap. And unbeknown to a few, they are extremely talentless where their shelf life wasn't meant to survive past 1989"},{"rating":"2","title":"To the 5 Boroughs: A must for any B Boy fan.","review":"I was the first to buy this album when Best Buy opened on June 15. The sounds of the modern boys, found on \\"Hello Nasty\\" is what you are going to find on this cd. I found this to have a generally darker sound than \\"Hello Nasty.\\" It is definately the most mature album yet, with lots of political opinions. You still get that rediculous fun noise they have always offered, however. The most fun comes from \\"Oh Word?\\" \\"Shazam!\\" and the tribute to NYC: \\"An Open Letter to NYC.\\" You will love this album if you have any love for the boys. Check out these tunes, and make up your own mind. \\"Hello Nasty\\" is a better album, but we've waited six years and it was worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Longtime Fan","review":"Some of us have been through years where the Beastie Boys were always playing in at least one of the tape decks in our dual tape players (that's cassette tapes, in case you are too young to know). Anyway, I was hoping for another album that would stay (now in my 5-disc changer) for at least a full year without my having to swap it out. Unfortunately, this is not what I got in this album. While there are tracks on this album that capture the energy and passion of the Beastie Boys of old, too much of this record feels like preaching. Although I agree with much of what they have to say, they now do so in such a politically over-hyped fashion that it detracts from their music.Truly, there are some great songs on this record. But if you listen to this album and then to Paul's Boutique, Licensed to Ill or another great one, you will quickly realize that this is not the Beastie Boys who revolutionized music in the late 20th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"I waited 6 years for this?","review":"I couldn't wait for the June 15th release. I've been a Beastie Boys fan since day one. I've loved every album they've put out until this one. This album is a dissapointment. The lyrics are subpar and lack their past edge and flow. The beats are alright, but they lack the depth and the sophistication of some of their past work. They also interject political crap in some of the tracks. I don't disagree with what they're saying, I just don't think a Beastie Boys album is the time or place to say it.Even though I think this album sucks, I still hope that this isn't their last. I know they have another Paul's Boutique, Ill Communication or Hello Nasty up their sleeves. I'd hate for them to end their careers with this turd."},{"rating":"1","title":"through the Motions&average","review":"this is the kind of album the Beastie Boys could do in there sleep.they are without a Doubt One of the Most Creative Forces Ever in Hip-Hop Music but this Album seems tired&contrived.going through the Motions&Lacking any real edge.they have moments here&there but it doesn't merit a wait of 6 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comeback record.","review":"Don't know where all the negative reviews are coming from here. This is some good stuff with a good vibe. I like the lyrics better than a lot of their music and the choruses and beats come through with a nice electronic minimalism and a penchant for well honed group raps. Sure, they can sound a bit older but that is life is it not? This is clearly 100x better than Mix Up which was almost embarrassing imo. I would easily recommend this to someone getting into these guys as I think it is the best representation of their style in the later years. Not really too many bad songs on here and there were definitely a couple near classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics","review":"A good album by the Beastie Boys, going back to their original strengths. An ode to New York City, well written lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic","review":"WHoever said these guys fell off is crazy. Anyone with any sense can see that the rap game is going old school and this is old-school brought into today at its finest. Look at any of the top songs...they sample old r&b, rock, etc. These guys are back with a album I have been anticipating since their last. The only thing I'm more excited about is M-A-$-E's new one, when it comes out. Be on the lookout for Shyne this fall. Gonna be off the hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics","review":"This album is back to basics for the B-Boys. If you liked their early stuff, you are gonna dig this disc. \\"Check it out\\" has been spinning on the air for a month or two now, but the anticipation of their return was what really got me into the store to buy this. It is well worth the price. For NYC, it is great to see their support for their home town and their lack of trust in good old G.W.B. If you are a Republican, you might want to skip buying this one. Otherwise, pick up a copy and support their return to the scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three MCs and One DJ","review":"To the 5 Boroughs is the Beasties stripped down, tightened up, and kickin'. From the high energy single (Ch Check it Out) to the harpsichord-looped Right Right Now Now, this album is so stunning in its simplicity, it makes Hello Nasty, Ill Communication and Paul's Boutique seem overproduced. After this showing, I am pretty sure that the Beasties could rap over a looped airport parking announcement and still be compelling.The Beasties are always best when they are paying tribute to NYC. I'm sure I wasn't the only Brooklynite who shed a tear when the boys went LA. Anyone who was in the 5 boroughs during 9/11 will be moved by \\"Open Letter to NYC\\", which captures the feeling of community that followed the tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this CD","review":"Don't get me wrong, the music is - okay. In a time when everything has become political, the Beastie Boys are no different. I was looking for a piece of entertainment, perhaps even a throwback to some good 1990's times, but instead I got political CD. If I want a political message, I'll read the paper or watch CNN.That's isn't even what pissed me off the most. I attempted to play the CD in my computer, only to find that Capitol records has placed a block that disallows this CD to be played in any Desktop or Laptop.

Triple Trouble was the 2nd single. Those two songs are their typicaly songs they did in the past. Some songs like We Got The Power is about voting a new president in. One of the members from Run DMC has a few lines on this album. It Takes Time To Build is about rebuilind New York city from 9/11 attacks. This album goes back to the old school years in the 1980's.

To the 5 Boroughs: (Circa 1985).Ok, maybe that is overstating the case a bit, but this album sounds like it should have directly followed Paul's Boutique. Lacking any of the funk and real instrumentation of the amazing Check your Head and Ill Communication, this cd is a collection of raps over boring drum machine beats. Yep it's \\"old school\\" but not in a good way. Although some of the sounds are new and interesting, the raps sound like recycled 80s rap and/or previous Beastie Boys tunes.I'll keep giving this album a chance but I'm starting to think this is one of those albums where your first impression is dead on. If you really liked Paul's Boutique you may like this album (I'm not a huge Paul's Boutique fan but there are some real jems on that album and enough solid tracks to warrant keeping it around; 5 Boroughs lacks any true jems).What happend? Where's the funk? Where are the instruments?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Sound, Bad Tech","review":"Sorry, but my beloved B-Boys have failed for two discs in a row now. I'm just not impressed with the tracks. They're short and most of them sound like they were written 15 years ago, except for the lyrics, which are wildly left of center.Then, there's the copy-protection. All it really does is prevent fair use of the CD. It installs a program on your PC pr Mac, WITHOUT your permission. This program prevents you from copying to MP3 for fail and LEGAL use.This CD has left a bad taste in my mouth, and it will likely be the last Beasties' purchase I ever make."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell happened?","review":"since when did the beasties start singing about political topics? And even if you don't pay that much attention to the lyrics the sound of this album just isn't that good, like they spent to much time trying to get their political messages across and not nearly enough putting the music together, but what do I know? .. This CD just does nothing for me and I wish I hadn't wasted the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the Mighty Have Fallen","review":"Talk about a dissappointment. The Beastie Boys used to be one of the hottest act around and were near legendery status, then this album came out.

I'm all for freedom of speech, but don't sell a CD citing it as \\"entertainment\\" when it holds a clear political agenda.Lets assume there are no political messages. I'd still rate it 1 star. EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME. There is no varaition which the Beastie Boys have been so well known for. Where are the rhythmic instrumentals that last for minutes on end? Where is the innovation in musical style that had, previous to this album, been their hallmark? Seeing as how they had years to develop this album i'm rather disappointed.If this is in anyway a hint as to what future Beastie Boys albums will sound like, you can count me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM Sorry","review":"yea this is the worst rap ive ever heard in my life!!!its so god d*** annoying!! ch chh ch check it out!! uhhhhh its so annoying!all the other songs suck too the only good white rapper is eminem! im sorry but this is garbage!definatly dont buy this one!this belongs with your bananna peel from 2 weeks ago....in the garbage! i mean cmon the clean version???nothing silly? thats so stupid! yea...you see the NO button under the review? knock urself out"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOR-ING","review":"I tried to like this, I really did.

I know a lot of long time fans are haveing trouble admitting this to themselvs but this cd just sucks. I miss the old Beastie Boys, you know the tough cool guys who sounded cool to party with. Now they are basically super liberal pansies, this album sounds like it was wrote by a card carrying PETA member. The beasties come off as politically correct sissys the whole album. You know those guys who cry when people litter or drive an SUV. I miss the old Beasties not these feminist losers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shut Up and Sing","review":"This album is horrible. To be fair, I bought Paul's Boutique with 5 Boroughs and (re-)listened to Paul's Boutique first. I highly recommend the older of the two CDs. Paul's Boutique is one of the coolest CDs ever. It is a pure delight; it's fun and it's crazy, with witty lyrics and genius sampling. On the other hand, To the 5 Boroughs sounds like a lefty's political diatribe that uses formulaic rap as an afterthought. The monotony induces the urge to fast forward, and the lyrics are juvenile. I can't help but wonder if these guys are pandering to the young, whom they believe are all Bush-haters, or if they're really that limited in their thought. Whatever the case, I wish they'd stuck to what they do best--rapping about being crazy fun. 5 Boroughs is a complete disappointment to this Beastie Boys fan. Pity. I had high hopes for a revival."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptacular Copy Control","review":"That's right, folks. This isn't a CD. It's a shiny disc that looks like a CD.

Instead these guys are still starting, and at best hitting the Mendoza line.Retire while you still have some pride, unless you think selling corny music for lots of money is cool. I don't.

There are no dense layers of samples as used on Hello Nasty, Ill Communication and Check Your Head. All we are left with is the Beasties themselves which isn't that interesting.

I quit being a die hard, cause it pxssed me off how long I had to wait between albums. Now in total honesty, I was impressed with the production. I only wish someone else was rapping over it. Their musical style is outstanding, but man I don't feel the political stuff. I consider myself an independent, but stuff like this pushes me towards Republican. I hate hippies, and I especially hate musicians/actors who know nothing more than what the liberal media feeds them. Now they think they have the right to critique our President? He makes decisions based on shxt they know zip about. Anyways, I'm sure they feel they have the responsibility to educate us and they're rich enough not to care what the ramifications are. I definitely miss the old school style lyrics. So to the Beasties, here's a big F U. Everyone download it instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Write music not political propaganda","review":"I liked it better when musicians just played music instead of using it as a polictical forum.

The sound lacks the sonicly comlex layers of those other albums. Where Paul's and Hello Nasty have a timelessness to them, this one is straight from early 80s hip hop, where the verses are stark with synth type beats as opposed to heavier samples. As for the lyrics, they still can execute with great skill. Keep listening as I will, and it will grow on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"6 years and this is it??? The best track on the CD is the current single Ch-Check it out. The rest of the songs are un-innovative and boring. It left this reviewer cold. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Licensed to Ill, Paul's Boutique, Check Your Head, Ill Communication...these are all 5-star albums in my estimation.Hello Nasty I give 4-stars. A bit too many of the non-hip hop songs don't quite work. But overall it's still fantastic.To the 5 Boroughs just doesn't cut it. It sounds rushed and not at all like the meticulously crafted albums I've come to expect. I want to like it. I try to like it...but there's just not that much there to enjoy. It sounds like an album of outtakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little new, a little old","review":"This album was almost exactly what I expected from the Beasties. As a die-hard fan of Licensed to Ill, I found myself reminiscing back to those days and the old-school sampled beats. The difference here is that the beats are more complex and modern sounding, and the Boys now sound a bit more like men. The lyrics are more mature, but this album is really fun to party to (I've included some of the tracks on mixes i havent touched for years). This is one of the few recent hip-hop records I can honestly recommend, and I imagine (if i can find it on vinyl!!) it will be appearing on my turntable for quite awhile.Summary: Old-school gone modern, the Beasties don't think they're pirates anymore, but they still have attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Beat for 14 songs straight!","review":"I was all pumped to buy this album after 6 years of waiting. I hear the single \\"Check It Out\\" and thought, oh they still have it. WRONG! After the first track I found myself waiting for the song to end to see if the next track was better. To my suprise every track sounded like the last. If you want to listen to senseless preaching about how Beastie Boys are the best MC's and how you should appreciate yourself for who you are and politics, than this is for you. If you want to listen to beats like the Beastie Boys used to rock, then don't buy this album...listen to Paul's Boutique again instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"out with the old school","review":"If anyone is expecting to hear the old school sound from beastie boys, you'll be very disappointed. The song ch-check it out is the best song on the cd. If I had realized how much I would dislike the album, I never would have bought it. In my opinion it doesn't deserve the 14$ worth of support I gave."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened??","review":"I own every beastie cd and this ones a flop. It sounds like it was made in half an hour with a casio keyboard. Every song sounds the same besides check it out. I don't know maybe its just me. I guess you gotta be from one of the five burroughs to appreciate this one. Who be rockin' y'all in sterereo??The beats are all in mono laced with hype rhymes.I gotta give it up to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego though for the rhyme thats right on time. I'm tellin' you.... is that echo?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Record for the Ears and Mind","review":"This album is a great addition to the Beastie Disc Library. The beats are laid down with efficient madness. This will make your body rock, with no sudden stops of instrumentals like Hello Nasty. This is a record that can be listened from start to finish with no need for the skip button. Now some might not agree with the lyrics consisting of liberal rhetoric, but hey if your still a fan today your used to it. After all, their politics are warranted in today's darkness. What is also good is that they are back to their roots of making albums that are parental advisory. The only problem, the album is fairly short, only 42min, so it leaves you wanting so more. But it is an excellent album."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"What's the time? It's time to retire!\\"","review":"I have tried over and over to like this disc, but I can't. It's just not very good. The lyrics are sloppy and trite, and there is no consistency at ALL in this record. Some beats work well (the title track is probably one of the best songs the Beasties have ever done), but other's fall flat. I truly am a long time BB fan, and I have seen them live 4 times. But, it's time for even me to face facts, that their days of Paul's boutique and Check your head are long gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"i USED to be a beastie boys fan.because they USED to make good music.too much hype, too little content.completely forgetable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ch-Check it out - we're politicians","review":"I love the Beasties but this album is not the best. Check it out is a great, but the rest seem like purely political speeches slap together in a VERY awkward way. I appreciate the fact that a band has an opinion - one song will do, but an entire album? It almost contradicts what they are trying to put across - we have a choice... but we're going to cram ours down your throat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminently Listenable--and Sometimes Grown Up--Old School Rap","review":"Highly recommended for anyone who loved the old Beastie Boys, but understands that even Boys have to grow up someday. New beats, imaginative, entertaining rhymes, exceedingly clean production make for a great record. While Liscensed to Ill is a classic, if the Beasties were still rapping about having their skateboards stolen it would be ridiculous. Yes, there are some politics on the record, but let's face it: the Beastie Boys are in their 40s now, and a little political bile is entirely appropriate. I have had this CD in my car for more than a week, and have listened to it straight through at least 7 times. Anything that can hold my attention over that many playings was worth every cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad,","review":"This album has unfortunately turned out to be a huge disappointment. The beats are pretty good in most places, and some songs have some good flow, but f__k their politcal bullsh*t! Their mainstream approach to politcs is LAME, LACKS INTELLIGENCE, and makes their music sound increadibly DATED!!!!!!!! Pacifism does not counter insanity! I'm no right winger or even close, but come, on these lame political lyrics should annoy any beastie boys fan who has half a brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's time to retire","review":"Having been a fan of these guys all the way to Hello Nasty, I've come to learn that there fellas like to do their own thing. They try to invent and redefine, but,somehwere along the lines they've decided to just ride on the name. Their latest certainly proves the point.Corny rhymes and lame beats make for a totally boring and disappointing effort from 3 guys that should really know better.Not one track stands out from another.

Not a one of these tracks breath effort and creativity.Maybe it's time for them to hang the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"its time!","review":"uugghhhmm!? what the hell did i just listen to?i think i just lost 16 brain cells. its time the boys call it a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old, Tired, and Gray","review":"That about sums it up folks. With regard to the complaints about the political nature of some of the lyrics, I say this- This is a product of just getting older and feeling the need to make music that \\"matters\\" or is important in a social context- but these are the Beastie Boys- they have just run out of steam- waiting 6 years to make a record will do that to you. I never like artists that get to much into politics- I don't care if they don't like the president, but these lyrics are straight off the talking points of the Democratic Party- This is supposed to be fun party time stuff, but now they have a social conscience- good for them- I just don't want to hear about that stuff in music-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant","review":"And just like that it was irrelevant. To quote from track four -\\"We got a president we didn't elect.\\"I have given this record a few months to sink in. I bought it on May 8, 2004. I kept thinking that it would get better and more enjoyable. Instead it just got worse and worse. Remember how the Beastie Boys used to dress up as preachy old people in their videos? It isn't so much of a stretch any more. The Beastie Boys have turned into a bunch of bitter old men who sit around whining about politics and they have a record to prove it. I would have given it one star but I gave it two because I did get some use out of it. Last night I used it as a coaster for the champagne I was drinking to celebrate an election that was the complete repudiation of the beliefs on this record.

What especially impresses me about this album is its critique of societal issues, most especially taking a hard look at the current American political system, espcecially in the area of foreign policy. Considering the fact that the Lisenced to Ill featured many lyrics considered controversial and immature, the Beasties prove with this album that they actually have a serious side, and they deliver that side well. My favorite track on this album is the poginant \\"An Open Letter to NYC\\" in which the Beasties pay serious tribute to their native city in reflection of the 9-11 attacks. Not my favorite Beasties album, since Paul's Boutique is simply phenomenal, but this album delivers. As with any Beasties album, a great addition to your CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Renewed B-Boy fan","review":"This is classic hip hop from the Beastie's....definitely their best since Paul's Boutique. I never really followed them since PB, but heard Ch-Check It Out and decided to give the CD a try..first listen was okay, but more and more I just can not get enough!! Every song is pumpin' like back in the days....but with a new feel to it as well. Still can't get into their last 3 CD'S (Check Your Head, Ill Communication and Hello Nasty) although some of the songs on those albums are excellent, there are a lot of fillers in my opinion. But, any past fan from the early days should pick up Boroughs...you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beastie Boys are still kickin","review":"Short and sweet. The Beasties have come back with yet another album that blows me away.

The Boys have always done what THEY wanted to do and this time round they decided to keep it simple with a tip of the hat to old school. If this is your game you will appreciate the samples from the ol' days and all the mad scratchin of MMM (some little man dares call him minor league talent...guess thats why he was not allowed to enter turntable contests after winning so many times). This is a fun album that happens to be loaded with the Boys' political thoughts (disclaimer: I don't like Bush either). If Licensed to Ill is your game then listen to that. Same with all the other albums. I own them all and enjoy them all for different reasons. The short version: you like the B-Boys and Old School Hip-Hop you will like this record....you wanna be cap'n cool go grab the latest bling-crunk-r&b crossover or whatever makes you happy..but don't dog this record cause you don't understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beastie Boys Are All Washed Up","review":"I cant believe I waited 6 years for this garbage.

I regretted that I didn't read this book first but instead wasted my valuable time reading useless [junk].

I felt that this product didn't last as long as other on your skin, smelled of that funky \\"tan in a tube\\" smell, and made this white girl look like she rolled in mud.

Of all the hammers I have this Stanley is my favorite. It's feels real natural in your hand, especially when you grab the hammer close to the head to start a nail and after starting the nail let the hammer slide through your hand and your palm just seems to fall perfectly in place into the \\"sweet spot\\" of the handle. What I also really like is the size and shape of the face, it's a little wider than most and the sides of the face are tapered back instead of straight. This makes it really easy when toe nailing to just smack the nail with the edge of the hammer face. The price is cheaper than most of my other framing hammers as well.EDIT:I have a Couple of Titanium Framing hammers now and I still find myself coming back to this hammer..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ubiquitous","review":"Anybody who does any kind of framing, at any time, has one of these. Not the best hammer by any means - but it's a darned good hammer all the same. I have a pile of bigger framers, but this hammer just rocks in general. And it drives a spike in two shots.This is my all time number two hammer for nailing. Only downside is that because of the waffle head, I refuse to use it for punches and the like.I might sound harsh, but I love this hammer. I keep coming back to it, no matter how more expensive my newest acquisition is, this one does the job beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so reliable","review":"I had a entirely new garage door and chamberlain door opener with an additional Chamberlain 940D Wireless, Keyless Entry System, 315 MHz opener outside on the wall.The opener worked for a short time and then intermittently worked and did not work. after awhile the buttons stopped working with the 4 digit code.

But the cheap plastic shell is in no way adequate for outdoor mounting, especially here in Minnesota. The mounting consists a single slotted hole on the back of the plastic case, which means it bobbles around as you try to use it and is easily knocked off. Instead of a rugged weatherproof keyboard, there's an irritating plastic cover to flip up every time.The cheap construction makes it overpriced. And yes, I'm sick of these plastic clam shell packages too. In fact I'd say the packaging appears to be sturdier than the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond irritating","review":"This should be the next product that Amazon requires to be in its new \\"fuss-free\\" packaging. The entire contents are contained in a nuclear-explosion-proof blister pack, multiple staples must be pried out of the folded-up instruction leaflet before it can be opened and read, the wireless keypad itself is encased in a huge sticky label that splits apart into a thousand little strips when you try to peel it away, and worst of all, the three of us couldn't remove the battery cover, which is required in order to access the second hole for wall mounting and comes with no guidance other than \\"slide it off.\\" With what, a jackhammer?

For the handyman type who wants to build a dollhouse for a child to play with, this book will suit you, but I do think spending a few dollars more on pre-cut pieces of higher quality wood to suit the overall size of the dollhouse would be worth the extra cost. Trying to do the house with a single sheet of plywood creates more work than necessary and the sanding of the cut edges can be tedious. So, my advice is to use the basics provided in this book and modify them slightly to make your own unique dollhouse. Don't be afraid to make it slightly larger or smaller, add a few pieces of decorative trim and create something a little bit prettier than the house on the cover. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully poetic reading","review":"Would it be blasphemous to quote an old adage that if God would speak it would sound like John Gielgud? Never mind if you consider the text as absolute historical truth, beautiful metaphor, or something between the two. It would be very difficult to find a better reader than Sir John. His voice shows every sign of age and that makes it sound just right. Also his carefully cadenced reading brings out all the poetry inherent in the King James translation of this material. An absolute Stunner!

Easy to carry: You can slip this under the sleeve of a skinsuit or the leg of a pair of cycling shorts and they stay put until needed.Easy to open: I'm not sure who created some of the packets for other companies, but they are not easy to open. Taste and Ingredients: If you like coffee, this is a great flavor. If you are put off by a sweet cappucino, then you should try the fruit flavors instead. The caffeine amount is the real plus. Double the amount of the other GU gels, it gives you just the right kick needed to get to the finish of a race. Thumbs up all around on this one. Only downside is if you don't like coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal on a necessary item","review":"6 Gu packs for $[...] is a great deal!

If you do any distance sport you understand how important Gu is, so I love that I can get it in 2 days with Prime--. Great deal, fast shipping. I can't complain!The vanilla flavor is my favorite, and this one also has caffeine in it. The espresso has double caffeine, and there are other flavors with no caffeine. Keep this in mind when you're looking for your flavor. I think the vanilla is the easiest to get down on a long run when my stomach doesn't want much in it. Of course, that's a personal preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price is fun, but shipping????","review":"You can go to a local sporting goods store and get Gu for 1 dollar a pack without paying shipping.

One for example is one of the Palos Verde rides. I drove 20 mins to make this ride only to find out that bikes have been prohibited here for several years.The map and trail diagrams are too small and crowded.Don and Sharon have a road bike that is much better than this mountain bike trail book.The book's writing style does have charm, but the maps are what's important and these maps could be better.The only redeeming value to this book is the altitude graph.

I've used it every day for the last year on everything from rough framing to finish work. \\"The Better Mousetrap\\" review played a big role in my decision in the 20oz Stanley over the classic Estwing. It's true that you really feel a difference hitting concrete. It's also very well balanced. I can flip it and throw it with surprising accuracy. Not that it helps me build anything, but I feel very comfortable with it in my hand. I worked on a crew with some guys who carried wooden handled Stilettos. They're nice, I liked them, but I'd still choose my Stanley."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Carpenter's Favorite!","review":"I'm always looking for the tool that will help me get it done easier, faster, better, this hammer is my current favorite! The Stanley does everything well, I can punch in trim nails, knock in 3-1/2 duplex with relative speed and ease(It doesn't beat a two foot framing hammer, but it's also not an anchor hanging off my belt fit only for framing either)bash masonry, and demo old walls. I find that it really helps absorb the impact well and one of the biggest advantages is the handle provides FANTASTIC traction and grip! After having hammers fly out of my weak, sweaty hands after marathon framing sessions, this is a tremendous boon. The magnetic starter works very well, but don't expect it to hold anything larger than a 10d. It's also nice to have a hammer that isn't almost a short-sword smashing your leg in with every belted step.Having used this for a couple of months, i'm going to buy a waffle faced framing model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crooked Hammer","review":"I don't know if this is part of the design but the hammer is bent to the left.

After encountering this book several times in the course of various classes, I was surprised to realize how comparatively simple the ideas it contains are. In the typical fashion of upper-level humanities academia, however, Rowe hides his point behind impossibly twisted sentences and an onslaught of outside references that seems designed more to impress the reader with Rowe's own wide-ranging knowledge than to enlighten. The ideas of this book could be condensed to a short essay, and the only thing lost would be the page count."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best knives I've ever used","review":"What can I say, they're outstanding knives.

In the 2nd season, if you are a product of the late 60's, you may remember that Mabel king, who portrayed Mrs. Thomas, was seen less often. Even the late Fred 'Rerun' Berry, was not seen in every episode, thus Danielle 'Dee' Spencer and Haywood 'DeWayne' Nelson were featured more prominently, and guest stars such as the Doobie Brothers and Greg Morris (Mission Impossible / Vegas) appeared.

Going, Going, Gong is another favorite; I just loved the Givens Family. They actually could be the next Gladys Knight and the Pips with the three cool fellows and their pretty sister; gosh, that Audrey Givens could really belt it out! The Teen center episode on season three is another favorite of mine; Ernest Lee Thomas sings a really meaningful song along with the number he and his TV sister, Danielle Spencer did.

As it would turn out, this would be the only real album legendary guitarist Jeff Beck would record with the Yardbirds. Shortly after this released, the Yardbirds lost Paul Samwell Smith, gained Jimmy Page, and then lost Jeff Beck. For a short time, Beck and Page led a two pronged guitar attack, which two of the best songs on this collection, \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" and \\"Psycho Daisies,\\" capture.

The only song that I thought had any merit was \\"lift me up\\", I was expecting more from Moby and gave him a 2 on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Jean-Luc Picard can pull off shave-man look okay!","review":"I am thinking to self > drinking all day, almost run over old lady on street.

He just wanted to create another crappy album as an excuse to put the back of his flaky baldhead on the front of an album cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageously B_A_D","review":"i've been a Moby fan since 1999 when \\"play\\" came out and got used to this style of his and even enjoyed \\"18\\" when that was released.beware: this cd is nothing like either of these. it's incredibly bad music. the lyrics are more simple than usual and there is a hinge of happiness in most of the songs, but this cd is terrible. moby sings on most all the tracks and then some other lady has a few tracks of her own in a very slow story like way.if you are lucky enough to get the 2-disc version, disc2 is the only saving grace of this waste of money (if you have the soundscapes or atmospheres sound channel on satellite, that is basically what you get with disc2).i honestly don't see how anyone could enjoy this HOTEL cd...massive letdown.-cwc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This CD is really great despite what others may say. The people who dislike this CD are basically wanting a repeat of Play, or at least that is what I've noticed. Moby expands on his music writing skills significantly with many radio worthy songs, especially the first half of Disc 1, which is some of the best music I have heard out of any artist in a LONG time. Great songs with awesome beats.The only reason I give this CD 4 stars is due to Disc 2. Disc 2 IS NOT BAD, and I am quite glad that it was included, but I found it not equal to the first, just based on the fact that I am not a HUGE fan of ambient music. It's still worth listening to, but don't expect Disc 1 all over again. It's a different genre of music. Overall though, this CD is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was excited to hear a new Moby album was out...","review":"Then I listened to it. It gives me no pleasure whatsoever to say that a Moby album is bad, there are plenty of artists/celebrities out there who I'd like to see fall off their perch but Moby is not one of them, I have Play and 18 both of which I still listen to and I also like his articles and social commentary but there isn't much to enjoy from this new 'singer/songwriter' effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moby's 'Hotel' is worth checking into","review":"'Hotel' is a solid release from the very talented Moby, but it's certainly not his best work (I highly recommend 'Play' for its inventiveness). It is a consistent album that's always listenable, and although there are a few standout tracks, it never reaches greatness as a whole. The best part of the album is the second half, with such standouts like 'Love Should', 'Slipping Away', and 'Where You End'. The best song on the album for me is 'Raining Again', a great techno song that has some very clever lyrics: 'it's raining again, out on your car like bullets on tin'. 'Hotel' is predictable Moby, but it's quite an enjoyable experience for fans who know what to expect from this gifted artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally charged!","review":"Moby's new album \\"Hotel\\" is a wonderful collection of musical sounds, personal thoughts, and intimate emotions. I found this album to be quite different from his past two albums in the way Moby mixes serious feelings with an upbeat sound. Moby also uses a female vocalist to reflect an intimate side of himself. I would higly recommend this album to old and new fans alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of himself","review":"This is Moby at his worst. By the time I got to the egocentric \\"Beautiful\\" I felt like returning the cd for a refund. The 2nd disc is O.K., but the first is a great disappointment. Last Moby I'll buy new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album...","review":"Moby's voice, and the lack of sampling seems to be getting the brunt of criticism for this album. I for one think this album is an excellent follow up to play and 18. If Moby had continued to use sampled sounds, I at this point would begin to feel it as too much a formula for him, instead he puts his own voice into his work much more then before - and while vocally he may not be the strongest he provides an insightful soul to the songs. You don't need to be a top notch signer you really just need to know what you're doing, (think of radiohead - very poor vocally but great) and Moby uses his own vocal range to establish the mood of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars for the bonus ambient disc","review":"I think fans have to be honest about Hotel: It is a disappointing effort. The album begins with great promise. The intro is an excellent, subtle, synth piece. It suits the sterile, soft colours used in the cd art. From there the album drops off. Moby isn't much of a guitar player-so a near whole album of \\"post-punk\\"-ish pop tunes is hard to enjoy. \\"I like it\\" is particularly bad. There are some bright spots. \\"Raining Again\\" and \\"Lift Me up\\" are passable. The cover of New Order's \\"Temptation\\" with singer Dawn is actually fairly good. The album ends well with some nice ambient compositions. \\"Homeward Angel\\" is excellent.If you can find a copy with the bonus ambient cd, buy it. The second disc is unapologetically electronic, slow, long, and beautiful. It is one for the fans and more than makes up for the short-comings of the first disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A travesty.. awful, terrible, bland album.","review":"Moby has officially lost his way. I cannot explain how bland and boring this album is. It is a summing up of everything which is falling apart in electronica, and related music types. Just another in the long list of terrible, recent electronica albums being released this last year.Do not by any chance buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear","review":"Sorry to say, but this is one (well 2) expensive coasters.I listened to it all the way through & was more than unthrilled.The next time, I got as far as the diabolical cover version of New Order's Temptation & threw the discs in the bin.Moby needs to go back to his punk roots & keep this rubbish to himself.I had to give it a star or my review can't be submitted, but I can award a star for the cd case which is handy to replace any broken ones I might have."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hotel Room in Dullsville","review":"I was looking forward to this CD and played it several times, but unlike Moby's other CDs it didn't grab me AT ALL. I LIKE it when Moby sings, but there's just NOTHING happening here musically. It is very DULL. The cover of New Order's \\"Temptation\\" is pointless and it's the high point on the CD. The extra ambient disc is even more of a SNOOZER. If you want to hear some excellent Moby, check out \\"I Like to Score\\", \\"Everything is Wrong\\", \\"Play\\" and \\"18 Songs\\" and leave this Hotel vacant..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone should tell Moby that he can't sing","review":"Moby is a talented guy, so let's get that out of the way. But his talent is in the area of music composition. Someone somewhere heard him sing and encouraged the poor man, and now we have this, a dismal disaster from a pampered misguided sould who's otherwise brilliant. The man can't sing, and if his fans care about him at all they should tell him to shut up and instead put his fingers to the keyboard and do what he does best: compose music and sample other people's voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am a big fan and have all his cd's.

Double music doesn't mean more enjoyment when the songs are so monotonous they might just be one long song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotel","review":"One of the two albums is mostly Brian Eno type of background music (good in the appropriate listening circumstances). The other album has a number of very good Moby vocals (with others) and I liked it a lot.

Many of the review consider disc 2 of hotel, Hotel: Ambient, to be the better of the two. Imagine my disappointment when my amazon order did not include it. If you want the complete alblum, be careful what you order. Don't be a stooge like I was. I ran down to my local record store and got the double disc for what I paid for this incomplete edition. The alblum art is the exact same, the Amazon reviews mention the second disc. Amazon, please take action on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought Hotel on faith, Moby has been awesome and up until now his albums have always impressed me (even if 18 sounded a lot like play). But Hotel was a huge disappointment. It's boring and average, the vocals are... Well, I hate to say it, but poor. The lyrics mean nothing; they're trite and repetitive. I prefer when he was just making music, just interesting stuff to listen to, and now every song has lyrics but none of the songs are saying anything. The whole album blends together for me, most of the songs sound very similar. Sure, a few songs have stood out and made me pay attention, but they're definitely not what I would have expected from an artist like Moby.Disc two is interesting, but it's background music and not nearly good enough to save this album. I know Moby is capable of more! But next time I'll listen to the album before I buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better producer than vocalist","review":"I'm a huge fan of Moby (\\"Play\\" remains one of my favorite cds ever), but \\"Hotel\\" was badly disappointing. I knew this cd didn't contain the same level of high tempo music I've heard previously with Moby, but aside from a few tracks, the music never caught my attention. I don't mind his vocals, if they were placed properly, but Moby tries too much to be a lead singer on this disc, and it just didn't work for me. If you must buy it, I'd get it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why you shouldn't pay for music","review":"What was I thinking...I actually paid for a CD without listening to it first, only because it was Moby and I love everything he has ever released. Big mistake. This CD is neither evolved or refined, just a quick and dirty release. Listen to this one before you buy it and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Surprised It Didn't Impress","review":"Ambient CD aside, the album sounds generic. A few songs sound almost identical. The lyrics are full of cliches. The beats are all too familiar and boring. I agree with the other people on here who don't think Moby can carry an entire album vocally. What made Moby so wonderful was his ability to combine beautiful melodies, beats and vocals. This sounds like U2 to me in some places. We'll never get another 'Play,' but I'll keep hoping. I'll shelve it up there with Medulla, The BeeKeeper and Dear Catastrophe Waitress. What's happening to all my favorite artists?BTW...Check out Halou - 'Wiser.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!","review":"Moby has released a very bland Album that is lifeless&just background filler. in the past he was able to have soemthing catchy&Hide His limited vocal skills but this Set has Him flat vocally&Musically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moby makes a huge departure from his usual style","review":"I am a loyal Moby fan, as I own just about every one of his CD's and listen to them often, without tiring of them....but what a disappointment Hotel is. Moby makes the huge mistake of singing on nearly every song...and he can't sing for his life...horrible voice, not even able to reach certain ranges. Hang it up Moby and stick with the keyboards...and keep borrowing other's voices...this is what has worked for you so well on Play and 18. The only saving grace is the Hotel Ambient, alas, because Moby's voice is nowhere to be found.Not even Teany tea and honey can help that voice. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another way","review":"This album is not similar to \\"Play\\" or \\"18\\", it's more a pop album with short songs. Some of the songs like the intro, \\"lift me up\\", \\"where you end\\" or \\"dream about me\\" are very good, but i feel they are too short. Another thing i dont like too much is that moby's vocals are boring sometimes. Anyway musically is a very good album with 7 or 8 fantastic songs, but i feel that he can do it better"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This album is a total disappointment.

However the Pop Songs on the Main Album are Horrible","review":"There was a limited edition of Hotel released. A 2CD set that had a bunch of bad pop-rock music on CD1 and some soothing, evocative ambient music on CD2. If you can find that 2CD set, good, buy it. Otherwise beware of pathetic, pandering pop music that's more awful than U2 or Coldplay at their worst. The lyrics are uninspired and pleading, the melodies are trite. I felt like I wanted to throw the damn thing away as soon as I heard it!Hotel Ambient is another matter, it's very much Moby doing what he does best. Those Ambient tracks are not the best he's ever done in the genre but they add to his catalogue, not make you hate him like the asinine pop-rock drivel he produces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the purchase","review":"I really dig Moby's latest effort - it's a great album to drive and walk to - great grooves. Def. some party tunes on here - \\"Lift Me Up\\" and \\"beautiful.\\" some really nice ballads too. My fave is\\" Spiders\\" - they should use this song in Spiderman 17 or whatever # they are up to... i love the artowork too - it's a great deal - two full cd's and great packaging and great music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Moby's Strongest Effort","review":"I loved \\"Play\\", I liked \\"18\\"... But \\"Hotel\\" really just didn't do it for me. Nothing on this album really stands out. He would have been better off making a lot shorter album with better quality music. This cd is worth owning if you are already a fan of Mobys. It definately sounds like moby.. I was just disappointed to see that he doesn't seem to be growing with each album. Most of it was pretty generic. If this is your first Moby purchase, I'd recommend you go with Play or 18 for a better experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"moronic moby music","review":"Moby apparently hit his peak with \\"Play\\" and then lost whatever inspiration he had. Hotel is one of the worst albums I've heard in a long, long while. The songs are incredibly inane and sophomoric. The lyrics to \\"Beautiful\\" should serve as a good example. This album is the opposite of everything that was brilliant on \\"Play\\". I would never check into this Hotel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Career Mistake Number 1 : The Roach Motel","review":"Moby has put out some wonderful albums in the past. His gifts are in electronic music composition and creating moods with his music. He blessed us especially with albums \\"18\\" and \\"Everything is Wrong.\\" However, the buck stops when Moby begins embedding his horrific vocals as a centerpoint to his material. This album is barely even tolerable. I hope the next is instrumental once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"super Hits K,T.

Certainly, it also reveals the characteristic verbosity of XML, which might be offputting to some.Experienced ASP developers may want to check out the new security Provider Model.

They're fluff-- airplane, swimming pool reading. That's what I bought this one for. My expectations are for entertainment, not brilliant fiction or even a gripping storyline.But I think it's one of the worst of Robards' I've ever read. The plot is appalling-- an 18 year old girl is seduced by her 28 year old step father. (Alright, the husband of her stepmother, but still) Yes, yes, they fall in love. It is a romance novel, after all. But I still found myself astonished that this was an acceptable relationship and I'm very disappointed in this one. There is a disconcerting incestuous overtone, that simply wasn't good reading. So much so, that I won't resell this one or even put it on my bookshelf. It's going right into the garbage can.

You know, back when romance novels were actually romantic, and weren't given stupid titles like Irresistable and Scandalous.

He was amazing as Babs Johnson. He was funny and just extremely divine. Mink Stole also does a great job as Babs rival for the title. No matter how much of thie movie you can handle, you must watch the last scene and show everyone you know. My mom has not seen the whole movie but I made sure to show her all the disguesting scenes.

I believe humanity is capable of anything and I'm sure there are actually people like the ones portrayed in this film. Sometimes you have to see the worst that humanity can dredge up from its diseased bowels to appreciate the best it can achieve.I say see it, or as much of it as you can handle.

Rated X or NC-17 for it's semi-pornographic nature, offensive doesn't quite do this movie justice. This movie should leave you disturbed and longing to shower after watching. Some of the highlights include a sex scene with a man, woman, and chicken; a trans-sexual really eating a fresh dog dropping; and a sphincter openning and closing to the beat of one of the tracks. Normal people should avoid this movie like the plague. It is an insult to humanity. It should come with child safety locks.With all that said, it is a must see for those with twisted minds.

IT IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE WHEN VIEWED IN A LARGE GROUP! There is so many things that make you say, \\"ah, I really didnt want to see this,\\" that you will never make it through the film. However, if you can manage to see it on the big screen in a room full of 100 people, go for it. It then becomes an experience, and while the gross scenes are not any less gross, they do become more funny. The best way to describe my reaction to the film is I was cracking up more then I have at almost any other film; there were tears in my eyes. However, while doing so, I was not able to look at the screen because I just couldn't watch.That said, if you're not able to get past the... well, let's call them speed bumps... then you will not enjoy the film.

It's SUPPOSED to be the most vile movie ever! It's supposed to make you cringe one minute & laugh heartily the next. It's supposed to inspire a painful response. It's supposed to expose you to the vulgar imagery of Waters's imagination and netherworlds that regular folk would otherwise run and hide from. Think about it, from the safety of your own home, you, too, can experience the extreme deviance of The Filthiest People Alive.If you can't stand a camp movie style and you don't understand kitsch, don't watch it.

But man, I nearly lost my turkey dinner.Pink Flamingos has some extremely graphic depictions of incest. Some cannibalism thrown in just for fun. Plus a sex slave/baby ring. But what takes the disgusting proverbial cake for me is the sex scene involving a live chicken. Director John Waters reply to the outcries from animal rights advocates was something like \\"Well, chickens get butchered every day. This one got to be in a movie, get laid(again), and then become lunch for the film crew\\". Somehow I doubt they agreed.This campy movie is filled with other outrageous examples of bad taste.

All hail the prince of puke! There are so many unforgettable moments in this opus it would take weeks to write them all down.

The memorable lines, the gross out acts and the sheer who gives a f**k attitude makes for one terrific time even though you might feel a little numb in the end. One can only try and wonder what was going through people's minds who dreamed up this shock fest. It is one of the cinema's lasting contributions even though the acting at times is wooden and the plotline really makes little sense. A must have for all DVD collections if only for Posteritysakes.

It's NOT for the weak of heart or the non-macabre sense of humor.All in a spirit of camp and outrageous sin, this is truly one of the filthiest movies of all time. \\"The future of city living\\", as one original filmgoer puts it.We've got an amazing litany of sins: stealing, murder, incest (while licking furniture), rape (with a chicken AND a turkey baster, but not at the same time), white slavery, selling babies to lesbians, and the all-time Divine eating dog poo.It also has a pretty good soundtrack.If you laugh at human misery and suffering (like me), you're going to LOVE this.

Just to see what was going to happen next is enough alone to keep you watching. It is good to see that there are people out there who care to see more than the typical Hollywood blockbuster. Be a bit proud of yourself for viewing it! It shows the rebel within yourself. Independent films as well as low budget movies need more support.

It seems to me that Mr. Waters just felt like making an extremely disturbing movie with all his sick hippie friends back in the early 70's. Anyone who enjoys this movie is perversely demented with extreme mental problems. This deserves a MUCH more harsh rating than NC-17. Showgirls and Orgazmo are family movies compared to this.

This collection covers all of the different kinds of music he has recorded, lots of the \\"Blue Yodel\\" recordings are included as well as many of other classics like \\"Away Out On That Mountain,\\"\\"Waiting For a Train,\\"\\"In The Jailhouse Now,\\" (which was later a huge hit for Webb Pierce),\\"Daddy & Home,\\" plus lots more. 20 tracks in all. I recommend this music to all of the fans out there as it is very adequate for most people (the people who don't want to invest in Rounder's series of complete Jimmie Rodgers recordings who want just an excellent summary of his great work), as the title of the collection and the title of this review says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living History","review":"My dad had a scratched, old 45 single with \\"Jailhouse Now\\" and \\"Muleskinner Blues\\" which we used to listen to in the early '60s.

For those who love great artwork in comics, this short run by Neal Adams on X-Men in the late 60's is really one of the highlights. So why would Marvel treat it so poorly? One reviewer mentioned the previous print job as being worse but I disagree. This is a mess; costumes change color from page to page, some pages are flat, saturated color while others are dot printed (which looks far worse on high grade paper than on newsprint!). I also hope they give this a third, improved printing. For those of you who can't wait, the great artwork is still there, it's just buried under an inept rush-job. Personally, I would've prefered the thing in b&w."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on data and pictures - maps are sorely lacking","review":"American Shortline Railway Guide is a great help for any train buff. Over 500 short lines are described: history, current status, number of engines (some lines with full listing), cars, as well as address of owner and radio frequencies. I especially liked the many pictures accompanying the text. There is really one drawback only: The book does not contain any maps. You will need a train atlas or a Rand Mc Nally on the side, unfortunately. Other interesting details are lists of abandoned and non-operating lines as well as addresses of ownerships companies. A must-have for US train buffs, especially in conjunction with the Train-Watchers Guide to North American Railroads (also by George W. Drury)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book!!!","review":"This is an amazing book on the conflict in the Middle East. The book is broken into three segments, of which only two are gripping. The Jerusalem section of the book was okay. Nothing fancy unless you are interested in the internal political problems of Israel. Well overall great book!! Look for the Hama Rule!! That is the best part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My View","review":"I cannot express how much I got out of this book. My only regret is not having read it sooner. It was a facinating account of Middle East culture & politics, and of the life of an international journalist tryign to make life normal in rather dangerous terrain. Friedman's analysis of how American Jews view Israel is also right on. Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"While providing some idea of what living in Beirut was like, as an american who grew up in Beirut, I found this an uninsightful blase accounting of what were extremely exciting times, to say the least. This is good example of why foreign reporters were generally regarded as idiots by fellow americans living in the region. It is particularly amusing, that Mr Freidman currently enjoys celebrity status based in large part on this C- work. That's some good marketing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Scholarship","review":"Tom Freidman's work is a collection of anecdotes and opinion with an occasional reference to an historical fact. As is always true of his work, it beguiles. He pretends an even handed look at the the Israelis and the Palestinians, but a close examination of his conclusion shows that he advocates tough TALK toward the Israelis and tough ACTION toward the Palestinians. Where are the statistics showing the amount of aid the U.S. has given to Israel vs the amount given to the Palestinians? Where are the facts concerning the number of Palestinians killed by the Israeli armed forces compared to the number of Israelis killed by Arab suicide bombers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reality book","review":"The best book I have ever read about the Middle East confilict... I read the book when it first came out the read it again (the new version) nine years later... during these nine years I have traveled in Egypt, Syria, Jordan, UAE, Israel and Lebanon.. all I can say is that the book sheds light on the most ambiguos aspects of life in the M.E. The only problem is that the book is very realistic and reality hurts... I belong to one of the minorities of the Middle East... Thank you Mr. Friedman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible history - Should be able to give it no stars","review":"I know this is a popular book. When I lecture on the Middle East, everyone seems to have read it. There are some good parts -- such as the author's description of his personal experience in Lebanon. It's his historical analysis that's the problem. He argues at one point that you can understand Hafez Assad's seige of Hama (February 1982) by understanding the Umayyid Dynasty (beginning in the 8th century). This is classic Western bias. No one would say you could understand (insert modern Western massacre here, say Mai Lai) by understanding (insert ancient Western history here, say the Crusades). And yet Friedman is basically saying that Arabs haven't changed in a millenia. While this is obviously not true, (and couldn't possibly be true of anyone) it reveals an underlying and subtle racism -- or just abject stupidity. There are plenty of better books, and this shows me that being an easy read will beat being responsible any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure genius","review":"If you really want to understand the whole psychology and social mores of the Miidle East, driven by history and religion, this is a must read. This will help anyone understand the current situations which exist there and how different their society is from America and Europe. If you have to read one book on the Middle East, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this to understand the Middle East better","review":"This is without doubt one of the best books ever written about the Middle, treating the events between 1979 to 1988.I started to get interested in the Near East at the beginning of the 90ies and was looking for books that would help me to explain me the situation also back in the recent past. This is the best book I found.Friedman shares with us his own experiences, delivers us all important facts about this time and especially gives us a deep insight in both sides of the conflict, giving preference to neither of them, offering to the reader the decision to choose their camp, if they feel like.This book has helped me a great deal in understanding the different factions, their actions and motivations much clearly than any other book."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Understandings/New Perspectives","review":"This is one of the finest and most intelligent and interesting books I have ever read. It opened my eyes and widened my perspectives, providing me with a new and thorough understanding of the historical basis for the Middle East situation and conflicts. It describes in intelligent and vivid detail what life in the Middle East is really like for both Arabs and Israelis, and presents the real issues driving the politics of that region--something we are rarely given in our news media. The book is extremely well written and displays both the genius of Thomas Frieman and his genuine caring for the region and its peoples. As the cover says, if you only read one book on the Middle East, this is the one to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the place","review":"I did not enjoy this book. The book is very disjoint does not give the reader an understanding of this very important topic. Instead he more or less just tells you a bunch of stories of things that he encountered while in the middle east. No real connection between them, just a bunch of stuff he came across over his 30 years of reporting. There's a lot of unnecessary information in these stories. I found the examples/scenarios far too specific and as a result the writing did not help me understand the BIG PICTURE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should only pay for the \\"Beirut\\" part of this book.","review":"Colorful and emphatic account of Lebanese civil war and Israel's involvement. Poetic, humanist, absorbing, and historically correct. Unfortunately Mr. Friedman's analysis is rather disconcerting in parts of the book describing Israel. It's not the belated in its originality, revisionist views on Holocaust and suspiciously vigilant and negative attitude to most of the things Israeli. It's that the author forgets there are casualties on both sides of the trenches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent","review":"One of my favorite books. Learned a lot from it. All in all, very interesting. Hilarious. Absolutely smashing. An excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre-in-chief","review":"I happen to know Thomas Friedman personally. He is short (like Yasser Arafat - the radioactive \\"Palestinian\\"), pugnacious and profoundly mediocre. He makes a living by inventing stories, dressed as objective analysis, that Westerners will buy. His book \\"The World is Flat\\" is the only one worth reading; the rest is pure garbage.If you are looking for books that promote Arab extremism and terrorism, than buy this one and you will be happy. Otherwise look for something that is less biased. In the War of Civilizations, U.S. and Israel stand high and proud. But some Americans and Europeans would rather kneel and maybe save their cowardly heads from being cut off by Muslim swords."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone who is unfamiliar with the region because it really pulls you in like a novel or a flick, and it paints a vivid picture. However, several academics are unsatisfied with some of Friedman's views, and the omission of various facts. I think that's pretty tough to avoid considering the subject, though, and a sizable proportion of the work done on this region is accompanied by similar concerns. From Beirut to Jerusalem is a good place to start if you're interested in studying the Middle East, but it's only one of many views about the region, and to get a firm grasp on the struggles that occupy so many of our minds and TV screens, one will need to delve into the works of ALL sides.Despite the thickness, it's a pretty quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fair and balanced, sort of...","review":"I've always enjoyed reading Friedman's articles for the New York Times, which like him has a persistent but mild pro-Israel bias. However Friedman always manages to keep a rational perspective most of the time, which makes his writing very palatable.This book is a great overview of the huge hopeless mess that is the Arab-Israeli conflict, is well written and well-researched unlike your typical PRO- or ANTI- polemic that are published en masse every year. Very enjoyable and enriching, even if you don't agree with all of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The unfairness of false symmetry","review":"A number of other Amazon reviews have pointed out the major error of Friedman. He bends over backwards to be ' objective' and in the process distorts reality . He has a visceral dislike for the Jews who live in Judaea and Samaria and cannot write of them with sympathy. He is one of those who argues a ' false symmetry' between the Palestinians who advocate terror, and the Israelis whose military action is in self- defense. He pretends to be fair, but lacks real judgment and the courage to see that one side in the Middle East conflict is far more right than the other. In this he is the perfect representative of the paper he represents, the NY Times which for years has worked to blame Israel when it should have been defending the Middle East's only democracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy 2-pews","review":"Consent & deny. Filling in the gaps with retro-fitted pleasure craft billbowas, frittering away the last vestiges of ceiling con-cavedness, somewhat fluid morants of militancy are left hanging by a chad. Helping the booze bound will be tantamount to a feeling of dis-servatude. Catfish?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing evaluation","review":"This book is so amazing, just for the neutral opinion that the author has throughout all its chapters. Well of course, its been written as an eyes of an American, but none the less it is quite absorbing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is intrigues by the complexity of the region.This book brings back to life the question I always asked myself, 'how come Yaseer Arafat received the Noble peace prize' which proves the fact that' one persons terrorist is other persons freedom fighter!!!!'Definitely read it, you will not be disappointed. The humor in the book all through is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into How the Middle East Works","review":"This book was recommended to me by a Friend, after 9/11, to help me understand the \\"thinking\\" in that area. Since then I have done a great deal of research but this was my \\"starter\\" book. I found it to be excellent in giving the true complexity of what has been and is now going on in that areaI recommend this book to anyone who wants a history lesson on the Civil War of the 80's in Lebanon and then, compare what happened then to what is happening now.I find it fascinating to hear what the perceived solutions to the problems at the time were, what was done, and what has happened since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sand in my eyes","review":"Reading this book gave me a much better understanding of the history and current struggles of life in this part of the world. From a culture so different from our western way of life, it was extremely helpful to have it interpreted through the eyes of an american immersed in the confusion and chaos of life in this region of the world. This book is a great introduction into understanding how and why things happen the way they do for many people in the middle east."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll feel like a scholar of modern mid-east history","review":"You will feel like a scholar of contemporary Middle East history when you are finished. However, it is very easy and fast reading. I just returned from a two year assignment in the Sinai. This book answered almost all of my questions about regional conflicts. It also provided a great deal of insight into the attitudes and behavior of Israelis and Arabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for objectivity?","review":"Then study mathematics.Looking for reality? Then you might be open to studying modern history, politics and culture. I'm convinced at this point that nothing short of a dry run of unexplained facts (such as numbers, geographic maps, etc.) could possibly satisfy all sides; otherwise, everyone's looking for a trumpet to praise their side of the story.Thomas Friedman gives a vivid portrait that goes further than anything I've read to date to present a complete picture of the Israel/Palestine region as he sees it. If you want to understand the region, I'd suggest starting here. If you want to feel better about your own personal inclinations, I'd suggest the official websites of either the Israeli Foreign Ministry or the Palestinian Authority."},{"rating":"2","title":"still useful ten years later","review":"This book is as balanced an account as one can find of the middle east conflict in general. his elucidation of the byzantine history of the lebanon conflict is excellent, as is his dispassionate analysis of the Israel-Palestine conflict. Perhaps the best evidence that he is onto something is that both sides think he's biased against them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A multi-faceted view of the Middle East","review":"\\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" ranks as one of the best books I've read pertaining to the Middle East. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it back down. (I know, sounds cliched, but it's true!) I've read a number of other books on Middle Eastern politics and culture, but few have captured the essence of the region more accurately than Friedman's version! The author's personal accounts glaze the book with an authentic and authoritative worldview about the many political and social facets that hold root in both Beirut and Jerusalem. Some of the stories are outright hilarious, and those readers who haven't been to the region (myself included) will find themselves enlightened by a view of the Middle East not found on the evening news. The author's personal stories are the treasure of this book, bringing the reader into a world of polar opposites - war/peace, religious/aetheist, democratic/totalitarian. A great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambo's analysis","review":"No matter how \\"exciting\\" this book may be to read (and not to base our opinions upon), just like Hollywood's Rambo, where Stalone knows everything about his enemy and overcomes all the problems to finally kill a whole army or nation (where ironically they all happen to be in what is known today as \\"terrorists\\") and sells it all around the globe. Friedman thinks he knows it all when it comes to \\"analysing\\" the Lebanese crisis and the Israeli socio-religious complexity, while in my opinion reading about the Mideast's history may be helpful, in addition to some classical music knowledge at least to know that Pachelbel's CaNon doesnt include any firing of any caNNon. And by the way, a Canon is the strictest form of imitation in musical composition in which the voices or melodies begin one after another, at regular intervals, successively taking up the same subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"a lebanese","review":"That ignore buffoon of a writer what can I say he said it himself he lived in west Beirut and worked with a group of pro Palestinian pro-arab people that buffoon blames every thing on the big bad Christians I fought in the war what that says is all wrong he doesn't even know the difference between the phalangist and the Lebanese forces... he spend half a chapter blabbing about the sabra and shatila massacre but oh so innocently forgets the mountain massacre committed by his friends for stupid ignorant who want to write about the war let him get his facts straight the phalangist lost the mountain war because the Israeli army cut of its supply because they where pissed of at the Christians because they did not full implement the 17 of may accord for people who want to know what happened in the war I advise u to ignore this and the other idiot Robert fisk"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best but not the Only Book to Read Now","review":"Like so many the world over, I love this book and recommend it highly. It is however far from the Only book to read. Following Friedman are other books I find, if not as panoramic and if not as in-genius, important and wonderful. In no particular order, but all less well known, they concern the same turf but either from a slightly different angle or from a later date: Danny Rubinstein's \\"The People of Nowhere\\", Amira Hass' \\"Drinking the Sea at Gaza\\" and Wendy Orange's \\"Coming Home to Jerusalem.\\" With these four books read altogether one begins to see with real clarity. Connect the dots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seminal and never truly Dated","review":"Friedman's book is an essential primer, should be the first book read on middle east. It can be seen as dated but it isn't because the ongoing violence has roots and many books published earlier on Israel or Jerusalem are important for understanding the current mess. After Friedman I suggest reading also: Adina Hoffman, Wendy Orange, Amira Hass, Glen Frankel, Mordechai Richtler, Benny Morris, and more writers than I can list without boring you.

The latter is a reworked version of the Jade God's Eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor sequel for a great character","review":"As much as I love Elric and the Melnibonean mythology, SAILER ON THE SEAS OF FATE is a disappointing follow up to ELRIC OF MELNIBONE.The book starts with Elric finding himself in a strange land. He boards a mysterious ship and sails off to the first of three unrelated, convenient adventures which do little to progress the overall saga. The stories serve more to explain the whole ETERNAL CHAMPION concept, along with giving details of MELNIBONE'S history and the interaction of all the planes of existence. And ultimately, after 160 pages, nothing really happens.Though the book is about Elric and his adventures, I found myself really wishing to hear news of Melnibone and the characters who Elric left behind. They are all as much a part of the fun and adventure in the first volume as is Elric. They should have been given some attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading \\"Elric of Melnibone,\\" I was looking forward to this novel, but whereas the former was (at least for the first half) original, poetic, and hypnotically written, this book is the lowest form of hack work, one of the worst novels I have yet read.

At his worst --- and he is at his worst here --- he is writing strictly to pay the rent. This fix-up of some generic Eternal Champion stories is clearly a piece that never went beyond a first draft, and adds nothing of substance to the Elric saga. This is not the kind of work that Moorcock takes very seriously, and neither should the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling excursion into the heart of the West","review":"If you have an open and inquisitive mind, no matter what your political outlook, you will enjoy this exploration of western America and our relationship with this unique landscape. Solnit weaves discussions about the settlement of the west by Euro-Americans, native American rights, nuclear testing, and other critical issues, with ruminations about H.D.

In addition you'll hear Domingo attempt to stretch out his \\"Poeta y Guerrero\\" theme with social compositions \\"ala\\" Ruben Blades.

If the people in your household have differing schedules, the early and the late get the same hot cup.The instructions recommend warming the carafe with hot water before brewing. If you don't, however, the incoming coffee warms it plenty (i.e. don't fret over preheating the carafe).It only takes a brew or two to get used to lining up the arrows. The carafe doesn't fit in the machine if it isn't closed, and the coffee doesn't pour if it isn't open, so let the arrows point the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"thermal coffeepot","review":"Very good product.

I have added hot water to the carafe and yes this helps but if you like to use the programmable feature of this pot you can't do this. My most frustrating complaint is how the carafe pours.

The cup you pour right after brewing is just barely hot enough, and it's downhill from there.Then, just as I was getting ready to give up anyway, the carafe started leaking at the seam between the stainless part and the plastic upper part that supports the handle and lid. I investigated and discovered a piece of really poor engineering, where a sharp rim of the stainless is forced against a very thin soft gasket in a way pretty much guaranteed to cut through it, after which you get little leaks that create stains on the side of the pot and, on especially good days, manage to dump enough of your freshly-brewing coffee on the counter to make a real mess.Forget it.

I like the thermal carafe, since I abhor coffee that sits on a warming plate. The carafe keeps it hot long enough for my morning ritual.

Quite disappointed; I've had good luck with other non-thermal carafe Mr Coffee machines in the past (and in fact, that's what I just replaced this one with.)Also the lid is a bit of a pain to get used to - what's wrong with traditional screw-on lids? Those work very well. And finally, the spout is poorly designed and it's really hard not to drip coffee all over the counter when pouring.I could have lived with the last two flaws, but couldn't take the weak, nasty-tasting coffee.

To keep the coffee hot the lid has to be on pretty tight and I find it very difficult to open. I too have had the problem with the filter falling over and getting the pot full of grounds.

It's very hard to pour water in left handed without it going out the back overflow slot or too far forward on to the plate.

But this device relies entirely on the thermal pot to keep the coffee warm. The weight of the pot with the double metal walls and it does a great job of cooling the coffee down to just over body temp. The thermal pot should prevent coffee from scorching, so why not put a heating element there??? If you want HOT coffee, you have to run the device first with water only to warm the pot and then run it to make coffee. This thing is a disaster.Finally, enough with the specialized lids and sneaky valves. God forbid you forget to put the screw down lid on at 6 in the morning. The drip basket stops the coffee flowing and the whole brewing mess goes back into the filling resevoir. Can't they make the anti-drip value removable?? I can wait the three minutes for my coffee to brew and I can see when the coffee is coming out of the drip basket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!!","review":"I've never been so disappointed with a product. The water does not get hot. The coffee comes out looking and tasting like very weak tea. You can't get the coffee out of the carafe without entirely removing the lid.

They cetainly know nothing about Egyptian pharonic royalty and its scribal culture.It is a deligthful book for the ignorant and the mad.

That said, it WAS written in Egypt.The writings were highly influential, and many Renaissance Humanists and Neoplatonists studied them closely--Ranaissance scholars DID believe them to be of Ancient Egyptian origins, however as stated previously, this is not the case.That said, the book itself might be useful and relevant, but the back cover description error throws the rest of the book into serious question, even as a popular as opposed to scholarly take on the subject.I would strongly recommend that interested people purchase a different translation--there are a number of translations that come up on the search, any one of them would probably be more accurate and useful than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliberate misinterpretations","review":"This is more a text \\"inspired by\\" the Greek and Latin Hermetica, and not a translation.

Mead are vastly preferable and the Scott text published by Shambala is a far better investment and contains the whole 18 complete tractates and Stobaea Hermetica to boot.

You can hear a lot of Indy/alternative rock influences, and some songs reflect those influences more than others. I think some songs are great and are really well balanced, but the album, as a whole, kind of fizzles out towards the end... I would have preferred a little more \\"push\\" through the album with one or two more higher-energy songs to balance out the slower, more sombre ballads.

They're expensive and I didn't really know how to buy them, store them, how much to use, and all that. This very well-written book tells all--and now that there's no mystery and I'm not afraid of making an costly mistake, I will buy truffles and truffle products. Truffle butter, honey, oil, cheese, and flour are all simple to use and will be great fun to play around with. To me they are the best kind of convenience foods--they add alot of flavor and luxury without a lot of cooking or prep time. I don't spend lots of time cooking--I think you can prepare great food without it--and this book seems to have that same philosopy. The recipes are simple and enticing. They often focus on humble foods--like potatoes, eggs, pasta, rice, lentils, and vinaigrettes--which give you a great way to flavor all your favorite foods and make any meal special with very little effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven in a shriveled little plum","review":"I had never been interested in prunes because they always seemed like a \\"special\\" treat just for grandpa.

The basic premise of the story was interesting but all of the repetitive questions drove me nuts! The book could have been reduced by one third had he not repeated the same information, over and over and over and over and over! I may try another L'Amour book, but if this book is indicative of his style, I'll swear off his books for good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Science Fiction Meets the Old West","review":"Without exception, in my opinion, this is the worst book Bantam ever published by Louis L'Amour. Perhaps it is because I like \\"tradtional\\" westerns, or because the book is just plain \\"slow\\" especially at the beginning as L'Amour sets the plot. Either way, unless you need this book to complete your set of his work, forget it. Louis L'Amour wrote some great westerns early in his career, but later on he let his philosophy of life and the like interfere with the story telling. Spend your money else where is my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his usual standards","review":"There was way too much telling rather than showing in this book. And the telling was repeated, nearly word-for-word, over and over and over again.Suspension of disbelief was hampered by the protagonist ignoring obvious danger signals, and areas that could have been developed for suspense were glossed over. The ending was no great surprise, although a last-minute twist did provide a moment of enjoyment.Alas, too little, too late. The concept was great, and with more research in physics and anthropology, it could have withstood even the pedestrian writing. But it just doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great.","review":"Found an old hardcover of this packed away, had read it many years ago, forgotten all about it, and read it again. The premise was good, very mysterious at the start...but then it fails on several levels. Long stretches of the book are very boring. Repeated long drives, with the same thoughts in the protagonist's head. Long conversations with the same dull characters over and over. Very little action until towards the end, and even then it's blunted. I got through this book very quickly as I felt I was reading the same lines over and over. Could have been much better given the premise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the average Louis L'Amour story.","review":"I gave it four stars because it is different. To some it might be a plus, but to others, expecting a certain style, it isn't what they are looking for in a Louis L'Amour. Having said that, I do like the story. The idea of alternative realities is explored in a unique way. It shows the Anasazi Indians living side by side with our modern world at some unnamed point. I don't want to give away any plot lines so I will say no more.If you like Louis L'Amour, keep in mind it is different than his normal fare, but it is still a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"L'Amour wrote at least 27 better!","review":"I have read 28 L'Amour novels and prize most of them very highly indeed. But Haunted Mesa is one of the last of his to read. As others have indicated, it needed a good editor to cut it in half--the constant return to the same redundant ideas and questions and musings is quite tiresome. It does not advance the action or the thoughts of the characters. The undigested references to scientific concepts of a \\"4th dimension\\" in space-time, and quantum mechanics, does not give plausibility to the fantasy plot of a tribe of cliff-dwellers and others falling through a \\"door\\" in \\"space-time\\"; and the story itself does not rise to mytho-poetic resonance. And as a professor of religious studies, I would have to say that it does little to advance our understanding or appreciation of Anasazi religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading!","review":"I originally borrowed a copy of this book off of an uncle who had most of Louis Lamour's books. I ended up reading it until it started to fall apart, so I bought him a new copy. The only problem I have with the storyline is that the author took abiout 60% of the book just to get the main hero from one side of the \\"viel\\" to the other. I wish he had made the remaining part of the book just a little longer.In this book the author has the protagonist find the Iron Mountain, an old steamboat that disappeared in the late 1800's. No-one knew what happened to it, only that a steamboat nearly ran into the barges it had been taking upriver on the Mississippi. I suppose that finding it in an alternate dimension is as plausible as anything else. I still pull my copy of this book off the shelf and read it as often as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best Work","review":"First of all, I love Louis L'Amour's books, and have read all of his western novels multiple times. This one is set in a more modern 1970's or so setting, adn there were just too mnay repetitive references to the past and the main characters special abilities. I'd save your money and pick up the first Sackett book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual Louis L'Amour","review":"If you are expecting the usual sort of action western that L'Amour usually wrote, forget it. This is a modern-day novel of a man who goes to help his buddy out of a jam and ends up in another world, or at least another dimension of this world. The first time I read this, I was speechless by the time I finished it. I have a friend whose husband is into the 'unexplainable' and he couldn't put it down either. But you may not like it if you don't like science fiction, supernatural or other departure-from-reality themes. I think it's awesome, even though I don't believe in parallel worlds and that sort of thing. To me, it also shows that L'Amour wasn't just a western action writer; he could think outside the box when he wanted to and he was an excellent writer who researched his subject constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haunted Mesa is hauntingly good!!","review":"The Haunted Mesa is one of the single best books i have ever read. In my opinion it is the best book that Louis L'Amour wrote in his career. The whole book is wreathed in an air of mystery and suspense. The book follows Mike Raglan as he tries to find out what happened to his scientist friend Erik Hokart who has gone missing. It delves into an area of myth and legend that surrounds the ancient anasazi cliff dwellers. The only part of the book that i thought could have been better set up was the love interest between Mike and the native American Kawazsi. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes action adventure, fantasy, or western books. I actually read the paperback version till it fell apart then bought it in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haunted Mesa by Louis L'Amour","review":"I am not a fan of westerns; this book from Louis L'Amour virtually creates its own genre. I have read and reread this book over the years, am haunted by it until I read it again, sated for awhile, then the haunting begins again. Certainly the title is appropriate for a variety of reasons.Fans of fantasy and science fiction and the unexplained would like this book. This is one I want on my permanent shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mesa that could have been more.","review":"I like a strong character that is prepared to fight the evil and bad in the world and has no \\"backdown\\" in them. Mike Raglan is all of that, but he is dragged down way to much in this story by his continued self doubt and always asking himself if he is doing the right thing. \\"Enough already\\" I enjoyed the story which has an exciting finish, but it could have been done in 100 pages instead of 427 pages. It was a struggle to stay with, but I did. This was my first LOUIS L'AMOUR book, but I will try another someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely Louis didn't write this,","review":"This is one of the first books that I have ever not been able to finish because it was so terrible. I've read dozens or more Louis L'Amore books and enjoyed them. He's had a few absurd relationships in his books before but this one takes the cake. In the middle of the book he randomly starts calling another character honey and acting as though they've been an item for years when they only just met. And the rattling on and on about the same ideas the main character is having....reminds me of when friends of guy trouble and can't stop repeating the same scene over and over again to avoid doing anything. It was simply awful. I don't know if he wrote this or someone else wrote it for him, but it certainly wasn't his typical style of writing. Maybe loose ends got brought together at the end, but I didn't make it. Get his other books and let this one go the way of the anasazi."},{"rating":"2","title":"The haunted Mesa","review":"Have always enjoyed Louis L'Amour's writings. Hated to stop reading for mundane household chores. Not the usual fare for his readers, but a good book none-the-less."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOMETHINGS WRONG HERE FOLKS","review":"I can't believe this book was written by such a well respected and widely published (90 novels) author. The fact that he died the year following its release may be a factor. The repetition in this book is unbelievable. It could be shortened by a third and would lose nothing. There are places where he seems to lose the thread and starts back at a different tangent.I found the story line interesting in spite of being very far out. I see it is available here for one cent,buy it and be prepaired to skip many pages. However I wouldn't pay much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haunted Mesa is not haunting.","review":"Maui H.S.I've read Louis L'Amour and I can't believe he wrote this book. I believe he started the book because the first couple of chapters were a could not put down draw you in. Then up until the ending, it was so boring and repetitive the story lost its energy. I wanted to shoot Mike Raglan myself. He whined and did drama about not wanting to be there to help Erik, but forced himself to stay. Characters were brought in like Louis used to do for an effect and time, but Louis used the characters well and then let them go. In this book the characters come and go without rhyme or reason and have little value in the overall story. The ending picked up, but it was a let down. The dog saves the hero, the men get the girls, and the opening is closed forever, what tripe. Although this was meant as a posthumous testament to Louis, whoever wrote it needs to keep his day job. Louis L'Amour was one of a kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"MESA VERDE CONJECTURE","review":"I have been to and thru Mesa Verde, so bought this book in Denver. I knew it had to be fiction since the Anasazi have left nothing of themselves behind to refute Mr. L'Amour's conjecture. A great deal of this book is questions, questions and more questions. I was tired of all the question marks over every little piece of evidence.Mike Raglan equivocated on every decision he made... and this was a man who was supposed to have ions of experience with the perimeters of the occult. But I stuck it out til the end. The last book I read of Mr. L'Amour's was Wagon Master, I think, and I was just a teenager then. He wrote Hondo which John Wayne starred in and that was great.I take this book with a grain of salt. Fairly interesting, but I will stick to his Westerns from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I think the premise was good. The action hero protagonist was fine. The settings were interesting. But the plot was jagged, characters were underdeveloped, there was too much repetition, not enough plausibility in the relationships or character's motivations, and far too many coincidental happenings. It seems like the book wasn't fully completed. It's a great sketch that needs a lot of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read this book because I am familiar with the Mayan stories of Xibalba (which L'Amour transcribes as Shibalba). He transfers the location to the American Southwest. Fine so far. But the plot is VERY thin. He repeats the same questions over and over and over - Who are these people? What are they doing? What do they want? What does it all mean? Etc. Etc. This becomes extremely tedious and boring. Also, I was expecting/hoping for some plot twists. Nothing. I could have guessed the outcome of the book after the first few pages. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmally disappointing psuedo-action tale","review":"I cannot believe I wasted 2 days of my life reading this absolutely awful novel. The author starts with an ostensibly interesting premise, and then proceeds as if he does not know what to do with it. Sections of expository lecturing follow pages of questioning non-action. Complete drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst book ever written by L'amour","review":"This book is read like a dog chasing his tail round and round, or like the window on the mesa to go to the other side; dragging along and so contritedly written. When L'amour became so old, he's just trying so hard to probe the other side of the world, if any or ever existed. There are so many repeated pages that read the same, very tiresome to read along."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAY WHAT???????","review":"This book started off BAD and got worse and worse as it went on.

John Grant may have come up with a solution to the energy crises, and he is a part of a complicated plot that skips around a lot and is hard to follow at times. There is war in the Middle East (what's new!), and this war does spread, a picture of a not rosy future.I found that Bart Kosko did not do very well in character development and also did poorly in describing places and scenery. It seems this novel should have been longer to flesh it out.In this book you will read about mind transfers to computer chips, artificial wombs, nanotechnology, and other technology about thirty years down the road, and all of this was done in a satisfactory way, but there is a lot more better science fiction out there to read, unless of course the subject matter of this book should interest you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nano Rating for Nanotime","review":"A lot of poor quality novels are \\"pushed\\" out into the SF world and this is by far one of the poorest.

This book, being one of them, was a major disappointment. It clearly did not live up to the others.

I stuck with it hoping it would eventually take off but sadly, it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing insightful in Therapy","review":"Jonathan Kellerman needs to get some therapy about his writer's block. This book was poorly written with plenty of 'filler' and not much story. His editor needed to cut out endless passages that do not add to the story telling or plot. For example, his love life adds nothing but some misguided \\"insight\\" of a therapist. In the jacket, it says the author is a psychologist, but he writes like he has never seen a couch, let alone been in the profession.In short, the book is a waste of time when there are so many other great books out there. read \\"Motherless Brooklyn\\" or reread Dan Brown , butn don't waste your time on this one flat bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT worth the money","review":"So, are you a Kellerman fan who's been happy with his previous work? Great, but don't tarnish that happiness by wasting money on this novel.

I also quite liked the supporting characters, especially the Quick family.My only real problem with Kellerman is his over-reliance on description. I don't really need to know what the bookshelves of some minor character looks like. His descriptions can sometimes run as long as an entire page, and I just wind up skimming.Otherwise, another highly satisfying book from one of crime's best writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Jonathan what did you do?","review":"As a regular fan and reader of all things Kellerman (including Faye) I rushed right out and purchased Therapy. Right from the begining things didn't feel right. In this book Milo and Alex spend all their time driving around LA, narrating the streets they are on, taking the reader down different who-done-its senarios, without ever really connecting the dots. Also Robin makes a cameo, but you ask yourself why, because it added NOTHING to the story. Allison's presence in the book is also unremarkable, and at the end it made me curious if she was just in the book to meet Mr. Kellerman's page requirement. Finally, the mystery characters were so disjointed that I became frustrated trying to remember why they were involved in the plot. I finished this book last night and I thought thank goodness that is over. It really was a terrible book and I gave it two stars because I'm still a Kellerman fan. Let's just hope he hasn't lost his touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a disappointment","review":"I had a hard time finishing this book.

Killerman with Milo and Alex and I wonder who is really the gay one. I mean Alex spends most of his time describing what person is wearing and watches and shoes and ear rings and on and on. And as for him being a psychologist - whoopee - that is about as far from a respectable doctor as you can get.I didn't read all of the book and gave it back to goodwill so some other sucker could by it. This author is terrible, he needs to find another way to make a living and quit boring everyone to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time reading this disappointing novel...","review":"If I could give this zero stars I would. I am a Kellerman fan, and I was extremely disappointed with this book. The plot was weak and it was a slow read. I kept going hoping that is was going to get better but it never did. Some of his older books are worth the read, but not this one. Save your money and buy The Clinic or Bad Love - both are much better than this disappointing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Therapy","review":"The author of this book pulls from his own experience with Therapy, not by having Therapy but by giving others Therapy. With this in mind he can get into the minds of his characters and see through their eyes what would happen if this happened or that. He has written a great story here putting together that experience and the skill of his writing ability to create this thriller that will hold you on the edge of your chair until you finish the book.

Too many characters. Too much information. I put it down too often, and it took me a long time to read it, which is not a good sign. Every character was eating; the sister with the biscotti, the doctor with the peppermint stick, the ex hubby with the popcorn - it was his writing style just slapping me in the face and too obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downward path continues","review":"The Delaware series continues to worsen. Milo Sturgis and Alex Delaware are increasingly self-righteous, sanctimonious, and cartoon tough. I initially liked this series because Milo, at least, seemed to have conflicts and to be an unlikely police detective hero. However, increasingly the series seems to be a vehicle for exposing what must be Kellerman's own aversions and predilections. The characterization is cardboardy (even by the none-too-demanding standards of detective fiction) and the plot is diffuse and unsatisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorhead - Overkill (30th anniv. documentary)","review":"Great documentary about 30 years of Motorhead.

The album opens with the summer sing-along song, the #1 hit \\"She's Got It All\\". The album has the perfect balance of uptempo country songs, and beautiful ballads. The song \\"That's Why I'm Here\\" is a touching ballad about an alcoholic, a definite highlight on the CD. Kenny also manages to do a cover of Tina Turner's \\"Steamy Windows\\" and does the song justice. He also joins Tracy Lawrence and George Jones on the honky tonk, \\"From Hillbilly Heaven To Honky Tonk Hell\\". Some touching ballads include \\"I Will Stand\\", \\"A Chance\\", and the acoustic version of past hit \\"When I Close My Eyes\\". Other highlights include \\"You Win, I Win, We Lose\\", \\"Lonely Needin Lovin\\" and \\"She Always Says It First\\", but there is no bad song on here, no filler whatsoever. Overall I WILL STAND is a consistent album and one of his best. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Chesney has outdone himself again.","review":"One need only to listen to this album once to understand why each CD that Chesney releases outsells the one before. He is on his way to becoming one of country music's powerhouse artists with a tremendous mixture of heartfelt ballads like \\"That's Why I'm Here\\", \\"I Will Stand\\", and \\"A Chance\\" as well as honky tonk classics like \\"Steamy Windows\\".

I'm not saying that some of it does not involve Jimi Hendrix. But, listening to these tracks made me very curious, and I found a very creditable website about Early Hendrix which says that 'Bring My Baby Back', 'Suspicious', 'Good Feeling' and 'Hot Trigger' are fakes, as in containing no involvement by Hendrix, just a 'lead guitar player playing \\"Hendrix-style\\".' In the case of 'Good Feeling', it's also singing 'Hendrix-style'. A bit lame and sad, unless you think it is an homage. Apologies to all if this is all genuine Hendrix, though I seriously doubt it. Track 15, for example, is the real deal. But, my feeling is that these 4 tracks, at least, are as phoney as a two-bob watch. The music on the 18 tracks on disc 2 is mostly pretty groovy, but I suggest you bear in mind that it might not all involve Jimi Hendrix playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it should.","review":"I have used this many times to find out how to forma chord.

The tuner is a lighted display, and the light jumps back and forth from sharp to flat when you are trying to tune a string, so you don't know which way to go.

I didn't expect much of anything from the description of the plot on the book's jacket but was pleasantly surprised. The plot was the best part about it for me and held my attention. This is the first book I've read from this author and the writing was fairly standard. I found the romantic subplot of the book to be enormously unrealistic but found myself rooting for the three couples in spite of this. I liked the way she mirrored the three fates with the three relationships though. The revenge was extremely satisfying and her character development enough to cause me to hate the villain and cheer for the \\"good guys\\". I also liked the way she portrayed the women as independent and gutsy even though the men wanted to protect them. Overall, entertaining but not for anyone who wants an extremely developed suspense plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"I wasn't expecting Three Fates to be as good as it was, but this book had everything! Romance, adventure, a little saddness(but in a good way) and my favorite, humor. I loved all the characters, but I have to say that my favorite couple was Tia and Malachi. He knew what he wanted and he did what had to be done in order to get Tia. Tia was the character who grew the most in the book. I also liked Cleo a lot who brought some spunk into the book. I could relate to Tia and to me Malachi was a real charmer. I also loved how they tricked the bad guy in the end. This book had me at the edge of my seat! This book was my favorite next to Honest Illusions and I never had as much fun reading Nora's books as I did when read Honest Illusions and Three Fates. Believe me this book is not to be missed!

Mr. Olesker attempts to tell a witty and poignant story about the melting pot that is Baltimore City, but simply winds up trying to write far beyond beyond his capabilities. The book was annoyingly overwraught with side story after side story without ever really coming to the point. I found that I was not the only person in my class who felt this way and it is unfortunate as I believe that the teacher will continue to use this as assigned reading. This book was frustrating to read and I had to force myself to the end, something I do not enjoy doing with books. If you want to truly learn about Baltimore city, come and visit us.

Also, Eve's \\"moment\\" with Dr. Mira and their little altercation during the \\"hunt\\" was played out very well. Dr. Mira is a stand-up person and knows how to handle the brashness that Eve dishes out to everyone. Mira knows how to stand up to Eve and at the same time let Eve know how much she cares for her.

I was so engrossed in the plot to find out who killed both Dr. Icoves and why that I finished the book in one day. Origin definitely had the witty banter between Peabody and Eve that we've come to expect. Throw in visits from Louise, Charles, Trina, a very pregnant Mavis, and Roarke's relatives, and you got yourself an all around good book. My only complaint is that the murders and Eve's cop work took too much away from the development of Roarke's relatives coming to visit from Ireland.

I personally thought it worked fine (if just a little weird) until I experienced my first serious crash with it. Because it lacks the belay loop in the middle--a strong loop usually in a bright color right in the middle of the crotch, in case you want to compare to other harnesses--there is no fixture in the harness to prevent your body from spinning to one side while in a serious fall. I wound up landing with my belay partner several feet above me, which does happen in rock climbing, but on my side and out of control. The rock gym people then told me that I wasn't allowed to use this type of \\"Bod\\" harness and gave me a loaner.So in toto, I think it's a harness that does the job, but does have some risk involved and probably won't be acceptable to your local rock gym.

The frequency, amplitude and phase adjustments are not in \\"real time\\", that is, when you turn the knob, the digits do NOT follow you as you turn it. There is a significant time lag which makes it particularly difficult to zero in on a particular value. More over, the device is very light and cheaply made. I don't think that you could give it away to others once they see how it functions. That said, if you don't care about what value of frequency, amplitude or phase, or are only interested in very ball park values, this may work for you.

I work in retail grocery for a living doing overnight stock so I know the value of a really sharp knife, and believe me, that blade is NOT sharp. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate the blade as only being a 4 in sharpness when right out of the box and after only a month of use cutting open plastic wrappings and tape from theovernight stock cases it has almost dulled down to a common butter knife. Plus I needed a screwdriver to open the knife to put in the utility blade. Its a good thing Ican figure out instructions by following diagrams, someone who is not used to figuring things out for themselves may have been really frustrated.

The disc plays fine on the unit but when you try to finalize it...nothing. Strange. I also found something even more troubling.After erasing a program on a Panasonic DVD-RAM disc, I recorded another program.

I guess that equates to shooting myself in both feet. They have both been nothing but trouble. They are extremely tempermental.

HOW To Write Fiction Like a Pro sums up his writing career in his characteristic spare and down-to-earth style, using many examples from his books, to help writers get going. It's certainly not comparable to BIRD BY BIRD or Stephen King's ON WRITING, but lets the beginning writers enter into the world of the fiction author at a personal level. The photo on the back jacket--Peck in black leathers, barechestedm smiling broadly--is the first time I've ever seen his face on a publicity shot or book jacket. He usually has his cowboy hat hiding his face. So this book is revealing of his techniques that make the SOUP books such a hit. I first discovered SOUP because of Bill Halloran doing workshops on reading to children. I read them to all ages, all kinds of kids and adults and they were a universally loved series. So Peck knows his craft. Read the SOUP books, then savor this tasty pot of ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Does he smell the shirt's armpit?\\"","review":"Peck captures the essence of writing in the very first chapter. In it, as he pokes and prods you to think of HOW a character is constructed, he asks you to ask questions so that you KNOW your character, make your characters human and REAL. His character-in-residence is named Stanley. Peck asks about Stanley, even going so far as to ask: Does he [Stanley] smell the shirt's armpit?That's REAL. Even now, you have an answer about what Stanley is like. You know him in just six short words.Peck continues in the same bantering and yet so-sharp way throughout his book. He gives you hints and pushes, he dares you to think and really know your story and your characters and your place of story.For everyone who is serious about writing fiction (heck, it would work in non-fiction, too!), get this book. Forget the dry and dull and textbook-feel of so many other books. Peck gets his points across without a dull moment in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for fiction writers...","review":"This book took me by storm.

The writer is trying to connect with his reader by being very, very casual. What this makes for is a lot of half-baked analogies about writing that don't really tell you \\"how\\" to do anything. The overly casual tone was frustrating and distracting for someone looking for information. Perhaps, as another reviewer has said, this might make for leisure reading.

In reality the Liberty had big white identifiers on the bow, one quarter the height of the ship, clearly distinguishing it from Egyptian ships. These numbers have been photoshopped out of Cristol's gun camera images, apparently. Here is an experiment for skeptics: google for a similar high-angle frontal photo of the Liberty on the web, blur the photo in your favorite program until it looks like Cristol's gun camera photo, and see if you can still discern the numbers. You WILL still see the identifier, if only as a big white splotch, though it is completely blacked out in Cristol's photos. Why is this significant? Because any pilot would have seen the big white American numbers too.

Non-partial sources such as Israeli military personnel and top brass will give a non-political, no bs, view of course. It's not like they're worried about promotion or anything!

Ringing drives me nuts!","review":"First, this is a very comfortable hammer (grip, balance, and easy on the elbow).

I thought I had a 5 star hammer until I helped a friend build a shed. My elbow felt great, but the continuous ringing for 2 days was enough to drive me insane! Even my friend was affected by the ringing while working several feet away.He had the 20-ounce Antivibe and it does not experience any ringing. I headed to Lowes to buy a new hammer and tested these two models in the store. I sampled several of the Antivie hammers on the shelf and the 16oz/20oz ringing/not ringing held true.If you can handle the extra weight, the 20oz Antivibe is a great hammer. It dampens the vibrations in a split-second.

That is, with the strap securely over the back of my hand, my fingers are near the lens, not the camera controls. This is not very workable.A minor issue is that this thing is pretty tricky to tie/untie, and the instructions are in the BG-E3 pamphlet -- the strap does not come with one.Another less minor issue is that the neckstrap and handstrap are connected when tied properly, so it's a hassle to remove one or the other without dealing with both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Great sturdy leather.

Fortunately that's my case in which I always carry my 10D with its BG-ED3. I tell this since a 10D, 20D, DRebel or 350D body does not have a strap eyelet on its base.

Also, you will need to have some patience in figuring out how to attach the strap especially if you want to keep your neck strap attached.

It works best when the level of the chalk is low enough that the chalk falls away from the gears.-The string is tough but leaves a fat line. When I originally got mine, the string was tangled up inside. I had not expected a problem with a new tool (always the optimist), so I immediately filled it with 4 oz of chalk.

Many people seem to think both products are the same. There not. I followed the directions to a T and had excellent results. I used two of the solvent based kits for a large two car garage. I put it on thick as possible but yet thin enough so I wouldn't run out of product. Time was a factor. The product started to thicken up towards the end, which scared me a little. Next time, I would defiantly have a helper to trim edges and to roll it on the floor. I used small bathroom sized Dixie cups to measure out the flakes, so I would get even amounts across the entire floor. That worked well. I feel that the finished product is as good as the finishes found on auto dealership service department floors. It all depends on how well you prep the floors and mix and apply the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine so far","review":"I poured a 60x60 slab about a year ago (2110). My concern was with the skid/rubber marks on the floor created by building the hangar. I spent about 19 hours with a rotary sander (20 grit) sanding the floor. Then I followed the directions. There was no oil to deal with. The box contains two gallons of finished product and it took seven boxes to do the 3600 sq ft. It was a little thin in places (my fault) so I put on another four boxes. It's been about three weeks now and it looks great. I have some hairline cracks in the concrete and it filled them better than I expected. It does not hide the cracks, but I didn't expect that. As per the instructions, I let it set up after mixing for 30 minutes. When I started rolling on the product another guy mixed another batch to be ready. It worked out about right; taking 30 - 45 minutes to roll on the two gallons with two guys on the project. So far, I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has lasted 1 year so far","review":"I put this on my garage floor last summer and it still looks great.

Surface preparation is everything when painting anything. I rented a surface grinder to flush the peaks of the concrete. I then used a presure washer to clean away the residue and any remaining contaminates. I have a typical 2 car garage and I used 2 kits. With the first kit, I used acetone to thin the product after mixing to allow it to soak into the concrete and bond better. It did cover the entire surface. But, well well enough for a finished look. There were holidays and thin spots. After the second coat, it was even and complete. Each kit contained 2 lbs of flakes. I used 6 lbs of flakes (I got some extra) to make a medium coverage. It would be very hard to broadcast 2 lbs evenly across a 2 car garage. Also, the secret to even flakes is to throw them upwards and allow them to fall.

The sound is excellent, and lyrics are included (in both English and Japanese).I don't find much at fault here, although I think the ideal Expose best-of, should it ever be compiled, would include the original version of \\"Point of No Return\\", as well as the 12\\"/extended versions of their club classics.

I don't have an HDTV so I can't comment on that aspect of it. If you are looking for a good DivX player though, this is a great option.My only complaint is that the menu only displays a very small portion of the filenames for files via the USB port or via the DVD drive. If you have lots of files with filenames longer then 8-10 characters it can be pretty hard to locate the file you want to play.

The zoom was a nice feature, though rarely used. The DVD playback was good. I was disapointed that there wasn't an S-Video output jack. There was not an \\"open-close\\" button on the remote, which isn't the most important thing, but it does come in handy. I've had video / audio sync problems with another Philips DVD player using Divx (avi) discs. The reason I like Divx playback capability is that my Digital Camera makes movie files in .avi format, and it's much easier to play on a TV when the DVD player supports the file format.

Van Dyne. Moreover, even thought it has William Powell and Mary Astor, two well-known actors in it they are not a couple in the movie.The acting is well done.

A lot of people are oblivious to The Verve Pipe, but lucky for me, i grew up in the Grand Rapids, MI area where they started out. I think this is a highly underated band. There is not a single bad song on this cd, and there is great guitar work on every song. Bullies on Vacation is my personal favorite off of the cd, but it's not a single song that makes this cd good, it is all of them together. I'd recommend this cd to anyone, it's a must have! You have to buy it to at least hear Brian Vanderark's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent indy release","review":"This album is a must for any Verve Pipe fan. I've been a big fan for years and didn't even know they had two independant label releases until recently. Pop Smear is excellent. It is certainly more pop oriented than the two major label releases, but it great to listen to. \\"Spoonful of Sugar\\", \\"Bullies on Vacation\\", \\"The River\\", \\"Pretty for You\\", and \\"What You Wanted\\" are my favorites. I've never seen a band more deserving of recognition than the Verve Pipe, although they are considered a one-hit wonder by MTV, which is an absolute farse."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes 1 hour of reading to extract 5 minutes of value!","review":"Some good information. The problem is that I had to do so much skimming to get to anything useful it was unbelieveable. Such a waste of paper. I don't know what some of those other reviewers were thinking about. Then when I finally found the useful information it takes you 10 excrutiatingly long chapters later to figure out what to do with the information. In my opinion your better off getting your copywriting information from another author. I've made the mistake of buying other books from him and he uses the same wasteful and frankly very egotistical style. He thinks he's the only one who knows how to market or one of the few.

I am pretty tolerant of bad writing, but my copy is still mostly unread. There are many other marketing classics that are readable and contain even better information. I bought this book at a used bookstore, because I have another book from Lant, and was disappointed at that. If you enjoy academic, painfully long sentences then you might be able to get through this book. I have talked to people that do confirm that the author is arrogant, as you can tell by the tone of his writing. If you can get past all of this, then there is some good information in this book. The biggest problem is the tremendous waste of paper and of your time, because of the lack of clarity and conciseness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This book is a waste of your time.

Problem is... it can't find a stud to save its life!The guy at Home Depot said they had a few returned, and suggested tapping the wall to find one stud, and then measuring (I think it was 18 or 24 inches) to find the other regularly placed studs, once you found two a certain distance apart.Save your $ and tap the wall, or if you need something to do, grab a branch from a tree and make a \\"witching stick\\"..it'll work better, and cost as much as this should have cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZON.COM sucks","review":"They duplicated my order and then won't refund the full amount of the item that was returned.

The squeegee, on the other hand, was a total failure. First of all, the cotton swab, or \\"rabbit's foot,\\" at the end of the cord was just way too thick to go into my barrel. I thought that pruning the foot to make it smaller would do the trick. This was not an easy thing to do since the cotton is very sturdy. After a while of pruning the foot I decided it was time to try it out. I ran one end of the squeegee through the barrel, didn't even pull that hard when the cotton foot came flying off along with the rubber disks and spacers on the cord.

The plastic case is tough and fairly slip resistant, the blade lock works well, the blade is easy to read, and though it lists a \\"standout measurement\\" of seven feet, I have had mine out to eight feet many times. All in all, its a good tape measure that is a much better deal if you can find it on sale locally.

However purchasing this training aid was not a total mistake, we also have a couple of cats who are responding to the ultrasonic training aid.

Recently brought in a stray kitty and typical behavior issues surfaced with our other (two) indoor cats. The trick is catching them in the act, of course. When we're fortunate enough to catch them a quick push of the unit's button causes an immediate reaction from the misbehaving cat(s). I'm a bit surprised at just how quickly they respond (an obvious wince) to such a short burst of ultrasound. They stop, retreat, and usually begin displacement grooming; \\"digesting\\" what just occurred. The instructions do give a clear warning to not touch or disturb the silver emitter plate (disk) at the front of the unit.

If you are buying this to enjoy and savor the process of reading and to consider the ideas the work contains, then this edition falls far short.

It is clear that Leuchtenberg concentrates on the role of the individual to a much greater extent than historians such as Flynn and Johnson, and as such, his argument is flawed when compared with other such historians. This book belongs in a different era, and I believe that it does not contain the reliability of source that other more modern interpretations do. I would recommend this book only as evidence of a source which needs to be disproved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still one of the best introductions to the New Deal","review":"I first read this book in 1980, when it was probably the best available introduction to the New Deal era. Leuchtenburg is such a stylish writer that the book remains well worth reading. However, some of his arguments, particularly on the economic side, need a little updating. In addition, there are more thorough works these days on Roosevelt's battles with the Supreme Court and the complexities of the court's judgements. Leuchtenburg's real achievement, though, is to bring across the sense of hope and creativity and energy that Roosevelt infused into so many Americans. It is the spirit of the times, as much as any supposed lessons about government activism and demand management, that makes the New Deal era so special. Leuchtenburg captures that spirit extremely well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Interpretation of the New Deal","review":"This book captures the politics of the Depression and the political genius of FDR. In recent years,it has become fashionable to trash big government for all of its failings. One can point to a conclusion that the New Deal did not, as was intended, lift the country out of economic depression. This book points, and correctly so, to the fact that the New Deal,while not a complete economic success, did indeed lift society from its depression in the first years. Later (1936 Election), the New Deal provided Americans with an alternative to more radical alternatives, thus preserving the nation. This is a very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"this will definitely turn your blood cold","review":"malevolent creation doesn't sugar coat their music. they put more bite in their music than mike tyson does on his opponent's ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"the mike tyson of the death metal world","review":"if you feel a stabbing pain in your earlobes when you listen to this cd, don't be surprised. this band bites your ears just like mike tyson"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Number","review":"I heard \\"Heart of Mine\\" in the closing credits for the movie Runaway Jury. After listening to the album, I found that was really the only tune I liked. Peter Malick is a veteran of the hard-charging James Montomery Band (who I have seen tear up stages of Northeast blues clubs), which is why the sleepiness of most of these pieces mystifies me. You could argue that he is going for a \\"relaxed\\" feel, to which I would repsond he succeeds all too well. Norah Jones can sing, and sing well- no argument there, but these songs are not great. The lyrics I found to be a little too clever, like some music student's term paper. For most of the album I felt like everyone was trying way too hard to do something deep and meaningful. Having said all this, \\"Heart of Mine\\" is an excellent record, and might even be worth the price of the CD. Of course, to get the one good track, you could try downloading it for a dollar from itunes or your favorite MP3 site."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is very good","review":"I liked this album very much and especially \\"Heart of mine\\".

This is Norah Jones with a little grit. She sings The Blues (All Your Love) like Bonnie Raitt meets Sarah Vaughan. Moreover, the title track (New York City) is spectacular & could have fit nicely on 'Come Away With Me'.My only regret is that there isn't more... I hope to see more of this side of Ms. Jones on future releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing work!","review":"Her voice is smooth and singing is flawless on this album. I especially like songs 4 - All Your Love and 5 - Heart of Mine. They have kind of a bluesy type sound to them as well.

The only thing about this recording that's redeemable, is Norah's voice. If you want to hear that, I'd wait for her next release, or catch her on her DVD, or live or something. Otherwise if you like giving your money away for almost nothing in return, try a good charity. This record was way over hyped.. Poor production, & sounds thrown together.

She, as always, gets 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad.............","review":"O.K.....lets say for argument sake that Norah agreed to this release, and that she agreed to let them market it the way they have(i.e. dark cd cover with dark lettering EXCEPT her name popping out), and that this is not a blatent ploy to make some money off of her success...........lets just PRETEND for a minute that none of these things are true.

Lacks the writing genius that was behind Narah's debut record.

Fans of Norah Jones' Come Away With Me probably wouldn't like this CD. I suppose a die-hard blues fan would like it, but I don't like the blues, therefore, this CD was a HUGE letdown for me. I liked New York City, but the entire album was enough of a disappointment for me to return to my library and forget about buying for myself.

Really, it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell Out","review":"I was disappointed. Norah's first album was original, and pure. It seamed to avoid even the appearance of commercial music. This \\"New York City\\" sounds like radio music. I feel cheated by hearing her dark and lusty voice behind such a blended band. It is like pop music, that it never seams to go anywhere, or at least looses my attention before hand.\\"Come Away With Me\\" was made purely for the love of music. This seams to be about something much less rewarding. Something we see too much of these days. I am disappointed. If you liked \\"Come Away With Me\\", you'll hate \\"New York City\\". Please Norah, please make some more good music. We don't need anymore pop divas. We need Norah Jones."},{"rating":"1","title":"bE","review":"Bad album. Don't listen what other people is saing to you!

The success of Norah Jones forced the music to be brought out. Well, I'm glad it has now seen the light of day! Norah's singing is even more spontaneous and open on these blues flavored tunes than on her own CDs. And while I admit I would not have purchased the album if not for Norah's involvement, I also enjoyed Mr. Malick's guitar playing. He can be subtle when the song calls for it (\\"Strange Transmissions\\") and then cut loose on something like the Stones-ish \\"Things You Don't Have To Do.\\"I thought Ms. Jones sounded a little like Janis Joplin before, but with this material the resemblance is even more noticeable. She has a true knack for the blues, and it's great to hear this slightly different side of her talents. If you're a fan of Norah's music, get this CD.

The product smelled \\"expired\\" when I received it, so I don't know if that's the normal smell of the stuff or if mine just sat in a hot mailbox for too long before arriving at my door.

The Frederic Fekkai product was as I was expecting from the sample I had, and I like the product just fine but am a little confused about its scent--not quite perfume-y but just shy of an \\"old oil\\" smell.

Normally I am very frugal and was hesitant to spend much money on hair care items, but after the first application (pea sized) I was stunned at the amazing change in the texture and feel and appearance of my hair. My hair is slightly wavy and continually at risk for the frizzies. This product left my hair soft, but not limp or greasy. It was so shiny and the scent was nice. This is the first product that has tamed my hair! I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like motor oil with fragrance","review":"I bought this on the strength of other reviews without reading the ingredient list. This is virtually all silicone, which is both greasy and heavy like motor oil, so of course it smooths the hair and makes it shiny. It also makes it so greasy that you can feel the grease on your forehead and ears and cannot put sunglasses up on top of your head. I have curly hair and this is just awful for it. Also be aware that silicone, if used daily without anything actually moisturizing between, will dry your hair out terribly and leave it in worse shape. So then you won't be able to wear your hair without a product like this. By the way, there are much cheaper silicone-based glossing products sold at Walmart that do exactly the same thing for less than a tenth of the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product!!","review":"My hair is relaxed and color treated.

A father caught in the World Trade Center on 9/11/01, and his son ends us supervising (in prison) some of the terrorists who were involved in the attack. The only problem is with the descriptive language employed by the author. He comes across with messianic fervor, as if the fate of civilization rests upon the message he is trying to convey.

But, as all the others, it is a slow read, full of mouth twisting words that can't be found in the common, everyday dictionary.....not the names of places or individuals....but words used to describe emotions, objects, etc.....and the series would be served better if the author would use more commonplace words to let the \\"unsophisticated\\" reader better understand the flow of the tale being told. ie: 'argute throb'....now why in the hell do you use 'argute' ??? Why not use sharp or shrill ???? When ya don't recognise a word, ya gotta get the ole dictionary out an look it up. And then, it ain't in the dictionary.....so ya gotta go to the thesaurus and see if it's in there....if not, then \\"Google\\" it ???

It's kept me very interested though, I'm ready for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely slow, and mostly reference material","review":"The many problems with this book have been described by other reviewers so I won't repeat the details here.This book is ponderous and slow. I'm only halfway done with the book, it's my second attempt to read it, and I'm about to give up again. Nothing happens in this book. It's mostly one character telling another character about things that happened centuries and millenia ago. This is more like a reference book masking itself as a story. The events of the story account for maybe 5% of the total content, the rest is all backstory.I'll admit the book started well, but once Linden arrived in the Land, it ground to a halt. It took the author over a hundred pages to cover the time span of a day and a half. Reading this is work, it's not fun. Having just learned that there are 4 books to this series, think I'm going to bail out. It's just not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite boring really . . . .","review":"I've read the Chronicles I and II again recently; my third time. The first time I read them I was in high school, some 20 years ago. I admit I've only read about the first third of this book, but I really can't go on torturing myself. You know, even in the first two Chronicles it used to bug me how often you would see \\"outcast, unclean.\\" In this book the phrase is \\"Lord Foul has Jeremiah.\\" It's just lame. Way too slow and the more interesting portions of each action sequence leave me yawning. I thought Linden Avery was kind of turd in the Second Chronicles anyway. Now, as the main character, Donaldson's just polishing that turd, but she's still a turd. I think the leprosy angle was interesting for the first two Chronicles, but Avery's weaknesses just bore me. Sorry fans .."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH MY Lord, what a story","review":"I just finished the story this morning. I wish I had the luxury to read this one straight throug. I had just re-read the 1st book of the series and was about half way through the second when I saw \\"Runes\\" come out. This story is very well thought out with characters both unfamiliar and, yet, embodying the archetypes from the previous novels - Harauchi, Ramen, and StoneDowners make appearences as do creatures you may not expect to have seen again.Mr. Donaldson has always amazed me with his mastery of the English language and his use of unusual (perhaps archaic in some cases) but always appropriate word choices throughout his story. There's no shortage of rare words used to describe people, creatures, scenes and emotions so have a dictionary handy if your vocabulary is not as robust as SRD's.Excellent book - glad I bought it in hardcover because it will be a keeper and I look forward to reading it again to pick up on all those little details that seem to escape the first read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarnished Gold","review":"Although I'm an avid fan of the earlier novels, I can't recommend this book. I felt like I was reading a synopsis rather than a story. Sadly, there are no new characters (with the exception of a blind madman who quickly becomes as annoying as Donaldson's use of the word 'apotheosis'), and the Land and its populace haven't changed even after thousands of years. (I know this is a fantasy book, but come on. You would think they would have at least invented gunpowder by now. No wonder Foul is always laughing) Not me - I'm crying, & praying the next book lives up to the hype - as well as expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, it's the Land!","review":"I've been waiting SO long for this. Every time I finish reading the Second Chronicles I feel like part of my life is missing. I crave this stuff. If you are like me then you will overlook the HORRIBLE re-use of \\"therefore, nevertheless, however.....\\" and just be happy to read the words \\"Kevin's Watch, Revelstone and Andelain\\" again. If you can't get over the fact that often Donaldson's writing is overly self-indulgent and trite then skip it. But if you are a true believer in the Land or if you have ever held up your white gold wedding ring and yelled out, \\"Melenkurion abatha\\"...just in case... then you wont want to miss this. No matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start - Warts And All","review":"An enjoyable read and a fitting continuation to the series.Unfortunately, Mr. Donaldson has picked up an annoying habit of starting a new paragraph while a character is still speaking. While this can be an effective device for denoting emphasis or a change of topic, overuse can be a bit distracting to the reader...YMMV of course. Happily, this doesn't apply to the second half of the book nearly as much as the first. There are also some problems with pacing.Minor quibbles aside, this book well matches the tone and quality of the previous books and I very much look forward to reading the next three installments."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE RUNES OF THE EARTH","review":"I enjoyed returning to this story.

So I bought this book thinking they would be as good. Sadly this one isn't. It's way too long and complicated. Too slow a read to be engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time After Time","review":"The first Chronicles of Thomas Covenant were unique and breathtaking. The second Chronicles were not nearly as satisfying but at least Donaldson's ability to create fantasical creatures and situations made the books worth reading. Unfortunately, this seventh novel appears to simply recycle old ideas and characters that have been fully explored -- often using plot devices that defy even an indulgent reader from suspending disbelief. Indeed, with the exception of Donaldson's unusual style of writing prose, this novel seems to be what an avid fan of limited imagination would write if allowed to author a book in Donaldon's place. In short, Donaldson has returned to the land one time too many times given his ability to realize new characters and plot devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed at best","review":"I read the first two trilogies a few years ago, and I thought I remembered liking them pretty well, so I picked this book up. BIG mistake. The moral quandry that Linden finds herself in feels so forced and manufactured. I could get behind her if she could just make up her mind, for good or ill, but the flip flopping is distracting and exhausting to read. The charaacters are shallow and undeveloped. I never really feel anything about any of them. Generally, people who read scifi and fantasy novels aren't (in my experience) really big fans of moral relativism and this book is full of it. Go for it if you like that sort of thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-written, Under-thought","review":"I liked the first 2 trilogies very much. Sure, the whining of TC got irritating at times, but the story was great, and the land was wonderful.Well, the whining is back, but the story is missing. Very little happens until the very last quarter of the book, and the cliff-hanger at the end feels like nothing more than a sales gimmick for the next volume.Especially irksome to me was the completely illogical and pointless time-travel thing.I will not give up on the series yet, but it seems to be heading the same direction as Jordan's series, and that is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Runes of the Earth (The Last Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, Book 1)","review":"I only recommend this book if you want a follow-up to the first two trilogies other wise it takes forever to get up to speed with all of the important caricatures in the story.I waited until this set of books was complete before purchasing this book, cause the author takes forever to finish his books. Last time I picked up one of his books (10+ years ago) I do not remember him using so many unusual words (read the kendal version it has a built in Thesaurus) that part seemed silly. In my opinion the author spends to much time with descriptions of what is going on in his caricatures heads.My mistake he has not finished the last book of this set. be out sometime this year 2013."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I've been a fan of Donaldson and I enjoyed the previous Thomas Covenant books.

The reason the Land exists is Thomas Covenant,not supporting characters. The reason the fans have elevated this series above all others is the love and respect of its main character, to attempt to extend the story without ite heart rings hollow indeed. Congratulations on a wonderful story that would have been more honestly titled Further Adventures in The Land it may have made less money but it would have offended less fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Donaldson Die-Hards Only","review":"Unlike many readers (as gauged by the reviews posted here on Amazon), I have not read the prior Thomas Covenant series of books . Instead, as I had done with Robin Hobb's excellent \\"Fool's Errand\\", I had hoped to read the first book from the new series and then, while awaiting book 2, read the first (2) series.Unfortunately, for me, that will not occur. Nor will a sojourn into book two (through a purported four) of this series.I found the primary protagonist (Lianden) unempathetic (perhaps even pathetic) and, worse, the author's general writing ponderous and... lacking.I, admittedly, can't attest to how this book stacks up to its predecessors. I can only state that compared to its contemporaries that I have read (Steven Erikson, Robin Hobb, George RR Martin, Robert Jordan, to name a few), I found that it didn't stack up well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with it.","review":"Boring boring boring.

I was reading Tolkien before most of you people knew what the J.R.R stood for. I have tried to read this guy many times since he came on the scene and, quite frankly, he stinks. His books are by turns depressing, poorly written, and not very well thought out. I fail to see what all the fuss is about. If I want to read poorly written, drawn-out fantasy, I'll read Robert Jordan. At least with Jordan, you know that he will never end his series because then there goes the cash cow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very tedious and disappointing","review":"This story is even more plodding and repetitious than the previous Donaldson books. However with this story there is no compelling reason to overlook Donaldson's need to increase word counts. A story is lacking, the characters are dull reincarnations of other characters. The only real interest in this book is the character Anele.The story and the journey twist in meaningless tangles. Occasionally there is a glimpse of the work of a master story teller, but those glimpses are too few.The book feels very much like it was propelled by accountants checking off pages, events and features, rather than an artist striving to create.For engaging entertainment it would be far better to re-read the original Chronicles and leave this sad work alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have been trying to read this book for 8 months now. I finally finished it and I can say it is pretty awful. I have always enjoyed reading Donaldson's books before even if they were flawed but this was totally boring and really strange. Believe me, I tried, I can't figure out what the raves are all about. Linden is one of the few characters with personality and she is really irritating.

Donaldson uses words that stay at the mouth, that need not only a dictionary, but in-depth thinking to understand. Sometimes the plot is dragged on, but it is always interesting to read. Like an ocean, the story comes in waves, big at first, then small and consecutive later on. It is truly a very enjoyable story and will leave readers thirsting for the next installment. Fantasy, humor, drama, and a little romance, it contains the main parts a story needs to bring the reader into a whole new world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling return to the Land and \\"edge of your seat\\" start","review":"Stephen R Donaldson has gone back to world of Thomas Covenant and he has dones so with the same passion of his previous work and a tighter and more refined writing style.

And I'm not talking about one of those \\"hmmm, that's interesting, well the next book should be a jolly good read\\" I mean it ends with a \\"What the !@#%\\",\\"Where is Donaldson?

I am a MAJOR Donaldson freak and this is a mind blowing book! Aside from one or two slow, kinda, glitchy parts in the beginning and a certian word being used too much Runes gathers speed and finally takes off like a rocket! The final two chapters have to be THE most beautifully written ones I've ever encoutered in any form literature. After 20 some years it's amazing that SRD can recapture his \\"Chronicles\\" bearings so quickly. It's so wonderful to be back in the Land and Donaldson's right: he's got his work cut out for him in the next three books! Wow! I can't wait!

I've tried other score keepers and this watch by far has been the best solution. It is set up for golf, but if you back off the score back to zero, it works for racquetball as well. The score per hole only goes up to 15, but this is still the best alternative out there right now for keeping score in racquetball. It would be great if one day someone comes up with a wrist wearing racquetball scorekeeper with the ability to keep up to 3 scores, but for now, this will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for the golf player","review":"I too have always been loyal to Casio G-Shock, and this watch compares easily with them.

It stands approximately one half inch deep. When I bend my wrist it digs into my forearm. The \\"Flix\\" system is a joke. I have to give my wrist whiplash to get it to light up. Then its hard to see because it has to be pitch black to see Indiglo face. I do like the Velcro band because it is big enough to fit my wrist. Unless you like big bulky watches look elsewhere. Sorry Timex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch!","review":"Nice watch with all the necessary features. It's comfortable, and I like the band on it (not the cheap plastic type). My only complaint with it is the alarm is way too quiet.

My son asked me to read the chapter for parents. With a plethora of Do's & Don'ts tips, it made a lot of sense & helped me tremendously to not nag my son.

I think the B&D also has a better filter. I have had the B&D 2 years and the Delonghi 1 year. The B&D is still going strong while the motor has failed on the Delonghi and the battery no longer holds a charge. I noticed fine dust that sucked through the filter on the Delonghi coating the impeller blade. I assume that is what caused a binding in the bushing of the cheap impeller motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Thrilled","review":"When purchasing this title I didn't know it was only a 3track + 1 video cd.

It can be used to remind you of certain topics if you are already a developer, but LN Help can do the same thing and it is free. There are numerous errors and the index is the worst that I have ever seen in a technical book. The examples are repetitive and useless after the 5th chapter. One of the most annoying things with this book is that for every example it contains, it tells you that in order to run the example, you must have installed the DB that comes with the disk. ONE BIG note at the beginning of the book would have accomplished the same thing with a lot less paper and ink. I guess the book needed to be filled with fluff to make it look bigger and therefore more desirable to consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watse of money","review":"Do not buy this book. It does not teach you anything. It is like a reference manual that is not different than yellow books. If you are not familiar with class etc. buy the book called Practical Lotus Scripot by Patton.

I did fine just refering to the On-line help to start, but now I find I am doing too many things, and a reference I can look at anywhere is more valuable than expected.

I keep it handy, even carrying it home and back to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book when little programming and OOP experience","review":"Having to learn lotusscript myself with little experience in programming and OOP, this book very clearly presents notes classes and its properties/methods in a systematic way.

Only minus, I would have liked more complicated examples included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not contain much more than the online help","review":"This book merely restates what is in the online help. Plus, the index is useless. You have to understand LotusScript classes before you can even look anything up.

Overall, although the book does have some value in inspiring introspection, reading The Daily Drucker (and anything else of Drucker's) in combination with the Bible will give you a much better picture of leadership and of how Jesus led, and will likely be more inspirational to effective action than will this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible, but not worth it either","review":"I teach leadership skills, from a Christian perspective, and I thought this book would be great. I was wrong. Much of the book is good and pithy. However, the book is extremely basic. She couldn't get too in depth with 3 page chapters. Some of her theology is less than sound.

Extremely basic, like i.e. \\"He formed a team\\" The chapters consist of an average of three (3) pages. I rated this book 1 star,I was surprised there wasn't any pictures? However, the Bible is an excellent source with management dealings, stick with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Undoubtedly well intentioned, but biased.","review":"The book starts well and has some real gems and insights. She interprets the bible from her own Christian point of view and for her own purposes. No problem, we all do this.

Scripture was used out of context in far too many places. Never was an emphasis made on encouraging a personal relationship with Christ. There is no way that a person can SUCCESSFULLY use the concepts that Christ taught without KNOWING Him personally. There was lots of talk about being spiritual, but NONE about knowing the Holy Spirit. I would highly recommend, instead, James Hunter's \\"The Servant\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus/CEO goes one step beyond Covey","review":"One of the more interesting theories by author Jones is that a way to deal with bad people and experiences is to look at these events as possible warning areas that keep us on track to our true destiny. Dwelling on bitter past events and encounters with evil doers will only deter your calling to higher experiences. In fact, these people and events may have been placed in our lives for a reason, just as they were during the life of Jesus.I picked up this book on a fluke, and had no idea that it correlated so well with the excellent teachings of Stephen Covey.

But once I read this book I was sorry I had waited so long. This is the only book I've ever bought multiple copies of to pass along, one even to a total stranger. It's a quick and easy read, a collection of short, insightful essays. How sad that so many people want to pick this book apart -- they miss the point. It's not a theological treatise. Leave your dogma and doctrine at the door long enough to appreciate this little treasure for what it is: another fresh and valid perspective of Jesus, with all the love and honesty His name symbolizes. When the people around you have frustrated you to your breaking point, open up this book and take a look at what Jesus might do. Too bad more so-called leaders don't try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For budding leaders","review":"This book is great. I am going to read it a second time to highlight all the great parts.

Her death was an enigma. Her writings were truly unbelievable and know that's where Ron got his talent for writing. I read this book several months ago and it took this time for me to write. It is tragically moving, poetic with an uncanny melodic verbage. The quest to find this father again took Ron to many places, winding up in of all places, California. The perseverance to not quit gave this reader a gut-wrenching mystery that kept me riveted to my seat. Once you start you cannot put it down. I will read this book again.

This book should be required reading by the Military and their families, and those that are quick to find fault with the men and women in uniform.

I simply got astonished because all the other musics from this cd are quite so good as \\"I like Chopin\\". And I finally could get a original version of this classic song, both single edit and the LP version. I only had the remix version from the 90's.

When I moved to the U.S., I bought a Sumeet and used it for 10 years but the jars started falling apart. But that machine can grind. So I recently replaced it with a brand new Sumeet. This one seems to be so poorly made. The finish on the product is pretty poor. But, I am really focused on function here, so decided to use it. The unit just cannot handle the grinding. When I used the new Asia Grinder, it just kept tripping. And, I was trying to grind only half a jar full. So it was definitely not overloaded. I had to keep resetting the load protector. It is not easy to try and get to the reset button. So I just took the new jar with the contents and used it with my old Sumeet. Coincidentally it fits well on the old Sumeet grinder and it worked great - It ground very fine.This new machine is terrible and I wouldn't spend the money on it. My sister bought the same machine and she has the same issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't WASTE your money on this one!","review":"Unfortunately we purchased this item before doing our research and looking for online customer product reviews. Hence, my taking the time to write a review for you.... We got this primarily for the alarm clock feature and now have decided to not use it at all and resort to using our cell phone alarm clock! The sound quality is good - but you CANNOT set a volume to your alarm clock other than the preset volume at level \\"15\\". So whether you are using songs, buzz, or radio, your alarm clock will sound off at an alarmingly LOUD volume and wake up your entire house! RIDICULOUS - That there is no volume feature on this! We even called the manufacturer's customer service and they confirmed you cannot control the volume of the alarm feature -- so why put this feature on there at all? There are many other quality products in the market for the same price. I do not reccomend purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the most overlooked book of this or any century","review":"This book turned my life around.

On the way down, I read this and Sales Alive saved me from my own circumstance. It gave me the industrial know how beneficial in my area of expertise and it guided me through the darkest shadows of my life. I am now happily married with 3 kids, making 500,000 per year.

In reading his novels and stories, one needs to simply go with it: there's a kind of quote/unquote dao that's a prerequisite, and you'll need it with GM more than the others. But once you're in the groove of his prose and story you'll be ... well, enchanted is not quite the word for it. Enhanced is probably a better one. While I'd recommend this book highly, I'd also recommend picking up The Franchiser or The Magic Kingdom first. Elkin was one of our very, very best, so you can't really go wrong with any of his titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, spicy and very yummy!","review":"This tastes great on chicken and shrimp and is very easy to use - just like Shake 'n' Bake but so much tastier!

I could be talked into giving this one 3 stars, but that's about it. It just doesn't move me. Jimi tributes are always an uphill battle in my opinion. Artists often avoid trying to play a song similar to the way Jimi played it and it's easy to see why - just who are you going to get that can touch the feel he put into the guitar playing and singing?Don't get me wrong - I'm a bigtime fan of Band of Gypsys and have no axe to grind with Buddy at all. I'm so happy he was there to help Jimi out in '69 and '70 when he was so in need of TLC. But this disc just does not, to me, evoke the soul of Jimi as much as I'd expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect Feeder","review":"This feeder is perfect for smaller birds which is what I intended it for since I have a platform feeder for my Cardinals. It has attracted a yellow finch and some other small birds like titmice and some birds I have yet to identify. You do have to fill it all the way up for both perches to get used and that takes a lot of feed. You can only use sunflower seeds because the smaller seed will fall out of the mesh. I haven't had any squirrels get in it but I have a baffle under it. If you want to attract Cardinals or larger birds this is not the feeder for you. The cardinals are to big for the distance between the perch and the food. They try but ultimately fall off and use the platform feeder. All in all this is a sturdy feeder and looks like it will last several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"No No Hour-Glass Feeder works well with large seeds","review":"Bought this feeder to replace a tube feeder for mixed seeds (tube feeder was damaged beyond repair by squirrels)and found that it is not suitable for small seeds, such as millet, which quickly fall through the wire mesh. However, it works well with black sunflower seeds. Also, it cannot be damaged by squirrels although one always manages to get seeds from it. Like many feeders designed to hold seeds, the No No does not have a seed catcher on the bottom and its top cover does not have a large enough overhang to prevent the seeds from becoming wet from drizzle and fog condensate that drips from overhead tree branches.I devised and installed a seed catcher that works well. Taking the No No indoors every evening is the solution to wet seeds although inconvenient. I like the feeder and recommend it with reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"birds are using it. well made","review":"very well made feeder, not pest proof, but large capacity and all-metal construction make this a long lasting feeder.

When they are hanging out the birds are not. Otherwise the cardinals and finches do feed. I have not seen other large birds, which is okay. Does hold a lot of sunflower seed.The only reason I am giving it a 4 star instead of 5, is because the squirrels consider it their dinner plate, thou I enjoy watching their antics too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard for the birds to eat","review":"I purchased the \\"No/No Hourglass Bird Feeder\\" and I was unhappy with the results. The birds had difficulty getting the sunflower seeds through the mesh. After a couple days of watching the birds struggle to extract the seeds, I returned the product. On a plus side, the build quality seemed to be of a high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! Not for bird seed!","review":"I ordered this in a hurry and didn't read all the fine print. I figured a bird feeder holds birdseed, noticed the high ratings and ordered. When I got it, I realized that it does not hold bird seed, but only sunflower seeds. So, if you are looking for a sunflower seed holder, this is great, maybe, but don't get regular wild bird mix or song bird mix and expect it to work with this. I never return ANYTHING, but I'm returning this.

But, ultimately it was Elvis' life to ru8in and ruin it he did.I am in awe of that voice and the innate ability he had to use it in the best possible manner.If only it could have stayed the way it was.A brilliant first album for anyone without Elvis material or for sonmeone who thinks those first few years were the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"He was the king, he is the king and he'll ALWAYS be the king","review":"He discovered the style of havin' fun with music, i like the 90s rockers but none of them can ever be compaired to Elvis.

I don't know why this was titled Year One because lacks everything that some of the great Year One stories had. Batman is faced with a crazy plot about death no longer existing and he solves it without batting an eye, no pun intended. Now, is that because Batman is the best or because of sloppy unimaginative writing? I'm guessing the latter. The only thing that keeps this book above 1 star was the phenomenal art by Paul Gulacy. He's able to draw Batman completely classic and modern at the same time. Excellent work on his part. Sadly he had to deal with this script.

If you are a Star Trek fan this is a collectors dream.
