The book is very well organized with many great ideas on how to solve problems before, during and after GWB installation. Colored pictures, tables, diagrams, think ahead and work smart tips carefully compiled to maximize the GWB education experience.

I found myself following hordes of backpackers from the train station to every guesthouse listed in The Bible. I began to notice travelers unwittingly conversing in \\"lonelyplanetspeak\\"--qouting directly from lp guide. Moon Publication's guidebook provided me with out of the way places to stay and eat as well as a different point of view--off the beaten track, but not in a ditch.

Rather than the twisted ambient tracks and disassociating metallic loops found on basictonalvocabulary and Balance, which, don't get me wrong, are Mr. Child's great strong suit, he attacks here with a deeper style. Hidden beneath his powerful shuffling drum loops are spooky vocal abstractions (some breathing sounds!), deceptive tribal rhythms, and screeching electronic noise (a product of his industrial Birmingham residence), bringing to mind a deranged primal ceremony somewhere deep in the jungles yet-unexplored. The fierce qualities end up losing the battle, however, as he winds up the album with a beautiful Detroit-styled jam with washing chords and light percussion. Check this disc out for a great piece that is a very listenable 50 minutes long and a very cohesive album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relentless and powerful!","review":"I agree with Matt Mercer when he said that it isn't anything really new or exciting but the pure power and technical strength of the Surgeon's form on this release is breathtaking.

I'm not a die-hard Sarah fan but after seeing this concert, I've come to appreciate more of Sarah as a singer and her incredible talent to sing so beautifully and with such little effort. I like all the songs on the DVD, especially \\"There for Me\\", \\"A Question of Honour\\", and \\"Moon River\\". All of the songs were very well sang by Sarah, although in a few part of the DVD, the music seemed to have overtaken Sarah's voice. But overall, it is a great DVD to own. Not to mention there is overall 80 minutes of bonus footage, including interviews and also a music video of \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE REST OF THE CONCERT ?","review":"Although Ms.Brightman's voice is superb in \\"LA LUNA\\" live, the actual production of the VHS fails in comparison to \\"ONE NIGHT IN EDEN.\\" I hope that the VHS is re-issued with more concert tracks. The end of the VHS concert is choppy with bad editing on Moon River and Con Te Partiro. Figlio Perduto and Question of Honour were both excellent, yet had that choppy effect. You can tell you're missing something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Brightman-La Luna (Live in Concert)","review":"I like Sarah's voice. It is very sweet and reassuring.

I saw the show in Salt Lake and it took my breath away. This video captures the highlights of the show, unfortunately, some of the songs from the actual show were left off.

In all there 26 songs giving up an hour-and-a-half of her singing. The visuals are okay, but I've seen better (her Las Vegas disc, for example). I thought the production was excellent, although there is a lot blue in here. That's the dominant color. However, I bought this for her voice, not worrying about the visuals.This concert offered a few songs I hadn't heard her do before, and ones I really liked such as \\"He Doesn't See Me\\" and her version of the Simon & Garfunkel tune, \\"Scarborough Fair.\\" It was good to see another great singer, Josh Groban, join her for a number, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Overall, a very good dvd with excellent visual effects.

I think the \\"Eden\\" video wins hands down. Sarah's costumes and stage settings in \\"La Luna\\" are wonderful, magical, dreamlike, too bad it doesn't have the flow and well-put together qualities of \\"Eden\\". I'm going to send this video back and ask for another one, hopefully the sound quality will be better on another video?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality still causes production to suffer","review":"Seeing the concert live left me with much anticipation for the DVD; especially after reading poor reviews of the VHS release of the concert. Although the DVD is stunning visually, the sound quality brings much frustration to the viewing experience. Figlio Perduto and Pie Jesu were literally ruined due to the sound fading out almost as if a microphone wasn't plugged in all the way or the attenuation was on. Think of listeneing to a radio station that won't sty tuned in and that is the effect. There are also several points where the soundtrack seems to go from Dolby Digital to mono...at the worst times resulting in the drama of the piece being sacrificed. For such a strong artist, this production is an incredibly weak representation of Sarah Brightman's talent and Frank Peterson's skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Luna","review":"This video is a great disappointment. The sound is very poor. The orchestra often drowns out most of the singing. The duet, I think it is \\"Will you be there for me?\\" was ruined by poor sound. The editing was awful, with sharp cuts from one song to another. One Night In Eden was incredibly good, and I have watched it over and over again. I will probably never watch La Luna again. I wish it could be re-released with the sound and editing fixed. I would not recommend wasting money on La Luna."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Sarah...","review":"Got this DVD 2 days ago... and do enjoy every minute of it... thoug in some of her songs.. the music and the back-up singers are enmpowering her... yet.. this DVD is worth to keep...Her voice is still as clear as ever.. her costumes reveals her new body..

It is quite possible that somehow I have a defective DVD, but I doubt it. The sound fades in and out. The problem is not my DVD changer either.... all other DVDs I own (160+) sound wounderfull. I first saw this concert on PBS a few months back and completly got hooked on Sarah Brightman. She has a beautiful voice. This concert is very impressive.... the music, the costums. The DVD has very nice features such as multiple languages, 3 different sound modes (5.1, DTS, PCM Stereo), plus you can select to view the lyrics for every song as she is singing. The DVD picture quality is great, but I didn't buy this DVD for the visuals. If it wasn't for the poor sound quality, I would give this DVD 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your money","review":"Brightman lipsyncs the entire \\"performance\\". Any fool can tell.

Her graceful movements - even while suspended in the air - while singing in perfect pitch is simply amazing.

In any case, buy it. You'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and touching","review":"I was dissappointed with Sarah's last eden video concert because it looked like she just was lip singing. But this La Luna DVD was so wonderful to watch. Sarah doesn't just sing. She also acts, performs, dances and if you can believe it even flies around the stage. She does lip sing some of the La Luna concert songs but she also does some versions live. Watching the concert on my birthday was touching and every song Sarah sung was excellent. The props were spectacular. This isn't just some music concert, this is something you would see in Las Vegas. Also Sarah's outfits are very very interesting. She seems to have lost alot of weight since I last saw her on the Andrew Loydd Webber video where she sings with Michael Ball. This La Luna DVD is one of the most entertaining DVD I own now! Fireworks included! I highly recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Walsh is so right !!!","review":"Sarah Brightman is a true diva and she will always be. Her technique and amazing grace are refreshing. But the sound quality of the video \\"La luna\\" is poor. Eventhough you can hear that the problem is not her voice but the editing, you can be dissapointed with the video. The sound is inconsistent sometimes and you can easily realize that the editing was done in a hurry. I went to this concert in Rochester and it was outstanding. Her former videos \\"Eden\\" and \\"In concert\\" are wonderful. The sound quality is great and you really feel you are in the audience.But anyway, Sarah is excellent and the mistakes the editors made do not affect her beautiful image and performance in any way. Thanks Sarah. You are an angel. THE DVD FOR THIS SHOW IS EXCELLENT, SO I DECIDED TO EDIT MY REVIEW. THE VHS IS NOT SO GOOD BUT THE DVD QUALITY (SOUND AND IMAGE) IS AMAZING.

The concert was SUPERB (and worth travelling to see), and the CD is awesome. BUT! This VHS is HORRIBLE! It's not even 60 minutes long for $24.99!!! Way too many songs were cut from the actual concert, and I could have edited this performance better with scotch tape.

Lip-synced again?","review":"Thank you previous reviewer (Tom) for the warning of her lip-syncing in this dvd. I totally agree that she lip-synced in \\"One Night in Eden\\", which lacked her passion and spirit and communication between her and audience because of \\"not\\" actually singing. So, I know that in any case audience cannot be led to Eden even for one munite without singers' actual singing and sincere effort. I almost wanted to try this dvd expecting a real concert. I won't buy this because of the reviewer's \\"testimony\\".

A great film that deserves a full restoration for DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR DVD","review":"In one of the all-time western greats, Duke is cast as Tom Dunson and Clift plays Matthew Garth in the saga of how the Chisholm Trail was developed as a cattle drive. In a sense, this plays like a western version of MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY, with 41 year-old Duke brilliant in his unsympathetic role, with Clift and Brennan great support. The photography by Russell Harlan is superb and Dmitri Tiomkin score is rousing.

It has all the ingredients. Cattle drive, indian fighting, fast draw and fist fights. It was also a good start for Montgomery Clift.

The DVD itself was of high quality and a very enjoyable watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Westerns ever","review":"I think this is my favorite early John Wayne film (it's not exactly early, but it was one of his earlier big hits). This epic story of a Texas cattle drive has all the parts of a western masterpiece--a journey made in the face of insurmountable odds, plenty of gunfighting, and a good, old-fashioned Indian attack. This is one of my favorite John Wayne performances, and the rest of the cast, especially Montgomery Clift and Walter Brennan, create a very dynamic chemistry.I love seeing John Wayne in these headstrong and stubborn roles. Watching the development of his relationship with Matt (Clift)--the ups, downs, and in-betweens--makes this movie very enjoyable to watch, and very touching at the same time. If you're a John Wayne fan, or a Western fan at all, and haven't seen this movie, you're missing out on one of the greatest Westerns of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billed as a psycological western. I don't particularly care for movies in which","review":"John Wayne plays an ass----. Maybe it just gives his typical character too many facets. He is Tom a cattle rancher who adopts as his own Matt played later as the boy grown up by Montgomery Clift. Tom becomes a ruthless cattle baron. Matt is starting to chafe under Tom's heavy handed control. He wants his own herd & own brand. Tom won't hear of it. Conflict ensues & it gets ugly.I haven't read all 80 something reviews, but somewhere it might have been mentioned that this was John Kennedy's favorite movie. Interesting in that in his own real life he had a love-hate relationship with his own father, Joe sr. His father was rather domineering, desiring to control every aspect of JFK's life, & the future president hated it.

It includes a line-in jack(which is great) for connecting an Ipod or other MP3 player to it, but it DOESN'T INCLUDE THE CABLE! I had to cannibalize the cable from my PC. What do these things cost? A quarter?3. It doesn't include batteries for the remote. For you young'uns(and I'm not that old), it used to be that including batteries for such a thing were standard, especially from a good company like Sony.To sum it up: If they had spent a few more pennies on things that should have come with this player, I would have been happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boy's Guide to the Historical Adventures of G.

Compared to the heavy tome by Snedecor or the procedural texts intended for social science majors, this is a breath of fresh air.But beware: you have to read this book with care. Don't skip anything.

I took some very high level statistic courses in college, was always kind of lost, and thought I would go through it again with hopefully a better book than what we had.This book is even worse. Formulas are mentioned mid-paragraph and are not laid out in an \\"orderly\\" manner. There are no steps shown to how referenced example problem solutions were achieved.

My wife was able to put what she learned in the video right to use after the baby was born. Sheri Bayles keeps the topic interesting in all her videos.

My baby is a slow eater. Why would I deprive him of food? And what's the problem with allowing him some non-nutritive sucking after he's done eating? Breastfeeding is about more than just calories.

I was a little wary about the humor since the title is 'Learn and Laugh About Breastfeeding' after all, but Sheri Bayles is simply not funny, and at points it's painful to watch. She's clearly working hard to sell her schtick, but the purpose of the video is to get info on breastfeeding, not to allow an outlet for an obviously frustrated comedienne. She knows breastfeeding facts, and she'd do better to just give the information. Finally, it'd be a better video if they included more footage of real babies feeding, latching, etc., rather than focusing on the baby dolls and Sheri's endless banter from the couch."},{"rating":"1","title":"One major complaint","review":"I reviewed this DVD in the hope of showing it to young mothers in a mentoring program. The instructor is obviously an expert and is very knowledgeable on the subject, however, 5 minutes into the video she uses the Lord's name in vain. She is referencing the pain you feel when the baby first latches on. The pain is real, but she says \\"Oh my G-d\\" to describe it. She also tells her audience not to drink a 1/5 of vodka if you want to co-sleep with your baby. I believe she was saying this in jest, but her crudeness made this video inappropriate to use with young mothers. It is a shame because I think she knows her subject well.

A young lady is competing in a local wakeboarding competition whilst living at home with the cliched drunk dad. Throw in some teen angst, some fun wake stunts and you have yourself a film that finishes before it starts.There are some deleted scenes from an unrelated film that follow and a preview of another. Sound is bad, picture is horrible, but I would recommend it to those teens looking for some cool (albeit brief) wake footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prof","review":"Don't waste your money on this book.

It is the best book to get if you want to meet the requirements of Pony Club levels A, HA, or B. But I recommend getting this book only if you are at the advanced levels in riding and horsemanship because otherwise you will find that the book overwhelms you with information.I may suggest that people buying this book should consider buying Pony Club Manuals on levels C and D before or perhaps in addition to this manual.Overall, a good book for learning about the horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant poster","review":"The image is exactly the same as it is displayed.

I bought this book to study for the rural carrier exam. I was mostly interested in learning some strategies for taking the memory portion of the exam. I wasn't happy with this book's method of assigning random letters to numbers and then trying to make words and stories out of them. The book didn't mention easy ways to break down the numbers, or maybe focusing on just names or numbers first, or even talk about whether you're penalized for wrong guesses or not. The chapters on studying for other portions of the test don't measure up, either. For example, the number sequence study section uses multiplication and division and the real test does not. It's a waste of time to learn how to decode number sequences that aren't even on the postal exam.I definitely do not recommend this book. You'd be better off just using what the post office sends you and winging the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO BASIC - NOT ENOUGH DETAIL","review":"I thought from the advertisement & description that this map would include road details that would allow me to use it as my source for traveling around the island of Nassau.

Among the most famous are those devoted to the \\"Notre-Dame school\\", specifically Leonin and Perotin, two directors of music at Notre-Dame de Paris. This is by far the best recording I have heard of this repertoire: it sounds like a real Mass rather than like professional musicians exhuming the past, and it transports you immediately to the Middle Ages. The second cut (Deus misertus), in four voices, is especially striking. Buy this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who spiked the egg nog?","review":"As a Spike Jones fan, I was seriously disappointed with this album. Practically none of the album is done in Spike's zany style. Most of the songs are sung by a choir in a \\"serious\\" style. I guess it's okay for what it is, but I personally find it to be very boring. Spike's old band the City Slickers are absent from this album, with the exception of George Rock, who sings a few songs in his \\"little boy\\" voice. The songs sung by George are the highlights for me, although his \\"All I Want For Christmas is My Two Front Teeth\\" is not the classic hit version, but rather it's a vastly inferior rerecording. He also sings \\"My Birthday Comes on Christmas\\", \\"Angel in the Christmas Play\\" and \\"Santa Claus' Son\\". These are okay novelty songs, with \\"Santa Claus' Son\\" being the best of them. I can't recommend this album, unless you happen to like choral singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for the die-hard","review":"Anyone looking for a \\"Spike Jones\\" treatment will be sorely dissapointed. Rather than using his usual comical approach and crew, we are \\"treated\\" to a banal \\"25 voice choir\\" and the City Slicker Juniors (7 of spike's nieces and nephews). More recognizeable is George Rock on \\"two front teeth\\" and a few other tunes. A rather bland '50s holiday fare worth a listen at best. Think of the soundtrack for the burning log of tv years past.

I might judge it less harshly if it were just about a random train, bus, and helicopter, but it isn't a random book--it purports to be a Thomas the Tank Engine book, and as such it should be better. The story doesn't match the characters as they're developed in better Thomas books; the text rhymes sometimes, but not most of the time; the rhymes, when they occur, are mostly simplistic doggerel without any of the fun cleverness of most children's rhymes; alternately, for the purpose of forcing some of the story into the pointless randomly occurring rhymes, unnecessary and jarring exceptions are shoehorned in (Percy doesn't really rhyme with Hurry, for example--and since most of the book doesn't rhyme anyway, why bother to force this?).The best part about it is that it's very short.My kids like it, and yours probably will, too, so long as they are young enough to not be purists about their favorite characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"No point","review":"I have to agree with the other 2 star review.

I suggest everyone who enjoys the oldschool sound to check out his albums, one little confusing thing about the album is that all the songs appears twice.

But they do have a certain unique quality to them which really works well on kids. My son and daughter love these movies, and the subsequent Godzilla games on the video systems and all of that really ignite their imagination. The transfers are about as good as can be expected I guess, as these films had poor audio and dubbing back then. Funny anecdote, my son is three and he has already seen the Godzilla film with Matthew Broderick (A disaster of a film, mind you) and when he watched the first film in this series he was all pissed off saying that that was not Godzilla and that it looked phoney. But he has warmed the the films and watches them all the time.

They make it look like you're getting the collectors package, but alas it's only a trick. I guess I'll not return it, as I wanted them anyways, but I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to having an amazing collectors box. Now, I'm stuck with a crappy normal box to stick with the rest of my DVDs. I was looking forward to putting it on display, not now.

It lacks the depth, superb graphics, and variety of the VERY good dinosaur game - Dinosaur Adventure 3-D. The entire game is this simple: Match 3 dinosaur tiles (head, mid-section, and tail) before your opponent does... and do it again, and again, and again...

YUK! AND DOUBLE YUK!!!!I am absolutely mystified as to why Andreas Scholl, with his fine voice, would be a part of this type of album. It's disgraceful! The voice of Visse is annoying to the point of agony and one hopes that listeners who hear countertenors for the first time on this album won't give up on them.Bertin is passably good but the biggest disappointment is Scholl. The song selections are inane in that they do not fit the voices. To hear \\"My Way\\" sung by any countertenor is ludicrous; I hope Frankie isn't listening.The only song I found attractive was \\"White as Lilies\\" sung by Scholl.

The songs are good in themselves, and Visse is extraordinary as always, and very funny. Bertin is unmemorable here. As send-ups go, well, I'm sure the boys had fun, but mostly it's lost on me. If there was a fire and I had to lose one of my Scholl CDs, this would be the one. The Orchestre Philharmonique du Carmargue sounds like a synthesiser. (Scholl has one of his own.) Not an essential purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing at best","review":"One wonders who at Harmonia Mundi thought this was a good idea. While it might be funny, one is certainly not laughing WITH the 'three countertenors'. The absolute highlight would have to be White as Lilies- it is too ridiculous. Apparently it was a big sucess in Asia following its use in a car advert- forget not David Hasselhoff's fabulous singing career in Germany. If you are looking for something with 'countertenors' but in a more popular genre, why not G��rard Lesne's recent release with two french DJs.

To me it was very basic information and for the cost, this video is certainly not worth it. The instructor spent more time showing you how to brush the hair of a boy vs. girl than anything useful.

I didn't like Jello, the wolf, Miyax's (Julie) mother-in-law, Miyax's husband, and the fact that the bird Miyax found died in the end. That was sad.

When she went to sleep, I grabbed the book and read the page. I simply got shocked. How can this kind of book be recommended for children of this young age?

Her novels have enchanted readers for years. She has an amazing ability to describe a scene! All of this, plus her general subject matter being about the outdoors, nature, adventure make for a teacher's (which I am) dream when looking for books to assign to their students. HOWEVER, do not allow your young children to read this violent book. Although it is marketed to 4th-8th graders it is in NO WAY appropriate for that young age. In addition to the graphic violence and animal abuse, 2/3 of the way into the book it has a well-described scene of r**e on page 102. This is very shocking and disturbing. If you want a good outdoors adventure book, read \\"My Side of the Mountain.\\" Wait to read \\"Julie of the Wolves\\" until the kids are in high school...or perhaps never. Too much negative to put into young minds!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a good book but some was not exciting.","review":"I had to read this book for a school project.

It seemed to wander around aimlessly, and it often lost my attention. I couldn't comprehend as to what the character was feeling, because the author made the character distant and not easily understood. Her life might have been toutching if the author had spent more time on her emotions than her making and mending clothing.If you like books that don't go into depth with the characters, or you simply love the outdoorsy stuff too much to care, then go on ahead and read it.

This book may of been the worst I ever read. This book bored me. After reading a section for over 5 minutes I wold get restless, and dont get my wrong ive always had a good attention span.I would give this book 0 stars but at least I understood what was happening in the book.

That also makes it better because it has different language. I liked it because it talkes alot about the wolves in it and that was the speacial touch to this book for me. It is about a girl that runs from home to San Francisco toword her pen pal who calls her Julie when her real name is Miyax but she gets lost in the middle of Alaska without anything, even food. You would have to read the book to figure out more and figure out if she finds her pen pal. I would give this book four stars for all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sends the Wrong Message","review":"I found the ending of this book quite disturbing. For most of the novel, the author portrays the arctic environment in general and wolves specifically in a sensitive manner. However, in the final pages, Julie's father kills the hero wolf by shooting it from an airplane. The author concludes by essentially shrugging the whole thing off. Julie and her dad reunite, and what happened to the wolf (who had saved her life) is depicted as something that's too bad but cannot be helped. Further, it is suggested that this is the way things are going to be and that's that.

Why this author chose to use this violent and filthy scene is beyond me.Furthermore, I am sick and tired of books being rated for 9 year olds that are in no way appropriate for such an age!!

Alaska's Governor, Sarah Palin, tried to increase that bounty to $150 and broadly expanded the hunting of wolves from planes. She did this claiming that the wolves were competing against human hunters for caribou, without any basic understanding of the science of the wolf ecosystem, that helps keeps all species in balance. That sense of balance in the natural world is well communicated by this book, and is a valuable lesson for young teens. If only Sarah Palin had read this book when she was teen, then maybe she would have more respect for the natural world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Review from a Parent","review":"My daughter picked up this book because it looked similar to Island of the Blue Dolphins.

Julie learns to \\"communicate\\" with the wolves. Food? You mean they kill food and give it to her? Well, sometimes. The wolves also regurgitate the food for Julie's dining pleasure.Although this book may cause readers to take an interest in Alaska and Eskimos, it really doesn't teach much about Julie and her culture. This book is unrealistic and rather dry. It would be difficult to keep a young reader interested in this book. Granted, this book may be a good tool for cooperative teaching.

The second part was the part that was boring and extremely inappropiate for young readers. It displays the reason for Julie's journey to such uncomfortable surroundings.

She learns to communicate with wolves, who soon take her in as one of their own. She learns what it means to be a true Eskimo, and she learns a lesson that took fear, dissapointment, and sadness to gain.

She doesn't have any shelter, protection, or food. She is alone in the Alaskan wilderness until she finds a pack of wolves. She becomes almost like family to them. Especially the leader, Amaroq. This is a fairly interesting book but isn't the best book. It goes to slowly and has lots of flashbacks which make it hard to understand. It also describes the scenery and what is around Julie way too much. This takes away from what is happening to her and what could happen to Julie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie of the Wolves","review":"The book, Julie of the Wolves, is about a eskimo child named Miyax who has to go and live with her aunt to go to school.

She doesnt like it there so she goes and lives with the wolves and she becomes a wolf child.

The reason Julie runs away is because dumb Daniel tries to force her to have sex with him at age 13. Not a subject I want a nine year old to deal with. Second she makes friends with wolves. Wild wolves are dangouous! They don't recomend you even keep a half wolf dog in your house because that predator instinct can kick in and they can kill you, but theese wolves don't see her as a snack they act more like a domestic dog pack.

It shouldn't be a Newberry Award book. The kids should deside what is Newberry and what isn't. This book's plot sucks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Julie of the Wolves","review":"I really enjoyed the first two parts of this book, but toward the third I did not, as it was focused on racial hatred. The first two sections were mainly about her survival in the arctic tundra, and her eventual acceptance by a wolf pack.However, in the third part of the book, the main character is consumed with hatred toward white people and their culture because of a wrong a white hunter did to her. She refuses even to see her white friends again because of her blind hatred and intolerance. She rejects her father as well, because of the fact that he incorporates aspects of white culture (such as technology) into his life.

To what extent was Matthew seeking to oppose Rome's claims to authority and sovereignty over the whole world, to set up alternative systems of power and society, to forge new senses of identity? If Matthew's community felt itself to be living on the margins of society, where did it see the centre as lying? In Judaism or in Rome? And how did Matthew's approach to such problems compare with that of Jews who were not followers of Jesus Christ and with that of others, Jews and Gentiles, who were followers?

It must have been shortly after it was first published. I have since re-read the book many times, and even had to buy another copy after my first one was lost. I have always regarded it as one of the best science fiction books ever written. It has action, heroism, romance, a thought provoking premise, a grand vision--everything you want in a science fiction novel. I just picked it up again, and found it to be just as fresh (and contemporary) as when I first read it almost 50 years ago. My brother loves the book too--we have passed our copy back and forth over the years.

However, I immediately became interested and felt a connection with Monty, the main character. Like Monty, who is writing his senior thesis, I often times use grades and school work to determine my happiness and measure my success. Sometimes I am lucky enough to have someone who opens my eyes to what is really important in life. Simon, a homeless, yet vivacious, man who discovers Monty's lost thesis, serves as this eye opener for Monty. With the help of Monty's roommates and Simon, he discovers that life is not about job titles or the amount of money you make or awards you recieve. This movie sends the poignant message that contentment and true happiness come from the simple, yet awe-inspring, moments of everyday life. We are reminded that our lives are enriched, and we are truly successful, if we help open the eyes of even one person and touch their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"I thought that this was an excellent movie...

I thought it was a great deal therefore I purchased it. My 2 year old likes the twirling. She does it over and over again. But that's about it. The doll of Dora is removable but stiff and heavy so she doesn't carry her along. She does comb Dora's hair with the comb provided and she wears the barret. Dora also tells a story.

If you're looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"tastes like perfumed soap","review":"I am a daily herbal tea drinker. I prefer green teas, but also love red bush teas. I used to drink fruit teas and even longer ago, I drank black teas before going caffine-free. I never thought I would not like a tea. Well, this is the first one that makes me cringe and I wish to never drink it again. Unfortunately, I bought 6 boxes here at amazon with many individually wrapped bags, and I don't want to throw my money away, so I will drink all 6 boxes (I did leave one at a family member's house, just to be rid of a whole box). I bought one box of the Yogi Blueberry Slim tea at the store (one box only to test it first) and it's quite good. As the title of my review states, this tea tastes like perfumed soap, so I can't recommend this super anti-oxidant flavor. I do love the little tags attached to the bags carrying wise sayings :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype!!!","review":"The box looked tempting and I thought what the heck, but man do I regret buying this expensive crap in your mouth tea. I couldnt put my finger on what the horrible taste was until I actually read the ingredients. If you look at the ingredients you will see that it includes irish moss as large component of the mix. Stay away, it tastes as if you are licking the bottom of a tree stump in a mossy overgrown forest and then swallowing a mouthful of bark. These 5 and 4 star ratings are very suspect and I believe they are generated by employees of Yogi corporation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yogi Rejuvenation tea is better","review":"I've tried many of the Yogi teas, and I really don't like the taste of this one.

Boy, was I disappointed!It's very very hard to drink. I forced it down my throat and it took a lot from meto hold it down. I had the puke sensation for a long time after drinking it. Now I know,why it works for weightloss. After drinking this, you don't feel like eating or drinking anything.

However, for anyone wanting to \\"get it all\\" in one book, it is a very good source.It is well written and penned with an obvious depth of knowledge and keen insight.The format basically runs from battle to battle.

There are others who get lost in the crowd. It would have been nice if there was a way to identify guests during this DVD.

The biggest drawback of this sling is that it's not adjustable - even if you get it sized correctly for your body, you have to take into account that babies are all different sizes too. Based on his age and the Hotsling's documentation, my baby should be comfortable in a forward or inward facing front carry. The sling is too small to carry him facing forward and too big for him to face me and stay upright. He never could lay down in it either b/c he's much too long - he was 26\\" long at 3mos old. Save your money and get a sling that adjusts to fit you AND your baby. I have a ring sling from another manufacturer that is much more comfortable for both of us. It was more expensive, but we've gotten a lot more mileage out of it than this Hotsling."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this sling!","review":"I purchased this sling to use with my third little boy.

It was nice to have my baby snuggled nice and close to me and free from the hands of strangers. He also slept very well cradled next to me...it was a grocery store must have, especially with two older children with me. I used this from the time he was a newborn all the way up until about 18 months old. We did the cradle carry, the front carry with him sitting, and eventually the hip carry.

It would be a great baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ORDER ONE SIZE UP!","review":"This sling worked PERFECTLY for us until my baby was 3 months old and then it was way too tight, despite the fact I used their website's sizing instructions. My infant is small for her age too so I'm not sure why we outgrew it so fast. I used hotslings' sizing chart but clearly it's too small. I don't want to spend another 40 bucks to go to the next size up. Anyway, I do recommend the sling because I wore it EVERY day for about 3 months but the sizing is tricky. I HIGHLY recommend going up one size from what their sizing chart states.

The film is broken up into five sections, for five different time periods, but none of them have any substance to them. There is a reason that this film was smashed pretty hard when it was released. I'll watch pretty much anything, but this remains the only movie that I've ever walked out of. I later watched it again with a friend to prove that Williams really did a film this bad, and it was worse the second time around. There is no reaseon to see this film. If you looking for a good Williams picture, get \\"dead poets. . \\" or \\"Good Will. . .\\" or even \\"What dreams[the book is better though].\\" This film is terrible, but not bad enough to justify being watched to mock, such as \\"attack of the killer...\\" or \\"THe Starfighters.\\" There really is no reason to see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmm...no.","review":"If the thoughts of Robin Williams playing 5 characters has visions of Eddie Murphy doing The Klumps from \\"Nutty Professor\\", move on.

It's not even that entertaining, and I think that's something else that detracts from the movie. You think you'll be entertained, and nothing really happens. Mr. Williams' character goes from one tragedy to the next, and it just never seems to get better. The modern-day finale story is good, but the rest of the film is just missing \\"the spark\\" that he has in him when he has a meaty role (like \\"Dead Poet's Society\\" or \\"Awakenings\\"...or even \\"Mrs. Doubtfire\\"!) Not worth watching, to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie","review":"I found this to be an easy movie to watch and yet quite enlightening. I particularly enjoyed Robin Williams and his antics. He blendes his comic talents with a very interesting subject matter of past lives and what that might represent to a person living today. The movie runs a little slow at times, but there is depth of meaning in this simple story that can only be explored with a light hearted fun and spiritual overtones. Robin Williams is a master of our time in this unique way of comedy acting while telling a story.I have found there are movies that are absolutely great but only if you see them when you are really bored. This movie could easily fall in to this category. Don't build an evening around it, but when you fall in to this movie, it can rock your world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soul of Being Human","review":"This delightful film is a thoughtful study of the incarnations in our lives which bring us to where we are right now. It is comprised of four past lessons and a current incarnation of the Robin William's character. In each of these we see strands which make up the fiber of the modern man. Insecurities, a lack of his sense of \\"place\\", inability to communicate emotions and a real talent for regret are the studies here. The story is sometimes choppy and muddied, but it is one of William's best performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is fabulous!","review":"I never knew there were so many things you could make with icing and an ice cream cone.I wish this Author would come out with some new books for us.Look up the ones he has done.This book shows you what to do to make ice cream cones look like teddy bears,rabbits,scarecrow,tiger,frog,fisherman,bride,baby,snowman,puppy,owl,elephant,and a man in a trash can.I love it!

The two traditions lay far apart in time, but, musicologically they touch upon common themes of rhythm and counterpoint. Webern wrote his dissertation on Heinrich Isaac. Personally, this mass of Machaut actually sounds \\"medieval\\" as opposed to truly Renaissance, and, what's more, it is polyphonic, which is usually pushed into the Renaissance bag-o-tricks. It is very spiritual at times and features quiet daring variations in following the cantus firmus."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new composition based on Machaut's Mass","review":"I own several of Peres's Ensemble Organum CDs. This is the only one I don't like. Machaut was perfectly capable of composing wild music and getting it down on paper (a ragtime version of Gais et Jolis, anyone?). I do recommend Peres's other chant recordings: in single-line and organum-style chants their approach is an ear-opener, and they have tremendous nuance in their approach to pitch. But if you want to get a feel for what Machaut actually wrote, you have to go to another recording: the Oxford Camerata is an incredible bargain if you can get it, and quite good. The Oxford was my 4th version of Machaut's Mass, and the first one I am happy with (although I'm tempted by the Lay of the Fountain on the Hilliard Ensemble version.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a rc plane!!!!!!!","review":"I Bought it just because i thought it would fly.

Many of the items are genuinely emotional, though not very poetical.The articles are divided evenly between: (a) previously published and still accessible material; and, (b) new, politically contextualized pieces. The latter work very well.The general quality of the editing is good, though continuity suffers in the assessment of Saro-Wiwa because of the mix between poetry and appraisal. Occasionally the writing of individual entries is abominably dull because of an elementary sense of stylistics and the most rudimentary grasp of rhetoric.

The light beam, battery life and handlebar mount were all very good but the construction of the light itself is very flimsy. The top cover over the batteries does not seal tightly allowing water to seep in and it is easily lost. The clear front part containing the bulbs and circuit board eventually broke off just by normal handling. I could not reattach it since the very thin wires also broke away from their solder joints. The switch on the back of the light does not have a positive \\"click\\" and can be easily activated unintentionally.This light is good for only occasional use in a dry environment.

This light does illuminate a bit in front of you but not enough to go fast in the dark without worrying about hitting something. The light is surprisingly small (about the size of two fingers).The switch is very well designed in that you hit it once and the light turns on solid, hit it again and the light blinks, hit it a third time and the light goes back to solid. This is nice if your ride takes you alternately through well lit high-traffic areas (blinking mode) and dark low-traffic areas. To turn the light off you hold the switch down for a couple of seconds. This way you never accidentally turn the light off when changing modes.Light is not very water-proof. I left the light on when I washed my bike and the insides were soaked.

Now it is useless without an improvised \\"fix\\", which I haven't been able to figure out yet. Unfortunately, I think the best answer is to search for a new front light. I do not recall how the tab broke off. I only remember hitting a street bump/pothole and the light flew off, never to snap into place again. The light was satisfactory and reliable before then. I used it for almost two years before the tab broke.

I have owned it for about a month and use it for my daily two and a half mile commute through the city to school.It performs as I expected, bright light, solid construction and has a farily sturdy, but adapatable, mounting system.When shopping for this I was not looking for a super bright headlight; just something that would help me see in the dark and would catch drivers attentions. I does help you see in the dark, but will only give you the sense that you have a decent flashlight lighting the way, not a headlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good light in a small package","review":"Pros:small lightregular batteries (AA)removable lighteasy to install mountflashing mode, good for being seen on the bikeCons:could be a little brighter in non-blinking mode.

The mistake I made was assuming that it projected sufficient light to enable me to see a reasonable distance ahead in total darkness. The LED light is certainly bright enough, particularly in flashing mode, for others to see you but does not extend much beyond two or three feet.If you're looking for an affordable and functional bike light to be noticed, then this one fits the bill.

However, the singing is very good and the orchestral work is even better. Woldike's tempos are moderate, not nearly as slow as Klemperer and not nearly as fast as, say, Max.

The London Baroque (2 violins, cello, and clavichord) does a very good job of catching both the French and Italian aspects of this blended set of sonatas.

I would have liked a less pronounced curve for the sides, as it's hard to have the food \\"jump\\" from the pan when shaking it back and forth.Like Celeste mentions in another review, I have 2 pots that leak around the handles. I haven't contacted Tefal yet, but am eager to see how the \\"limited lifetime warranty\\" will hold up to that, and whether the replacements will have the same problem.It's a nice stainless set, but the price is not a \\"bargain\\" for what it is.

With the exception of the title song it was rather straight. And straight ahead. Amazing vocals. Pretty good songs. What the ? It may seem a trifle desperate attempting any kind of MOR, but he did it with some panache. Sadly, most of the audience was gone. He innovated himself out of a job. Innovatively. Sefronia, the song, was brilliantly beautiful both melodically and substantively. Hauntingly. Dolphins always welcome and a great intro to the record. Honeyman, Because of You, Quicksand, Stone in Love--even Sally Go 'round the Roses. A very underrated outing.

The bottom line is: anyone can cash in and get $2M+ for giving the US government information that leads to a component of a nuclear bomb, let alone a full one. We also know that the Russian mafia ripped off Al Qaeda in the early 90s and didn't give them anything (but it was reported that they had). On the one hand, it's good to be vigilant. But we need to cover the bases that make sense. If Al Qaeda has a nuclear bomb and it was in the US, they wouldn't be able to keep it a secret (they know that) so they'd use it almost immediately (under 6 weeks). As for them owning 12 suitcase bombs, that's a well exaggerated figure and could only be proposed by someone infected with delusion on a Michael Moore scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"Enjoyable.

Originally from Switzerland, he studied in the Paris Conservatory, winning the First Prize there, as well as in Geneva in 1956 (shared First Prize) and won the Second Prize in Munich in 1961 (behind Heinz Holliger and ahead of Maurice Bourgue). For years he was the Principal Oboe with the Salzburg Mozarteum.Andre Lardrot recorded extensively with Vanguard in the LP era, but unfortunately very few recordings have been reissued on CD. This is a rare CD featuring mostly Andre Lardrot's playing.Being an oboist myself, I can heartily recommend this CD. The quality of the recorded sound is so-so, but the playing is first-class. For an even better rendition of these pieces, with better sound, one may try Heinz Holliger or Pierre Pierlot's recording (available on DG Eloquence and Erato, respectively)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice table for small space","review":"This table is great in a small kitchen.

Catherine Gates (Ann Sheridan) they decide the only thing the can do is get married. All this would be fine except for one thing. The U.S. government forms for bringing a spouse back to the U.S. assumes the spouse is female (hence bride.) After several attempts to correct this oversight it is apparent the there is only one way to get on board the ship. A horse is missing a tail and a lanky spouse is having problems with high heals. Will this work or is it just the beginning?There are many great one-liners. Also misinterpretations and some slapstick moments. Through all of this you get the Grant expressions.

This was really the beginning of his most lackluster period on screen.

She seems wasted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLASSIC HAWKS'S SCREWBALL IN A BEAUTIFUL NEW TRANSFER","review":"Howard Hawk's \\"I Was A Male War Bride\\" has become a benchmark in screwball comedy. Grant plays a French officer stationed in post-war Germany, who falls for stubborn American WAC officer, Ann Sheridan. This is one of those great comedy of errors, in which two people, destined to be together by the final fade out, have to go through the rarest of hoops to acheive their blissful conclusion.TRANSFER: In a word - gorgeous! A stunning black and white picture with an exceptionally balanced gray scale. Near pristine film elements - perfect contrast levels, solid blacks and NO DIGITAL ANOMALIES, result in a smooth visual presentation that can't be beat.

Yes I heard at the end that Cary Grant does a good job impersonating a female nurse but why wait for that if the film is a notch above total boredom? Humor was off as was some of the pacing in the story and some blame female lead Ann Sheridan for that one. Probably unfair as the movie just had a number of issues. This is one of those old movies that doesn't stand up to the test of time. Pass!

Ann Sheridan is often underrated and certainly died too young. Together, they make a fairly predictable pair in a fairly predictable film. She is an officer in the peace keeping troops in France after World War II; he is a French officer who is assigned a mission in which she accompanies him. Neither like each other then (of course) fall madly in love (in a hay stack, of all places). They get married, mix ups ensue, they have to get him legally in to America but all the rules are written for war Brides (not war Husbands). Cary Grant has to get aboard the departing ship to America but can only do it if he disguises himself as a war Bride. As handsome as he is, he does not make a good looking woman! Regardless, this is a charming movie with a few laugh out loud moments. If it's on sale, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wondering...","review":"... if Howard Hawks was proud of making this. Sure Cary Grant didn't seem happy playing this part. I can't think of any good actor who'd enjoy being lured into such a preposterous plot which should have got Sheridan some Oscar for impersonating one of the most insufferable bitches on the screen (there's no shortage, but very few were less funny) although the responsibility is more Lederer's disappointing script.This opinion is for the first 15 min. only, since I don't know if it gets better afterwards, but I couldn't stand it any longer : the last 5 min (of the 15) were an ordeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I am a Cary Grant fan, but I was extremely let down with this one.

It was likely filmed in post world war II Europe as there is a lot of destruction in the background, but the movie doesn't specifically address the sadness of the era, just the post war government red tape that plagues anything involving moving between countries.

Almost every page had 2-3 boxes with quotes in it which was very distracting. The chapter headings were inviting but there was very little detail involved in the chapter.

Too many one-liners, like \\"Either the key to our wallet is in our heart, or the key to our heart is in our wallet.\\" that just left me cold. Now I must admit I am a psychotherapist so much of this material I already knew, but I still consider myself a student in life as well as a teacher, and the writing just didn't connect with me. There was nothing that I felt invited me in to the topic or caught my attention that would give me something deeper to think about. It was too general.

For a serious read on portfolio theory try books like the classical approach of Grinold & Kahn, or more recent texts by Amenc or Scherer.

I find it not only soothing, but evocative. The same songs take me on a different journey into my own past with each listening.(Bekdum makes me cry - Fishook.) As with a good Hitchcock film, the music somehow elicits a different response from each listener. JD guides the listener and sets a mood, but never forces a musical conclusion - that is left to us.

If you're fed up with the voiceless wonders of modern performances (the paradox being that instrumentally, Baroque music is played better and better - are we really to believe that H?ndel, shipping in singing stars from Italy, was writing for such thin voices, so devoid of personality?) give this a try.

Her horrid niece rents out parts of Sarah's house to offset the costs of her care, and Sarah overhears two of the tenants plotting murder.

Through perseverance she starts communicating with a little girl who had the patience to wait for her to blink (once for yes, twice for no), but how can Sarah convey her message if the question is never asked? And after her secret slowly comes to light, her life is in danger as well because no one has the full information. This is a highly compelling thriller that is so unique.

Most of the stuff assumes you know those plays well so that you can understand the inside info. Some of the plays were simply aweful and a few were even offensive to the point that I quit reading them. And as a theatre student, I like to think I can stomach a lot but where in the story of Hippolytus and Phaedra does a twelve-year-old boast about all the sexual experiences she's had? Ugh. If it were old, I MAY understand based on culture, but as a modern subplot added on, it's just revolting.There were a couple of plays that were okay, and I just love Sarah Ruhl's adaptation.

I have several Wustof knives that I can not keep sharp, so after reading a review from America's Test Kitchen and the great reviews on here, I decide this knife was worth trying for under $30. I am so happy I did. It really slices and dices like a charm. It is lighter than my pricey knives, but it doesn't bother me. The handle is easy to hold on to, and fits nicely in my hand.I have only had it for a couple weeks, so I will be interested to see how sharp it remains, but I figure for the price I can buy a new one every couple years if necessary.I have no complaints, it was money well spent on this knife!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good knife","review":"This is a good knife, however I only rated it a 4 star because after about 3 weeks of use I needed to sharpen it.

This is actually a very good knife but it's light weight is taking me a minute to get used to. The blade is quite thin but sturdy with little to no bend. For the lightest knife I own,it does feel pretty good in my hand. It isn't quite balanced as it is blade heavy with a lighter handle. Having written all the above, it is razor sharp and has sliced with ease everything I've cut in the 4 times I've used it. If it stays as sharp as it came I will look forward to using it often.UPDATE: I've now owned this knife for almost a year and it is by far my go to slicer. It is still the sharpest knife I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife","review":"Holds an edge good, fits the hand well, could be just a touch heavier.

It is exceptionally sharp and handles tough tasks like slicing tomatoes with ease. At times, it is disturbingly sharp, cutting through bell peppers and such with minimal pressure applied. I have luckily, managed to avoid slicing my finger open with it, as even the slightest graze I'm sure would have me sprinting for the band-aid box.

So be careful when using! The handle is quite comfortable, and as others have mentioned, this is a great value at this price. Whether a first knife or a gift, this Victorinox will last years beyond your expectations.The best of all the Santokus is the Wusthof 7-inch Classic Hollow-Ground Santoku. However, this Victorinox Granton Edge is a close second because of its overall quality and unbeatable value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sharp, inexpensive knife","review":"I have owned the knife for about a month now and it is great. Very sharp right out of the box and it cuts through veggies much easier than any knife I have ever owned.Yes, it feels very light compared to the Wusthof and Henckels knives but that is mostly b/c the handle is made of non-slip lightweight material (and I have tried the $80 Wusthof knife and this one works just as well).

So far, I've used the knife to slice a frozen roll of sausage, peel an orange, chop an onion, slice bread, and chop a tomato. The results were fantastic! The blade is extremely sharp, so be careful. I've knicked my fingers a couple of times, but I'm sure I'll improve as I become more familiar with how to use the knife. My husband enjoys the knife too. Good knife and good value. I only wish I had a way to store it because it won't fit in the knife block I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value and Very Sharp","review":"Even after reading most of these reviews, I was surprised at how small, light and almost flimsy this knife is. This knife should be thought of as more of a blunt nosed chef's knife than a hybrid of a chef and cleaver. It is way too light to be used to chop bones or hack away at tough items.On the bright side, it is extremely sharp and holds its edge very well. I like how maneuverable it is and it can almost be used as a paring knife if you're careful.For slicing tomatoes and working through just about any other small to medium sized fruit or vegetable, it is my go-to knife.The Victorinox steel is very corrosion resistant and even after leaving it unwashed in the sink for a day or two when being lazy, it hasn't acquired any rust spots or discoloration."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT KNIFE","review":"Only used a few times but cut very easy.

This is probably something engineered and never tested, as it supposed to avoid chopped food from sticking to the blade, it actually creates a vaccum and everything that is bigger than 1/2in would stick to the blade as you chopp. Very frustrating. My thoughts are that the gooves would work as planned if it would extend all the way to the edge (thick side) of the knife.This is making me drop the rating on this knife."},{"rating":"2","title":"chopchop","review":"Been using Victornox knives since apprenticeship 30 years ago.

I have been wanting a good knife for years and finally the wisdom of the community (and my wallet) made me buy this. For one, it is not made in China. There itself it lands 3 stars. The baby is lightweight and glides through most veggies like, well, warm knife through soft butter. The first two weeks, trust me, you'll only want to cut through everything and you get a nice warm fuzzy feeling. But try doing that with tomatoes and you'll reach for your old knife. For some reason, the serrations on this knife won't go thru tomatoes and it ends up squashing them, leaving a bloody mess on your board.Bottom line: cuts through everything except squishy veggies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.","review":"Pieces stick to each other, which is charming, but not to other surfaces, which is useless.

I first heard Tim as a suggestion from my parents and pursued it reluctantly... after all, it was my parents! What i found blew me away and i still have not recovered. Tim Buckley is a visionary as another review states, and his fearless message and freedom of expression are the missing links in today's music... He sings with such feeling that the listener (if tuned in) becomes that lover sending his or her heart out to another. Equally impressively, there are no clear influences on him, he is a true original. This album is more powerful than any of Bob Dylan's contributions to music. It is however, very hard to come across Tim's music in stores, i guess the internet takes care of that... this is a timeless love album from my favorite musician of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Raven Steals the Light","review":"I grew up in the pacific north-west and experienced many of these stories as a child.

I saw the movie first and thought it would be a better book. When I saw the book in the store, I was excited and bought it right away. It turns out, however, that the BOOK is based on the MOVIE and, boy, can you tell. It was like the author was handed the script and just filled in the non-dialoge parts around the dialoge. There were a few parts in the book that somewhat clarified parts of the movie and I did like the ending, which went a step further than the movie did. All in all, though, if you are seeing the movie skip the book. It's not worth it. On the other hand, you might enjoy the book on it's own. It's an easy read and would be nice for a cold winter's night when you don't have anything better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail the return of Deborah Chiel","review":"Deborah Chiel is back!

There's no bite, no aggression to this album. Half of this fits more into a category of \\"dated power metal\\" than the Gothic Black Metal we've come to expect. Dani's vocal arrangements are redundant and merely a re-vomiting of everything he's done to date. No barriers broken here. Damnation and a Day led me to think this would be an excellent follow-up.

It is framed by four excellent symphonies, two chosen from the Grand Set for 12 obbligato instruments, and two chosen from the earlier set of string symphonies. The orchestra sounds particularly lush in the wind symphonies, and precisely dry in the pieces without. Overall an exquisite and dynamic sound, as usual from this orchestra. There is also a more recent release featuring similar repertoire that is definitely not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for children ...","review":"Fellow Fans, this Star Wars book is strictly for children. Kevin J. Anderson's previous work in the Star wars universe, the Jedi Academy Trilogy, was disappointing but this book was truly dreadful for any thoughtful, mature reader. It's characterizations were poor, it lacked any interesting detail that could bring the story to life and the plot reeked of slapsticky goofiness.If you read the positive 'reviews' written below it is easy for the astute observer to realize that they are soley from children who are not likely to be leaving their teens anytime soon. Not exactly the most discriminating readers.

The man needs to work more on developing a fresh idea, not taking off ideas from others. This book was just as bad as his Jedi Academy trilogy. The characters are shallow, the plot is unthinkable, and the ideas are simply replays of his past books.

Lemelisk is written well, and the reader will also learn more about the Hutts, Sand People and a few other peripheral characters.

Jump in the escape pod!","review":"Let me preface by saying that this was my first Star Wars novel, and I must say that I found it to be a frustrating experience. Anderson has crafted a tale that delivers action (unarmed Jedis versus 17 Imperial Star Destroyers!) and a few genuinely amusing moments. But his dismal writing style keeps getting in the way of the story he's trying to tell. He repeats himself constantly, often writing essentially the same thing three times on one page. It seems as though Anderson is just trying to take up space so he can reach page 400. And although Luke is only in about a quarter of the novel, Anderson succeeds in making him an annoying character. (I could see why Callista dumped him.) Overall, the book is what it is: a way to eat up the hours on the plane from Los Angeles to New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"While I totally agree with the bashing of this books Predecessor, children of the jedi, I found this book to be slightly under-rated. While it is indeed true that there IS another super weapon, KJA handles it very well and keeps it fresh. The real importance with this book was it details the progression of the new order of Jedi Knights. We get to see how Luke's academy is eventually going to become a pivotal role in the survival of the new republic.As with the Jedi Academy Trilogy, you either love or hate KJA's works, I myself am one of the former."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, except for one part.","review":"Kevin J.

I read all of these clips and reviews that praise him and place him just behind Zahn as the master of the Star Wars universe. These reviews must be because of the quantity of novels he has written not the quality. Stackpole, Allston, and Perry are much better than Anderson. If you want to read the Jedi Academy Trilogy the way it should ahve been told, read Stackpole's I,Jedi. Whole story, one book instead of three. Anyway, after all of this whining about Anderson, this was a very good Star Wars book. This is, by far, the best Anderson book I have read. The plot is good and the storyline progresses rapidly. It really is a page turner. Maybe Anderson is at his best when he is not writing a series or trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"Okay, the whole death Star thing is getting just a LITTLE old, don't you think?

I mean One TIe Bomber took out the Knight Hammer, which in opinion is highly not possible. The Knight Hammer was bombarding Yavin 4, and not hitting one thing! the only casualty was basically one Jedi!! Also, killing off Crix Madine was a low blow to the unsung heroes of Star Wars. Anderson, try to put more quality into your books."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid Kevin J Anderson like a plague","review":"Kevin J Anderson is probably the worst author to ever grace the NYT's best seller lists. He's the worst author in the entire Star Wars franchise, and that's allowing for alot of crap. His writing style is atrocious, simply atrocious. His books do not contain a single quote. Not one. Why? because it is written completely in the 3rd person in which character thoughts and dialogue with each other is summarized. It reads like a condensed novel. Ok, here's an example of what Kevin J Anderson would write,\\"Chewie thought it over. He said to Han that the blaster wouldn't work because of the missing power pack. He sensed Han was mad.\\"while any half decent author would write something like,\\"What do you mean the blaster doesn't work!\\" said Han\\"Rrrah rah rah\\"\\"Power pack? Huh? Why didn't you say so earlier?\\"How someone like Kevin J Anderson can be successful writer is beyond me. He has absolutely no writing skills whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Zero Stars Option","review":"I must say this book deffinatly has made my top 10 worst reads ever.

If you enjoyed any of the Star Wars movies or have the slightest affinity for any of the characters, please destroy this book on sight. I have not read any other work by Kevin Anderson, and after suffering through this filth I have no intention of doing so. The characters are perpetual irritants, the plot is ludicrous, and even the \\"action\\" scenes are vapid. I kept telling myself that no one would intentionally write a book this awful. Anderson writes like he's nine, repeating himself throughout the book. Maybe he thinks the reader cannot recall what he wrote just five lines ago. I hope BDD jettisons Anderson in an escape pod. After this book, he can never redeem himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has the dilution of the Star Wars legacy begun?","review":"This was an awful book by the alleged \\"Dean of the Star Wars Academy\\". KJA is the ringmaster of the new Star Wars novelization push, so we can only assume the worst if this is the kind of drivel that he himself puts out. This book was weak on a number of levels but the most egregious was the asinine plot it presented. Example: uhh, did he ever stop to think about how ludicrous the \\"Hutt super weapon\\" was? An orbiting laser gun that is capable of destroying planets?? Talk about ripping off old ideas. Also just how hard would it be to destroy this weapon before it could fire?

Don't bother, you'll quit half way!","review":"Anderson isn't even close to 90% of the SW writers out there! Darksaber was babyish, the Death Star thing was dumb, and to all the good characters are killed. Callista's personality must have gone through a scrambler between Children of the Jedi and Darksaber- since when does she rely on Luke for everything? And if the Jedi Knights can repel 17 Star Destroyers with the force why don't they do something like that in every fight? Darksaber wasn't worth the money at all.

What is this, the 4th Deathstar? And why on earth kill off a character for absolutely no reason at all, as he goes after a \\"superweapon\\" that wouldn't even work in the first place? The book early on showed some promise, but the characters were so insipidly stupid and the plot so obviously hackneyed that it was a chore to finish it out.

Just don't expect too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not another super weapon!","review":"This book had it's moments but overall was not what I have come to expect from a Star Wars novel. It was cool with that old Imperial scientist but was a little far fetched when he was executed more than once. Another death star. Come on, can't you think of your own ideas? It would have been better if the death star, that dominated most of the book, would fire at least once! The space battle at the end was sort of unrealistic. At least he tried, we should thank him for that. His trilogy Jedi Academy was much better.

Anderson is a decidedly anti-Empire author, which is bad enough. What's worse, the plot simply bottoms out at the end. The Empire is depicted as weak and splintered, and the focus of the whole plot, Darksaber itself, is grossly misused at the conclusion. The reader is truly let down, because the whole worry on the Rebellion's part is unjustified, because it is destroyed before it ever threatens them. Pitiful book, as are all of his others. Don't buy it, but if you have it, spit on it, burn it, and warn others"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ!!!","review":"There are a lot of mixed feelings about this book, I thought as I read all of the reviews.

The author's thorough research into archaic legal concepts like \\"self divorce\\" and \\"criminal conversation\\" gives her fictional early American community a solid structure. Sure, it's a romantic story, but the characters are so well depicted and their controversy so sensibly drawn, that the intrigue of the book goes far beyond the simple categorization of its genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought provoking","review":"This book was a recent selection of my book group. It provoked an interesting discussion of women's rights in regards to divorce and custody and how those rights have changed over the years.

I especially enjoyed \\"To Spite the Devil.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A pleasant, but overly long quest.","review":"This, most \\"modern\\" installment yet in the world of _Illusion_, combines Victorian technology with deadly magic; WWII-style brutality, Verne-like travel, intrigue and romance. In an alternate world strongly resembling ours, a brutal and efficient empire is conquering the world, while the rest of civilization is frittering away time. A young woman undertakes a perilous race to win a chance at a magical weapon that can change the balance of power.The mixture of romance, skulduggery, adventure and magic is entertaining, but overly long. Despite well-drawn characters, the quest contains too many subplots to maintain tension, and the result is less effective than in Volsky's earlier, simpler novels like _The White Tribunal_.The novel takes place decades or centuries later than many of Volsky's books, and has references to places, phenomena, and even titles of her previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting another \\"Illusion\\".

She makes no effort to reconcile her views with society, or adjust her ideas to reality. The book says She has traveled before, but judging by how she acts in-story, I find that hard to believe. She behaves so stupidly, it is unreal.I can handle a dumb main charachter though, If other charachters are interesting enough. Unfortunately, the interesting charachters all get pushed to the sidelines (th hilarious twins), or we only get to see their boring sides (like the young \\"german\\" general, who we always see pining inexplicably after The main girl, and briefly angsting about his past.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive for an average product","review":"only get one pair not all 4 pairs as shown, expensive for one pair, unable to choose color, therefore I returned them, I didn't get the full purchase price reimbursed and had to pay for shipping the item back.

I wore the red ones with the white crocs I wear in the house, and still more lint! A trail of lint everywhere I walked. The lint came through the holes of my crocs.

It is attempting to promote family values. It is attempting to educate about the Negro Leagues, and it has Ernie Banks in it. \\"Finding Buck McHenry\\" is an example of how good intentions are not enough. It is also an example of how it isn't enough for a movie to not have certain elements. This movie doesn't offend, but it has a clunky screenplay and almost none of the relationships are believable. For example, Buck McHenry is so frightened by what happened 40 years previously that he hides out as a janitor and doesn't even tell his own wife who he is. Yet, the name he chooses to go by is Mack Henry. The movie ends with the great Ernie Banks saying,\\"Buck! Mack!\\" over and over. Not exactly \\"It is a far, far better thing I do...\\" kind of stuff. Having said all that, the acting of Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee is a highlight.

It's mostly aimed at kids (even though there's bad language throughout) but there is also good acting to keep adults involved. Be sure and watch Tommy Lee Jones closely. He does a great job showing who his character is with small details."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Paranormal World as we don't know it.","review":"Levinson's movie takes a closer look at the lives of the mysterious black-dressed men. Men in Black, secret government officials who try to protect the ultimate secret: ETs exist and they visit us often. In occasion MIB-byro also takes care of illegal aliens (heh) and exterminates a few killer giant bugs.Danny Elfman's score is moody and fits perfectly to the world of MIB. The Casting is suberb. I can't think of anyone else than Tommy Lee Jones who could have played his character. Will Smith offers the action and one liners, while Jones amuses with his routine and dry humor.MIB offers big laughs often, but the story could have been better. Now it seems that we are being shown the world of MIB, but don't do anything in it. The movie sticks with jokes that one could expect, but it could have been a very powerful satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets Boring After A While","review":"I actually would have given this movie two and a half stars. It gets kind of boring after a while. But the movie is still funny. The effects are really improved too.I liked this movie a lot when I first saw it, but I kind of get bored of it now.

I think the film thought it was terribly clever, and that's what really bothered me about it. The plot is a simple A to B progression with no twists whatsoever. Every scene exists simply to set up one lame gag, however, the problem is that the gags (which are simply a goofy CGI shot followed by a Will Smith witticism(tm) or Vincent D'Ornfrio as a redneck Beetlejuice) are just NOT funny... at all... Speilberg produced this movie, which is odd, since the thing it most lacks is what he provides best : a sense of wonder.The DVD has some great special features, but what's the point if the film included is nearly unwatchable in its garish loudness?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man Its Bad","review":"This movie is god awful. Will Smith should stick to what works for him, action movies with comedy in them (ex: Bad Boys), because he was garbage and so was Mr. Jones. He proved he cant do just regular comedic movies in MIB, and also that Wild Wild West. Buyer beware, this movie isnt even worth a dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheese","review":"People warned me this movie was cheesy, but I just had to see it for myself. God it sure was.

Stupid, immature, and crude comedy with dark touches and SPACE JAM humor that isn't worth finishing initial viewing. But I did, foolishly. Nothing more than an excuse for Smith to show off and swear excessively without getting a PARENTAL ADVISORY slapped on him.

This movie is far too violent, and includes shots of a man's skin being torn off his body, two disuised aliens being sliced through the neck (and dying), a person having been killed and inprisoned in a slimy green cocoon, an alien jumping off a building to his death, a toe truck driver being shot and killed, several squashed cockroaches, a hose puring out toxic gas was shoved down a man's throat (obviously killing him), an alien being blown apart, a guy's head being shotoff, and, to top it all off, a full shot of a man broken in half at the waist, lying dead with a pale face and his feet by his head, stuffed into a metal shelf, one arm hanging down at his side.

[There is only ONE disc] I wish more studios would stop being greedy and just include both versions. And I'd give the movie 5-stars, but I'm only giving 'this' DVD 4 stars. Why: The disc doesn't go with its case. I say this because: The disc menu references extras that, upon selection, refer you to \\"DISC 2\\". The disc has \\"DISC 1\\" in the silkscreen artwork. The disc was new/unopened- complete with all those accursed stickers around the case edge. If all you want is the movie, you'll be happy with this disc. FS/WS versions and some extras. The MST3K-style commentary with Tommy Lee & the director; is disappointing. And the extras I would have liked- 'making of' 'special effects' are on 'DISC 2', which the manufacturer obviously decided they would rather throw away than simply give to me in what is obviously a re-branded, lower-cost edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, original movie","review":"This movie is like Ghostbusters with aliens. It plays off of a lot of existing popular culture and alien mythology, as well as introducing some original content. A key to the success is also the soundtrack, and the theme song by Will Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoroughly enjoyable ride","review":"Loosely based from a 1990 comic book series, this 1997 blockbuster combined eye popping special effects, classic sci-fi fare, and off the wall comedy and featured Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones as Agent's J and K respectively. Both of whom are members of the MIB: a government organized secret group who keep the knowledge of extra terrestrial life under wraps while keeping the planet at peace. Director Barry Sonnenfeld handles the film very well and keeps it at a crowd pleasing speedy pace throughout most of it's running time. While it does start to lose steam towards it's climax, where Men in Black shines is with the casting: featuring Linda Fiorentino, Rip Torn, Tony Shaloub, and Vincent D'Onofrio in lively roles, with D'Onofrio being his usual scene stealing self. This Deluxe Edition of the film seems like the umpteenth time MIB has been released on DVD; but out of all the previous editions this seems to offer the most bang for your buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not the best!","review":"I enjoyed this movie and I own it on video.

They're not protecters of the universe by any means! In true retrospect & in my 16 year study as an Ufologist, \\"Men In Black\\" or \\"MIBs\\" for short are actually UFO aliens in disguise (pick up some of the old magazines of the 'UFO Universe' or get some old & new books about UFO's or watch the old show, \\"Sightings\\" on the Si-Fi Channel, or better yet, watch the show \\"Unexplained Mysteries\\" for a good lesson on this matter. I just couldn't believe they would make a movie (and another one) about MIBs who are human & go after aliens which is way out of proportion. That just stoops very low. Maybe some daring producer would make a movie about the \\"REAL\\" Men In Black & just scare the living daylights out of these people.

Smith is pretty good in his role (he should have looked for another role like this instead of trying to be James West in a horrible version of a classic TV show!), and Jones is wonderful (as he has been in almost every role that I've seen him in). The problem is that discs are in cheap packaging, and the supplemental material is really dismal (especially when you see what can be done on DVD's like the recently released T2: Ultimate Edition). After going through the \\"extras\\" on disc 2, all I could do was wonder what I had just wasted my time on! There was nothing of interest on disc 2 other than wonderful menu graphics (Too bad they didn't pay as much attention to the content as they did the menu! The graphics are really terrific).

You said Columbia Tristar should release a 2:53.1 version of this movie. My question is this.. why would you want to do that? This film is presented in its OAR (original aspect ratio) which is 1:85.1 shot on 35mm film. If columbia Tristar was to make a 2:35.1 aspect ratio of this movie... it would literally have to be cropped and cut. Why would you want that? This dvd is 1:85.1 anamorphic widescreen. You cant get anymore than that without destroying the film. If this film was made 2:35.1 it would probably have the actors heads chopped off and things like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the parents out there...","review":"Ok, let's get parental.This should have been a great movie for kids. It's got weird creatures, cool secret-agents, lots of neat ray-gun-type-things.

Then I'd spend the next few years playing MIB during recess with all my friends. \\"No, I wanna be the coroner!\\"I say \\"should have been a great movie for kids\\" because of the language factor. My boys love this video. I love watching it with them. I hate the discussion we have to have before and after about what sort of language is appropriate in my house and why it is Hollywood people seem to find it necessary to fill their movies with junk-talk.

Will Smith is at his comedic best in this sci-fi movie that for about 10 seconds makes you actually think. This is a great no brainer movie to watch, so when you are ready to relax and watch a funny movie, watch MIB. Tommy Lee Jones is an unknown and non-existing agent for a non existent and unknown law enforcement/immigrations officer for illegal and legal aliens...Extra-terrestial aliens. At the end of this movie it has you looking at that guy down the street wondering if inside that humanoid body is a little alien with controls like a car.

Gotta love this classic summer fun flick!The Blu Ray edition is stunning; while some of the special effects didn't age as well as I'd have liked, picture quality and sound quality were both phenomenal, noticeably better than DVD. Colors were crisp, there was minimal grain and noise. Watching this on my 50\\" plasma was a total blast. This was hi def done right and a great showcase for the capability of blu ray. I haven't really explored the extras much, but they seem pretty normal--commentaries and the like.

Will Smith had a few good jokes, but they get old after repeated viewings. The special effects were good, but not stunning. The acting was mediocre, the plot not so great, and overall a failed attempt at a movie that could've been much better. Overall, something I would have given 4 stars when it was first released, but I'm forced to give it 2 now just because it gets old, and very quick.

But it did have potential, I'll give it that, and some interesting scenes, but not enough to carry this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure...","review":"Ok the story as an absolute story is not bad, actually it's somehow interesting. The animation is perfect and well done too. I think this is the best film ever for Will Smith! Oh yes, and you may accept this movie as a light commedy.One of the main downfalls of this movie was that the Science Fiction side of the film was badly affected when the story got framed into commedy! In other words, the suspense was dead!Some of you are comparing this movie with Star Wars or Aliens... I think this is not right! Nor Star Wars or Aliens was a commedy! Instead the suspense was very genuine and the movie turned out to be very powerful Science Fictions!Anyway, this movie maybe worth seeing once or twice... but I do not recommend buying it unless you are a big fan of Will Smith or Tommy Lee Jones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nostradamus Prophecy","review":"This book had a great beginning, but a poor finish. Overall, I thought the author borrowed heavily from Tom Clancy's \\"Sum of All Fears\\" and \\"Clear and Present Danger\\". Except for Dubov, the characters were not very interesting. There were some elements that were well written, such as the escape from Cairo. However, the last third of the book had a choppy feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic, gripping plot masterfully told","review":"Powell winds current and past real-world events into a fictional tale of international terrorism that gets hold of the reader early and never lets go. He ties together so many actual events and historical facts that, when finished, the reader begins following the national and world news closer than ever before just to make sure the story is not really happening! One negative: the tie to Nostradamus' prophecies could have been stronger.

The top could double as a cutting board. It is perfect for my small kitchen. The only downside so far is that the stool tops upon which you sit are too small and when the table is open, the front wheels remain off the ground thus rendering the locks on them useless. It will then roll around a bit. With some personal adjustments I'm sure this can be taken care of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"This breakfast bar is really cute.

It is very sharp looking and nice. It's good for a studio or a small space. I got it because when we actually buy a big house I can use it there too. It has wheels and moves around easily even on carpet. The leaf opens up pretty big. The stools are good size for me but I am 5'1. If you are tall and long legged it may be a little uncomfortable. I really like this set because I have such a small apartment and really just wanted back up seating for the occasional get together and a place to set things and occasionally have dinner. I put this together myself it took maybe 2 hours but I am not very handy and was watching my baby. It wasn't too hard but I took off a star because it wasn't easy to assemble either and the glue does suck. I got a separate super glue to glue in little bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Table useful.

It's just plain wood to me now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing defect","review":"For an inexpensive little breakfast bar for very small spaces, this has potential. Unfortunately the drop leaf portion of the table top on the unit we received had a gap along the side between two boards as well as uneven planing on the edge of the defective board. We feel this piece should have been discarded when it was being manufactured, but it wasn't. That said, if you get one that doesn't have a defective piece, it's probably money well spent as overall it feels pretty sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT!!!!","review":"I'm not really sure what some of the other people were talking about when they said it was hard to build, flimsy, or that the stools didn't fit when trying to put it away. I received this set today. I (a 21 yr old woman) had it built in less than and hr, building it by myself. The instructions were not hard to follow like someone else had mentioned, everything fits together perfectly, and it's very sturdy! The only thing and I literally mean the ONLY thing wrong with this set is that i was shorted two screws. But luckily they weren't completely necessary. The wood is REAL and beautiful too! Also, the packaging did not arrive damaged. I ordered it on Saturday night and it arrived early this morning (Wednesday). It IS, however, a little smaller than I expected. But it fits perfectly in my tiny kitchen! I definitely recommend this to anyone interested in buying it for whatever reason! It's absolutely perfect and I'm very happy I decided to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with table and stools","review":"Have a new kitchen and needed small table and chairs to fit a small space. Looked in several stores and then tried online at Amazon. Table and stools arrivedin a timely fashion. My daughter was successful in putting pieces together in a very short period of time. Hooked the stools on to the table placed napkins and silverware in the two drawers and am good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall I am happy with it","review":"I can only give it 4 stars instead of 5 for two main reasons:1) When assembling it, one set of holes didn't seem to line up. I'm not positive if I did something wrong (although I doubt it), but I ended up having to just ignore the hole and drive a screw straight into the wood.2) It is a not the sturdiest thing on earth. It does wobble a little bit, but not enough to really be a big issue.Overall, very happy with this product. If not for these two things, I would call it perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD ITEM, NO DIRECTIONS","review":"Nice little set, however, there were no instructions in the box...

It is not difficult to do (despite the fact that the instructions are illustrations). Suggestion....I read in some reviews prior to my buying this item that the table was wobbly. What I found out is that you have to make sure that you screw in the screws all the ways (sunken below flush level) the way they are supposed to be...tight. I see no wobllyness:)I suggest that you go through the parts list and check to make sure you have everything and lay the pieces out as you go along. This makes setting it up very easy. Take your time and don't rush (making sure that screws go in straight etc.).My item came via UPS and out of the box complete with nothing missing or damaged. So far very please with this table set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, easy to put together, holds well over time!","review":"I bought this piece over a year ago because I had a dead space in my kitchen and needed extra counter space. This is a great solution! It looks great when it's open and in the center of the kitchen, yet easily collapses and rolls to the side when I need the extra space or am cleaning. I've removed one star because after several months of use, one of the bars on one of the stools broke, but it's still usable and hasn't caused any major structural damage. For the price, this is an excellent product and I've recommended it to many of my friends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible assembly process","review":"Who runs this company? Certainly not someone who is thinking about the end user. I can't tell you how well this product functions because I still have not been able to assemble it! It comes in a very large box in numerous pieces. Considering the size of the packaging it could come fully assembled! The parts go together with wood screws and a provided allen type wrench. The screws only fit the holes about 50% of the time. There are sections that require 2 people for assembly. I am about 1/2 way through assembly and right now, this product is holding my wet jackets for drying. Don't buy this product, or any other from this company (I also bought another of their products that was packaged very poorly for the user) unless you want a real project and poor craftmanship.Very unhappy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"just as described","review":"This product does not dissapoint.

ABF Freight Systems, the compnay that ships all Amazon purchases, will only deliver between 9 am-5:00 pm and MUST HAVE A SIGNATURE TO DELIVER. What are you supposed to do while you are at work? I contacted ABF several times to tell them I would sign a waiver to just put the package on my doorstep and they refused. I will no longer use amazon's standard shipping and use UPS instead.

Looks very nice, and does what we need it to do- serve as a pub table/kitchen island in a small space. I like the way the stools tuck away underneath.The only minor quibble is that the wheels are supposed to lock, so the table doesn't roll when the cats jump on it- and this feature doesn't work too well. The wheels do move a bit, and the table does get repositioned. But we can live with that-especially at this price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Winsome Wood Table Drop Leaf Square Stool,","review":"This has to be the biiggest waste of money I spent on line this table looks very nice in the picture and it looks much bigger. Its used as a small table to hold the cookie jar and napkins yes, its that small not to mention cheaply made after getting socked with the shipping which was almost as much as the table I was really mad at myself for buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken pieces","review":"After I opened the box, I found two broken pieces and I was trying to find a phone number to call on the installation manual. Unlike other furniture companies, they don't have a phone number you can call to replace the broken pieces. Instead, they only have a fax number. To my great inconvenience, I had to use a fax machine in my friend's house to fax them the sheet with my phone number and email address. But I have not heard from them since then. I just hate to deal with a company like this who would like to keep their customers in the dark if there are issues with their orders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Price","review":"This is a pretty nice breakfast bar. I got it on sale and it was shipped from amazon right away. Assembling it was a pain but it wasn't overly complicated. The worst part about assembling it was using the tiny glue bottle. Also, the little stoppers that you are supposed to put on the side of the drawers (so they don't fall out) don't really stay in place. The screw-hole covers don't like to stay on either, but that's to be expected. All in all, once it was assembled it looks very cute and compact. I like how it has wheels so I can easily convert it from the small breakfast bar to the drop-leaf table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xlnt space saver","review":"Breakfast bar was delivered quickly and assembled easily.

This unit was perfect. Tables like this were going for $150+ at LNT or bed bath and beyond. I ended up paying about $45 at the time of purchase.The construction is a bit cheap, and I had to sand down one of the drawers pretty extensively to get it to slide in and out correctly. Otherwise its been a great fit to fill one of those kitchen corners that doesn't quite fit anything else.I've started recently using it as a sort of 'walk in' table for my bedroom and been happy with it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information","review":"All Moon books deserve 5 stars in my opinion.

The contents stay hot for two hours or more, long enough for us to finish the pot while doing our emails.The carafe pours well without dripping, but the screwtop often needs two hands to get unstuck. We haven't found this a problem; we just don't tighten it completely.The outside of the carafe is easy to keep shiny clean; for the inside, use a long-handled dish mop.We like to have the tools of day-to-day living be attractive, as well as functional.

But I thought it was time for a more recent edition. Very disappointed in this LITTLE book. Be sure to note the dimensions; it's amazing what an inch or so (or lack of) does. The new version is printed on a grey stock with small type and is hard to read. I also wish they'd kept the basic page numbers. It's an excellent resource and I use a thesaurus often in editing, but this is not one I reach for because of these \\"small\\" things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pictures by an \\"Insider\\"","review":"This book makes a great addition to anyone's GT40 collection. Friedman's pictures document not just the races, but a fair amount of the preparation necessary to get the cars in shape for competition.As a pervious review mentioned, the coverage stops right after Ford's 1967 Le Mans win, thereby totally ignoring the JWA/Gulf era, but in all fairness, Shelby wasn't involved in those years. This is a book about the *Shelby* GT40 afterall.I especially enjoyed some of the coverage of the GT40's competitors: Ferrari, Chapperal, and Porsche.

Good, as in the thrill of bearing witness to a train wreck.Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) is a controversial diagnosis. Some of the worlds top shrinks don't believe in it and neither will you after watching this film.Watch this film only if you enjoy being a spectator at car wrecks or watching amputees jump from a burning hospital.That millions of dollars were wasted in order to pinch this loaf off is the only believable crime you will see in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you an Antonio fan?","review":"If you like Antonio Banderas, this is a great movie for you! He is wonderfully sexual in this movie, and the one scene that stands out is right after Rebecca returns to his apartment and slaps him....it had me so...well, lets just say it was really good! If you can watch a movie for its entertainment value, and not pick it apart for its cinematic quality and reality quirks, then you will enjoy this movie. It does have a plot, and a good one, and the ending is a little bit of a let down, but other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Antonio is at one of his sexiest in this movie! He had me captivated the whole time! Watch for that particular scene, you wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Awful","review":"There is only one word that can fit this movie--bad. For lack of nothing better to do and no good movies left at the video store, I rented this one night. Mistake! The acting was atrocious, the script worse and the score left much to be desired. The only reason this movie seems to have been made was to have a showcase for Antonio Banderas and Rebecca De MOrnay to have sex. While I am usually a fan of Antonio Banderas, even he seemed lackluster in this movie, as if he were bored with his over-cliched role as biker Tony. Rebecca De Mornay tries and tries, but her performance is flat, and overdone. Also, the stalker is predictable to anyone with half a brain and the edning is so overdone and ludicrousI spent 20 minutes laughing. Watch this movie if you really want, but don't say i didn't warn you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie to endure, not enjoy","review":"I cannot remember another time when i actually suffered through a movie, but this one was almost unbearable to watch for me and company. The dialogue is cliched and horrendously bad, the acting is poor and forced, and the story utterly, irredeemably awful. It is full of lame suspense-thriller gags that have been used perhaps 100 times prior to this one. The movie also has one of the worst conclusions of any movie in the past 30 years at least-- all of us were shaking our heads and laughing, a bad thing since this is not intended to be a comedic film! De Mornay and Banderas have done vastly better work than this, and if you catch this film it will spoil your opinion of both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"If you are tired of those predictable \\"thrillers\\" where the bad guy is overly obvious and the plot is over done than see this movie. I don't want to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it so I'll just say this, you may think you know what's going on but you're in for a big surprise. What would that surprise be? You'll just have to wait 'til the end to see.

I finally found it in a used book store and have not been disappointed. This is definitely one of her best.

She takes a depressing, very off-putting scenario, a nursiing center for chronically ill or disabled patients, and goes beneath the surface, to show who these people are and what their lives are life. Yes, the subject is scary(who wants to put themselves in these peoples shoes?) but James writes with such knowledge, feeling, and understanding of theese people, we come to discover how close to us in emotions, hate, rage, love, and pettiness, they really are. Apart from that, interesting story-line of how crime can be committed even in this gothic setting, issues of religion, and the always insightful and compassionate Dagliesh make this the most enjoyable, haunting story! Try all her books, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great...","review":"I did sort-of like it, but the bouncing back and forth between perspectives got to me this time. I didn't like many of the characters, and came very close to setting the book down. I pushed through, though, mainly to get to the next book in the hope that it would be better. The mystery plotline was ok, but not great - sort of anti-climactic, actually. Eh. Not one of James' better mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major snooze-o-rama!","review":"What a snooze.

As a busy homeschooling momma I have short periods of time to read and this book is just awesome in that regard. This chapters are short enough to be manageable, yet are so powerful that each one leads you a bit closer to Christ bringing your spirit into a state of worshipful awe with each word. Sometimes we become so distracted by the everyday things of life, and we lose sight of the magnificence of Jesus Christ. This book will bring you to your knees, ignite the zeal for Christ in your heart afresh and revive your spiritual life. This is the first book by Mr. Piper that I have read, but it will not be the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful path to understanding our Savior, Jesus Christ","review":"I chose this rating because this book is all I hoped it would be. John Piper has a special touch and talent as he writes about spiritual things, and his other works have been a blessing to me, as this one is.I've believed for some time that I am in need of a closer relationship with Christ, and this book is a wonderful foundation for that journey.I also sought out the original 2004 edition for its Scripture version, which is closer to the one I use, and I was pleased that Pastor John used the New American Standard Bible, for which I have a great deal of respect.

Because of this, you have to push on the backside of the armoire and stuff the cable(s) through. The shelves are pretty deep, which is a good thing, but I'd recommend purchasing some extra lighting to place on top of or inside of the armoire.

Technical support was limited to reading to me what is included in the box and they could offer no other info or help whatsoever. I know more about the product than they did.

For me, since I was involved in the early days of helping Eckankar getting the right to build the Temple of Eck in Chanhassen, Minnesota along with Phil and many others, his portrayal of Temple politics which he gleans from his \\"inner\\" travels to Katsupari Monastery is not to be missed by any serious student of outer or inner body phenomenon who desires ultimately the light and sound of God! huuuu leland roth Quetzalcoatly2k@webtv.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly, madly deeply execrable","review":"I read the first three Deathstalker books and thought I should read this one.

Some people might find a dark finish appealing, but I didn't, so I immedately got out my orbital sander and stripped the tables down to bare wood.

Started brewing today. While the majority of the steps were extremely easy, (sanitizing, adding water, mixing in Hopped Malt Extract (HME), adding wort to barrell, cleaning up), I found dissolving the Booster to be the most tedious and time consuming component of the whole process thus far. It didn't matter how SLOWLY you sprinkled in the Booster, it still clumped together (like it was magnetized). Mr. Beer needs to create an easier Booster, even if the Booster ingredients have to be separated and added individually. It took longer to dissolve the Booster than all the other steps combined.

However, they all had something in common: sediment, and lots of it. I could only get about 18 bottles (12 oz.) per brew, with the rest being sediment. The brews were also consistently cloudy. Going to the MrBeer website, these are apparently common issues. I've been doing this for a year and have decided I can buy 24 bottles of my favorite beers for the same price as the MrBeer refill kits that give me only 18 bottles.

Furthermore, it has several solid performances and despite being rated only pg, has enough action to keep me, a huge action buff, completely entertained. However, the best part of this movie is the message throughout the movie. Sher Khan, who rather than a villain is portrayed more as like a jungle police officer, kills only those who disrespect the jungle law. The jungle law essentially states you will not kill unless you are defending yourself or need to eat. The movie states the message that people should not kill animals unless it is in self defense or for food, not for trophies. I think it is a very solid message that kids should learn, and should respect.

Many of the songs here start with unforgettable guitar licks. \\"Lady Luck\\", the first song, starts out with the kind of sound you're going to hear on the entire album; Nugent playing with wreckless abandon.

Including looking for the screw I dropped.They are plastichromed so don't get your hopes up about buying real chrome mirrors for this price, but they are sturdy.

His fascination perplexes no one more than the author's relatives, who make a living at it and observe his enthusiasm for the work with benign bemusement. Of course in the process of learning the family trade, Klinkenborg learns something about his own heritage, but he presents this as mere incidental observations, like an old friend waved to at the end of a row just before turning the combine around to get back to business. The writing is superb.

What I can say from experience is the stock filter for the 280ZX is getting harder to find. If you are going for the stock look, this filter will be the last filter you ever buy for your car.

First of all, the price is excellent. Best Buy sells this for $2699.00. Plus, you'll pay tax and probably pay for delivery too. Amazons listed price is ALL you'll pay.

I called Samsung and it has been 4+ weeks and I still don't have my TV. They had to replace the lamp, ballast and the DMD board. The TV is great as long as it is working but I wouldn't trust one to work for very long. I researched these for quite a while before buying and all of the reviews were good.If I were buying today my first choice would be flat panel LCD if money was no object, but since it is with me, I would go with a plasma because I believe it is the best bang for the buck at current market prices (June, 2007). 42 inches seems to be the break point.

You can hear that these pieces were composed from many hours of jamming together, working out ideas together... creating a musical style that was extremely strong, unique, and uncompromising. I wish they'd have recorded another record during this period of Pretties & Easy Action. \\"Fields of Regret\\" is one of the heaviest songs you'll ever hear from Alice Cooper, regardless of what era you're into."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love Alice Cooper - try another album first.","review":"This was the first attempt by the Alice Cooper group and it shows. They really hadn't gotten into their groove yet. There is a lot of experimental stuff with too many tempo and key changes for any fun music to really happen. Truthfully, I like the album, but my advice to anyone looking to add to their Alice Cooper library is to try \\"Killer\\", \\"Love It To Death\\", or \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\". \\"Pretties For You\\" should be added to your collection only once you are a true Alice Cooper fan, deeply devoted and interested in where it all started. I am and was, so I bought it. It's an interesting album for what it is, but maybe not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album Ever By Anyone Anywhere","review":"I am a huge fan of the original Alice Cooper BAND but this album is truly horrible. It's all over the place. It sounds like some guys who don't know how to play any instruments decided to go into into a studio, drop some acid, and see what happens. It's absolutely and completely useless. How these guys got a record deal is completely beyond me. After listening to this album you can see how much work Bob Ezrin had to do to make these guys play something listenable. The next album, Easy Action is much better although the band still hadn't hit on their signature sound yet. No one who is sane and values their hard earned money would purchase this album unless your a collector of all things Alice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?????","review":"This album is just plain wierd!

But if you are a true die hard and must have every thing Alice Cooper ever put out(dont be emberresed, I'm one of you!)Then By the album and see where it all began.One interisting note about the disc.

I eagerly snapped up each new Cooper release through the Years, one day I was at a Zayre Dept store in 1975, and this album was in the cut out bin for 99 cents. It blew me away, I had read early reviews of the band recounting their \\"negative\\" powers to clear out clubs, and this was the reason why! Here we have a true document of the late 60's L.A. weirdo scene. Lyrics that make no sense at all, bizare base lines, and psycadelic meanderings abound. This is a truely underrated album, it has no doubt inspired many in the advant guard scene { Pere Ubu's Dave Thomas even mentions them on a live set}. The song \\"Living\\" reminds me more of the 60's L.A. club scene circa 1968-69 than any song I know. I listen to this historic document more than \\"Killer\\", \\"School's Out\\", and \\"Love it to Death\\" combined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alice The Hippy.","review":"In my opinion, this is a good album, more on the lower end of the good side, bordering on bad. Now don't call me a typical Alice fan that hates his \\"weird\\" albums, one of my fave albums is his \\"Flush The Fashion\\" album... Pretties For You is just too... 60's psychadelic for me.

The abundance of typos in the book takes away from my confidence in the presentation. Also I find that the exercises sometimes lack the appropriate conditions for them to make sense. Also, the listing of theorem, lemmas, examples is very confusing; for instance, you will find theorem, say 2.1.1, comes after example 2.1.16; sometimes one example will appear over and over in different sections, and the text does not remind you the conditions, so you will find yourself flipping through page and pages trying to find them.

Possibly by then a new edition of vol 1, correcting all the typos, will be available, and then the set may be worth considering. The proofreading of the current edition of vol 1 was so sloppy that it cannot be recommended. The authors didn't even bother to run the text through a spell checker ('terrabytes').

It features one doll/outfit per page with a short blurb about the picture. The outfits are sometimes matched with incorrect accessories or off-the-wall descriptions. While this is of no consequence to the little girl playing with her first Barbie, it should not be confused with a book for serious collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Craftsmanship","review":"The content and design of this thick book is great.

I was sort of mortified by the Harry Potter references and put off by the cheesy cover art. But since I had \\"asked\\" for the right book to come to me, I took it home even though I would not have chosen it myself. Surprise! This is a great little handbook. It is simplified, but as someone already familiar with many magical techniques, I found the brevity refreshing. The techniques and perspective are solid and sound, but the BEST thing about this little book is that the spells can mostly be done using handy, everyday materials. Its a great little reference tool, compact but covering a wide range of magical subjects. Im glad I didn't judge this book by its cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real life Harry Potter?","review":"A friendly and appealing introduction to basic magic, and a true pleasure to read.I liked the \\"Harry Potter\\" theme to the book while explaining what real magic truly is. However, in some instances I thought the Harry Potter theme went a bit far. For example, male Wiccans call themselves Witches, not \\"wizards.\\" (At least she didn't use \\"warlocks.\\") I also didn't care for the \\"good magic, evil magic; good witches, evil witches\\" idea. Magic is magic. Like fire and water, it can save your life or kill you. And people are not always clear cut good and evil. Sometimes people will use magic in harmful ways (we're all human) but one mistake doesn't make you \\"evil.\\"Regardless, there's some very solid information in here, including some great potions. I had a lovely holiday afternoon reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Starter Book for Kids","review":"I was a little nervous when my son bought himself this book about magical training. The Harry Potter references were obvious in the title and in many of the chapter heading such as Divination and Defense Against the Dark Arts, but upon closer inspection I found this book to be a fairly accurate book about witchcraft and magic and not nearly as gimmicky as the title might suggest.For instance, the Defense Against the Dark Arts chapter deals with the rede Harm None and the threefold law of what you send out come back to you threefold...in other words - don't think about using magic for revenge or to hurt someone.Written in a very kid-accessible style, I was impressed with the solid beginner knowledge of the kind found in most adult books on witchcraft and paganism.

Then, the fan failed in the unit and the rest was history. These things get very hot without a fan to cool them, and the smell of burning became a common occurrence when using this appliance on the road. It would function OK until it became so hot (and I mean BURNING hot) that you had to unplug it.

The author goes to great lengths to draw the reader in, and is successful in creating something that is entertaining and thought provoking.If you like the works of Stanislaw Lem or John Varley, then Champetier is an author you definitely should try.

Most of the songs were new to me although I'd heard a few of them in modern arrangements for voice and guitar on other albums such as the superb \\"Elizabethan Lute Songs\\" on RCA Gold Seal sung by Sir Peter Pears accompanied by Julian Bream.

It wasn't until my WRT54G died that I decided to try something new. This was priced right for me at the time, so bought this with the free shipping and out of the box it worked like a charm. Now I gave this a 4 out of 5 due to the config cd not even working. Not a big deal, and don't need it since it was a cinch to setup. Now for the inexperienced I would still buy this if you want the faster dl speed, and better range (and pretty blue lights)...just make sure the cd is working. Otherwise it might prove to be a bit much to setup. It even has a connection light for those that just use wifi (shows inet is active). So no real need to use the ports if you're not intending to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I had this router for 8 days. One notebook worked fine, another constantly lost its connection, and the third would not connect at all. I tried a few simple fixes and none worked. Called their tech support and in 30 minutes he told me to reset my router. Nice job! Of course I had already tried this. I told him I did not have this problem with Linksys (although I had many others) at which point he told me to go buy a Linksys. What a joke. I asked him if he was serious but that was enough for me. Giving Netgear a shot now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, works poorly","review":"I bought this in Feb of '07 due to the draft 802.11n specs as upgrade to my Pre-N router that was also from Belkin. That model though had almost perfect stability which is what my gripe with this is: intermittent connections.Installation was a breeze and aesthetically it's the best looking router hardware but unfortunately frequently dropped connections (from a mere distance of 20 ft, on different channels from my cordless phone, and away from any walls and major physical obstructions) just does not cut it. A waste of $150.. stick with the Pre-N in my opinion if you want Belkin or look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money!","review":"Alright, this Christmas I was surprised with an Xbox 360 and a Linksys wireless router. I tried setting up the Linksys first to get my 360 online, but there was no luck.The next day we stopped in at Circuit City, replaced the Linksys, and got this one. All I can say so far is GREAT! Even though it's a little bit more money than the Linksys, it's far worth it.

So with that in mind I purchased the N1. But this model has been nothing but a nightmare of corrupt settings. I've set up many large networks (70+ users) and programmed and optimized gigabit ethernet LAN's for post production video and audio file transfers. But this unit defies reason, any attempt to customize menu settings creates a different problem. Many times the router would stop transmitting but still function wired. To get it going again I would have to reset to factory default and even then some other problem would arise, not assigning DHCP's, losing communication with the modem and more. The unit shipped with the latest firmware so no relief there. The F5D7230 isn't much better either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the worst tech support!","review":"I am writing this review as I am on hold with Belkin for the 4th time.

Then it quit broadcasting SSID despite Setup reconfigurations, reboots, etc. Tried different channels, wireless modes, even turned the protected mode and security features off. Called support both times (outsourced to India) and they couldn't fix it either.

So I rolled the dice and tried the Belkin unit.

Well done Belkin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is the first Wireless router i've tried. At first I was impressed because the directions and setup were a breeze. However, like all the other negative reviews here, the problem with this router is that it will drop/hang your connection after you get it to work. I've even updated the firmware, which I thought helped at first but the connection only lasted a few minutes longer. After using it for about 5-10 minutes, both Wired and Wireless connections freeze and stop working. I'm so disappointed; it's such a nice looking router and was at a decent price. I'll be returning this tomorrow and shopping for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthless upgrade from old D-Link wireless router","review":"After extensive trials on the unit I purchased from Amazon and a replacement from Belkin, I am now requesting a full refund from Amazon for this worthless router. It proved to be much slower than the 3-yr old D-Link it was to replace, with weaker signal strength. This was after several calls to Belkin tech support to make sure their unit was tweaked to perform at it's peak.We eventually determined that what I had purchased from Amazon was a year old, without the latest Belkin firmware. Belkin replaced that unit with a new one, which performed at an even lower level, finally giving out altogether: delivering no signal at all.So, I'm pleased to be back with my old D-Link router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product, bad tech support","review":"Used this for some months.

I don't know if this is security feature, but there's no way to disable it.Minor issues :- Most of the changes force a reboot of the router.- Incomplete support of UPNPThis router is now sleeping in a closet as a backup in case of a failure of the new one...May be adequate for people with simple configuration (single pc, etc...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ROUTER!","review":"Once in a while products do come deffective, but you call their customer service number and most companies would take responsibility for their products, well, Belkin does not.The router that i got cannot connect two wired or wireless devices at the same time.

But for several months now, it keeps dropping the wireless signal more than a dozen times a day every day. On contacting support, they sent me a replacement. That kept dropping signals too. Belkin support asks you to disable firewall and enable broadcasting but that doesn't help either (why even have those features if we can't use it?).I havd to admit though, the device looks cool and fashionable.

I bought the N1 thinking it would be at least as good as the pre-N. Wrong! This thing is a step back into the dark ages. Unreliable connectivity. Horrible range. Poor interface with USB adapter.All in all, I would steer VERY clear of this router.

Obviously wanted to be ahead of the game so I found this to be the best reviewed wireless router for Draft N out there. Set up was easy and I loved the idea of the indicators on the front. However, as I used it, found it to be very fussy. It seemed to run very slow and the connection breaks often. I ended up replacing our cable modem but that wasn't the issue either. I also found out that it has some issues concerning xbox live. It will work, but I found that trying to party up with some friends wasn't possible. In the last 3 months I've had to restart it and the modem at least 20 times because the connection slows. Now I am researching to buy a different one because there are just too many little things that give me problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back after 5 days of misery...","review":"Definitely has potential, but \\"N\\" technology isn't quite there yet. Installation and setup were a breeze, no problems whatsoever. In fact, the simpliest of the 3 routers I have ever owned. My problem was that I could not get my Belkin N1 wireless card to connect at any speed greater than 54Mbps. Calls to tech support were useless as they told me that I should be happy with 54Mbps. I have two cards one could connect at 300Mbps, one only at 54Mbps. The big problem with this router came with interference from my cordless home telephone. Anytime I answered the phone I would instantly lose the router connection. No matter what channel I set the router or phone on it was no good. Again, tech support could offer me nothing. By the way, tech support does not speak English very well. I boxed up all the Belkin merchandise and returned it. Hope you have better luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belkin N - Don't Set High Expectations","review":"I had high hopes that the Belkin N would be better than my Linksys Wireless G (with SRX) access point, and I was disappointed.

This did nothing for my configuration.Obtusive advanced set up screen. It does the job, but why make it so difficult?Overall, I would have kept this unit, but the dropped connections and intermittent signal strength (bouncing from excellent to good and from 54mps to 1mps was too annoying.

The Logan Inn was the first haunted site I ever researched (for a school newspaper article), I've done the ghost tours bit, and been in a lot of the sites on this show. The show though is badly done. Its format is very flat and uninteresting. Like far to many amateurs they obsess over orbs (which are hands down the least interesting and most easily explained of all \\"psychic\\" photography) and some of there other pictures are questionable as well.

If she's psychic, I'm the Queen of England! I give it 2 stars because I did enjoy the interviews with the \\"normal\\" residents of New Hope, and with the music used throughout the documentary, especially the closing track \\"Her\\" by Claire Voyant.

However, it couldn't really be longer I suppose because it was written by someone else (Icek's son) from the memories of Icek. It's narrated in a straightforward, almost detached manner (the reason for this tone is explained by his son in the introduction, and makes sense.) Many of the events related are horrific, but not surprising given what we know about the holocaust. Several photos are included as well. As a result of reading this, I will probably add a visit to the Holocaust Museum to my bucket list."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, but the ebook has problems","review":"The classic 1872 narrative poem celebrating the disappearing gaucho way of life.

The Kindle folks don't appear to have added any value for the price they are charging.The main problem is that the verse formatting disappears after the first few pages; stanzas are run on as paragraphs. I find myself reading more slowly, looking for the rhymes and counting syllables to \\"hear\\" the lines of verse that aren't visible on the screen.

The 30S has lost virutally everything I found useful (RPN, all the valuable probability distribution stuff) and has limited functionality in most other areas. What it has got is 3 different color face plates (what? do they think it's a cell phone?) and the virually useless ability to calculate means, standard deviations, and correlation coefficients (why would anyone waste time inputing a bunch of data into a calculator when they could save it in a spreadsheet file?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Crap-Ola!","review":"Maybe this works great for other disciplines, but for engineering/surveying it is darn near worthless.Unfortunately, this is one of only 6 or 7 cheapo calculators (including the HP 33s--another piece of garbage) allowed for use on the liscensing exams.

This is amusing stuff, with the songs being performed in the styles of different stars of yesteryear. For instance, the title song(s) is played in the style of the Coasters, \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" is played in the manner of Johnny Mathis, \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\\" is performed like Jerry Lee Lewis and so on.

So if you are having trouble with the editing, check out that version and it will probably be cleared up. I am a psych major at college, so maybe I get into this kind of movie more than others, but I loved this movie. It is about four friends who are involved in a terrible car crash. The movie revolves around Cassie, who tries to come to terms withbeing the one driving during the crash. She feels survivor guilt and she tries to figure out what really happened following the accident. I thought this movie was very clever and I feel that it did not get the recognition it deserved due to delays in release dates. I also thought the movie had a fantastic ending.

I don't understand why there are so many CATHOLIC GUILT horror films that mix religious faith with horror. Stuff like STIGMATA, and BLESS THE CHILD. Who writes these bogus horror movies? People who are trying to sneak catholic doctrine into horror movies? Most irritating trend ever if you ask me. Why can't horror films just be horror, like JEEPERS CREEPERS.

How could it miss? Well, SOUL SURVIVORS, while not a total bomb, just isn't all that engaging or exciting. Sort of a teen version of CARNIVAL OF SOULS or JACOB'S LADDER, the story simply can't stand up to these creep-out classics. The idea of life and death bleeding together is fascinating, but the story in SS isn't strong enough to make it work (a good example of this theme can be found in LEFT IN DARKNESS). Perhaps, if I hadn't seen CARNIVAL or LADDER, I could have enjoyed this one more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Plot Holes?","review":"This movie was OK. I'm still a little confused about the opening scene. It was really awful and then... nothing ever came of it. Two freaky raver guys commit a horrendous crime that seems to \\"mean\\" something. Throughout the movie they pop up to chase the main character. That opening scene is never explained or linked to anything else in the movie. I feel like they just threw it in to make the movie \\"scarier.\\" By the way, this film is not scary at all. It's more like a drama. Luke Wilson, a favorite of mine, was horribly miscast and his character was almost funny, it was so terrible. He did the best he could... but he was playing a dead priest. I, like many people, was drawn to the movie because of Eliza Dushku... and on the cover of the box she looks like the main character. But no, her part was small and random and odd and the movie was mostly about \\"Cassie\\" played by Melissa Sagemiller.

Then I saw Soul Survivors. It isn't as hackneyed and generic as Valentine, but it is really, really boring. I had trouble telling the two male leads apart, they both had exactly the same haircut, and no distinguishing features. The plot just went nowhere. After the hints that something sinister is going on start presenting themselves, the plot goes nowhere. There is no progression towards figuring out what is going on and reaching a conclusion, the plot just stagnates, with numerous sinister occurances that are never explained. Even at the end of the film, we get no closure. The question of whether the people pursuing the girl were real flesh and blood people, paranormal manifestations, or merely her own personal delusions, is never answered. That just adds to the weakness of the film though. Even if there was a conclusion, it would still be unwatchably dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star is still too high","review":"i never saw this movie at the theatres, but at 85 minutes, the additional material must not of amounted to much. and it sure doesn't. i like eliza dushku and bought the movie for that reason alone. the plot is muddled, acting fair, and not well-paced. the box advertises: more blood! more sex! more terror! well, there is very little of any of those. there are a lot of extras, but i don't know why someone would want 3 different motion menus. borrow or rent it before you buy. a subpar teen movie that is not worth the price. and if ya don't believe me, look at how many are for sale, used, and how cheap they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Parody Of I Know What You Did Last Summer","review":"This movie falls completely flat.

I was wrong. I'm not sure why I finished watching it, especially when I found out how [dumb] the ending is. There is not really much to tell about the non-existent plot, it took about 30 minutes for anything much to even happen. The opening scene has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Most of the time I was wondering why Wes Bentley, Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck were even in this. The DVD does have some features, a few deleted scenes. One of the deleted looks like it might be an alternate ending, which is somewhat of an improvement over what ended up in the actual movie.

I Don't Get It ????","review":"I have to say the beginning of Soul Survivors makes it seem like it's going to be packed with eerie images and spine-tingling effects. I couldn't have been farther from the truth.This movie, about four teenagers that were in a horrifying car wreck, seems to have little or no point at all. Just when you belive the movie is going to dazzle you, it fizzles out instead. It seems to have a slow building plot that never hits a climax. The main character, Cassie, Begins having all of these visions. Are these visions real or just a dream, we unfotunately don't find out until the very end. This movie was a disappointment in the fact that it just doesn't seem to have a point. Maybe it's me, but I just didn't see the story in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

But the skill level needed to craft one that isn't is considerable and The Illuminator generally fails that skill level. Not many readers, I conjecture, end its four hundred pages saying, \\"I just feel better having read this.\\"Its characters are one dimensional and generally fail to arouse our caring and concern.

A bit of subtlety would have gone a long way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing book","review":"Riddled with glaring historical errors this book reads more like a Harlquin romance. Fluffy and at times silly, it falls far short of the hype on the cover and its PR. Surprisingly, nowhere in the reviews or description of this book does it tell you that a central theme weaving through this amateurish tome is the suffering of the jews. The beautiful Illuminator incurred the loss of his noble title and lands because he married a Jewess. The union produces a lovely child, Rose, who is beauty and innocence herself. Against a backdrop of greedy, bloodthirsty Christians scheming and hurting each other, Rose and the noble christian son Colin weave a dewey romance complete with flower-strewn lute lessons in the wool house. The young romance leaves Rose pregnant, mingling christian and jewish blood... All of this makes you wonder how this author got published.... The jewish lesson seems to be the most valuable thing this book has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but tried too hard**Warning: contains spoilers!**","review":"I wanted very much to like this book.

It felt like she just kept adding to it, putting it aside and then she came back and added some more. She wound up digging herself into a hole where she had no other choice but to kill everyone off (or make you think she did).

I would have thought that a PhD in Library Sciences would have taught her the skills of researching. She has confused the 14th Century with the 16th Century. Her idea of period dress goes much better 200 years in the future with laced up bodices, skirts, \\"petticoats\\" and snoods. The middle-class land-owners, yeomen, have been reduced to paid servants. The \\"shilling\\" makes a surprising introduction about 100 years too early and Laudanum, a tincture of poppy (opium) is way out of place by 400 years (poppy was available, just not as laudanum). There are so many more inaccurate historical falsities that it was driving me crazy. I started keeping a list!

Other than Will Sanderson, the rest of the cast is really, really bad...especially the lead character of Jo. The movie seems to exist only to show off some buff bodies and watch them run throughout the building in slow mo; the director also liked using that filming the same shot from minutely different angles, for what purpose, only he can tell.

I would have prefered a matte finish option on the frames rather than gloss only. The lenses are incredible, the polarization quality and glare reduction surpass any other sunglasses I've seen.

Also, you can't keep the face in snarl mode, it reverts back to mild-mannered when you release the lever. Still... action figures with changeable expressions! Never seen something like that before.

The blurb on the box says that this is nothing about Haiku, or tunnels, but I think it is more about Haiku than not. Think about Haiku in terms of the smallness of the structure, a few short simple lines, used as a vehicle to say something that could have been done in a much bigger structure.

The jacket would lead you to believe you've found a funny & clever working place story, but more than likely you'll be waiting for humor to shoot into orbit, when in reality it simply sputters on the launching pad. The premise seems to hold validity as a funny scenario - successful temp becomes chaotic perm - but the writing and directing are a bit too amateurish to pull it all off. Josh Kornbluth is able to entertain, but only in spurts during the film. Some of it is very predictable, once you get going, and from there on you're waiting for something that just never happens. The only thing you'll be concentrating on is why the heck isn't he mailing the letters? The supporting cast does a very credible job, specifically the head secretary, the lawyer who Josh works for, and the female lawyer he trysts with. The rest is pretty much forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it up, Josh","review":"Don't expect another Office Space with this one.

Now don't get me wrong, it was highly enjoyable and entertaining. But it seemed to have broken the flow of everything. The disc itself is nice too, get a few trailers and a commentary as well as deleted scenes.

On the other hand, Halstead is spot on, but a bit mechanical sounding. The Hanover Band is quite rough around the edges and the continuo - to me - sounds like what I imagine the ancient water torture felt like: the constant plunk, plunk, plunk of the harpsichord is maddening. The 'cello plays the bass line, the double bass plays an octave below and the harpsichord sounds as though there is a 4' sounding a octave above.

So why does doesn't this recording do that? One can only wonder! Music was published in 16th century Italy in a convenient way but we know that larger forces were used when it was performed.The playing and singing on this disc is excellent and the instrumental works are particularly good.

Eric has always had me captivated in his live performances, and has never let me down with his Blues Prowess. Any situation I have seen E.C. in, he has always been able to rise to the occasion!

I'm a big fan of Clapton, but I really think this is his worst album. There is more organ than guitar in some songs. The \\"version 1\\" release of \\"Before you Accuse Me\\" sound like Lay Down Sally - nothing like than the high-power original track on Journayman. The whole first disc is a crossover between Lay Down Sally and the Michelobe Lite version of After Midnight. It doesn't get any livlier than than. I haven't had the heart to pop in disc 2 yet. If you're a blues fan or a classic Clapton fan this is a disapointment. Stick with from the cradle and be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Clapton newbabies","review":"If your new to the world of Blues or Eric Clapton, this is a good album to buy because 1. The songs are all classic Blues songs covered by Clapton 2. You get one CD thats studio blues and one thats live Blues 3. Clapton is a rock \\"god\\" who uses the Blues to showcase his amazing talent with the gutair and at the same time express himself as an artist. If, however, you already own all of Claptons previous efforts or compilations (Cross Roads 2, ect. ) then you may want to save your money and buy his latest effort Riding With The King (anohter excellent Blues effort). Otherwise this is a very exceptional Bluse album (plus one CD of live, un edited Blues). Life and music, don't get any better than this!

The 50\\" tv is only two years old and is seldom used so the cost per viewing hour is already way too high.I have owned GE and RCA TVs in the past and never had the problems I am having with the Samsung TVs.

Whenever she starts to get upset, I just put this in front of her and she will look up at me and smile and start playing with it immediately.The music selection is really good and the feature that allows you to turn on just one instrument or all of them will help the baby learn to distinguish sounds as s/he grows up. The cushioned corners are very nice as well because our daughter has now started trying to lift it and sometimes puts the corners in her mouth, so I am glad they are not sharp. It's also pretty durable, as she's rolling it and likes to bang her teething toys on the edges and it hasn't shown any adverse affects yet.I highly recommend this to anyone with babies or toddlers. My daughter is only 6mo right now and she's in love with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"They weren't impressed","review":"I worked in the church nursery for over 4 years with this toy in one of the toyboxes available to the children. I never saw any of them properly engage with it. They'd pull it out, bang it a couple of times (starting up 2 different sounds) and then get bored and crawl away. It was the one toy I knew I'd never buy for my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPENSIVE AND POORLY MADE","review":"This cube is quite large and heavy for the age group that it is marketed at. The end result is, it will fall out of those little chubby hands. But apparently Munchkin never thought of that because ours broke after our daughter dropped it a few times. She didn't drop it out of her high chair or anything, she just dropped it while playing with it on the floor. What a waste of money. I strongly suggest avoiding this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited to get this for my 1yo, and it is a great toy... My 1yo & 3yo love it. BUT it has an issue with batteries! When it arrived (with included batteries in a \\"try me\\" box), the batteries were dead. It's not being played with at a rate that warrants having to change the batteries once or twice a week. When it begins getting low on power, the music sounds warped, like an old warped record, which is dreadful! Perhaps we got a defective one. I don't know. I hope this isn't happening to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic toy","review":"We got an older version of this toy from my sister (whose kids had it when they were little) when my 4 year old daughter was born. She loved the toy then and now loves playing with it with her baby brother. She is now into the specific instruments and has said she wants to learn how to play them. Love this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite purchase","review":"This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild. She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.This is an excellent choice for a baby gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son's favorite toy!","review":"This toy is our son's favorite! I like the different musical options it has, and the very nicely rounded corners. It lights up but not in a super-fast, annoying way that so many baby toys do. It's very solid (has been dropped on the floor many times) and an overall quality toy. Two thumbs way up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver!!","review":"This item has been a life saver for me! Not only does my child love it but it's the only thing I can distract him with while dressing him (he apparently HATES putting sweaters on). I can hit one of the sides and instantly get flashing lights and music while I try to squeeze a sweater over my child's head. My child loves it because it's easy for him to hit and acheive the same flashing lights and music. The music is good and there are a lot of different choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite toy","review":"My 1 year old Loves this music box. She plays the songs over and over and dances along with them. I like it because it has lots of variety, and doesn't play only one annoying song like many toys do. It is actually music, not just silly sound effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Played With","review":"This was a Christmas present for my 9 month old. 8 months later it stays tucked in the toybox never to be played with. Maybe this would be better for a really young baby? He plays with it for about 5 seconds then gets bored. My 3 year old was never interested in it. The music is pleasant, and it is durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overstimulating","review":"I appreciate the idea behind this musical toy, but it's absolutely FRENETIC. Talk about toys creating passive, overstimulated babies...this is a prototype. The quality of the sound is great, but to have the lights flashing in a strobe-like fashion certainly makes my baby look away immediately. I can't stand it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical and fun","review":"My one year old loved this toy and explored pushing all of the colors and sounds. She swayed with the music and loved looking at the lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst toy ever!","review":"Most loud toys don't bother me... this one is the WORST toy ever. It's so loud (no volume switch-- at least on my model) and it doesn't stop. It ended up getting put away for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and fun","review":"This product is interesting and fun for my 7 months old twins. I'm sure they will grow to understand it and love it even further in the future.The only drawback I see is that the quality of sound is not great, and the instruments sound more like simulated electronic sound than the real sound of the instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best toy","review":"We received this toy as a gift when my daughter was 10 mos. old. She's 2.5 yrs. now and STILL plays with it and laughs out loud. GREAT GREAT GREAT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Loves It","review":"I bought this toy for my grandson last Xmas when he was 4 months old. His mom and dad told me he absolutely loves it. I thought they were just trying to make me feel good but sure enough when I went to see them for a visit I found this was, in fact, his favorite toy. He will soon be a year old and still loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, there IS a design flaw - the kids LOVE the toy though","review":"Aha! It wasn't just us! It was interesting to see that we weren't the only ones who had the battery cover break - it's weak right there where the batteries are pushing against it.We got a replacement battery cover for free, too, but guess what - It's breaking again!! I'm upset about that because the kids really love it a lot but I need to call for a replacement piece again...here's some advice, if you get the toy, call Munchkin right away and request a couple (or more) covers, because chances are extremely good that it will break there, and more than once! I tried superglue but that doesn't work.I do agree with the reviewer who said the violin sounds flat, but I don't think it's that bad. All 3 of my boys (ages 1, 3, & 8) enjoy it a lot, but it's put away right now because when that cover breaks, it's sharp - be careful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby boy loves it!","review":"I rarely write any review but I would give this toy a five star! I bought this cube three months ago when my boy was five month old. At first, he was not too interetested but one month later, he started to really like it! The music is classic, unlike common silly songs. And the corners are round so it's pretty safe. He touches and kicks the cube and now this is one of his most favorate toy! Would recommand to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 month old loved it!","review":"I know it says that this is for older babies but my daughter loves looking at the blinking lights and listening to the music. A piece of advice: it took me a little while to figure out that you had to press the orchestra button a few times to change the song. Before I figured this out, the same song was driving me crazy! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does not have a volume control button. It is quite loud and I sometimes wish I can make it lower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom of active boy","review":"our son loves anything that plays music and when we heard about this toy we went out and bought it. He was 15 months old then and didn't seem to like it. He pushed the buttons afew times but mainly it just sat. I bring it out every couple of weeks to show him how neat it is and it still does nothing for him. He is now 21 months old. He loves the leap frog drum and the phonics radio. ANd they were only 19.99 each not 34.99.I wouldn't spend your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy","review":"I second the other reviewers who warn that this is a cheaped out version of the original Embryonics toy. I got this toy and while it is a great idea, the sound is so bad and OUT OF TUNE that I just couldn't let my kids play with it. After reading the reviews saying that the old Embryonics version was better, I got one on ebay and in fact it was. Shame on Munchkin for taking a great toy, ruining it, and then riding on the coattails of the original toy. What's more, when I called the company, they just told me to send it back at my own expense and denied that they had changed the innards of the toy. But I played it and the original one right after the other and the difference is obvious, and huge. Scary when a company that makes items for babies lies to you. I would have given zero stars if I could. I will never buy a Munchkin product again. Trust is everything in the baby business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy even for younger kids","review":"We got this when our babies were 6 months old and they have loved it from day one. They love the lights and music and now that they are older (8 months), they are able to press it to turn the music and lights on and off. The recommended age is 1 year but I think that is a little old EXCEPT you have to be very careful when your kids are learning to stand that you don't have it near them. If they fall near it, it could hurt a little until they are old enough to control their standing and walking. I definitely recommend this. I don't even tire of the music which is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not interested","review":"Our three year old got this as a gift when she was a year old and never really liked it. We thought it was because she never liked electronic toys, much preferring to play with music toys in which she made the music (like the Little Tikes instruments.) Our one year old had always loved musical electronic toys, but she doesn't like it either.Oddly enough, when we tried to change the batteries (the first time after about 2 1/2 years) the battery compartment broke and we had to throw it out anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty pretty pretty good","review":"The product is very fun for my daughter of 12 months, but the sound is so electronic that all of the selective instruments sound kind of the same. How hard would it have been to have actual recordings of instruments? I guess they don't have actual instruments in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it!","review":"My 11 month old grandson loved this toy -- dances to it with smiles all over. His big brother (9) wants to play with it too, having a greater understanding of the instruments. Their dad, 39, liked the option of adding or subtracting instruments from the mix. Good tunes, good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart Cube","review":"I purchased the Mozart Cube on the recommendation of my friend who has two small grandchildren. She told me the features of the cube, and being a music lover, especially classical music, I thought my 8 month old granddaughter would enjoy the cube. It was suppose to be a Christmas present, however, my children showed up with the baby before Christmas. She was being a bit fussy and so I gave her the Mozart Cube. She loved it! She enjoyed the music, being able to push the buttons that trigger the musical instruments and was fascinated with the lights. The cube is great and the price of the cube is remarkably inexpensive for what pleasure and enjoyment she has already gotten from it. My children decided the cube is to stay at my house and so the Mozart Cube will always be a source of entertainment for my granddaughter. I highly recommmend this for younger children as multiple senses are stimulated.Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classical Music... Great OFF SWTICH!","review":"My husband, son and I all LOVE this toy. My niece had it before, so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already. I love that he (1 year old) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him. He loves that it all lights up (when the buttons on any side are pressed) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes (pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song). An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an \\"off\\" switch. :) SO key, even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great, fun toy. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"My 7 month old likes the cube. It took her a little while to figure it out but she likes it now. I can sit it near her and she will reach for it so she can play."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was a Volume switch, it would be perfect......","review":"My children (an infant and a preschooler) like this toy--but it is WAY too loud. I wish there was a way to turn the volume down. I'd return this if I purchased it at a store, but it's too much of a hassle to return this to amazon. So sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Fun Toy for Infant","review":"This toy definitely keeps my 7 month old entertained. The flashing lights are very attractive. Though I have to say, the sound quality is just so-so, but at least there is enough sounds/songs on there that it does not repeat very often and becomes annoying, so that's all that matters. I have to say the toy itself is a bit heavy. My son likes to grab hold of it while rolling around and sometimes he drops it on himself and cry..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for infants","review":"I gave this as a gift to a friend with a 3 month old baby. She has told me that it is great, the lights and sounds really engage her. When playing with this toy, it was the first time she tried to move her feet to hit a toy to make it start again. My friend is thrilled with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So loud!","review":"I bought this toy on the recommendation of a blog. I wish I had read some of the bad reviews first. First off- my baby does like this toy a lot and it is the perfect height for him to lean on while learning how to sit. The problem is the non-adjustable volume. Considering this is a toy for a baby who has tiny sensitive ears, the volume is way too loud. It's too loud for an adult product. I can hear it well from a different floor in the house. My son can ruin his hearing on his own when he's a teenager- I'm not going to do it for him with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A favorite of our son ...","review":"Purchased the Mozart Magic Cube for our 1 year old son who loves to sit and play with it for extended periods. As a boy, he is rough on his toys and this one has taken a beating. The edge piece that has the on/off switch and battery compartment has now cracked and is starting to fail. Since our son likes it so much, may have to consider replacing it with a new one soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it!","review":"My 15-month-old loves this music box. It's durable, too, which means Mom loves it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring toy","review":"My daughter got this for Christmas when she was about 6 mos old. She rarely ever plays with it. She was slightly amused with this toy for a month or two. She never plays with it now. When she did show interest in it, it only lasted a few moments. The music does get a little annoying because my daughter liked it when all instruments would play at the same time. Nothing special about this toy and it's loud. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"toy for the tone deaf","review":"I knew this thing wouldnt sound very good, I can accept that. Most all of these kind of toys sound like crap. What gets me is the violin is badly out of tune with the other insturments. Many a sour note. My son holds his ears when it plays all the insturments together. Otherwise its another piece of plastic that makes noise and passes the time. What do you expect for 20 bucks? Want to get your child into music? Get them a harmonica. My son plays all the time and passes on the cube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screechy Sounds, does not keep son amused","review":"My son is now just over a year and has had this toy for about 6 months. I bought this because he loved the baby einstein take along tunes toy and thought this would be similar type music and activity. The sound is horrible! Every instrument sound is extremely screechy. I am not sure if I just have a bad product, but I feel like I wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality and tough","review":"Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months. He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him. He now plays it himself (13 months). I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come. The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys. It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument. That is pretty neat. Baby likes it. The only problem is that there is no volume control. Batteries last a pretty long time in it. The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting. It seems really tough. It has withstood some hard knocks. It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries. The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery. It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for 1 year old","review":"bought this for my niece's first birthday - she loves it, as do her parents. The melodies are all pleasing to the ear, so it's hours of entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid loves it but poor sound","review":"I got it based on reviews and I am glad I did. My now-7-month-old son likes it though not as much as another musical toy. The only downside of this toy as far as I can see - which was also pointed out by other reviewers - is that sound is very unnatural - I was surprised even though I was expecting it. Think of an old cell phone with musical ringer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Music Cube Rocks!","review":"We took this toy with us on a cross country trip with our 17 month old daughter. It entertained her both day and night. The evenings were lit up from the backseat as the music played on. Since then, we have had 2 more kids. The music cube has entertained them at all ages and still delights my daughter who is now 3 1/2 yrs. We actually keep this toy in the car because it keeps the kids quiet and entertained. The music can get old to mom and dad, but you can't go wrong teaching you child about classical music and instruments. Our daughter knows which instruments make what sounds and what they all look like. It is by far the best family toy we have owned! I encourage you to purchase this toy early on so it can be enjoyed for many years. One small part did crack, where the battery goes, and the company replaced it imediately (within days of notification by email.) Great toy! Great Company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube","review":"Have purchased this product a few years back and gave it as gifts to many babies. Now, however it is made by a different manufacturer than the original one and the sound is horrible, especially considering the price is not cheap. I noticed other reviewers felt the same way. The sound quality was so bad (and I am not a music geek so my standards were not unreasonable) that I could not give it as a gift without extreme embarrassment. None of the instruments sounded clear, but rather very tinny and CHEAP! What a shame. This used to be a fantastic product. I'll never purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality toy.

It is NOT SAFE for toddlers and babys to play with. DO NOT BUY!!! Fire Hazard !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud, not interesting","review":"Based on the mostly positive feedback, I purchased this cube as a birthday present for my son's first birthday. He's not even slightly interested in the sound; my 4-year old pushed the buttons a few times, but complains that it's much too loud - unfortunately you can't control the volume. It really is too loud. The 1-year old pushed the buttons twice, and got very close in order to look at the blinking light, but that's it. The sound quality is also not the greatest, but it is a children's toy, so I didn't really expect it to be any better. So, neither one of my children plays with it or is actually interested in it, and the biggest drawback is the lack of volume control, since the toy is way too loud. I'm seriously considering returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"This toy would be good if it were built to last. The touch pads that play the music when compressed are held in place by a tiny cheap piece of plastic. After only using the product a few times, one of the music cube coverings broke off. We also have carpeting (not hardwood floors), so you can imagine how flimsy this is built to break on carpet.Very disappointed! ... and Amazon's return/exchange policy is terrible!!Buyer beware on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart Cube is a favorite of my grandson","review":"My grand son has over 1,500 pieces of toys; mostly small die cast hot wheels but almost every single day since I gave him the Mozart Cube for Christmas, he's always playing a tune on it. This is a great way to get your kids acclimated to the real classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Musical Fun","review":"This is something that gets alot of use. The combination of the varitey of instruments keeps things changing enough so that it is not too diffuclt to listen to for longer periods of time than some other musical toys.The mixing and matching of the various instruments was something that was fun to see as the assoication of how to get different instruments playing was beginning to be understood.Stood up well to alot of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the original one!","review":"I am so glad I read the reviews and purchased the original Embryonics one instead of the one made by Munchkin. The sound difference is amazing. I've heard the Munchkin one play in person and it sounds like it is dying and about to run out of batteries. Seriously save yourself some money and buy an original one (even if it's used). I got mine on ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved by our twins, but easily broken!","review":"I wish I could give this cube 5 stars! If it were based on how much our twins adored the toy, I would definitely give it a better rating! However, I feel the need to mention that we initially purchased this toy for our 6+ mos old twins and within a few months the battery cover cracked right next to the on/off switch, leaving the batteries easily accessible. Duct tape would not even keep the cover on securely, because the cover was under so much pressure from the batteries and springs underneath.When our twins were 1 1/2 we decided to put it on the Christmas wish list, because they both adored the first one so much. Much to our dismay, the exact same thing happened to the battery cover of the second one!What a huge disappointment! Obviously this toy has a manufacturing defect and I can only hope that Munchkin fixes it for future production of the toy. The concept is excellent and our twins really did love it, especially our very musical little girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I purchased this over a year ago for my first grandson.

Super expensive for the piece of crap it is. The sound is simply HORRENDOUS. It's so out of tune it hurts! And so LOUD!! There's no lower volume setting. But it's not just me who hates it.

She wasn't interested in it right away (I had more fun playing with it than she did) but around 18 mos. it caught her interest. It's endlessly durable and the music quality is good. One bad thing is there is no volume control, just off and on. Also, it plays about 10 different melodies but doesn't always cycle through depending on which musical instrument you press. When operated by a toddler, you tend to hear the first song over and over and over and over.... The best part is that older kids can enjoy it too. Now that she's 4, my daughter can still have fun playing with it, changing and adding instruments to get different sounds. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my son","review":"It's neat but my 18 month old son doesn't like it much. He actually sometimes complains about it and wants me to just turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and sturdy","review":"This is bright, sturdy and has great music. It's a nice concept - conducting your own symphony, so to speak. It has not maintained my one year old daughter's attention for very long, but that may be because it was a Christmas present and there are other things that she is more interested in right now. I love the rubber balls on the corners and the bright colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"The product is not as wonderful as I thought it was going to be. My son got tired of it very quickly. There is something about it that is simply lacking in entertainment value. Its very interesting the way the cube can isolate each particular instrument sound so that you can hear the songs played either with just a flute or the whole orchastra but my son who is just learning to appreciate music in general is not at all interested in that yet. Also, it doesn't play very many songs. You would think something called the \\"Mozart Cube\\" would have a selection of Mozart."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLY OUT OF KEY!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I had high expectations of this toy given the reviews here. Much to my disappointment, many of the instruments are notably out of tune, making it exquisitely unpleasant for anyone who has even a remotely musical ear. It is certainly not good for babies to be repeatedly bombarded with horribly off-pitch music. It is like nails on a chalkboard. Great idea - bad execution. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the young","review":"We bought this for our 4 month old daughter because she enjoys music; we then tried to pass it on to our 1 year old niece but she wasn't impressed either. The recommended age group is 0-6 years old and that's too big of a gap. The parents enjoyed it more than the kids. I would think that it should be for an older child, say 3 or 4 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice while it lasted","review":"This toy stopped working as our child was starting to enjoy it.

The only issue is that one day it just caught fire. They were not at home, when they arrived the fire alarm was going like crazy, and smoke all over the house. The toy was completely melted and it left a square hole in the table. It was the only thing on the table so definitely the source of the fire was the toy. They were lucky that the table didn't caught fire... otherwise it could have been a complete disaster. They had to leave the house for 2 days until the smoke and plastic smell was completely gone.I would never but this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balanced Review","review":"Well, we received the Cube in a battered box and found that the device functioned marginally. The carrier may have dropped a piano on it or something. It appears to be an adequate toy but far too expensive. The sound / instrument quality is actually quite good. The build, design and aesthetics are so so, but again, the expense is unjustifiable. We will be returning ours because of its condition (one button remains constantly depressed and no sound comes from it unless rattled vigorously). The damaged goods status gives us a good reason to return this sub par, high cost toy. There are alternatives out there for a better return on your toy budgetary investments."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed mom","review":"i bought this toy for my two handicapped sons who love music(unfortunately not from amazon)while on a trip to the states . when we got home and tried it the toy didn't work at all, we have never even gotten one sound out of it. we emailed embryonics several times and they never replied, so naturally neither we nor my sons are impressed by this toy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service makes this product a DO NOT buy.","review":"We were given this product for a gift - from our wishlist - for our, at the time, 12 month old daughter. She loved it, and carried it around everywhere. One day, she dropped it. She was 29 inches tall. It was in her hands and fell no more than 15 inches. It broke. Saddened, we contacted the CS department to see about getting it fixed. We were told too bad - it fell.So, basically, a toy made for young children can't fall any distance, and was not under a warranty because of the fall and would not be fixed. Therefore, I will never buy anything from this unrealistic company again.

The 3 year old has a ton of toys and this toy simply doesn't match up. I suppose if you only have one toy, kids might play with it; otherwise don't waste your time. The buttons are not easy to push and the music is boring. Sounded like a great concept, but was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative!","review":"I bought this music cube because of the high ratings on it. I didn't expect much because it didn't look like it could do much. Our 1 year old doesn't really spend hours playing wtht the music cube but it is creative. It plays different instuments. One instrument can be played or all of them together which is neat. The music is soothing and not loud and annoying. The cube is very durable so it can be dropped many times and still play. Oh, the colors light up too, but hard to see in daylight. I still recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game cube is fair for price","review":"I liked this for my 6 month old son because it plays music and lights up. You can also press a couple of the buttons together or seperate and it plays together. It's neat and my son enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube","review":"This is another favorite toy of my grandson's. I hope that he picks up an appreciation for the wonderful music it provides. It is a safe toy with no sharp edges and is easy for Brian to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging from Hell","review":"There are a number of stiff plastic wires connecting the toy to its packaging that are extremely difficult to remove. I'd recommend against buying this for that reason alone. Not suitable for use by a child until they've been carefully pried out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold Your Ears","review":"This toy while interesting in its approach to presenting the sound of various instruments, is annoyingly loud. Unfortunately there is no volume control, so you either listen to it at full volume or not at all. Sorry I bought it. Also the size of the cube it rather large for a young child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like the batteries are dying even though they're not","review":"My daughter played with an Embryonics version of this toy and she really liked it. The sound was great and it was entertaining. I decided to order one since she enjoyed it so much and I found that there is a HUGE difference between the original version and the one they sell now. I had read the reviews on Amazon about the poor sound quality and I thought \\"how bad could it really be?\\" It's AWFUL. It is so out of tune that the batteries sound like they're dying even though they're not. I returned it immediately. If you can find an original Embryonics Mozart cube, get that instead as it is far superior to the Munchkin version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made battery cover and on/off switch make this difficult to recommend","review":"The cube has a poorly made on/off switch and is placed too close to the edge of the battery cover. The battery cover is also poorly made and breaks easily. The batteries it came with were dead on arrival. The wires attaching the cube to the packaging were difficult to remove and required pliers. Other than that, it seems like a fun toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this sorry imitation!","review":"you can tell by the review dated 11 years ago what the quality had to have been when it was first issued by Embryonics, and probably the reason people keep buying it (like me). This is a cheesy fake. Harsh, tinny and way-too-loud sounds don't even resemble the instruments they are supposed to represent, and they all sound alike. I bought this for a baby gift but I have a feeling the parents are not going to appreciate it or let their baby have it on more than a couple minutes at a time because it is about as irritating as fingernails on a blackboard. It wouldn't be quite as bad if it had a volume control to turn it way down but one song will be anyone's limit. I guess they can remove the batteries and let it be a VERY expensive block toy! SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging FAIL","review":"Sad that I had to to go Amazon reviews to figure out how to get the wires out of the cube. Used some pliers but as I pulled the wires out some of the plastic casing around the wires was stripped off and will forever be entombed within this God-forsaken cube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too loud","review":"My baby daughter got this as a gift. I thought it sounded terrible and it scared her. I might have hung onto it to see if she would grow into it, if it weren't so loud. It's so loud, I was worried it would damage her hearing while she was holding it close enough to play with it. I returned it, and bought her aLamaze Mortimer the Moose, which she loves. It makes nice jingling, crinkling, and squeaking sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super loud","review":"Got this as a gift and love the idea but it is poorly executed. It is super loud, there is no volume control and it is glitchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my 17 month old","review":"My daughter loves music and this a sturdy toy she will play with for awhile. It's interactive enough and actually has good melodies that are beyond the typical toddler stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh. . .","review":"Purchased this because my 16 month old son loves music and this product has amazing reviews. Gave it to my son for Christmas and he is completely uninterested in it. . . I am disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemed to Love It","review":"Bought this for a 6-month old pseudo-niece as a Christmas gift. In the two or so hours she had the gift she seemed completely engrossed in the toy and entertained. She had no issue comprehending what to do with it and was playing within a minute of first touching the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good toy but loud","review":"Why can't manufacturers put a volume control on all toys or at least err on the side of being too quiet? this toy is a great concept and plays great music, looks great, but is too loud. espeically when my baby is playing with it right next to their ear.Unfortunately many other toys are too loud too, so this one is probably worth recommending to friends/family. but it could be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the little music lover","review":"My 17 month old daughter loves music. This cube is perfect for her. The large squares are easy for her to push, she spends 30-60 minutes at a time dancing to the music. She loves that she can choose what she wants to hear. As she has gotten older I notice she is selecting some instruments more than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not built to last","review":"We're on our second one -- the first didn't work out of the box (which would have been a letdown for a child older than our toddler son). The replacement worked fine and has generally been a source of delight for our family (dad loves playing it, too!). For mom and dad, though, this toy has become a disappointment. The manufacturer has tried really hard to make this a tough toy and we salute them for that. But after little more than a year, one button has died and the toy has a tendency to decide it \\"doesn't feel like playing today\\" even with brand-new batteries. Yes, toys wear out. But for the steep price, we expected much more. In short: A great musical / educational toy, but not built to last. Not a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd call music","review":"I found this item to be very disappointing. For one thing it's much too large and heavy for a baby to pick up and handle, although it may just be that my baby is too young for this toy at 7 months. The real issue I have with this toy is that the sounds it makes are just horrible. Off key, electrical sounding \\"music\\" is layered together to create a loud, jumbled, unpleasant sound that makes me want tear my hair out. This is not the learning toy I expected, coming from a family of musicians I'm going to say that this toy offers absolutely nothing for a child's musical development. If you want your child to have a love and understanding of music, listen to classical, jazz or other complex music with them. If you want a toy that will benefit your child musically, give them a xylophone to play with. It's simple and fun, and will always produce a perfect tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - so does not deserve 5 stars!","review":"I don't usually review items on Amazon - mostly because I agree with the star system that is in place. This item had quite a discrepancy between the stars received and how few I would give it.As many people have mentioned, you really need to be tone deaf to enjoy this cube. I thought the others complaining about the off-tune music were just music snobs that had a fun time at \\"band camp\\" - but this isn't true! I'm about as forgiving as possible when it comes to kids toys (and didn't go to \\"band camp\\"), but I found myself replacing the batteries trying to make it sound better.There is some kind of tone shift mid-note that I would only expect from a product that is out power. Do yourself a favor and find something else. I give it two stars mostly because as a cube it keeps my 11 month old occupied for a few minutes a day without breaking into small choke-hazard pieces. That's where the praise stops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for baby (and adults)","review":"I purchased this as Christmas gift for 6-month-old granddaughter. After we opened it, all the adults wanted to play with it too! Great way to introduce baby to the works of Mozart."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple and perfect!","review":"my 8 month old love this toy! ..... the music is wonderful .... and sounds great! best to put the cube on the floor for your baby to sit up and play. this is great gift for any reason..... the only thing i would want to see improvement in. is to make the volume adjustable, which it's only on one level loud ..... i don't mind it...... my husband tends to yell back at it .... and i sit and laugh !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHat is wrong with the quality??","review":"I bought this cube for my 14 month old daughter and was really excited for her to play with, as she loves music. This cube stopped working withing a week! and did not work even after i changed the battery. Oh, it gets better..the return for this product is just 5 days from the day it ships! I think the company knows the crappy product it is manufacturing and wants to cover all its bases. Really a shame..as the product is really nice...the quality and the return policy must be improved. It is putting me of against all the munchkins products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon Rocks!","review":"As well as this being a review for this totally awesome toy I also just want to say just how much Amazon Prime rocks! I recently moved to a different state and it's been though missing important occasions well Amazon made it possible for me to send a great gift for a friends daughter's first birthday and they even did the wrapping too! I order it on a Tuesday afternoon and it was delivered before lunch on Wednesday and this was just with the standard prime shipping. Both mother and daughter love the Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube. The child loves to dance to the music and her mom says it isn't annoying like some toys can be.

The cube entertains babies and introduces toddlers to the music of Mozart. It also teaches cause and effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Fun!","review":"We absolutely LOVE this cube! I bought it for my 5m nephew...and although he can't quite sit up on his own yet, it is still an entertainer for him. Anytime we want to distract him, we start up the magic cube! The sounds are good (not annoying) and becos you can add and subtract any \\"instrument\\", it is not boring. I do wish the lights were brighter and more visual, but this is becod the cube itself is so colorful. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, wonderful toy :-)","review":"My baby loves music and lights and this toy is a perfect combination. This keeps my baby entertained with music for quite some time. He loves that he can move the cube in his hands without any help from Mom. The buttons to activate the music and light are also easy to push. He will stare, fascinated at the lights and sound. If you want your child to appreciate music, this is a fantasic toy. This is my favorite toy for my son and I find it to be priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant toy","review":"Our son received this cube as a gift when he was 8 months old, and instantly loved it. He is now 13 months old and still loves this cube. The instruments sound crisp and clear, and the symphony feature is amazing. Every Mom who has been at our house loves this toy. I highly recommend the Mozart Cube for its entertainment value and for its introduction of different classical music instruments. Brilliant idea, Munchkin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greaat for babies of all ages!","review":"We bought this last year for Christmas for our (then) 18-month-old. She loved it, but the real surprise was last month when our 10-month-old discovered it. To say he loved it would be a real understatement!! He loves to crawl around after it and will play with it for 30 minutes at a time--amazing for a baby to play with something for that long.The music is a pleasure to listen to, especially compared with most musical baby toys. Like the other reviewers, I would have liked the addition of a volume control, but otherwise this toy is perfect. The batteries even seem to last a very long time. I was amazed that my 2-1/2 year old and 10-month-old can be mesmerized by the same toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest quality sound I've ever heard","review":"Length:: 2:32 MinsWe purchased this item both for our daughter and as a gift. The construction is rock hard plastic and a sound quality that would embarrass a monkey with a hurdy-gurdy. Please listen to the sound 'quality' before you decide to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY - build quality has changed!","review":"Please save your money and don't buy this product. The majority of good reviews were made long ago when this toy actually had decent build quality. The model that's been shipping since 2009 is questionable at best. My toddler played with it only a few times before it stopped working. We've received zero help from manufacturer. It's unfortunate they switched to cheaper components as this was a promising toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"While it may not have the amazing sound quality that the original toy does, you still can't find anything like it on the market. It plays eight different Mozart compositions, and allows your kid to add or remove instruments, or play with the instruments alone.The only complaint I have is that it doesn't play each song for long enough to really mess with the instruments effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although our special needs grandchild can hit the squares to produce music and puts his ear to the cube, the sounds are poor. We thought the batteries were weak but replacements did not change the sound. Sorry we did not return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't consider it a top toy","review":"I often see the music cube listed as a top toy for a 1 year old so it was on my child's birthday list.

The cube was dropped on the side with the battery door and now the door is busted and will not play. This happened one other time and I ordered a new door from the company via the internet. I failed to keep record of the address. HELP!! Who knows how to contact the company?

The intonation and distortion are just nasty, and no one of any age should have to be subjected to it. It's really too bad, because conceptually the toy is a good idea. But the violin is really flat, and sounds particularly awful when played along with the flute.I also think it's sad that a music teacher mentioned in one of the other reviews gave this as a gift. It illustrates the state of music education in America.If you want to buy your child something good, buy CDs of Mozart and real instruments to play along with it -- maracas, drums, whatever. Even if an electronic instrument is in tune, it's much more passive than something physical, natural, and acoustic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid wires mar otherwise good product","review":"Shows different musical instruments so baby can experience either each instrument on its own or combined with others. However munchkin did a bad job with packaging using wires to secure box to package. Wires are attached to internal part of cube and not possible to remove. Had to cut, could not pull out so had to push remnant wire into cube. One wire got stuck and may poke my child. Think will throw the cube away as it is a safety hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"music?","review":"The musical sounds don't sound like the real instruments, they just sound like a cheap toy. Also, I thought each instrument would play its own melody, how it would in a real orchestra. For example, the horn would play the background, the flute a lighter melody, then all the instruments would combine to create the true melody when the orchestra button is pressed. But really, each button plays exactly the same notes except with a different instrument. I was really disappointed, and my daughter prefers the music buttons from her Tiny Love Activity Center. The ones on that toy are really neat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this toy","review":"I was so surprised to read other reviews of this toy. My 16 month old daughter has been playing with it every day for the past 10 months. We take it everywhere, have bought it as a gift and have recommended it to everyone we know. I often say that I could throw away just about every other toy in the house, but not this one. We are very happy with the sound and have had no problems at all with durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music doesn't synch","review":"I was disappointed in this toy.

My 16-month-old received this toy as a gift from my mother-in-law and of course loved it - the one time my husband and I let him play with it. What parent needs to lose his or her sanity over a toy? ...Whereas some musical toys have volume control or only play for few seconds, the Mozart Magic Cube blares at one solitary volume level and plays the ENTIRE sonata before it shuts off. It's like the Energizer Bunny: it keeps going and going and going and . . . .... . . . Heed my warning...buy a board book about musical instruments and a Baby Mozart tape instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"We purchased the Mozart Magic Cube for our third daughter's second birthday. Our other children had one which has since worn out with use. Munchkin has purchased the rights to this toy from another company and it is completely lacking in the quality of the original toy. The original version had full sounding music which was a joy to listen to. The Munchkin version sounds 'tinny' and can get on your nerves rather quickly. The sound quality is extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for infant","review":"I was looking for a gift for my second child that would be her own toy. She is 6 mo. old and I based my buy on the reviews I read here. The reviews weren't wrong. My daughter loves this toy. It is entertaining and pretty indestructible (dropped from highchair and is fine). My daughter is just starting to seat up without support and this toy helps her balance and practice sitting on her own because it is sturdy and just the right size to fit between her legs as she sits. She hits the buttons with her feet and seems excited that that actions makes music. She also sucks on the soft rounded corners. You can't go wrong buying this toy. My 4 yo daughter likes it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The \\"cube\\" that was shipped as a gift stopped working after the first battery change. I was unaware of this defect and the gift recipient was too polite to bring it my attention until my visit to their premises a few weeks ago.

Shame on Munchkin!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy","review":"I bought this item for a baby. It remains a well loved toy.

I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound for a toy that teaches about sound!","review":"Don't take my word for it, listen to the video clip on this sitel The sound is pretty horrible. I'm not sure how this is going to teach a baby to identify the sounds of the instruments featured, which is the purported goal of this toy. I'm sure that baby will have fun making the cube play sounds and pressing buttons, but to whose benefit? Yours? Hers? I think neither. If you have any interest in having baby learn the instrument sounds, check out a dvd for babies called Trebellina, which teaches the instrument sounds, note reading, and pitch. It is pretty amazing. I think the instruments are largely digital on there, but only a highly trained ear would know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never-ending music","review":"This toy keeps my 4-month old's attention for a while - she really seems to like the flashing lights as the music plays.I only wish there was a volume button on it - it seems a bit loud to me (and if it seems loud to me wouldn't it seem loud to the baby as well?), and I wish it weren't quite so heavy. It will be a long time before my baby will be able to turn the cube or pick it up, for now it just sits on the floor between her legs and she's able to hit the buttons that are facing up/out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy and bulky","review":"I was originally excited about this toy, but there are a few things I was disappointed about, mostly the lack of any volume control. It's either off or on, that's it! I think it's WAY too loud! It's also a little bigger and bulkier than I imagined. I definitely like the concept, I just think there are a few major improvements that need to be done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cool for parents, too advanced for kids","review":"This is a totally cool product...for the parents. By the time the small child this is designed for could possibly appreciate what the toy teaches, he/she would be at least 5-10 years old and by then, the toy still requires patience. This is just a good idea that can't quite reach the audience it hopes too. I still like the toy, but sadly, it's just not for babies.

Buttons don't depress easily or distinctly. My 6 month old has fallen headfirst onto the cube and has cut her forehead and chin and jaw on the hard(!) unpadded edges. The corners have sufficient covers but why not the edges between corners??? Buttons require too much strength to push for a 6 month old. She can sometimes manage it her feet if cube is braced against other object. Definitely NOT for under 1 year olds.

This one does. In addition, as each side is touched the instrument pictured on that side begins to play and each additional side that is touched causes another instrument to join in the music. If baby touches orchestra side then they all play. The flashing lights, bright colors, and rounded corners combine with the music to make it a great toy. My 7 month old granddaughter chooses this cube consistently. Happily, she can make the music play herself with just a light touch.

But this one is so simple and kid-friendly that I can think of more uses.I will probably use it to laminate drawings, my kids' artwork so I can hang them on the refrigerator in style! And I plan on protecting important documents like the kids' birth certificates and health records, and I think even things with unusual shapes, like circles or triangles, because the system lets you cut to fit anything.Plus you can't beat the price.

Cold sealing is good, but stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing piece of junk","review":"I received this product with high hopes, based on the other reviews, and was startled to realize it is a piece of junk. They give you sticky plastic pages, which you press together around whatever you want to 'laminate.' The 'laminator' does nothing. Skip this product & buy the sticky paper instead & you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Mess!!!","review":"I opened the package and immediately, I realized that this was not what I had expected. It was poorly made and the quality of the laminates was also poor. The laminate would peel-off if an edge happended to be slightly open. Also, the paper was a sticky mess. If you don't place the laminate correctly the first time, then say goodbye to your precious document. Don't even think about pulling the sticky paper off and re-doing it because it will rip or damage your document. Definitely a bad purchase. Beware!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile for its intended use...","review":"There's a reason that this laminator costs much less than most other models - it's made of unreliable plastic.I have never laminated before. I bought one of these and misread the poortly written instructions. While trying to get the first paper item to be laminated, the lamination envelope and two carrier sheets through it the first time, one of the two flimsy plastic pieces that holds the roller in place snapped off of the plastic housing. The laminator was not repairable, even with super glue!Unless you are verrry familiar with how to laminate and are really gentle when using fragile plastic devices, this thing is just too fragile to consider purchasing at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I bought this a few weeks back but didn't have the momentum to try it, so didn't even take it out of the pack. Today when I finally found a need for laminating something, I took it out and observed that the metal parts inside got totally rusted. I could clearly see a metal rod from the slit on the bottom side which got very badly rusted that the rust is falling out of it. I live in SF bay area which is not a moist environment either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im rating the service!!!!","review":"I have not yet received my items.

There is absolutely no fixing this POC either. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You2 Cool Seal Laminator-Defective","review":"This item was received as a Christmas Gift on 12/25/00. Upon opening and trying the laminator, I found the gears inside were broken into several pieces. The paperwork that was included with the laminator said it had a 1 Year Warranty, so I called the 1-800 number to request the gears be sent to me and I would install them. The person I spoke with was very rude and said they would not cover this problem, that it should be sent with the receipt to the place of purchase. I again requested just sending me the items and she informed me that they do not do that and very rudely said they would not accept a return under the warranty. So, basically it is my problem. I will not do business with this company again if I can help it. What is the purpose of a warranty if the company will not accept it's own terms of that warranty? I only gave this item a 1 Star review because it did not give me an option of entering a negative!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rolling pin would do better.","review":"This a totallly unnecessary piece of plastic.

The record labels have all but forgot about Sonny in fact with the exception of this 2 fer I had to go to Nashville Tenn. to even find Sonny James material and from West Virginia that is quite a distance. Was the 60's and 70's so long ago or is Sonny's material just being ignored. If I remember right this Country legend had a string of 21 number one hits but yet for years and years his material was out of Print. These two 70's albums released on one CD shows how well Sonny can cover some of the all-time great tunes from yesteryear, treated with the upmost respect and care from Sonny.

Also, to my ears, Corelli's music sounds much better on the period instruments. The modern instruments sound too sweet and glossy to me. Not to say that period instruments would work for, say a Rachmaninov symphony!

As I read through the awkward, primer style text, I got the impression that all of the analysis and style had been brutally edited out in order to meet the length guidelines required by the publisher. The account is little better than a raw recitation of chronological events. Many of the \\"Great Campaigns\\" series are enjoyable and informative reads. This is not one of those. Try \\"The Boston Campaign\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst, but not great","review":"This book does not offer anything in the way of even decent maps. It is tough to follow along with the text when you have no decent maps to look at. I have numerous other books on the Petersburg Campaign, and I found myself referring to the maps in these books repeatedly. The book does offer a coherent, concise analysis of the campaign in one book, which is an extremely valuable thing. You had better have other resources to look at while you read, though, or you won't pull anything useful from this book, aside perhaps from some information from the numerous excellent sidebars."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE worst...","review":"I've read 100+ Civil War related histories, biographies, soldier accounts and such over the last four years - this is the absolute worst.

One of the few instances where I learned nothing from my efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"file next to your least favorite Harmonia Moroney discs","review":"Pandolfo has the most pathetic technique of any da gambist on record. His tone is wussy, sawing timidly everywhere around the notes, avoiding rhythm completely. He makes his fine old instrument sound uncannily like Glenn Gould's humming. Totally enervating. Pandolfo's teacher was Savall whose own recording of these sonatas is an even more famous failure. On that recording he and Koopman somehow managed to give the impression that they were recording their parts in separate locations, neither performer playing with an acknowledgement of a collaboration. Here Pandolfo is lucky enough to be partnered with Alessandrini who plays gloriously. If only the harpsichord track could be isolated this disc would be a keeper. I'll stick with my Westminster LP of Janigro & Veyron-Lacroix - they are about the only one's who can make sense of these brilliant gems - which really aren't that difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passably cute","review":"My Love Patzzi is a short, ten-episode television drama about an unlikely pairing of two people looking for love who become good friends instead, but discover that love was right next to them all along.

My Love Patzzi is light fare, probably best for fans of Korean pop culture, but is a passably cute drama for the rest of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"captures your attention","review":"This is a fabulous book!

The Baldwin brothers both provide mailed-in, vanilla performances. Tons of gratuitious violence are lost against a plot that's not at all engaging.The lighthing tries to give a sense of place, but fails miserably. The extras aren't even handled well. This movie will take 105 minutes away from your life and you'll never get them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For DJs and Parties","review":"First of all, THIS DVD IS 3 HOURS LONG! Many computer animation videos are only about 40 minutes. This DVD consists of three 60-minute videotapes from 1993-1994 that have been transferred to DVD. I don't really care for the first 10 minutes of videos 1 and 2 but the rest is great. The animation isn't as detailed as that from the Mind's Eye series, and there is a lot of repetition, but it has a stylish look and fast movement so it goes great with dance music in a video bar.I honestly haven't listened to much of the music on the DVD since I only use the video portion while DJing, but I like what I've heard.

I would not reccomend it for kids since its filled with new age ideas, smoking, and innuendo. Its more geared towards older kids, teens and adults. I didn't like that it was filled with many hoopla mumbo jumbo ideas with pagan like themes.It gives kids the wrong impression and frankly Disney has crossed the line with this movie. I would not reccomend it to anyone that's below 9 years old. Its just not appropriate for little kids, so please keep this on mind parents. I found the story to be lame and shallow in many ways.Since I don't believe in the beliefs of the new age ideas in this movie it was hard for me to get into it. I felt that it could have been done a whole lot better. Basically all they do is set out on a mission, somoene betrays them and they overcome that. I didn't really like the plot in this bad excuse to make an animation flick. You won't miss anything if you skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantis -- Much hype, no substance","review":"The much hyped Disney feature, Atlantis bored our family. The plot is minimal and shallow. Most disturbing is the abundance of violence -- not the fantasy kind, but hitting, kicking, shooting guns, etc. My 5 year old couldn't stand it and my 8 year old was unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I left bored and apathetic","review":"The story moves forward at a pretty quick clip, unfortunately sacrificing necessary character development along the way. When our hero is ultimately double crossed, I had a hard time caring. It seemed pretty obvious it would happen.Some beautiful animation along with some not-so beautiful, it didn't make up for the minimal story. And given the number of writers credited, along with the fact that ATLANTIS is strangely similiar to the anime NADIA from 10 years previous, you'd think they'd have that part worked out.Without ruining it, the end depends on some out-of-left field, unestablished robots, who seem more about being like THE IRON GIANT than staying within story context.It's been weeks and I still have no idea where that part came from.All in all, I left mildly bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney, ?oh,no! you did it again!","review":"anybody see \\"Nadia, the secret of the blue water\\" ?, Atlantis is, of course, a copy of this classic japan animation movie, belive me, go to:and decide yourself P.S.

Aimed at the teenage male crowd (me), it did not hit its mark. Atlantis drags on far too long for the story, and it seems that some of the scenes, like when the side characters share their personal stories, could have been left out for brevity. While it is creatively quite interesting and has really cool dvd menus, the film lacks any of the sparkle that makes other disney films attractive. It also utilizes a smattering of foolish and simple humor to try and win over the audience, but fails yet again.I hate to do this, but it is a rental, at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantis","review":"Not very pleased.

There is nothing charming about the character art, though some of the landscapes are pretty. The characterization of the hero and heroine is strictly by-the-numbers. And I never realized how annoying Michael J. Fox's patter can be until I saw this movie! The sidekick characters, such as they are, are anachronistic stereotypes and just plain unfunny. Ugh.

There are some great moments and nice backgrounds, and a fairly good story. But I found the drawings harsh and distorted, maybe a glorified sort of Pinky and the Brain type of animation. As in Road to El Dorado, Disney seems more interested in just how much skin to reveal on their heroines, how much innuendo and adult \\"humor\\" they can slip into the story--and this is supposed to be for kids? I was looking forward to this one from the trailers I had seen, and when I sat down to watch it with my niece we were both very disappointed. Don't bother--go get My Neighbor Totoro instead.

Aside from the story getting going a little too quickly for my tastes, the plot was a more complex one than other Disney films -- it actually managed to hold the attention of people over 10! The humour is also well-used, with potty humour kept to a minimum and some very quirky jokes. With some stunning visuals and tastes of the great comic-book style of Mike Mignola, this movie has a great cast featureing absolutely NO animals! (well, unless you take that term loosely.) The lack of singing and dancing is great, and also a wonderful change for Disney who has stuck with formula for so long, but the song over the credits by Mya was rather irksome.

Not a typical Disney movie, although I don't know if there really is a 'typical' Disney movie lately.Toward the end it got kind of trippy and bizarre.It seemed like the plot wasn't actually all that strong, and there was such mystery surrounding everything - I mean, things weren't explained very well - that it was hard to get fully engaged in what was happening.It all seemed very rushed and some of it was just weird. Other than that the movie was kinda cool, I guess... it had its funny moments and its cool moments.Okay, I guess it wasn't the sort of movie I'd really want to see again. Not much strong characterization, not much strong plot, and some general bizarreness... it kind of gave me the impression of writers saying \\"ehh, I know it lacks something, but I can't be bothered working on this thing for another minute\\", like I do when I've finished an essay that is technically okay but strongly \\"lacks something\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag...entertaining...but..","review":"Excellent animation and graphics.

Milo and the lovable hilarious group that he joins are more likable and enjoyable than some previous Disney characters (*cough* Snow White *cough cough*)and Princes Kida's strong independence, intelligence, and bravery make her a worthy addition to the Disney cast of royals. All in all the movie was fantastic. A little surprising though, this particular film from Disney has no sing a long music.

But all in all, it was pretty good.Michael J. Fox does a great job voicing the lead character, Miles, who is following his grandfather's dream quest to find the lost city of Atlantis.

When I watched it I felt quite unfulfilled. The begginning happend too fast really rushing you into the action. The plot was quite thin, and quite the head scratcher. In the audio commentary they producers said they wanted to keep everything mysterious and not give too much of the history of Atlantis away. I thought the history part would be the most interesting, a whole movie about the history would have been better. The animation was okay (yep, the block hands were really odd) and the action was pretty good. But like a lot of Disney's other stuff it was all pretty on the outside but totally empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panned by critics, audiences, I loved it.","review":"No it's not Beauty and the Beast - there are no songs!

I suppose I should not have expected higher quality writing--but I certainly did not expect rampant, unrepentent voilence. The story of the mythical world was completely missing from this graphically violent cartoon full of death and distruction--which gets wholly brushed off by the characters This is NOT a movie for children should not be billed as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"OOPS","review":"Much like the ill-fated TRON, this Disney spectacle fails to hit the mark. The story begins with a momentum and excitement that feels like the Indiana Jones movies, and one wishes it might have been live-action instead of animation. As the story quickly begins to lose all sense of logic and time and place, it becomes populated with a band of disjointed (even in their animated style) characters. They are intermittently funny, but as the adventure wears on, the story reveals an Atlantis, and its many strange secrets, as a bizarre, unlikable place. The over-the-top crystal concept is so strangely remote and undecipherable I can hardly imagine a 7-year old comprehending what the heck is going on. And the inconsistencies in the story are rampant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney formula","review":"Disney took a good idea and made the worst of it. Combining elements from Raiders of the Lost Arc, STAR WARS, and Bay Watch, I wish I had taken the $34 we spent at the movies and bought some good books. The female heroine was a voluptuous, scantily clad girl. All of the other female characters were either very \\"butch\\". Milo was the typical glasses wearing, gaulky geek, that Disney has made famous. Realizing this was a fantasy I was prepared for a stretch in the story line, but Milo keeping his oversized glasses on throughout the whole movie, under water, dangling from a hot air balloon, and the escapes from falling down tunnels and off of bridges was just too much. This might be a good rainy day rental but I would encourage you not too waste your time or money on the big screen. The 10 year old boy I was with was not impressed much either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity, Fun, Action","review":"Disney has really done a good job with this one! The cast of characters is truly for today's society and it works great. Yes I will agree that my 3 year old daughter probably could not follow the plot, but the characters are so enchanting and the imagery and music spectacular and the action adventurous that it really did not matter. The plot was for my 10 year old niece who also enjoyed it immensely. I read one reviewer who thought it was too scary. Scary?!?

In the movie, over 150 people died for the all too typical greed of money. The jokes and animation used in the film are for kids, but I don't think the movie is very family oriented. There are other better movies out there and I defiantly wouldn��t recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooring and not for kids","review":"Atlantis must have a demographic out there somewhere that likes this sort of crap, but for 90% of you out there reading this review right now, trust me and skip it. Anime fans might be willing to sit through this, but kids and adults are both likely to come away disappointed. My wife and I could barely finish this movie, we were so uninterested. Part of the problem is that characters are not well-developed (except for the females, in true Disney fashion,if you know what I mean). The animation is nowhere near as good as you expect from a true Disney production; it's more like a bad Saturday morning flick that you don't understand why your 8 year old enjoys. I'm really surprised that Michael J. Fox lends his name to the lead character, actually. Watch an old Disney movie instead for kids, or Shrek if you are over 10 and still want to be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries TOO hard to be serious","review":"This was a fair movie.It had decent action and a few funny moments,but it was ruined by half-hearted animation and it tried to be TOO serious.The plot was made half-enjoyable by an overkill of action and death.It wasn't as good as \\"Pocahontas,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast\\", \\"Lion King\\" or \\"\\"Hunchback of Notre Dame.\\"The songs were kind of forgettable and the movie seemed to lag in drama and humor.This was an action filmed that sadly was destroyed by TOO much action and not enough other elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great movie","review":"I agree that Disney isn't doing too well with their recent movies. They are getting worse as they create sequels to almost every other original movie. It's not helping them at all, but I still love Disney movies, though I prefer to skip the sequels.I enjoyed this movie actually. For once it wasn't all about a love story. This was more adventurous and based on the legend of Atlantis.It's interesting to think that Atlantis actually looks like it does in the movie. It gives you another perspective to it, than your own view.The way the culture of the people is displayed shows a differentworld than ours, even if it may not be real. You expand your imagination when you watch this movie.If you simply like movies and have a big imagination and the heart of a kid then you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully animated and classic tale by Disney","review":"I'm not sure how this plot could confuse anyone. In essence it's about a man named Milo who is searching for Atlantis using this myustical journal and a mysterious crew. The animation is stunning, the characters are funny and their interaction is nicely worked. Good for kids, but understood by adults. A very well made Disney movie as always and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable \\"Indiana Jones\\"-esque adventure!","review":"I enjoyed this film immensely. It's been SO long since there's been a really good old fashioned adventure like the aforementioned Indiana Jones movies (well, the first and third ones, anyway) and this movie really helps in filling that void. The pacing is strong, the voice acting is great, and the supporting cast is quirky and amusing. This is an ideal 'first date' movie as well as one that will keep the entire family entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlantis...Disney goes for the glory!","review":"Im a 19 male just out of high school who went to watch this movie on a first date. Well I haven't seen the girl recently but I have seen the movie 3 times since. It is great. It has a great storyline and each of the characters have there own personalities that really set them out. Everybody is dogging this movie for what it didn't have....they need to notice what it DID have. A great Action-Adventure flik without all the boring, childish songs. It even has a touch of romance in it between Milo(The main character) and Kida (a beautiful Atlantian princess). This movie is great for children, teens, and adults. Its hard to make a movie that will entertain all 3 of those...lets give Disney some credit. Go watch it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dive into 'Atlantis'.","review":"This movie is an okay sort of movie. Not the greatest one I've seen. It does not have the greatest animation, because there all shapes. There hands are very strange too. The movie has a good plot, but is certainly not as good as, 'Tarzan' or 'Beauty and the Beast' but is certainly an enjoyable film. Michael J. Fox does a really good voice as Milo, the explorer looking to find 'Atlantis'. Well, I recommend this movie only to kids and maybe adults. It is enjoyable to kids and be sure parents you will get a thank you after the movie from your kids! They will certainly love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complex for me","review":"I wouldn't waste your money on this movie because it is to complex to understand. Definetly one of the worst Disney movies, right up there with Pocahontas. There are way too many characters in this movie that are not developed and none of them are likeable or that you can relate to. The worst part was that they tried to give this movie \\"the Disney Formula\\" where you have to have to characters fall in love. Please if you want to go see a good Disney movie that doesn't use the Disney formula that came out resently spend your money on renting the Emperor's New Groove an great movie that is easy to understand and doesn't follow the Disney formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old...","review":"The Disney formula is getting old. The hero, the love interest, the bad guy, the asinine sidekick and the troups. From Pocahontas, Aladin, Hercules, Mulan and the rest the recipe remains the same. Plug in a new environment & costumes and you have a \\"new\\" Disney movie. Disney must think the members of its audience are total gullible imbeciles not to recognize this fact. Among other grievances about this movie is the gratuitous violence: the guns, the weaponry, the bombs... In this particular film, the sidekick \\"Mole\\" is totally nonsensical, absurd and annoying. I would recommend to avoid this movie and instead, repeat your visits to \\"Shrek\\" if kids insist on going to the movies. Disney, give your audience some credit for having a little intelligence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing...","review":"I had much higher hopes for this movie. For starters, there was no character development at all. Milo was the only one that we knew anything about and who anyone could possibly relate to, but even his relationship with his grandfather was more contrived than usual for a Disney film. I was shocked at the way that the film tried to include minorities-- in a very type-cast/stereotypical way. There was an Italian who worked in a floral shop, a smelly dirt-loving Frenchman, and a Latina woman who's highest ambition was to open an auto shop. The \\"international\\" cast did more harm than good. The scenes were choppy and the characters more flat and uninteresting than normal for a Disney movie. The most interesting part was Atlantian-- the artificial language. ...\\" Suggestion: don't bother. Spend your money on something worthwhile like Shrek...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, awful for young children","review":"This movie was absolutely BORING. The scenery grows old, and the thin plot is confusing. It is entirely too long, and I don't remember much action except at the beginning. This was definitely not for young children, because their attention spans cannot sit through the tiresome dialogue. Not to mention preschoolers asking their parents where half the crew went after the submarine sunk. (They died, obviously.) Even with its few clever lines, you will be too tired and bored from this movie to laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"great character design/animation....... thats all.","review":"once upon a time.. there was a company called disney.... who cared about having a great story with strong character developement throughout thier journey. the laughter, the drama, and the spectacular animation. well the only thing atlantis has going for it is the animation and great character design. the story is bland and uninteresting. the love story is just the styrophome inside the box before you move all of that fluff out of the way. if you look at the death of the father scene in atlantis, and the death of the father scene in the lion king, you will see what i mean as far as drama, and how atlantis lacks very much in it. overall, its just plain disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Done Differently","review":"This film was excellent. I went with my girlfriend, who is an artist. I'm a tech-head. The movie had elements of each, which makes both of us happy. :) If you liked \\"Titan A.E.\\", you'll definately enjoy this one. I enjoyed Titan, but my complaint is that Disney simply can't do space movies. It's not their thing. Mythical stories, however, are well within their realm. The art is beautiful, the CG work is beautiful, and the plot is very entertaining. The love story isn't overdone, but it has enough of a presence that my girlfriend and I were touched by it.It's a fun \\"feel-good\\" movie from Disney, and I recommend it to everyone, children and adults alike. About the only age group who *shouldn't* go would be the Jr. High to early High School range who haven't matured to the point where they can enjoy a \\"kids'\\" movie again."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Atlantis\\" is the long-lost treasure we've been looking for!","review":"I saw this only yesterday, and this is destined to be a classic in the hearts of Disney action seekers, including mine. I loved this movie, and I can guarantee you that I will buy this movie when it comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantis: The Lost Chance","review":"Not good. And what a missed opportunity. Whatever happened to the Disney ethic: it's only cartoons, nobody gets killed! Violent flaming death, desecration and destruction of ancient civilizations, and ugly greedy-minded characters. And this is supposed to be a Disney film. Even chain smoking is given precious Disney airtime. Walt must be turning in his grave! I suggest that the talentless, unimaginative and over-paid creatives who put this dull and hackeyed story together, sit down in the archives and pull out the reels of Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs, and re-acquaint themselves with the concept of: F.A.M.I.L.Y E.N.T.E.R.T.A.I.N.M.E.N.T. This appaling film only gets two stars: one for the Disney hallmark, and, one for the poster (even though is looks like an Asia album cover). Hopefully, this film will sink beneath the waves...quickly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shall We Call it \\"Dumb\\" or \\"Dumber\\"?","review":"Okay . . . it's a kids' movie. You don't have to reduce the entire content of a movie aimed at the under-10 crowd to pablum, however. Disney should know that as well as anyone. The fact that this ho-hum piece should show up in the same season as the inspired brilliance of \\"Shrek\\" is somehow ironic.Does anyone over 10 actually believe that everyone in this supposed civilization has forgotten how to read? Does anyone care, considering how lifeless and flat the \\"Atlanteans\\" are (with the obvious exception)?Yep, the animation was terrific. The voice-over work was outstanding in spots. If you aren't in the target age-bracket, though, be prepared to be bored . . . for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"atlantis: the copy cat","review":"this is another example of disney's hardwork in copying the story frame of other movies. the japanese's 'laputa: the castle in the sky' (http://www.geocities.com/Tokyo/Bay/6800/laputa/), which is a 12-year-old movie, has the exact same story frame.the difference is -- the atlantis is talking something burried under the sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATLANTIS - WOW!!","review":"This movie is a must see for children and adults of all ages!

One of the best animated films I've ever seen, and I've seen them all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlantis","review":"Tired of buying over hyped DVD's. This is a plot from a 50 year old \\"B\\" Movie, and a little of 60 year old Flash Gordon. It's not much more than that. The only plus was sound, but not worth the $... I paid for it. Very, very few movies are lately."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Political Correctness from Disney","review":"The villain in this movie is a murderous expedition leader who describes himself as a \\"capitalist\\". His name? Roark -- an obvious reference to Ayn Rand. I'm not happy with such underhanded attempts to \\"educate\\" children with a leftist point of view. This is not to be considered a simple entertaining movie, but a political statement -- and more evidence of Michael Eisner's misdirection. Walt Disney, we miss you more and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just because im not ten anymore.","review":"\\"Thumbs Down!\\"Somebody help with this boring animated Disney flick! It was supposed to be a great adventrous one with cute humor! This film just tries to pass as something original, but is really a copy of Indiana Jones, just put into Disney's version.

This could run for worst film of the summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicotine Pusher","review":"I was very disappointed to see that Disney chose to make one of the characters a chain smoker. This is a movie for children and it is inappropriate to introduce this type of character in a children's film. Is Disney getting money from the tobacco industry to promote the addiction of nicotine? Is this why they wrote a chain smoker into a children's movie? Also there was a lot of fighting and harshness from the characters. I give it 2 thumbs down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlantis DVD","review":"It's a good movie. It's funny. It's good entertainment for kids and adults.

If you want to see a good movie buy Akira."},{"rating":"1","title":"having the same story frame of a japanese movie","review":"this is another version of disney's hardwork in copying other's story frame (a 12-year-old japanese movie, translated to english as 'a city in the sky'). very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par for Disney","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. It is NOT up to Disney standards. 1)The animation was Television quality. They have gone from exceptional animation quality (from Little Mermaid through Aladdin)to this new straight-line, squared-off. \\"Anime'\\" type drawing. It's terrible! 2)Also the story line was violent with too much fighting and warfare, whereas you normally expect jokes and comedy between a main character and his sidekick, from Disney.Overall, I was very disappointed and would not recommend this Disney movie to anyone, especially young kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much plot, inconsistent animation","review":"This review is for adults -- my children (age 8 and 5) loved this film. I, however, did not particularly care for it. There is not much of a plot and no real character development. But, hey, it's Disney! My real beef is with the animation. It's very strange -- some characters look like classic Disney (think \\"101 Dalmatians\\") and some look like Japanese anime and one looks like a reject from Saturday morning cartoons. So, very inconsistent animation plus no plot equals...a good opportunity to sit in the air-conditioned dark eating popcorn with your children. Go if you must, but be prepared. It's not as bad as \\"Pokemon: The Movie\\", but it's close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop recommending this movie to me!","review":"I saw this movie in the theatre.

At points the old mentor guiding Milo reminded me of so many other characters in films I have seen in the last 5 years. The crew that journey with Milo could not have more intriguingly designed; they are a wonderful bunch of characters that provide the most superb reparte and basic jokes.Obviously it is not meant to be some sort of Alice Bailey style exposition of \\"The Real Atlantis\\" otherwise we would be looking at a History channel DVD and not a Disney show.The fun is great, it is straightforward, and even the hint of romance with Milo and the Atlantean Princess is beautifully done.The denouement is superb as always.And, if you can find the DVD, get ATLANTIS:MILO'S RETURN, it is a fitting sequel, and a work that is lovingly crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but with problems","review":"I've seen the movie and enjoyed it, but found that the first DVD loops on Magnavox DVD players so the movie never plays, but gets stuck on the (really boring) trailers.Kind of a problem.

I believe that is a first for Disney.To be cliche, it's a fun movie the whole family can enjoy.

His wooden acting lends a sinister atmosphere to his every move, gesture and feeling. This is amply set off by the other actors, who give their all - a distinct contrast to Dorian's flat, almost logical way of carrying on.As an Englishman, I find the inclusion of American actors somewhat strange - I assume this was something to do with the film getting finance, but don't let the accents put you off. All the cast give their all and to great effect.The direction is immaculate - look for the little details of lighting, the humble people in the background in many of tyhe scenes going about their everyday duties, everything has a symbolism, and the more you watch this film, the more you will get out of it.A masterpiece - a must-see.Richard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Near Perfection","review":"Handsome, young and morally corrupt Dorian Gray has his portrait painted.

Hurd Hatfield may be the most wooden actor ever to star in a movie. He also was way too old for someone who is supposed to look like he's in his early 20's throughout the movie. I didn't for a second believe that Donna Reed's character would have been pining all those years for a character so charmless and robotic. And the usually wonderful George Sanders played one of his patented quick-talking smarmy characters but without any of the wit, charm or menace he showed in so many of his performances, including All About Eve and Rebecca.

Not a huge deal, but an unnecessary trip to the hardware store.I bought a set of these chairs about 4 years ago now. They have changed the design on them somewhat, the back is now more rounded and you have to put the back support together your self now. It is no longer welded together, this was the area I had to literally bend when I was putting them together.Very cheap, and the design has worsened which is not surprising since the Chinese design for money rather than design for improvement.

With this in mind I have to say that I found the sound to be poor. Even with the bass turned up and the treble down it still sounded tinny and weak. I did like the fact that it accommodated my older, 1st generation iPod and had several attachments for the various versions of iPods. I bought it because it did accept my older iPod and because of the price, but I sent it back and bought the iM7 which has great sound and accepts my old iPod for a price that is not that much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the deployed soldier","review":"I bought this to use with my Ipod while deployed to Iraq.

The noir mood and gritty setting is lost completely. Deadly Spell was cool, intelligent and fun, Witch Hunt is campy, heartless and plastic. Nothing about the story really works well when it tries to tie in to the past movie, and it's very disappointing when detective Lovecraft ends up being a magic user by the end of the film. It's a soulless zombie feeding on the corpse of the first movie, and that metaphor is way cooler than anything else about the film itself. If you loved the original movie because of all the H.P.

However, that's not the case. You don't get to see the boat built until the last 10 pages or so. And most of the story is not about building the boat either; it's about political intrigues surrounding the several neighborhood kingdoms which centered on the one ruled by Mark Twain. I guess it has something to do with the author possessed limited scientific knowledge about the techniques actually building a boat.I'm really disappointed at this book and no, I won't continue on to the next book in the series.One last thing, I don't know whether it's just me, but this whole concept of the series reads like a Scientology textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"THITH WATH THO DITHRACTING....","review":"Yes overall a good story, but my god it dragged like a dead dog.

Lots of history in this great cookbook!New England is known as a rugged place. Its borders include austere shores, deep forests, lakes and mountains. Its winters are long and hard. Boston's fare has been molded in such a setting. Its taste is often direct and to the point.From a frugal heritage, it's early traditional dishes emanated from the culinary treasures that abounded in the fertile countryside. The taste is unpretentious but distinctly its own and today some of the country's finest cooks make dishes, homemade and good, that bring many a tear to one's eye.OLD BOSTON FARE bursts with tasty dishes to suit every occasion. There are old favorites like boiled cake, sour cream pie, strawberry dumplings, fish chowder, old-fashioned johnnycakes, and syllabub. Many traditional recipes have been modified and simplified for the modern cook without any loss of their old fashioned richness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't see beyond the poor writing...","review":"This is my first Amazon review. I have been \\"moved\\" to do it - almost to tears. I have read hundreds of martial arts books (and similarly videos and DVDs) and this is easily the worst at any price. To say there is little new in it (despite the insinuations of the title) would accuse most books but this one is poorly written, illustrated with often bad postures and verbally illustrated with puerile stories.If Huan Zhang is truly going to write more books on taiji in English, as he promises, I sincerely recommend him to do so with a skilled English-speaking martial arts author. For now, unfortunately, you should spend your hard-earned money on... well, almost any other book than this.

He could sing the national anthem and it would be great. The sound is excellant and this two-hour concert contains even more hits by him than those listed. The song listing is 34, but the actual number of tracks are 36. Right after \\"I'm In Love Again\\" you can add \\"Honeychile\\" which was a top ten, and after \\"So Long\\" you can add \\"Natural Born Lover\\" which made top thirty. What I do not like about this 2 CD collection is this: it was recorded in 1989 in Texas and first appeared in a 3 LP collection with the live audience. Now, Tomato has deleted the live audience from the original trying to make these tracks sound as if there studio recordings, which there not. That is my only complaint, and it takes away from what was a real live show."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Fats 30 years later","review":"These are not the original Imperial and ABC/Paramount recordings by Fats. They are all taken from 1989 studio sessions which appear to be somewhat unrehearsed. The band includes Herb Hardesty and Lee Allan on tenors but is saddled by a mediocre base player. Fats does a professional job of singing and playing his hits, given he was 61 years old at the time. However, the obvious lack of preparation for these sessions leads to overly long and meandering versions of some numbers like an almost 9 minute cut of Jambalaya with a sax solo including \\"Yes sir, that's my baby.\\" Overall this CD is a big dissapointment. The only reason you might want to get it is as a souvenir of a Fat's concert you attended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of Albert King?","review":"First things first. This cd is NOT the best of Albert King. It's a compilation of tracks culled from a series of mediocre albums he recorded in the mid to late 70's (including the truly awful \\"New Orleans Heat\\"), and contains no songs from his classic Stax recordings.

It was very obvious that they were trying to stretch the book to 60 minutes- but they did it very poorly.

The writing itself is technically solid, but the subject matter left a bad taste in my mouth, as though I'd eaten something disagreeable.

Both Bridges' & Sarandon's acting (as well as that of the others in the film) was competent - they did as well as they could with the little they had available to them.

If you have limited video inputs in your TV, do not have a receiver, and care about video quality, this product is the best option you can find at the moment.The only downside is the interference suffered by other appliances that work on the 2.4 Ghz frequency, such as microwave ovens or wireless phones.

All in all, I think it's a great book for kids and parents to either read aloud or just look at the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two boys' review: We like The Very Hungry Caterpillar better","review":"This book is eligible for Amazon's 4-for-3 promotion, so you are not risking a lot of money should you buy this book.It isn't one of our favorites from Eric Carle. The story is supposed to address anger issues -- and it does -- by hitting you over the head as the ladybug flies from page to page trying to pick a fight with larger and larger animals.The problem isn't the message it is the entertainment value. This book simply didn't engage our sons' interest. I suppose it is difficult enough to relate to a bug, much less an angry bug.For our bedtime reading collection, we prefer these Carle books instead:The Very Hungry CaterpillarThe Mixed-Up ChameleonBrown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As a buyer of most of Eric Carle's books, I was very disappointed with this story. Definitely not for toddler-preschool children. The concept is basically one of a grouchy ladybug (we never figure out why he is grouchy) and that he wants to pick a fight with everyone, progressively bigger animals as the book goes on. Eventually he picks a fight with the whale and it reads the \\"whale gave him such a slap\\" ... and pretty much that was it for me. I have no idea how this book won Laura Ingalls Wilder Award. Its a bit aggressive for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike this book","review":"The artwork is wonderful, it's colourful and attractive, it's too bad the story is repetitive in a non-positive way and boring for the most part. The grouchy lady bug is not a sympathetic character at all, and not one that I would want my children mimicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Very Grouchy Review by: Nicole","review":"I liked this book because it reminds me of what i used to do. Yelling adn always wanting to fight. It was very funny because I was very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Title from Eric Carle","review":"\\"Hey you,\\" said the grouchy ladybug, \\"Want to fight?\\"Not only does the bad-tempered protagonist ask once -- he tries to pick a fight with every single character in the book! Only to get smacked around by a whale at the end.Perhaps it \\"invites children to explore the concepts of time, size, shape, and manners\\" as advertized on the back cover...I think the more poignant lesson is that the biggest guy wins. It's disappointing to see author Eric Carle's award-winning investment in a book with such an unpleasant tone.The book appears to be written for a 3-6 year old audience (in my opinion), but it's one children's story that we won't be keeping on our shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grouchy Lady Bug","review":"I picked two stars for many reasons. This book is not good for little children, because in the story the character is, a fighter, and does not share. Children's book should be opposite of that, they should be teaching children to share and to respect and not to fight with others. I think that this book is for children 5 or 6 and up because they should know that they should not be fighters, mean, and to share.This book is mostly for boys, because boys are more interested in fighting and not being nice and not sharing. And this story is I like to say aggressive. It's not really for girls. Girls are more in to like nice sharing and not fighting stories.That is what I have to say about The Grouchy Lady Bug."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really dislike this book","review":"As another reviewer said, we are not incredibly conservative or anything. But I'd like to keep my three-year-old's innocence going as long as possible. I threw this book away after reading it just once, since the main character just picks fights with everyone. Why would I even want to introduce the notion of fighting to my son?? This is not a good children's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally inappropriate for anyone","review":"This book should be black listed. Almost every page has this sentence \\"Hey, you wanna fight\\" on it. Never read it to a child. It condones fighting. Kids learn enough bad things on their own without this idea being drummed into their heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Grouchy Ladybug","review":"This book is about a grouchy ladybug that doesn't want to share a leaf with another friendly ladybug, so he flies off trying to find some other animal to fight with for no reason. I picked two stars because I think this book teaches kids how to fight when they don't get something all to themselves with out sharing. I think that children's books should teach about sharing your things with others even if they like it a lot. I think that this book shouldn't be for younger children under age five. So six years old and up should read this because they will understand that you shouldn't fight and they should realize that this is just a story and that they shouldn't start fights.This book seems like boys would enjoy it more because they are more interested in fighting and the grouchy ladybug tries to be big and bad by fighting. I don't think girls would like it as much because they are more into sharing and being nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ERIC CARLE BOOK EVER!!!!","review":"I marvel at the reviewers who try to put positive spin on the horrific premise of this book. (And I'm not even especially politically correct!)The grouch ladybug proceeds to pick fights, for no good reason, with ever larger animals. That's pretty much it. Over and over again! What was Eric Carle thinking? Maybe he's just written too many books and is running out of ideas. . .There are so many great children's books. There are a lot of great Eric Carle books. Don't waste your money or you and your child's precious time on this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The very Grounchy Ladybug","review":"I rate this bookony a one.

Unfortunatley the \\"Wanna fight\\" parts of this book just aren't great for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for the age group.","review":"I really liked this children's book. The illustrations were very peculiar and different, as was the organization of the book. The pages going from smaller to bigger in the middle and the words on the pages also changing in size, getting progressively larger is definitely a different touch. I especially liked how the shape of the whale's tail was a page in itself towards the end. There was also a clock on each page reinforcing the time mentioned and the concept of it. All around this is a great book. It brings unusal animals, not thought about everyday to mind, which could potentially lead to questions and curiosity about them. I really think this a great book for the age group it is meant for (ages 3-7)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"This is one of my all time favorites by Eric Carle.

It is a moral book ~~ that teaches kids to be more grateful and to say please and thank yous. It also points out other people's kindnesses as well as their flaws.It's about a braggart lady bug, who was told to go off and bully someone else. There is a series of characters that the lady bug meets and turns out to be bigger than she is. It's colorful, certain to grab the child's attention and gives a nice moral to the story as well. It's not boring for the parent to read ~~ I am sure I'll be reading this one constantly over the next five years. It also gives the child perspective on nature ~~ like the beetle's claws, the yellow jacket's stinger and lobster's claws. Those are just among the few descriptions the author has thrown in there!Enjoy this book ~~ it's a keeper!7-25-03"},{"rating":"2","title":"long time favorite","review":"i bought this for my nephew who hadn't read the story as it was a favorite of my family. he loves it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Size does mattter.","review":"This book was the size of a square of toilet tissue, and I was expecting a full size paper towel.

I started reading it to a child and had to stop after a few pages. I flipped ahead hoping that there would be some moral at the end. Basically after trying to pick a fight with a bunch of animals, the ladybug accidentally gets slapped by a whale and gives up and says one nice phrase on the last page. Otherwise the language used in the book is not appropriate for very young children (very rude and sassy) And you cannot really explain the \\"moral\\" if that is what you want to call it. If you really want to get this book I would suggest that the age be 7+. I wouldn't read it to my 6 year old, I know that the only thing he would get out of it would be the imfamous phrase that repeats throughout the book... \\"Do you want to fight.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for small children","review":"My children have enjoyed most of Eric Carle's books. However, the only thing my 5-year-old took away from this book was the words, \\"Hey, you! Wanna fight?\\" This phrase is repeated throughout the story. Older children may be able to understand the lesson learned at the end, but I really can not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition, repetition, repetition....","review":"After reading The Very Hungry Caterpillar to my son enough times to have it memorized, I bought this book thinking that it would be a nice change, and expecting The Grouchy Ladybug to have a moral somewhere along the lines of Alexander And The Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (if you haven't read that to your kids, get it). I found The Grouchy Ladybug to be repetative to the point of parental abuse. Eric Carle has good children's books, but this one was definitely not my favorite. The only thing my son has learned from it is \\"Hey, You, Wanna Fight?\\" It was okay to read once or twice, but the next garage sale, it's going to mysteriously vanish. I would suggest The Very Hungry Caterpillar instead, if you don't have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grouchy Ladybug makes a grouchy father!","review":"My father purchased this book for my two-year-old daughter. She absolutely adores the book---to my wife's and my dismay. She requests to have this book read over and over to her. As one previous reviewer noted, \\"Repetition is the best tool in teaching.\\" Yes, I agree, but what do you want your child to learn? I really do not want my daughter to approach people saying \\"You wanna fight?\\" when she feels grouchy. I realize that there is a nice ending and the ladybug learns it lesson. The moral is not repeated and emphasized, though. If children learn through repetition, \\"You wanna fight?\\" is what is going to stay in their head. The concept of a grouchy ladybug is wonderful, and the correlation with teaching time is nice, too. With a different story, this book could be great. I am not sure how this book has remained popular for the last twenty-five years. It lost its popularity in our house after the first reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, You, Wanna Fight?","review":"This book is going to have to quietly disappear. I can't get my 2 year old and 5 year old to stop saying the infamous phrase that is repeated throughout the book, \\"Hey, you, wanna fight?\\".

I'd skip this one and buy one of his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't read this to my son","review":"Thank goodness this book is beautifully illustrated b/c I won't be reading the text to my son.

These pages are have for my son to turn also.I love reading real children's stories to my kids, and I don't mind some repetition (e.g., \\"Guess how much I love you\\" and \\"Are you my Mother?\\" are great...)

It would be insane to teach a stallion a trick that could easily lead to him biting your face or neck. The closest thing to a liberty trick offered here is rearing, a behavior he used to use to challenge me, so not something I wanted him to do on cue.

I challenge the author to update her training methods and recall this book. There are a few things that are positive training, and was able to use those. I train dogs and other animals and know that they would not want to be with me if I hurt them. It is the same with all animals that positive training is the best.

In most pictures, the moon provides commentary on the scene. It has been popular with children K-3, and I take it to school reading programs.

A lot more.To be fair, most guide books don't pay nearly enough attention to the Keys, instead imparting more information than I ever wanted to know about Miami, a city that I've come to deplore.It might be me; I just don't get the hype and focus on a sullied, soulless, filthville of a town like Miami over the glorious, exquisite keys.At any rate, if for whatever unfathomable reason you really want to spend lots of time in Miami, this book is for you. If you're looking for Keys information, look elsewhere (though I haven't found a good alternative myself).Just be forewarned that there's a good reason MIAMI has a huge typeface on the front and \\"the Keys\\" is shrunk down in size.

He too falls head over heels for cardboard Jenny. He's convinced she didn't kill the two men she's accused of murdering. Why? Because he loooooooves her after setting eyes on her once. Who cares that she's a spineless headcase, she's hot!The pacing in this book was terrible. It lurches and jumps all over the place. Overly predictable, there are several moments in the story that are really funny, it's just that the author probably didn't intend for them to be.

NOTE TO CONCERNED PARENTS- I owned Dumbo when I was little (I'm 19..so...) and I only remembered the vaguest parts of it- I knew his mom tried to protect him and got taken away, he learned to fly with a feather, he made friends with a mouse, and I remembered the creep pink elephants he sees. Other than that- nothing. As long as you watch it with them and say, \\"Thats not very nice of them is it? What would you say?\\" They're really not going to remember the details of it in the long run anyway. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"dumdo","review":"Great kids classic a must have for any Disney fan, I bought for my wife and grandkid and they loved watching it many times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great customer service","review":"This company has great and fast customer service.

Our old tape is so used that it has a funny hum when played. Anyone who calls this movie disturbing or scary is probably disturbed and scary themselves. This is a classic! It's sweet and powerful all at once, and has a lot more feeling than newer movies which are just scene after scene of blah."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Disney film ever !","review":"Other films might have more fluid animation or more memorable songs, but no Disney animated film hits it on all cylinders like Dumbo. All it once you will laugh, cry, be delighted and scared, and cheer alongside the exploits of little Dumbo and his pal Timothy. This is one of the most heart-warming (and at times heart-rendering) tales ever told. A magnificent movie and a thoroughly entertaining classic, you must see Dumbo. Twice, if necessary.

What the hell was in that water? Some funny type of acid trip. Anyway, I know it's a classic, so whatever. But I will never watch it again. I'll just keep the movie for show.

For a young child, the older elephants are too cruel, scenes too dark, music scary, drunkeness inappropriate, pink elephant sequence too long... Thankfully, we rented from the library before I bought it. My two-year-old loves to watch the storks, Casey the Train and watch Dumbo fly but he asks me to fast-forward through the other parts that make him cry.I'm not trying to discount the other reviewers' feelings and wonderful memories of Dumbo, but just trying to warn those with very young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"won't play","review":"This DVD will not play on my blu ray player.

Disney has previously gone out of its way to give the classics the royal treatment when it comes to their blu-ray renders. Dumbo is no exception.The colors burst with a newfound brilliance and the linework is beautiful and defined. It's hard to imagine, based on the image quality, that this movie is in fact 70 years old!The story of the baby elephant who was born just a little different is one that tugs on the heartstrings of everyone who watches it. The Pink Elephants scene looks even more amazing in high definition. I had no watched this movie in over twenty years, but all sorts of emotions came flooding back as soon as I put it on.I think every child can relate to feeling different at one point or another in their lives and this uplifting story is one that they have a chance to identify with and remind themselves that everyone is special in a different and unique way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Trouble!!!!","review":"Lots of great features, but it doesn't play correctly on two of my three DVD players.

Dumbo runs 1 hour and 3 minutes. Walt Disney's 3rd animated movie. Is Dumbo's name supposed to be Jumbo Jr? Yes, Dumbo is the elphant with his ears sticking out and soon we see a mouse named Timothy Mouse. Dumbo (or Jumbo JR) is not the favorite among the other elephants expect his mom Mrs. Jumbo. But when trouble happpens, and Mrs. Jumbo is out of control trying to protect her baby, she ends up in an empty car with a sign that says \\"Mad Elphant\\". But she doesn't look mad. She looks sad. I own this movie on video. But I can't remember how I got two video tapes of this movie and when I got both tapes. Great movie to own if you own more than one tape and on dvd. Good luck finding a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it really worth repurchasing at over $20?","review":"Why would anyone who now has a Blu-Ray disc player, want to pay so much money to get the Blu-Ray disc, and yet get another copy of it in the DVD format? In most cases, anyone who wants this movie of \\"Dumbo\\" this late in their life already has the freakin' DVD! So, why do we have to buy it again? They did this with \\"Monsters, Inc\\" too where they also give you a Digital Copy (that you didn't ask for) to have to buy. Four discs when all I want is one movie. I have yet to see that release be less than $30. Disney sucks! You are forced to buy so much more than you need just to get the bleeding Blu-Ray version. They did this with \\"Fantasia\\" too where you're paying for four discs when all you really wanted is just the one.Well, Walt Disney sure is over confident that they are worth half a damn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never one of my favorites","review":"The drunken pink elephant sequence went on WAY too long. And how about those black crows?Disney will release this, but NOT release Song of the South? Doesn't make sense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Disney movie for toddlers","review":"I have various Disney movies and this is the best one for toddlers as it does not contain the thematic and real violence of a Peter Pan, nor sibling bickering like in Cinderella nor a too-hip attitude. Instead it is innocent and very positive in its message of overcoming your weaknesses and of self-esteem. (In fact I read an article that a company in India uses this movies to motivate its employees.) Aside from this, this movie is a masterpiece for people of all ages. The next best ones for toddlers are maybe Cinderella and The Jungle Book and when they are a little older Little Mermaid and Alice in Wonderland. For Aladdin and Lion King I'll maybe wait until my little one is maybe 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, sad, and loveable movie!","review":"I remember watching this as a VERY little girl! It always seemed so safe and innocent even though Dumbo was separated from his mom. As a little kid I didn't notice it so much, but now I can't help but shed a tear at the poor lonely baby with only that little mouse and the crows for companionship. And I definitely agree that adults, esp. parents or those with a maternal streak will cry at \\"Baby Mine\\" and also when Dumbo first arrives and his mom wants to protect him from the jeering of the other elephants.It's kind of like a semi- social commentary. From cruelty to animals to prejudice, there are kind of a lot of issues you could drag out of these 60 minutes! But even if you choose not to, any little kid (or anyone at all, really!) can find something poignant and/or endearing in the movie \\"Dumbo\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumbo (60th Anniversary Edition)","review":"thank you for sending it so quickly. it got here just in time for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy children are the best!!","review":"This classic movie is one of my daugher's favorites. She has watched it so much that we have had to replace thedisc once so far, and she is only 2 1/2!!!! I can't really stand this movie personally because she has watched it so many times, but since we have a portable DVD player, she can watch it anytime she likes. I realize many parents may think that I am neglecting her by allowing her to watch this movie, or any other, so often they need to replace the disc, but since her father is deployed to Iraq for this holiday season, I feel anything that can keep her in good spirits and happy is fine..:D:D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crippled DVD that you can't transfer to your iPod, a waste of money","review":"I get a lot of kid's DVDs that I load onto my iPod for my daughter. It's great for long trips since a good movie will keep her occupied. The problem with this DVD is that it incorporates a new copy protection scheme that makes it much more difficult to format shift it to an iPod (I use HandBrake for this). It seems the only reason Disney released this edition was to prevent consumers from converting this DVD to other formats. The 60th Anniversary Edition released in 2001 has more content and doesn't have this restriction. So if you intend to put this on your iPod, PSP, AppleTV, etc. don't buy this edition and look for the olderDumbo (60th Anniversary Edition)."},{"rating":"1","title":"mean spirited","review":"As a disabled woman I can wholeheartedly recomend such Disney movies such as Finding Nemo but have a hard time recomending Dumbo. Dumbo was made fun of by everyone except the crows and his mother in the movie and was treated cruely. In the end, the thing that made everyone like Dumbo was when they found out Dumbo could fly. So if Dumbo never learned to fly they would have never considered him worth treating nice? Cruddy message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad DVD, Good customer service","review":"Unfortunately the Dumbo DVD that I ordered for my daughter and I didn't work when we received it. It skipped and froze throughout. However, when I contacted the seller about the problem, he was very prompt in his response and very helpful. I sent the DVD back and I was issued a refund.

Thank you to the seller for helping to make this an easy process!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mind plays tricks.","review":"I was so excited to rent this video and watch it with my son. I didn't remember it being so racist. I was incredibly saddened as we sat through it, hoping that my son wouldn't pick up on all the slurs against people of color. I agree with many other reviewers that this movie is a classic, it is just a shame that it was socially acceptable to make this kind of statement at that point in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase this video for children","review":"I was shocked that Disney would make such a horrible movie for children. It is loaded with social and cultural stereotypes and constantly shows animals caged, doors slamming on animals, and even shows the ringmaster whipping Dumbo's mother with a large black whip. My two-year old was very scared. More than that, I was offened by the song \\"Roustabouts\\". The men who put up the circus tent at night sing this song. First of all, they are all black men putting up the tent. If you listen to the words of the song, they are singing about \\" we don't read or write\\" and \\"when we get our pay we throw our pay away.\\" Also, the black crows in the movie clearly have black accents. I know my two-year old doen't pick up on this, but I don't want her watching this kinds of movie over and over again. The only saving grace in this video is the loving relationship between Dumbo and his mother. I don't like this video and am VERY sorry that I bought it.

My two year old was frightened by the darkness and mean-spirited behavior of every character in this movie. From a toddler's perspective, and from my own, ridicule, circus cruelty, a house on fire (in the clown scene, elephants falling from great heights, and drunkeness are not funny, entertaining, or good teaching aids for children. I get the whole thing about kids being picked on for any diferences they might possess, good or bad, but this is really presented on a more mature level than children are ready for. As I watched this movie, I was reminded of seeing it in the theater when I was about seven or eight, and being very upset by the experience. I wish I had remembered that before buying this from Amazon, as I cannot return it opened.

I am 19 year-old who was just looking for a fast read. While \\"Everything She Wants\\" runs the risk of being dated, it is still wholly relevant and even more so today. The emotional struggle that the main character toils through is one that I completely relate. Wynn manages to create a story that while specific to the time is also ageless in its themes and messages. I found that I was rooting for the female lead, and I found that I became emotionally invested in her struggle. I may not recognize the name of the Detroit mayor at the time, but I also relate to the struggle to remain independent but also trust someone enough to fall in love. The story isn't overly cheesy, which usually turns me off right away, but it still manages to not be stone cold. It is realism, emotion, and fiction at its best! I look forward to another novel by Wynn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. By the end of the book I felt like I knew the characters on a personal level.

The table of irregular verbs only gives the aorist (simple past), active and passive, and the past participle. So if the imperatives are irregular, there is no way to find them using this dictionary. And if the dependent (which forms the perfective subjunctive and perfective future) is irregular, as it often is, there is no way to find it either. So if you want to say, \\"I want to see it\\", then, since that requires the perfective subjunctive, you cannot find the right form of the verb \\"to see\\". Likewise, if you want to say, \\"I would like to eat that\\", you cannot find the right form of the verb \\"to eat\\". And if you want to say, \\"Please give me that\\", you cannot find the right form of the verb \\"to give\\".

The author digs into details without giving the big picture. Although the details are not that technical, but they lack perspective. I got lost in the details without understanding the reason behind them.One other thing I didn't like, but wasn't a big factor in my decision to stop reading the book was some of some examples.

BEWARE!!!!It has that hateful and nasty \\"COPY CONTROLLED CD\\" sticker. This means I cannot play the CD in some of my older CD players (portable/car).

Since my CD collection lacks good female artists, 90 some% are male singers for some reason I decided to try her CD. I LOVE it. She has a different sound to every song on the CD and all are good or great, not a single \\"halfway\\" song. Very unusual. I think it's hard to compare artists but if I had to I'd say she sounds a little like a mix between Norah Jones, a happy Dido, Laleh (a Swedish singer-songwriter) with a pinch of Catatonia and a whiff of countrypop. My personal favourite are \\"Other side of the world\\", \\"Under the weather\\", \\"False alarm\\" and \\"Suddenly I see\\". The latter makes you smile and you can't stay still. All the songs are awsome though. It's been playing almost non stop since I got it.

Three songs are okay and the rest are total tripe, though looking on youtube her solo performances put them all to shame. Which is why I hate this album. They took someone who could be the next Janis Joplin or Ani Difranco.If you want an idea of the difference between this album and how much talent Tunstal actually has, go to youtube, and type in her name. Look at her live solo stuff versus the videos and music she does with a backing band.This album is an attrocity, and should be stricken from social conciousness, as should her backing band for crimes against humanity.

Bluesy, folky, angry, joyous and, above all, fun, \\"Eye To The Telescope\\" is a great way to introduce one's self to the United States. This is an album steeped in a lot of attitude and a lot of creativity, for both the musical stylings and the fact that Ms. Tunstall herself wrote/co-wrote every song on the album. Try this album out--whether you like blues, jazz, folk, rock...there is something on this album for everyone to enjoy. So, go and enjoy it :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy controlled!

Since, I listen to music on my computer while traveling and in the office, this is a real inconvenience. Hopefully, the US version, when released, won't have this feature.

My words can't do justice.If you love music, buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This music makes it fun to go through your everyday!!!","review":"First time I came across KT Tunstall, was after watching the movie the Devil Wears Prada, which I loved for the fast-paced reality it portrayed and that I myself live in everyday. I basically loved all the music in it and was looking to buy the soundtrack originally but came across the wird fact that one of my favorite songs of the movie WAS NOT actually in the soundtrack so I decided to do some research and came across TD Tunstall.I herd the amazon samplers and pretty much found I loved her entire album, so I ended up buying it and loving it everyday.This is a definite must buy for the busy business woman trying to make her day a a fun one.Higly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunstall Amazes","review":"Don't let the cowboy stomp of \\"Black Horse & The Cherry Tree\\" fool you, this is no country singer. This Scottish lass proves, on her debut Eye To The Telescope, that legwarmers, a low voice and some rock thrash can go along way.Her album is filled with luscious tunes from the second single \\"Other Side Of The World,\\" with its subtle demeanor to the \\"Stoppin' The Love.\\"Standouts include the lonesome \\"Under The Weather\\" and the superbly put-together \\"Suddenly I See.\\"The lyrics are not strapping, wavering between straight talk to that of middling nature. The arrangement is what graces this effort. Tunstall rocks out without being too shrill or too acoustic. The blend of rock instrumentation makes this the finicky endeavor that it is.KT Tunstall has released a profound record that feeds a niche that has been hungry since the hay day of Lilith Fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new(er) artist, worth a listen.","review":"I was a little late to the party, recently finding KT Tunstall on iTunes and making the purchase. The tracks are strong, start to finish. The song she performed on the Today Show, Black Horse and the Cherry Tree, is reminiscent of Mark Broussard's \\"Home.\\" This is an album that is enjoyable start to finish, each song is unique and well written. KT is an artist who is catagorized under \\"pop\\" but she's much more than that. Check out Sonya Kitchell if you like KT, you may find two young artists worth paying attention to, as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Goddess of Folk Music","review":"KT Tunstall does what all musicians should do- capture your ear with unique arrangements and vocal liberalism, boldly venture into their own spiritual avenue with their style, and take you on their own journey. I can feel what she is feeling when she sings. Absolutely fantastic, forget the comparisons - anything short of letting her be herself is insulting, and very soon, people will be comparing other artists to her- this woman is unique in her very own right. When she goes off on the end rift of \\"Black Horse and a Cherry Tree\\", I swear my leg started moving of it's own accord. Like your body feels the rhythm. I get goose bumps every time I listen to her, even though I have had the album for about three months now.Buy this album now. Just do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the year's best!","review":"One of the freshest and most original compilations of GREAT music to be released in a while, KT Tunstall offers a surprisingly smooth and catchy blend of folky pop in an album that is by far one of the best I have heard in recent times. Track after track offers a sometimes rythmic, sometime catchy, sometime haunting mix of beautiful tracks sung by a brilliant vocalist with a husky and pleasing voice. \\"Another Place to Fall,\\" \\"Miniature Disasters\\" and \\"False Alarm\\" are album standouts, and current single \\"Black Horse and the Cherry Tree\\" is a thumping guitar-string filled classic. Another instant classic is the upbeat and hook-laden \\"Suddenly I See\\" - perhaps the best song on the entire record. KT is clearly a gifted artist, and has outdone her peers with an album that is a mix of the very best of artists like Sheryl Crow, Norah Jones, the Bangles and Dido. She also plays an instrument, which only adds to her appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I bought this CD for one song (Black Horse and a Cherry Tree). Much to my surprise, the rest of the CD is great. I recommend it to anyone who likes Black Horse and a Cherry Tree. Chances are you'll like the rest also."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest thing in a long time","review":"I really like this album. Black Horse, Universe and U, Stoppin' the Love(especially the male backing vocals), are all great tracks. I think \\"Suddenly I See\\" like someone said is a bit insincere. The lyrics are definitely lacking substance. But I don't believe it's for lack of her ability. I think a lot of artists today dumb down their lyrics in order to target the mainstream. Kids today don't have the patience for a real song. They just want some neurotic jingle that they can pop in their ipods. KT is a fabulous musician though. And I love the masculinity and drive that she brings to the music. That's rare among female artists and something to be admired."},{"rating":"2","title":"K.T. - rates right up there with.....","review":"Bonnie Raitt & Cherly Crow in my book. This collection of songs grows on you. Worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly good","review":"Finally a CD worth the listening! KT Tunstall offers a dish of pensive and sultry, with seemingly little effort on her part. A sophisticated voice with her own style...please quit comparing! MUCH better than names being thrown around such as Sheryl Crow (who I regard as mediocre and whose music comes unbearably close to other songs I've heard) and others. Tunstall is uniquely Tunstall, and true blue to her own style. The first track sets the pace, pulls you in, and you just know this is the work of a great artist. She doesn't disappoint thereafter. Unpredictable, serene, jazzy, provocative. She is an exceptional artist with a great talent. Great CD from beginning to end and so uniquely her own that folks feel obligated to compare; the result is unfair to this great talent. A wonderfully relaxing mix packed with good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not Dido","review":"So, I'm sitting in Barnes and Noble reading and suddenly this ethereal beautiful voice comes out of the speakers throughout the store. For a brief millisecond I thought \\"Oh, Dido has a new CD\\" but then I started paying close attention.On \\"Eye To The Telescope,\\" KT Tunstall gives us some blues, some pop, some retro, and not a lick of whiny self-centered complaining that seems to be de rigueur for female singers these days. KT has a marvelously expressive voice, which she uses brilliantly without ever taking it too far. While listening to this CD I got flashes of Ricki Lee Jones, Shelby Lynne (the GOOD album) Joni Mitchell and even a little Carole King. However, that's not to say that KT is imitative in any way. She is absolutely fresh and original.If you like great lyrics matched with fine melodies and sung with sincerity and grace, give this CD a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"KT Tunstall, Eye to the Telescope","review":"Extremely talented. Hope Ms. Tunstall is around for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Too Late","review":"While KT Tunstall was firing up the UK music scene, the world isn't all concerned. A year later, Suddenly I See suddenly became the hit. Well, it's no wonder. Probably the most infectious and uplifting song off her debut Eye To The Telescope, Suddenly I See is unabashedly great pop.However, elsewhere on the album, things are quite different. The first few songs on the album are sweet and enjoyable, but they mostly sound like KT borrowed a page from Sheryl Crow's books. The casual listener might not find it anything more than ordinary.As the album plays on, KT proves her point. Besides Suddenly, the singer shows her talent for serious songwriting and soulful lyrics through Stopping the Love, Heal Over and Through The Night. The laidback and jazzy False Alarm also showcases KT's ability to put a pop track behind a clever facade. Telescope as such is the beginning of more good things to come.(A-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I got this after hearing \\"Black Horse and the Cherry Tree\\" on our local indie station and although the rest of the album isn't quite BH&CT, it's quite good.

Honestly, I don't have the CD, but the DVD is my favorite of numerous concert videos I have. Even my picky wife liked it. Why? The live tracks are perfect! The sound, everything about them is perfect. They're just five songs, so you can watch them over and over. They're a good example of really good musicians live, so they're educational, too. The Black Horse song, even though I don't particularly like it, is fantastic, as KT, her drummer-husband, and a fancy voice effects processor create a musically (and technically) complicated live masterpiece. I'd like to see Miley or Lady GaGa pull this off -- no way."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums to date!","review":"Every song on this CD is awesome.

It's a song cycle that draws you through the playlist without one dissatisfied moment.

At the moment, her music is more enjoyable with video than audio only, but you can still feel the greatness coming through her lyrics and licks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye on this rising star","review":"I've listened to this CD a few times now and every song is a winner. KT's songs written alone or in collaboration have a nice variety of pop, rock and bluesy overtones. Others have mentioned Melissa Etheridge or Bonnie Raitt, so let me throw in some Norah Jones and Edie Brickell (especially in Under the Weather). False Alarm sounds like a Beatles' song Here Comes the Sun. Just a great debut from this talented woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Disappointed","review":"I like KT Tunstall don't get me wrong. But the producer of thisCD did her a great injustice. I first heard KT on NPR in a radio interview. Her voice was raw and filled with energy- quite unique. If you have a chance to see her in concert and you appreciate singers whose voices can stand alone you will truly enjoy her. It is unfortunate for her that whoever produced this CD did not think her voice could stand on its own. Clearly, over synthesized music sells better in these modern times. To have a musician that does not need their voice manipulated and smoothed over is rare- and that is KT. But this CD is in one word...Overdone- and perfect for the background of commercials and your favorite Desperate Housewives episodes...Save the money you would spend on this CD and see her in concert....KT if you read this - get someone who is not afraid of your talent to produce your next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not great","review":"There are 3 songs on here that are any good.

This tea tastes great, and if you just want a nice herbal tea to drink that may promote (non-pregnant) women's health, this is a great option, but beware if you are pregnant.

I have used this pan several times a week for the past 3 months, occasionally using a metal spatula, or metal tongs to remove objects from it. After using metal tongs to remove something this week, I noticed during washing that the coating is scratched to the point that I don't want to cook with it, for fear of getting chemicals in my food. I have consulted Tefal's website, and although they claim it won't scratch, scratches to the non-stick coating are not covered by the (limited, lifetime) warranty.I like the heft of the pan and the grip, but there's no way I'm dropping $50 for another one"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it.","review":"It's really a great eyeliner.

The book transcends sports though baseball fans will enjoy this well written autobiography. However, Mr. Morris' extraordinary story is more about fulfilling dreams that might sound like Don Quixote still going for the gold. He also pays homage to his family for their sacrifices and to his West Texas team that encouraged and assisted an injury-plagued high school coach and turns him into a major league pitcher at thirty-five. Great inspirational story worth reading because Mr. Morris along with Joel Engel tells an amazing true story with grace and honor.

I am a huge baseball fan and have often fantasized about what it would be like to play in the major leagues.Jim Morris takes us on a nostalgic journey through his childhood, adolescence, and early adult years, growing up in a military family. He describes, in painful detail, his troubled relationship with his father, the challenges he faced in his career, and even the difficulties he had in his marriage.The story is almost too good to be true. A Texas high school baseball coach in his mid-thirties pitching in the major leagues? No way! The climactic ending is the highlight of this book.

The fact is, no device can predict human preference in temp or comfort levels - regardless of bells, whistles, automated thermostat additions or device options - and since us installing this device in our work studios and homes, it has saved heating costs by nearly 40% or more in all locations. The simple philosophy of turning it on when you're cold and turning it off when you're warm is simple. And its proven to only be used when residents are truly cold. 40% in all locations is enough for me to believe and I will continue using this device at current and future locations.

The color of the caps DO NOT MATCH THE COLOR OF THE PENS at all other than the red, black & gray! Very frustrating when doing art work with them!! The name of the colors are not even on the pens! Come on Sharpie, as much as we pay for this product you could at least if not match the lids to the actual colors, put the name of the colors on the pens! How do you expect us to do our work effectively? I finally made my own color chart, gave the colors names, then took white ashesive tape wrote my color name and put on the pen. (If you try to use the black marker and write it on the pen it will of course soon wipe off as permanent does not stay on this type of plastic).

I have tendinitis/arthritis in my pinky finger, and the compression gloves are nice, but I wanted something just for the finger. I bought these expecting a little better quality. They immediately \\"ran\\" when first pulling them on. After about 4 wearings, the sewing along the seam started coming undone. I have worn the one about 6 times and it has run, much like stockings, barely has any elasticity left to it and is coming apart and leaving fuzzy lint everywhere. They aren't that expensive, but considering I have a multi-pack with only a few small enough for my pinky, it is rather disappointing.I would not recommend these. Not worth the time or money invested."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoddy workmanship","review":"I was initially pleased with the product until I tried to use it....the sewn seam began to unravel within 1 hour of use.

Guests on \\"Dillinger & Young Gotti\\" are few but appearances by Xzibit, Beanie Siegel, Roscoe, RBX, and Slip Capone are utilized to the fullest.For any true fan of the Dogg Pound Gangstas, this is a must-have and if you are a fan of crew leader, Snoop Dogg, then you may want to check this LP out as well, for his family tree is full of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is sick","review":"Yo this is crazy D.P.G stuff A definite for any west coast rap fan.

Being a James Dean fanatic, I naturally had to own the first movie that names him in the credits. The cover of my copy (Dean in a army helmet) is deceiving, because the movie is really a story about the death of Jesus. Dean is the apostle John, and has about 2 lines. If i could give this movie zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting piece from another era","review":"I give this a high rating as I found it a curious little piece, that is definitely dated, but valid within the context of the time it was made. The concept is the story of Easter as told by a chaplain to a bunch of war-weary youths on the front lines, with scenes of the Easter story inserted between the battlefront scenes at beginning and end. Yes, it's hokey at times, but that's how they used to make spiritual movies back then. Although, the airs and phony low voice that James Dean affects are almost laughable, he only has a few lines, and he's somewhat in the background for the most part. Costumes and sets are a bit corny and stereotypical as well. But through the negatives, a nice little spiritual period piece from another time in Hollywood shines through. As a item of memorabelia for James Dean collectors, it's worth the purchase to see one of his very early roles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV Easter Program, April 4, 1951","review":"This is a made for TV Easter Program that aired April 4, 1951. It was made by Family Theatre, Rosery Crusades. It is a very dark and blurry broadcast, somewhat typical for TV in the fifties. James Dean (before he was a star) has a very minor speaking part as the disiple John. The real stars of the film are Leif Ericson, as pilate, and Ruth Hussey as Mary the Mother of Jesus. Gene Lockhart plays Matthew and Roddy McDowell plays \\"the Professor\\".The plot opens with a group of wartime soldiers questioning their fate and the seemingly pointlessness of capturing another hill on Easter Sunday. The chaplain drives up and tells them the story of Easter starting right after the Crucifixion.The script is original and includes the wife of Pilate running away and joining the Christians and a Roman soldier making a pass at Mary Magdelene. Combine this with the bad costumes and fake beards and you have a movie that rates about 1 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived joy","review":"This was the first humidifyer I ever bought.

I hope next year's offering is an improvement and gets back to her usual style of fast pace and exciting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"Certainly a let down from previous books. The plot is boring and the conclusion was predictable from chapter one. Recommend skipping this book and you will not need an alibi to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Sandra's worst!","review":"I love Sandra Brown and because she writes so slowly I expect wonderous things from her. THE ALIBI was by far one of her worst books - I didn't even bother to finish it. It was formulaic, predicatable, and BORING! I love you Sandra - what has happened?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work :(","review":"I am an avid fan of Sandra's and have snatched up everything of hers even from her Erin St. Claire and Loveswept days. The Alibi has too many subplots and forces you to take a while to warm up to the plot. The characters are never fleshed out to the point where you really care about them. And unfortunately, I figured out who done it by page 15 though I wasn't really sure why the killer did it. She also left quite a few of her subplots dangling and cut the book off abruptly. I realize romantic suspense is all the rage but I kind of wish Sandra would write a sizzling, lusty Southern burn-up-the sheets true love story and take a break from the intrigue. As I said, not her best work. Think I'll re-read Slow Heat in Heaven or Fanta C and forget about this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"It's impossible to imagine a book like this making the New York Times best-sellers list. It is horribly written, horribly plotted, garbage.

Except for this book...Although, THE ALIBI was 560+ pgs long, I found that I was caught up with the story from page one. Truly loved the sweet love-at-first sight theme btw the H/H, and this coming from someoen who loves romance books. The mystery was well paced, it never seemed to get too stale or boring and ending was supring, like a good mystery book should be. I would've given this book FIVE stars if Ms Brown added a bit more about what happens to the H/H afterwards. After the murderer was caught did they, H/H, get married, have kids, what happened to Hammonds career, romance btw Davvy and he ex, etc, alot seemed to be left unsaid, ... guess I just didnt want it to end there, hehe. I would recommend this book to any fans of romance OR mystery novels. This is a keeper, well done, Ms Brown, bravo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the heat?","review":"No heat, no sizzle and very little edge-of-your-seat intrigue made The Alibi one of my LEAST favorite Sandra Brown novels. Definitely bottom of the list with Charade and Unspeakable. Pick up Best Kept Secret or any of the Texas! trilogy for an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sandra-Brown-Caliber","review":"Surprisingly, this book was very disappointing to say the least. The plot was very choppy and it did not hold my interest. As an avid Sandra Brown fan who has always enjoyed her novels, I found her style of writing in this book to be very eclectic. I enjoy and appreciate her old and new styles of writing, but this was definitely not Sandra Brown caliber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Brown Yet.","review":"This is a classic Brown romantic suspense thriller. She combines her usual star-crossed lovers, with a twisting plot, a little danger and the inevitable brown passion. The story line is much more involved than in the past, incorporating murder, corruption, the legal system and an assortment of potential villains.Great potential for a sequil."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow paced, easy to lose interest","review":"I have read most of Sandra Brown's book and I agree that this is not one of her most exciting books. I found it too slow paced and too caught up in mundane details. Half way through I started skimming until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fast-paced reading..but I need closure!!","review":"After reading over 25 Sandra Brown novels, I feel this one is, as expected, an excellent read. As promised, The Alibi delivers satisfying suspense. However, I think the novel ends too soon. As a HUGE FAN of Ms. Brown's past romances, I believe it would've helped the novel if the relationship between Hammond Cross and Dr. Alex Ladd, though believable, is developed a little further (past a week). For example, what happens after he tells Charleston he is her alibi? Ms. Brown should write a sequel to this mystery novel, perhaps go into the romance between Hammond and Dr. Ladd a little further. Maybe even develop the characters of Davee and Smilow, I think they were a great pairing and I would love to read on and find out if anything happens between them after the mystery of Davee's husbands death is solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown's worst, complete garbage.","review":"I can't believe Sandra Brown actually wrote this tedious, predictable book. It has none of her trademark plotting or enjoyably sleazy characters. Everyone in the book is one-dimensional and the killer is so obvious it's laughable. The story centers on a local prosecutor who sleeps with a woman he meets at a county fair and when the woman turns up as a murder suspect, he's too wimpy to come forward as her alibi until he's proven she's innocent. Even Brown's usual hot love scenes are dull, and, even worse, told in flashback! A waste of time and money. I think I'll reread \\"The Witness\\" or \\"Exclusive\\" to erase all memory of this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too long","review":"I would give this book 2.5 stars(why doesn't amazon offer the option of 1/2 star?)At the end of this book, it became more fast paced. But she could definitely have cut out a good 100 pages or more and it wouldn't have ruin the story. I decided to skim through page 250-400 or so, just reading the dialogue. I'm finding some of Sandra Brown's books to be long winded, while others are really good and the perfect length. Total hit or miss. Nothing out of the ordinary, this is just a typical murder mystery,other reviewers can go over the plot for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I could hardly wait to get it done!!!","review":"In all of my years of reading Sandra Brown books, I have never come across one that was below four-stars until now. \\"The Alibi\\" was very boring and I found myself skipping paragraphs and hoping the next page would prove fruitful.

It contained most elements I look for in an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't help but not like","review":"Just when I thought Sandra Brown could do no wrong. I couldn't even finish reading it and with the thanks of one helpful reviewer I felt no need. I really had to force myself to get through as much as I did, and I never not finish reading something. ALL the characters really weren't likable they were all deceiving little liars. A little more than halfway through the book and the story was going nowhere. The girl was most likely using him anyway and they were too wrapped up in each other to do their jobs which was a ridiculous case. Some rich, old jerk murdered. That could be interesting but not enough this time. I love the author but not this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner","review":"A friend gave me this book to read and it sat on the shelf for a couple months before I picked it up and started to read it for lack of anything better to read at the time. I really didn't think I would enjoy it but I loved it! It had murder, suspense and romance. Although I found it hard to believe that Hammond could fall in love with Alex in less than a week, it was still a good book. I couldn't put it down until I got to the end and found out who the murderer was. It wasn't until the last 20 pages that I started to suspect it might be who it ended up being. Very well written. I love how Sandra Brown makes her characters so witty. I got a kick out of Davee. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys murder and romance reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am not sure if the reviewers who called this a \\"page turner\\" ever read one prior to this. The book started off boring and had trouble ever becoming more than mildy interesting. I would recommed less descriptive detail and more character development..maybe just even one likable character. The end was decent but it does not make up for a bore of a book as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greed, Lust, Sex, Law, Politics, & Power-in the South.","review":"This tale of greed, sex, lust, law, politics, and power in the South, features Hammond Cross, attorney, his investigation of a murder of one Lute Pettijohn, and the entanglements (legal and romantic) that follow. There's no shortage of suspects in this fairly well paced thriller. (Exclusive is also good by this author.) I see Matthew McConaughey (I'm not sure why) featuring in a movie version of this (if made). Anyway, as Cross looks into the murder, his invovlement with two women comes into play (one is a suspect). Also, his father (a rather pretentious man, to say the least) in his arrogance almost hopes to see his son \\"fall\\" from his standing in the community. It has all of the makings of a fine film, if (as I always say) handled correctly. May be a cut above most \\"romantic\\" books. Well read by Dylan Baker (with just the right amount of \\"southern\\" accent, so as not to make the characters \\"caricatures\\" of southerners)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potentially good story","review":"If Sandra Brown were a beginning writer, I would be much more understanding of the shortcomings in her writing technique. In The Alibi, she doesn't seem to have listened to her editor - or worse, her editor wasn't paying enough attention. The story itself has a great deal of potential, but the characters are flat, the dialogues stilted, descriptions inconsistent and the repetitions in vocabulary very very annoying. There is nothing more irritating than being told the obvious: that someone is acting hysterically because he or she is hysterical, for example. She and her editors would do well to re-read some of the truly great tight thriller writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful work! I loved this story","review":"I fell in love with this story. During the period deepest in the plot, i was literally queasy with apprehension because of Hammond's despondent situation. I couldnt wait to see how the story ended. But now that I am within hours of finishing the book... I dearly miss it. There were important messages to take away as well. I'm partial to the one she left through Ellen Rogers. Even though I'm not a woman the message is very applicable. Thank you so much Mrs. Brown and all who helped the effort foward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding and boring","review":"I love Sandra Brown and almost all of her books, but this one fell short. Its characters had no depth and it was hard for me to feel any emotion towards any of them, also the plot was boring. The characters were not well-described and I still dont really have a picture of what the DA Hammond Cross (main character) looks like. Actually I dont really know what any of the people look liked because they were barely described. If you want to read really good books by Brown pick up \\"Envy\\", \\"Breath of Scandal\\" or \\"Best Kept Secrets\\" which are only a few of her great ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"It kept me turning the pages, but.....","review":"Let me say first that I like Sandra Brown. But I sure wish her characters could be a little deeper and not so dense. They do the dumbest things! It's kind of like in the horror films when no right-minded young female would enter a dark menacing building at midnight...but they still do, you know? Everyone in the theater wants to yell, \\"DON'T GO IN THERE!!!\\" But the idiot on screen still does and all kinds of bad things happen. Overall, The Alibi was a pretty good plot with enough twists to keep my interest. The outcome of Sandra Brown's books is always a given: good wins out. Buy, hey, that's why I read them! I LIKE it when good wins! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful........one her best!","review":"I loved Sandra Brown the Alibi. It was one of her best.

BUT, Alibi was very slow moving, and quite honestly, boring. I found myself asking \\"Why did I spend all that time reading this book?\\" If you really feel you must read this book, maybe you should just read the blurb; that's as interesting as the book will get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as mirror Image","review":"her first big hit, Mirror Image was the type of book that made me become an avid reader of Sandra Brown, but from that book on, she has let me down. I keep waiting for another one as good, but she promises but does not deliver.Exclusive was boring...alot to do about nothing..an extended plot that seems to go nowhere. This book, as well as the last few start off great, but dwindle down to a boring middle, and I usually rush to see where or how it ends. I think she just lost me as an avid reader.."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring, boring","review":"I have about 25 pages left to read of The Alibi.

I put this book away after about 80 pages. The characters were neither likable nor despicable, they were just shallow and boring. The reviews indicated this was going to be a page turner - did this book come out on the coat tails of something fantastic by Ms. Brown? The spawning romance was unreal and unrealistic, the angst of the main characters (or at least who I assume were going to be main characters) had no discernable cause. Everyone was dark and disturbed, but what about? The mystery to me was going to be how many pages until something interesting happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining read","review":"An entertaining read filled with quirky characters, likeable characters and suspicious characters. The author combined a murder mystery with romance, upstanding characters along with scoundrels, and mixed in some second chances.

I received this book as a First Reads Giveaway and I look forward to reading more titles from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I just finished The Alibi last night. I loved the characters, loved the story. The only problem with the book was that I didn't want it to end.

Mirror Image, Slow Heat In Heaven, Texas Trilogy - to name a few. My question is: Why Not? That is where your true talent lies. I know there are millions of your readers who love \\"those\\" kinds of books and were and are willing to pay the hardback price for the sheer joy of reading a book by a writer with your immense talents.

How I long for the old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A read that's just OK....","review":"Romance fans, skip this one! In fact skip all Ms. Brown's new books---she's trying to distance herself from us all. Suspense fans, this is an OK read, Hammond Cross is an interesting character. And the mystery, did keep me guessing--for a short time. This is one of those authors, that has dropped off my automatic buy list. This book is worth a trade at the UBS, and that's about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Sandra vs. New Sandra","review":"There's definitely an old-Sandra Brown style and a new-Sandra Brown style. Those who liked the old seem to find a lot of fault with these newer ones - that's why the ratings for this book range from 1 to 5 stars! I, who only started reading the new style, think she's quite good! Good romance, suspense, and lots of action! Now, having said all that, I must say that I didn't really enjoy The Alibi. The book I really liked was Exclusive. But this one - I got frustrated about 2/3 of the way through and skipped to the end just to find out who did it.What was the problem? Brown couldn't make Alex and Hammond \\"connect\\" for me. Tons of physical attraction but otherwise - too many secrets, too many lies, too DRAGGED OUT. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brown has done it again","review":"Sandra Brown has once again proven that she knows how to write an excellent suspense novel. I became a fan of Brown's way back when all she wrote were romance novels. Over the last few years she has proven she can mix romance with intrique. I was spellbond by The Alibi. The characters were very believable and complex. I had a hard time trying to figure out who the killer was.

The author considers any method other than his own to be unfounded and of no benefit. Could we say he is coming from a very egotistical point of view? I wonder how we and all the animals survived the thousands of years before modern medicine and his birth! The cover of the book is also cleverly laid out in order to trick the consumer who is interested in learning about alternative therapies into thinking the book will give them information on learning how to use complementary care. This was a total waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"The editor collected this set of articles in a very biased, one-sided and narrow fashion. No objectivity. The editor has obviously not had any experience dealing with horse situations where \\"modern/conventional\\" medicine has failed or under FEI competition rules where invasive techniques are illegal.At least Dr. Ramey is consistent with his tenacious view of alternative therapies. I would be more interested if he were to turn the microscope on conventional vet medicine to see which procedures and techniques had the gold seal of the scientific method: double blinded, randomized and controlled. Medicine and the scientific method are both fantastic but there may be others...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked forward to a balanced and scientific review BUT","review":"was very disappointed and felt the author did a disservice to balanced critical review and assessment. I did agree with a number of the findings in the books but the author should have provided less personal opinion and adhered to balanced scientific review rather than providing sweeping generalisations of certain therapeutic modalities. Absolutely regret having bought this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an objective viewpoint","review":"This author is well-known for his disparagement of alternative therapies. Do not buy this book if you are looking into alternative therapies for your animals as the author is strictly a \\"Western Medicine\\" kind ofguy and very biased. Having used chiropractic, homeopathic, and acupressure on my horses, dogs, and cats, alternative therapy is extremely helpful when provided by a competent and trained professional. Research your practioner's training and background.

The Author sets out \\"open mindedly\\" to investigate numerous alternative therapies for horses and proceeds to discredit each and every one of the therapies, concluding that the horse owner should revert to consulting the Veterinarian. A desperate attempt to preserve the Veterinary Profession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"As an equine massage therapist, I am always looking for relevant information which will help me be a better therapist and help my clients more proficiently. Even though I am a licensed massage therapist and a registered massage therapy instructor, I do not automatically believe that because something is labeled alternative or complementary that it is always good, or effective, or even non-injurious. However, I try to keep an open mind, which is what this author has failed to do. Virtually every summary for the alternative therapy which has been discussed ends with (paraphrasing) \\"there is no scientific proof that this treatment is effective in either humans or animals.\\" The author is obviously so biased against any non-traditional medical treatments that I consider this book of absolutely no value. In fact, I plan on returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toilet Paper Is A Better Buy","review":"Junk. The author wants a 'good 'ol boy' pat on the back from other veterinarians. \\"Atta boy, Davey, you tell 'em! Tell 'em all what quacks those alternative practitioners are. Atta boy! Sick 'em boy. Atta boy!\\" Oh why oh why doesn't Amazon allow for zero starts. Or even negative stars? The author does not know the first thing about alternative health care for man nor beast. Just a bias, non-open minded view. How do I know? Because he published the same kind of non-researched tripe about me. In one essay he lied about me at least three times. He probably thought I wouldn't see it. Don't believe ANYTHING this author writes. Go online and just read articles for free. This book is pure swill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real science prevails","review":"I just wish there was a book like this about dogs! Of course, its easily applicable to dogs (or people, for that matter). The dog booklists are filled with dog books touting alternative medicine, as is my local library, but the information presented in this excellent, easily understood book is nowhere to be found. Dog owners should understand that most highly touted alternative remedies don't stand up to scientific scrutiny, and could learn, via this nifty book, how to properly evaluate the claims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author bias against Alternative Therapies","review":"Given the interest of many regarding alternative and complementary therapies, I think it should be mentioned that while the author does have some good points, he does not believe that these modalities should be taught in veterinary school, nor does he ever advocate their use in any journal article he has written. All of his articles ridicule the use of these therapies. It is as if he has a mission to keep alternative and complementary therapies from being used among veterinarians. Yes, he does have some good points about lack of trials for evidence. But there are many articles written and published about this growing field, and there are plenty, plenty, plenty of medical practices we take for granted that have never been tested with clinical trials. So take from it what you will, but know that he has not published any article with a positive light on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much \\"Neigh\\"-Saying","review":"All those glowing reviews convinced me this was a worthwhile book, but I was sorely disappointed. This is not a guide because it doesn't provide any guidance. I might have understood if the authors were skeptical about some of the therapies, but they have nothing positive to say about any of the many possible alternative therapies from acupuncture to herbals. None seems to have enough scientific evidence to convince them. They criticize all. The obvious conclusion is not to do anything except follow current, conventional veterinary approaches. It makes you wonder whose interests these writers are trying to protect."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Debunking Alternative Therapies\\"","review":"This book is a little bit like reading an Air Force report on Roswell, or a CIA report on the Kennedy assasinations.

Granted, these songs are all well-written and performed; yet they lack something of the latter work. Nevermind, though; THE EARLY YEARS, VOLUME 1 serves as a good introduction to the pre-SWORDFISHTROMBONES years of Waits career, and is also a fine addition to already-exististing Waits collections.

Instead of buying or renting 'The Detonator' from '06 why not watch Wesley's earlier '00 film 'The Art of War' instead. Why you ask? Why because it's virtually the same movie that's why. Oh there are a few differences, Wesley Snipes is now a C.I.A. agent instead of a U.N. agent, he's in Poland instead of New York and the beautiful woman he's protecting this time is Russian instead of Chinese. Other than that it's EXACTLY THE SAME! 'Detonator' Director Po-Chih Leong even had the nerve to copy the supposedly surprise ending used by Christian Duguay in 'The Art of War.'Positives: Silvia Colloca adds some feminine charm to an otherwise dreary film and Matthew Leitch is excellent as tough guy Dimitri.'The Art of War' is a very good movie, 'The Detonator' isn't.

The plot was steady and flowed good. The screen play i give four scores it was a good story with a happy ending, well written. Considering the fact that Wesley Snipes was the only big name actor in the movie; the acting was mentionable well, Silvia Collica did an excellent job as an actress, and displayed great eye candy to the movie. Although, it could of had a more vivid love scene that would have made the movie well rounded.

I found this one in a $5 discount bin while shopping for groceries; If you know what you're getting, it's worth every penny of $5. The movie is unoriginal, cliched, and utterly absurd. At the same time, it has some fun chase sequences, fight sequences, and is surprisingly well acted, given the recycled-from-every-action-movie script. It was fun to watch, if you went into it expecting the sort of thing you'd find in a discount bin. Also, the movie was filmed on location in Romania, and is pretty visually interesting for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this movie","review":"Do not, do not purchase this movie. It is so strange and the plot is so screwed up that I turned it off after 15 minutes as I didn't know what was going on.

If free agency is on your radar, then this book will give lots of practical food for thought and ideas to spur you forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you think like a self-helper","review":"This book didn't do it for me. It has a lot of overview, theory, selective details and glancing personal accounts--but all of it in a tone of an infomercial. The problem is that this way of approaching any subject rarely gets people to achieve the goals that Pink urges us on to. Instead, it continues an ongoing addiction to self-help books which may be the next silver bullet to our woes. . . but most often it's not.He takes a broad survey of a lot of fields, grabs bits of information and formulates it into theories about being a free agent. Having been a grunt-work temp, a freelancer, and now a homeschooling mom (free-agent education), the descriptions seem less-than-rigorous and his conclusions are overdone. Zeal is a powerful force and Pink has lots of it. But it's a force that hasn't matured and mellowed into evenhanded understandings which are brought by in-the-trenches personal experience.

In the meantime, I became acquainted to Screamin' Jay by buying,\\"Spells and Potions\\" which I feel is a better representation of Hawkins' work.\\"Black Music For White People\\"is at the end of his career and sounds as though he was being manipulated by some producer that threw him in with some musicians that were very good, but they just don't have the soul of the early recordings that are on \\"Spells and Potions\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"He Still Has It","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet coz no one's gonna read this review. Why? Coz no one has the time of day for Screamin' Jay Hawkins or his later work. He's always been looked at as a novelty act and was never taken seriously. Well, this 1991 album is pretty entertaining. Sure, his age has restricted him from being as caffeinated as his younger days, but don't be fooled by his age. He's still crazy and has a voice powerful enough to blow you through the wall. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was all excited to get some Hawkins after hearing his amazing voice (and seeing his cameo in Mystery Train). This album looked like a good best-of, but boy is it a stinker. The all-synthesized backing is ear-achingly cheesy and this definitely doesn't sound like Jay at his best.

Nothing his mother did could stop him from walking into town to the barbershop to tap dance for the customers. She also discouraged Clayton from working in the local cottonseed mill when he was twelve, but Clayton was determined to switch from farm work to factory work.Tragically, he lost his left leg after a terrible accident at the mill, but he did not lose his fierce determination and love of dancing. Clayton \\"Peg Leg\\" Bates emerged to become one of the country's most famous tap dancers, performing in front of white and black audiences and opening one of the first resorts in New York's Catskill Mountains to welcome African Americans.

However, beware the seller! The picture above clearly shows two Nozovents in one package, but you only get one. So you do NOT get what the seller has pictured here. (I wrote the seller asking them to send the second one but they refused, offering my money back if I went to the trouble of sending the box back -- but then I would have been out the shipping so it wasn't worth it.) Note that the seller says \\"1 Box(s)\\" as part of the description -- but the picture shows two Nozovents in one package. Maybe the seller thinks that this makes up for showing a misleading picture of two Nozovents for sale, but I very much disagree -- it's just misleading to picture two items when you're only selling one.So, I strongly recommend Nozovent and would definitely buy this product again, but I'd never buy another product from this seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snore aid","review":"Product seems to work well.

The Danny Thomas stuff is separate from the Stooges stuff, and all of it is public domain stuff, that shows up over and over again under a myriad of titles, but the same old stuff.I am not knocking the actual material. I enjoy the Stooges, and Danny Thomas is great.

The diversity of repertoire on this CD, unfortunately, does not make up for the absolutely HORRIBLE singing given by the choir.The choir's sound is often very strident, vowels are sometimes strikingly spread, the sopranos sing the correct pitches sometimes, etc. The first thing I was struck with when I listened to the first CD track was how nasal sounding the choir's tone was and how they were not in tune with each other. The choir's lack of attention to tuning and balance is mostly illustrated in the faster, rhythmic pieces, when the choir barrels through each selection with about as much attention to musicality as a dog might at dinner time. Even the slower pieces, though, are significantly unbalanced, and sung with a shrill timbre.This is one of the worst choral CDs in my collection...soon to be OUT of my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the birds","review":"This is the second one of these I have bought, the only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that the dish is rather shallow and with the tons of robins drinking at it,I have to fill it every morning.The first one lasted three years so that was good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot tub for the birds","review":"This is not to say that the water gets hot, it doesn't.

Bad science, blind following of Darwinism and selective feeding of information to humanity needs to be challenged by Scholars and Thinkers like Dr. Immanuel Valikovsky. I have read some of the negative reviews. I do not think some of these reviewers ever read the book in its entirety. It is sad that some people who call themselves scientists are not doing science but making up popular stories. This is a great and wonderful book that helps everyone to start thinking outside the false-scientific box. Everyone is a scientist if we start using our observational skills and reasoning abilities.

From her early coffee shop folk days to her jazzy period to now, one can never expect the same thing from our favorite Righteous Babe.Unfortunately, Ani misses her mark on this album. Ani's a great lyricist, but here she focuses too much on the lyrics, leaving the melodies to be BORING! She plucks only a few notes on her guitar throughout the songs, as if she's only trying to create some background ambiance and nothing more. You'll enjoy the album more if you just read the lyrics and not listen to the CD at all...which is maybe what Ani wants you do to.I would recommend you buy \\"Knuckle Down,\\" \\"Evolve,\\" or \\"Not a Pretty Girl\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ani's Worst Album","review":"She's been on a downslide for the last couple of years, but to judge by this cd its getting worse. She tries to ryhme words with themselves, she continues on the completely mined-out vein of politically complaining that has replaced all her other subject matter lately, she's forgotten any way to show emphasis or go for emotional impact other than just repeating the first verse as the last verse, apparently...I can't find a good thing to say about this one, which is a real shame because Ani is one of the only artists out there today who could fairly and without exaggeration be called both a poet and a geniusShe needs to take some time off and get some new material and new inspiration though, and until she does I'm afraid all her cds will be as bad as, or worse than, this one.

Although some of the smaller pocket guides are also handy, this book really made our (my!) trip. It was a constant source of great info on how to get around Paris by using the Metro and bus system. It also provided excellent info on many small, local points of intrest (don't miss out on Jo Goldenbergs restaraunt; great food, reasonable cost & marvelous entertainment!) The only small problem I could find is that the prices refered to in the book were listed in French Francs. As everything in Paris is now in Euros, it took a little searching to discover that, at last calculation, $1.00 was approximately 7 FF. As Paris is an expensive city to visit, this book more than paid for its cost.... Not to mention it being a great conversational subject for my girlfriend & me!

I hate to say it that way, but it does. I took it with my nose held and chased it with pure honey and it still had some nasty flavor left over in my throat. And the taste lingered for awhile. Really disappointing because it's a good vitamin but has proven impossible for me to take.

The objective appears to be to teach young girls to be snarky, self-centered, sexist little jerks. I look for books that teach my children to be self-confident and self-reliant. In attempting do to so, this book actually does the opposite. The main character is little more than a self-absorbed young lady with complete disregard for others. Some may find the way in which she turns away suitors to be entertaining. But even from a literary standpoint, its gets old quickly. If you are looking for a book that can teach young girls how respect that which is most precious to them and not be at the whim of every suitor, I highly recommendPrincess & the Kiss: A Story of God's Gift of Purity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the type of Princess I want my girls to be like","review":"Princess Smartypants is basically glorifying a spolied brat who is mean and vindictive and not very nice.

The story is fun and the illustrations are fabulous. Read it with your kids in the tongue-in-cheek manner in which it's presented. It's a children's book and as long as you continue to expose your kids to all kinds of other books, I don't think you need to be concerned about them \\"internalizing\\" the message here. Or, better yet, here are messages you can instill: For girls, if you say you don't want to get married, then it's not nice to tell boys that if they do as you command you'll marry them and then pull a dirty trick on the one who actually does everything you say; For boys, if you want to get married and a girl says she doesn't then you should find another girl who shares your views of marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"I bought this book for a friend's daughter's 6 year birthday.

I cannot adequately express the pleasure I receive from this cd. I am not an audiophile or vocal technique expert but I know good music when I hear it; this certainly qualifies.

She's a pro all the way and makes the best of something very embarrassing that happens(I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it). Eric Shaffer, the director, is an acquaintance of mine and I've grown to love his work. He's quickly becomming a major talent among directors and I hope he continues to do good work, such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sondheim Jewel","review":"From start to finish a marvelous evening of Broadway in your own home.

I had heard about the blooper with Carol Burnett's skirt and was really looking forward to seeing it as several reviews mentioned that it was on the dvd as an extra.It wasn't.Now, I don't know if it's because there are two different versions of this dvd on Amazon.com, one selling for $8.97 and one selling for $18.97 (or thereabouts) and the more expensive version is the one with the extras?I will say that having the exact same reviews on both versions makes it impossible to tell for sure.I love Carol Burnett and one of the reasons I picked up this dvd was that blooper...and now I kind of wish I hadn't since the blooper isn't there (and none of the other extras as well).And that's why I knocked off a star.

BUT NOT TOO SUBLIME SCHUBERT","review":"In my review of 23 October 2000, I found the Mozartean's performance of the Schubert Op. 100 wanting in nuance, depth and feeling, all enhanced by particularly poor sound quality and the use of historical instruments. If possible, the Op. 99, here, fares no better and, in many ways, seems even more superficial, routine and annoying. Not even the inclusion of the berceuse-like Adagio (Notturno) in E-flat, nor the exhilarating Allegro in B-flat, both shorn of their burnished warmth, improves matters in the least. A most disappointing issue on all counts.[Running time: 59:43]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It.","review":"While this book is not the best resource on Ex Libris, it is a great book.

(The author's general bias is in favor of national health insurance of some sort).

Despite the majority of its tracks coming from the now infamously bootlegged Lillywhite Sessions, this album has a fresh feel. All of the songs have been polished up and made much more professional sounding. This album has a much more laid back feel than Everyday, with more classic DMB insturmental jams. If you liked the Lillywhite Sessions, you will love this CD and shouldn't hesitate to buy it even if you already have the Lillywhite Sessions. If you thought that the Lillywhite Sessions were missing something, the tweaked lyrics and instrumentals of Busted Stuff are probably just what you were looking for.

I hate to say it, but DMB is going downhill. \\"Everyday\\" was a step in the wrong direction and now this- even further backwards. The other albums released lately, \\"Live in Chicago\\" and \\"Listener Supported\\", were nothing too special with typical jams to songs we've already heard.Dave Matthews is an unbelievable musician, but needs to take to time to record a new sound (Or head back to the old sound which made him popular).In addition, I play the guitar and the songs on \\"Busted Stuff\\" are not complicated what-so-ever!

Unfortunately, if you were looking for an official release of some of the great tracks this is a poor representation. Where Lillywhite had a certain raw edge to it and the musicians showed a little passion for what they were playing, Busted Stuff left you feeling like they showed up in the studio just going through the motions.The tempo of the songs have been slowed down, a greater focus has been put on vocals, and the wide range of percussion has been replaced with a simple drum kit.I guess that I was bound to be disappointed by this album because I enjoyed Lillywhite so much. My expectations were just too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"Compared to the Lillywhite Sessions, Busted Stuff is a letdown. The darkness and passion is missing, replaced with a lighter more commercial tone that undercuts the lyrical content. The raw confessional tone is muted on Busted Stuff in favor of less depressing but also less intimate one. The reworked versions oddly are less catchy and more bland than the originals. For example, the reworked lyrics of Big Eyed Fish seemed jammed in, ruining the flow of the song. The only new version on Busted Stuff that almost improves upon the Lillywhite Sessions is Raven. The lyrics, while changed, are actually intelligible. I just wish they had stayed true to the spirit of the LWS and not fiddled with what was one their best recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return to form!","review":"After a dry run with Glen Ballard (and i Do Mean DRY!) the band comes back with some thought provoking and beautiful music.

Busted Stuff has all the LS songs minus Sweet Up & Down, JTR and Monkey Man. The two new songs, Where Are You Going and You Never Know, are solid additions to this superb album. If not for the unreleased Lillywhite Sessions, I would have given this a 5 star rating, no doubt. They're back to their groove and not afraid to run with pure instrumentals (eg. Kit Kat Jam) as well as the 8-plus minute Bartender. Bundle all that in with the free DVD and you've got yourself a solid buy.

His best works in the past have seemed intensely inspired and uplifting. \\"Busted\\" is a perfect title for this watered-down collection of songs that leaves much to be desired for a long-time DMB fan. There was such a special feeling of togetherness on his debut album, \\"Remember Two Things\\", live performances on the \\"Recently\\" EP, and others. \\"Busted\\" sounds like an uninspired jam-session in which Dave is performing for record executives, not the spirit of his fans or his inner self."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dave Matthews album we should've gotten last year!","review":"This is a great album.. we should've gotten this last year.. but we never did..instead we got \\"Everyday\\" this album is great, I can't say anything about it.. only Bartender for some reason skips and I have no idea why? but I still have my receipt so I'll return it in exchange for a new album.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Dave CD to Date","review":"Wow...too think that I once considered myself to be a Dave fan.

They have somehow managed to take 9 songs from the Lillywhite sessions, and suck out all of the emotion that made them great songs on the Lillywhite recording. Busted Stuff sounds nothing like the way these songs are performed in concert, and I am definitely glad about that! The two new songs are mediocre at best. By anyone else's standards, the two new songs are good tracks, but by the standards that dmb fans have been given the luxury of having, these songs are weak at best.Bottom line, this disc is incredibly weak. The producer butchered the levels on the instruments, and Dave's vocals were frequently flat and lacking emotion.

The electric guitar and rap influences did not impress me, and I felt as if Dave was trying to please the majority instead of dedicated fans. Naturally, I purchased a bootleg copy of the Lily White Sessions as soon as possible. Imagine my shock, when, a year later, Dave releases the same cd, with a few added and/or changed tracks. With Busted Stuff Dave has gone back to the days of yore and renewed my faith in him. The title song is one of the most beautiful and haunting I've ever heard, and the last song, Bartender is full of philosophical questions dealing with Dave's ideas of religion. The songs in between all deal with complex issues and come out as beautiful pieces of almost poetry. Serious Dave fans should be ashamed if they do not own this cd, and Dave trashers should be silenced until they have heard it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyday is DEAD! Long live the ol' DMB!","review":"This is what they should sound like. A great return to the organic sounds we all loved before Everyday tarnished the streak.

It's just an enjoyable album from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"I used to think the Lillywhites was their masterpiece....","review":"The Lillywhites were outstanding...dark, brooding, and brilliant. Then came Everyday; an efficient, powerful album that, erm, didn't touch on the issues we have come to expect from The Dave. I was a little wary of Busted Stuff - I was scared the band would try to erase the (painful) memory of the Lillywhites by altering the actual songs themselves. With baited breath, I bought the CD, popped into the car stereo, and went on 70 minute drive. My fears were short-lived. Busted Stuff is everything the Lillywhites were...and more. The songs have changed, and not for the better or worse....they're just...different. I heard Dave described them as being being endowed with the \\"sweetness of meancholy\\", and this is a perfect description. Highlights: You Never Know, undoubtedly, Where Are You Going?, Big Eyed Fish segueing into Bartendr, and the epic Raven. The DVD, although a little content-shy, is also brilliant.Rock on, DMB, rock on"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret song on Busted Stuff","review":"Hey everybody if you listen to Busted Stuff be sure and find the secret song that is included. It is apparantly one of the songs originally on the Lillywhite Session but then scrapped from this album. Apparantly somewhere along the line someone, without permission reportedly, added the song back onto the album. I bought the album first thing this morning and found it already (it takes a little work, but not much), but a friend bought a copy at a different store and couldn't find it-- there may be copies out there without the song. I don't want to give too many details, that would remove all of the fun!!! haha. Good luck hunting and it's a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave, you've done it again.","review":"Wow- this is awesome. It takes a lot of talent to write and song and make the listener feel your pain when they listen ot it. You weep with Dave on \\"Grace is Gone\\" and the amazingly brillinat \\"Bartender\\". You rock out with Dave on \\"Grey Street\\" and \\"Kit Kat Jam\\". You sing along with \\"Where are You Going\\" and \\"Big Eyed Fish\\". Dave. Dave. Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave is here to stay","review":"I have to admit i was a little hesitant to buy this at first. after all, Everyday was a little disappointing. but after hearing the cd with songs such as Bartender, Grey Street, and Raven, i knew it was well worth it. this is the Dave Matthews that everyone has grown to love. Grey Street is probably my favorite with the solumn lyrics and the music filling in perfectly instantly makes me want to go see him live. A must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they kidding?","review":"I'm not certain what the other reviewers heard, but this album is a joke. While i enjoyed the music a great deal, the lyrics were awful. I kept wondering if Dave went to grade schools and accepted submissions from 3rd graders for these songs. The world already has too many bad poets, and Dave's decided he wants to be included in the list.Once again another subpar album from the Dave Matthews Band. Spend your money on something far more useful, such as earplugs for when one of these songs comes on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Adult Alternative","review":"I really, really want to like Dave Matthews. By all accounts he is an artist that should appeal to me. But I really find DMB to be so bland and devoid of any melody, texture or color. This album really epitomizes that. I know, I know- it's just me. There's got to be something here that I'm missing. I'm willing to keep trying, because I think there is something of substance here, even if I haven't found it yet. But in the meantime there's so much more good music being made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look who's back again","review":"Too bad. I mean, too bad that Dave Matthews has to live with the fact that he keeps re-writing the same song to infinity. Too bad millions have fans have resigned themselves to thinking this stuff is the best music on the market. Too bad that these fans spend their hard earned money on concerts and t-shirts and albums and posters, etc.The fact is that DMB has tricked millions of people into living and dying with its every move. They're not doing anything different than what CSN or Simon and Garfunkel or Grateful Dead or Carlos Santana or Graham Parsons or the Byrds have done before them: folky/poppy acoustic guitar tunes with a sometimes lysergic edge. The only difference? The bands listed above were actually good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted Songs.","review":"After two particularly challenging and inventive albums, the DMB return with a collection of songs that they scrapped in late 2000 before collaborating with Glen Ballard on the far more exciting Everyday. These songs should have stayed in the trash. Rife with vague spiritual references that insult the listener and will surely have college potheads for years going, \\"You know Dave Matthews is a Christian, right?\\", the lyrics are an unrewarding mess, and the music is bland and completely under-produced. The bright shining moment, \\"Gray Street\\", would probably be a weak spot on any other DMB release, though that song together with \\"Where are You Going\\" may be worth the money if you find this album used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Busted Stuff","review":"If you want to get all depressed then you should buy this album. I am a great DMN fan and have been to see them twice, but I am very disappointed in this album. I would describe it as elevator music for the tragically sad. Get a bottle of vodka before you listen to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing It All Back Home Again","review":"Don't let the title fool you. This is by no means a collection of rejected outtakes. If you liked The Lillywhite Sessions, you'll love the eleven tracks on Busted Stuff. Carter is once again drumming like mad. LeRoi and Boyd woo. Steffan bounces all around. And Dave sings with a the heart we always knew he had. Do yourself a favor, buy this album. You'll be smiling the whole journey through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the greek","review":"busted \\"lillywhite\\" should be the REAL name of this album, as these tunes were originally \\"thrown out\\" when dave met steve ballard and \\"everyday\\" became the new album instead of this stuff...now, granted, it has been re-worked and re-written, real dave fans will probably like the original versions best, and you can only get it by downloading it from morpheus or kazaa..the bonus dvd is WAY cool, as is the xtra stuff you can access from your computer!! definitly a must for any TRUE fan....**** out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"pitiful","review":"This album gets lumped in with Everyday and Before These Crowded Streets as horrific albums at best. Yes, I said Before These Crowded Streets. That was a miserable album that needed editing in every way shape and form. BTCS was marred by never ending songs and unconvincing melodies. This marked the decline of Daves songwriting ability. Things have only gotten worse. Of course, he will always be incredibly talented and can live and tour off his only 2 good albums: UTAB and Crash. Yes, he only has 2 good albums (you cant include live albums). Face it folks, its over for our man Dave. Talented beyond belief, yes but he has lost it and once a band or artist loses it, they rarely recover. He'll have legions of fans buying new release after new release for years to come just hoping / praying for a bit of the old magic but I can assure you, it is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and relaxing, but no Crash","review":"Busted Stuff is full of nice, slow, relaxing music. There are some very good ballads such as Grace is Gone and Digging a Ditch but there are no unbeilavable songs. Dave's songwriting seems to decline a little on this album. There are no great songs like Two Step, Crush, or Stay on Busted Stuff...just slow relaxing ones. There are no fast, up- beat songs...a little dissappointed but it's still better then most music out today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This cd rocks, i highly reccomend it to anyone. Kit Kat Jam is one of the best ones on here besides Where are you going. GO BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-buy for any DMB fan.","review":"I must admit that I was one of millions who downloaded the \\"Lillywhite Sessions\\" and to some degree that may have taken some gloss off of \\"Busted Stuff\\" for me, but for any real DMB fan, this CD delivers. For anyone who hasn't heard \\"Sessions\\", this CD should be a treat and for those who have, consider it a reinterpretation of great songs. My only qualm is that it is missing \\"JTR\\" and \\"Sweet Up and Down\\", two of my favorites from \\"Sessions\\". All the songs are great on this CD. It is classic DMB. If you are a fan of DMB, there is no question, you need this CD..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This album is great! Unlike die-hard fans who have followed the guys since the very beginning, I got into DMB with \\"Everyday\\"--which I absolutely adored. I was not disappointed by this album. Dave's voice is great--especially on the title track. My fave song on this record is \\"Grace is Gone.\\" What a treat it is to have a studio recording of such a beautiful song. All in all, a great buy from a great band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave can do no wrong!","review":"I just think that this album like all the rest is very original and very easy to listen to. Every song has a different theme and that's one thing i love about Dave. He never lets me down!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what to think","review":"I have to admit I'm a big Dave fan, and I love pretty much everything he puts out, but I'm not very impressed with this one for one main reason---the songs all sound the same! I've always been impressed with the way he can make a whole album, a fantastic one, and all the songs sound completely different, yet all good, much like what the beatles could do. The basic sound he has going on the album is good, but it's too constant, I need variation. Either way, Dave is brilliant and I'm sure will continue to floor us with his brilliance, and his loyal fans are willing to look past a couple of flukes every once and awhile. Love ya Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I am excited each and every time a new CD is released and feel that what others consider Dave's pop attempts are still better than anything else out there. Be that as it may, this new one is the best thing since Under the Table and Crash. You won't be able to stop listening... Can't wait to go listen so more. Don't listen to others who want to ruin the experience over analyzing things... Just go listen for yourself and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than \\"Everyday\\" at least","review":"I've been a big man of Dave more many years now. Concerts and cd's have become a must. While I'm happy with \\"Busted Stuff\\" compared to \\"Everyday\\", which i wanted to burn, this cd still isn't as good as \\"The Lillywhite Sessions\\" disk. Many of the songs are the same, but the versions on the Lillywhite cd are ten times better. You'd be better off downloading that cd for free than spending money on this. But, if you do want this, you'll at least have to satisfaction of knowing that you're buying a much better cd than \\"Everyday\\", which made me lose some respect for Dave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"When I listened to this album for the first time, I was blown away. And I continue to be blown away every time I listen to it. This album is like nothing DMB has done before, the mood is a bit darker than any of the other albums. Still, every song on this album is excellent--something that cannot be said of the previous album, the very disappointing Everyday. At any rate, this is a must have CD for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"If It Ain't Busted, Don't Fix It","review":"Had they not toyed with a good thing I'd have said this album should have been a 5-star recording, but I've had the internet rough cut for over a year and I must say the Lillywhite Sessions are far better than this re-recoreded effort. First off, many of the lyrics have been changed (Grey Street, Big Eyed Fish) or dropped (Kit Kat Jam), which lessens the brooding quality that pervades the Lillywhite version. Also, some of the tracks have been dropped; most notably the rocking sax-charged JTR and driving Sweet Up & Down. Only Digging A Ditch and Bartender seem to have escaped unscathed and appear here almost identical to their Lillywhite predecessors. Sure the sound quality is better on the Busted Stuff album, but the intense mood of uncertainty, longing and regret that pervades Lillywhite has been lost in the name of unnecessary revisionism. I'll stick to my net copy--thanks anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE DMB!","review":"Heres a short review, for maybe the best album to come out this year, so far. First off, all the songs sound incredibile! The production is excellent, you can hear all five playing at once. The best song is one of the two new tracks, \\"You Never Know.\\" This is the DMB we love. Get this album, all the songs are sweet! This is another great album from them, a perfect album to listen too ANYTIME, doing ANYTHING."},{"rating":"2","title":"DMB is back with a great album","review":"I was hesitant to buy this album because the Everyday album really disappointed me. I thought it lacked the DMB's eccentric sound. However, the moment I put Busted Stuff into my cd player~I knew this cd would be jazzy, happy and musically involved like the others before Everyday. If you liked the \\"pop\\" attitude of Everyday then you may not like the interesting sound of the new album. Personally I love it and thats what distincts DMB from all the other artists out there~~~They are different and unique!!!! Great job Dave and the band!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The original tracks are better","review":"As mentioned above, all but two of these tracks were leaked on the Internet months ago. If it were up to me, I would have just released the old tracks in nice remastered sound and it would have been a better CD. The re-recorded tracks are ok, but Grace is Gone doesn't sound as melancholy as the original and Bartender lacks some of the awesome bass lines and drumming that made the original cuts incredible. It seems like DMB just ran through the motions for the sake of re-recording the songs. I just bought the CD, so it may grow on me, but for now I think I'll listen to the bootleg. Or maybe just make a custom CD with a couple of the old tracks. I am a huge DMB fan, and this CD is better than much of the 'music' being released these days, however I am not blown away."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this album","review":"What's wrong with the really good pop that they did on Everyday? I don't understand why they have to throw in jazz and dark stuff onto their albums. The saxophone player sounds grittier, and I liked it more on Everyday when he sounded closer to really good saxs players like Kenny G. Also, where's all that electric guitar? It's just missing. It's as though they made this album so that people could smoke marijuana while listening to it. Last, the lyrics are bad. Songs like \\"I Did It\\" from Everyday have much better lyrics.I just don't like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I Am not a DMB fand or will I ever be. The lead singer is boring, has annoying voice, cliched lyrics and the same songs all the way through. The rest of the band whoever they are seem to do their best out of weak material. They don't explore new territories or try new things. This is a tipical album for young girls to pick up and sing a long to thinking that this is the best thing ever. Boring and trite. The only reason why i give this 2 stars is because it has couple of allrigt songs and they do know how to play well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Additional Busted","review":"The case fell apart when opened & the additional busted CD would not play in player. It would error out and then be ejected."},{"rating":"2","title":"DMB's evolved version of Lillywhite Sessions","review":"Busted Stuff by Dave Matthews Band is the official studio release of their \\"leaked to the internet\\" Lillywhite Sessions CD. Included on the enhanced CD are two new songs: Where Are You Going, and You Never Know, as well as a separate DVD with bonus concert material. Busted Stuff represents a cleaned-up and re-worked Lillywhite Sessions reflecting DMB's ever evolving style and musical talent. Hard core DMB fans may take offense to the re-working of their favorite Lillywhite Sessions songs (most of the songs have had major work done to them, including tempo and lyric changes, notably Kit Kat Jam which is now instrumental). That being said, it doesn't take long to accept and enjoy the new take on the old fav's. This album is again (like Everyday) a representation of the band's post Steve Lillywhite growth and expansion both musically and commercially. I highly recommend this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DMB Album","review":"This album is just awesome,another DMB masterpiece! I have all the DMB albums todate and so far, this is the best \\"NON-LIVE\\" album they have made. I am a huge Carter Beauford fan and in this album, he showcases probably the best chops in any Alternative band. A must have for all DMB and Carter Beauford fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this disgrace?","review":"I must say as a huge dave fan I am greatly dissapointed with this rework on Lillywhite. It was like the energy was sucked out of the original and locked away in a dark room. Captain, which is an incredibly dark and mysterious song on the original, now sounds like something that would be played on an easy listening station. The one redeeming song is \\"grace is gone,\\" which was sweetened up a bit from the original. Dave, I support you buddy, but this seems like a sorry way to make a few dollars, I sure hope Steve Lillywhite gets a piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"more of the same","review":"this album represents more of the same stuff that was released before. after a while dave mathews really starts to sound dull. there isn't much if anything good coming out of this album, therefore 1 star is all it's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave","review":"Who doesnt love Dave. Only the best around. Always classic. All around good music, great lyrics, and some amazing talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great come back","review":"This new DMB cd is not like Everyday. It's a lot better, you can find a lot of really good songs with a mixture of the old stile of DMB and new great sounds. The best songs are You Never Know, Grey Street and Grace is Gone. You will not find a bad song in this new Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Is A God!","review":"Dave Matthews is THE most talented singer/songwriter to date. Releasing Busted Stuff may not have been on his top priority list but the fans thank him intensly. Busted Stuff is pure genius and will go down in the DMB record books as one of the best. That along with Crash and Under the Table and Dreaming. It goes back to his roots instead of trying to be in the \\"now\\" like Everyday. Don't get me wrong, I did love Everyday. It just doesn't have what Busted Stuff has.Thanks for the music Dave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sit Back and Enjoy!","review":"I have all the DMB cd's released and each one has its own personality. (yes even Everyday) I really enjoyed Busted Stuff and yes I have the bootlegged LillyWhite sessions but just like hearing the guys in concert they put a different spin on the songs. I am tired of hearing how the band sold out on Everday and how the LWS was how the songs SHOULD have been played. I give them an A+ for continuing to grow and try new things. Afterall if every CD sounded like the classic Crash they would be complaining that they had no imagination. Buy this CD, sit back, relax and get ready for a great time. Keep it up guys!! I will continue buying your music and enjoying it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album!","review":"Dave and his colleagues return with a type of album that originally made them the commercial success that they have become. Not as good as the bootlegged \\"Lillywhite Sessions\\", but still a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"fixed not busted","review":"busted stuff by dave matthews band is unbelievable. after listening to the lillywhite sessions for the past year and a half I was wondering how this would sound. all of the songs that were redone are better. I didn't think they could do bartenter better, but they achieved it. The ending of that song is amazing. Greystreet is one of the best songs off of this album. The new songs are great to, you never know is great and this is a song that could have been on btcs. I don't have a favorite dmb album, its to hard to decide they are all unbelievable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust Me on This One....Buy It","review":"As a big DMB fan, I of course was interested to hear this album, especially coming off of \\"Everyday.\\" I have most of Dave's albums with the exception of the last one and this is one terrific album. Every song, with the exception of track 5 (Captain) is fantastic.I originally wasn't a fan of the title track, but after listening to the CD several times, it's a catchy song. \\"Grey Street\\" really starts the great momentum for the CD and is a great lead in to \\"Where are You Going.\\" I could go on and describe all the other songs, but the song that makes it mandatory you buy this album is Track 7 - \\"Grace Is Gone.\\" All you have to do is relax, grab your favorite beverage and let the song take ya. It's lyrics and melody will stick in your head after the first time you listen to it.Do yourself a favor and buy this CD. It's one of those albums where every song is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK, there are better paper towels","review":"These towels are thin and rough, and they do not tear easily.

At first this seems to be a problem. Till they start looking at the ghost as data which has somehow been recorded. Think of it - data that could be stored for a long period, with little loss of information, in a medium that could be mass produced. The title kinds of gives that point away. If they could just figure out how it WORKS - without having to kill people.The real horror is the last ten minutes when you realize just how old the stones are and what they really hold.

The special effects haven't aged well, nor have the early 70s fashions, but the script is outstanding - blending plausible science fiction and unsettling horror in the way Kneale did so brilliantly.Disappointingly, though, this DVD lacks the commentary that accompanied the BFI DVD release (listed on amazon.co.uk at prices ranging from 49 pounds to 199.99) - a conversation between Kneale and horror writer/critic/enthusiast Kim Newman.

You will probably hear unexpected echoes of the Celtic and the Middle Eastern. What may surprise you most is the vocalist on the record. If you are not familiar with countertenors, you may expect the worst of tenors and sopranos, shrill and straining. Instead, you get a lovely, effortless, floating high-range voice. If you *are* familiar with medieval music, this is not the most impressive album I have ever heard (Drew Minter gets too trilly and belcanto for my taste here and there), but it is worth four stars and sticks to the Middle Ages instead of (as so many do) spending far too much time off on Renaissance stuff.

Material like what is found in this book strays far from this goal.An Earth/Universe that is 6000yrs to 10,000yrs old is as credible as a flat Earth or geocentricism. The fact that we have multiple independent lines of evidence for the big bang theory (14b yrs) and a 4.5 b yr old Earth is factual should be a wake up call to these people.My recommendation to anyone that wants to get a handle on the Young/Old Earth debate is to read \\"The Genesis Debate\\" where these different views are debated back and forth. Also Hugh Ross' new book \\"A Matter of Days\\" set for release in June this year is definately a recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternate Cosmology","review":"If you want a 400 page tirade against astronomer Hugh Ross with a preposterous cosmology thrown in that includes such ideas as \\"white holes\\", a universe centered on our galaxy, and \\"quantized red shifts\\", then this book is for you. I view Brian Greene's writings as a much better investment for someone seeking an enlightened education in the latest cosmological findings.Sarfati apparently considers Hugh Ross the biggest threat to Christianity since the ancient Romans. Why else would he mount such a vicious, malicious, and personal attack.Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassingly bad","review":"I stopped reading materials published by Answers in Genesis and the Institute for Creation Research after reading an article on the ICR web site that claims the speed of light has slowed down over the last few thousand years. That is absolutely preposterous and insulting to any reasonably intelligent person. Mathematics is not a science of ambiguity. I am not less of a Christian or believer because I use the brain God gave me to think about things. But the pseudo-science propagated by these folks is embarassing and makes Christians look bad. The personal attack against Hugh Ross is unnecessary and renders this book as the work of an amateur.

His work is not about attacking other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"The simple facts.","review":"Jonathan Sarfati makes many assertions in his book, but he and his readers should consider the following.Sarfati's theological claims are not considered to be correct by the majority of evangelical Christian scholars and theologians.Sarfati's scientific claims are viewed as absurd by the entire scientific community, many of whom are themselves evangelical Christians. Could it be that if the large majority of educated evangelical Christians disagree with Sarfati, then maybe, just maybe he might be wrong? I suggest that if you are honestly seeking truth, then compare his arguments with those of Dr Hugh Ross (the topic of Sarfati's book) and please MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND IN WHICH DIRECTION THE EVIDENCE POINTS.

If you can put up with those two things for the first few washings, you will really like these sheets.

In turn, Pat Travers covered the song \\"Tramp\\" on his album \\"P.T. Power Trio\\".By their second studio album (\\"While You're Down There\\") they had added two new members and completely changed their sound, so if you like one you may not like the other.The guitarist for this group is/was Snuffy Walden, who now does a lot of TV music, but back when this was cut was one heck of an axe-man.Another reviewer indicated that only Stray Dog and ELP were on Manticore, which is not true.

They might not have been as good from a pure technical standpoint, but they weren't awful either.Wayne plays deputy Sheriff John Steele as he goes undercover as a drifter in New Mexico to find out who is behind the cattle rustling. Ruthless Land baron Sam Crew sends his Henchman Arizona Frank Bailey out to capture a herd of cattle being brought in by some new settlers.

To some, the advice found in these pages may prove to be repetitious and common sense, but I personally found the sections on theories and case studies to be a highly useful tool to reinforce the core ideas of graduate level writing that grad students sometimes forget in their zeal over their research interests and meeting those deadlines. One drawback, is that it is geared towards graduate students who study international relations where the case study method is most prevalent. In other segments of the field, the large-n- method is empathized, meaning that other students using that method may need another book. Overall though, most students of political science should find something useful in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a guide to methods","review":"This book is not a guide to methods, but a guide to how to write an under-grad paper.

However, you may have to watch this alone if you need the subtitles, or don't have a friend that likes dark movies. I would have given it 4 1/2 stars if I was able.

The stickers that are to decorate the portions of the airport don't stay on. The item appears to 'fold up' into a case but it doesn't even do that.

There are several structural problems and coordination problems in using the car elevator, namely a 7 year old does not have the coordination to simultaneously lift the ratcheting car lift with one hand while keeping all the accoutrements on the top of the airport so they don't fall and scatter. He grew frustrated, and after watching him try several times, I wanted to throw the silly thing out the window for him. The airport itself is very tiny, the runway non existent and the only way to hold all the little cars and trees and suitcases and every other little thing is to store them.

The truth is we've all been there at one time or another and he does a good job of capturing these feelings, as well as the conflicts and afflictions of those attempting to live a Christian lifestyle while engaged in battles of the mind, body, and the spirit. The musicianship of this work is excellent and true to form in terms of what we've grown to expect from Tonex--he keeps it interesting.

It is at times, hard to follow, and he cites every quote that he uses to absurdity. Other than that, those being really small things if you think about it, it is a great book. It looks at some things that people usually don't look at for answers and meanings. He doesn't seem aggressive, no, in fact he seems like he really wants everyone to take him seriously, and he is, at least in this book, always very civil and gentlemanly. He looks at logic, antitheism, philosophy, and theology. It is probably better to think of it as a beginner's philosophy book. Happy reading... if you dare. Ask yourself if man can read without God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not the next Schaeffer . .","review":"I was about 15 when I read this the first time, and was mightily impressed by it. Since then I have had six years of life experience to add, and two years of Philosophy at Bristol University - and looking back on the book I can see weaknesses I was not aware of before. As stated by other reviewers, Zacharias does an awful lot of \\"argument from authority\\" and often little to back it up. He does make some good points, but they are often repeated and bulked out with numerous illustrations (which are helpful, but tend to just pad it out some of the time). If you only want to scratch the surface of philosophy then this is probably what you want - if you want to dig deep then try 'Christian Apologetics' by Norman Geisler. Habermas and Geivett's \\"In Defense of Miracles\\" provides a staunch refutation of Hume's (and by extension, Flew's) arguments against the possibility of miracles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Eye opener.","review":"This book is excellent reading. His passionate arguments and his cosmopolitan approach help us escape our egocentric cleanroom worldview. He takes classroom philosophical ideas and tests them against the real sweating persons. It helps us realize that ideas have consequences. Add it to you library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A plead from authority.","review":"If you want a good Christian apologetic work, this book isn't it. There is nothing here except big words, insults, and arguments from authority. I don't believe there is a single instance where Ravi Zacharas uses logic or reason to prove any of his points. Atheism leads to immorality - why? - because some guy in a Nazi death chamber said that the gaurds didn't believe in god. Evolution isn't true - why? - because Phillip Johnson said so. And so on.Zacharias needs to read some books on atheism if he wishes to attack it. For one thing, *he doesn't even know what atheism is!!!* He defines atheism as the \\"dogmatic denial of God\\" because Paul Edwards and others said so. Of course, he gets absolutely nowhere attacking his straw-man fantasy version of atheism.This book will work only for Christians, because Zacharias goes on and on about how God wants this and it would be great to believe in his God. Things that only a Christian would agree with, without any forethought or proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"What will happen after God is declared Dead?","review":"The 19th century philosopher Nietzsche said that \\"God is Dead, and we have killed him\\". Now a century later we can look back on the 20th century and see just what happens when man thinks he can live without God. Dr. Zacharias takes a look at atheism and extrapalates its logical outcome. Much like Nietzsche did he comes to some horrid conclusions, but then shows how those conclusions have manifested themselves in the 20th century. Ideas do have consequences: What are the consequences of the idea that \\"God is Dead\\". Read Can Man Live Without God to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian Apologetics for the Postmodern Age.","review":"This is the definitive defense of the Christian faith against postmodern nihilism. Zacharias shines the light of Biblical truth on the intellectual barrenness of the 1990s, and shows how the Christian message provides satisfying antidotes to the prevailing moods of meaninglessness, despair, and hostility toward the very concept of truth. Ravi Zacharias is a worthy successor to C.S. Lewis and Francis Schaeffer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what he sets out to do, not a comprehensive arguement","review":"Appreciated the book, though Zacharias has a few logical mis-statements. This book, in my opinion, was not intended to be a comprehensive proof for the validity of Christianity. Ravi accomplishes what he set out to do, showing areas where Atheism is lacking and Christ offers help. A readable book.A person could easily knock some holes in the arguements presented by Ravi. But such a person, I would hope, feels the honest need for deeper answers to life's questions than can be derived from an atheistic viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a real argument.","review":"The problem with this book is it doesn't do what it claims.

Daniel Auteuil was brilliant as the good natured but intensly nervous Henry of Navarre, knowing full well the risk he ran in coming to Paris for his wedding. Both the King and Anjou appeared not only physically as I would have imagined but personality was spot on as well.

Sadly I was not able to buy it from Amazon but found it in London (that's the beauty of having a multi-system VCR!) and immediately purchased it!

Falsely billed in such a way that it is aimed at both lovers of history and those who appreciate cinematic eroticism (and hey, who doesn't?) Queen Margot fails to deliver to either audience. Purporting to enlighten us as to the machinations of those who paired the Protestant Henri (future king Henri IV) with the ardently Catholic Margot, played by she of the stunningly beautiful eyes, Isabelle Adjani, what unfolds in this slow-moving period piece is little above confusion. I pity anyone who goes into this movie without a background on French religious history of the late 1500's, and I truly can't grasp what it is about this production that makes critics review it so generously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I'm blown away by all the reviews praising this film for historical accuracy! While it has its moments, and Adjani is luminous in the role of Margot, this film is as anachronistic and silly in its own way as the American fluff piece, \\"Dangerous Beauty.\\" Catherine de Medici's court was definitely full of political intrigue and sex, but the wedding scene, for example, comes across like a costume party in a discoteque.

One which is believable, and accurate in its minute details.This coupled with a cast of highly expressive actors, moving in a Caravaggio-like atmosphere, often nightmarish but always riveting.

I am a big fan of Dumas, and had read the book that it is based on, \\"Marguerite de Valois\\". I usually don't like films based on books, but this film was truly spectacular, with all the elements that make up a good Dumas story: romance, swashbuckling, history, and tragedy. Unfortunately, the film is no longer available for sale. Does anyone know where I can get a copy?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting, and violent.

I was tremendously disappointed in this book. Allen removes Elliot from her natural location, and, as Elliot spends the novel commenting on her dislocation, so the reader feels dislocated as well, with no reward. The circle of Friends whom Elliot relies on is gone, and the characters and suspects she encounters here are not developed enough for us to care. The reader is told much but shared with not at all. I hope if Allen continues to write this series that she returns Elliot to her home in Cambridge and novels that are more fully developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"I really loved all three of the previous books in this series. I am not a Quaker, nor even a Christian, but I was deeply interested in Elizabeth Elliot and her spiritual journey, which complemented in a very suitable way the mystery story in each book.I had some difficulty in believing that the same author had written this book. It was preachy, unfocussed, digressive and completely unsatisfying, all things the previous ones were not. I have much sympathy with the political position the author takes in this book, but it's a d**n poor mystery story, and not even a good political rant, as each gets in the way of the other. Distressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ageism Reigns!","review":"I read a previous Allen Quaker mystery, \\"Quaker Witness\\", and enjoyed it though I found her repeated reference's to Elizabeth Elliot's age annoying. \\"Quaker Indictment\\"'s ageism is much worse. The two main characters met in college 40 years ago--therefore they are in their early 60s. Yet Allen repeatedly calls Elliot \\"the old Quaker\\". In the library copy I read, a previous reader circled some of the \\"old Quaker\\" references and why, \\"Why is 60 old?\\". Indeed, Ms. Allen, why do you characterize her as \\"old\\" so often? How old are you? Perhaps to you 60 seems the apex of decripitude. But the incoming Speaker of the House is 66; would Allen call Nancy Pelosi \\"an old Speaker\\"? I chide Allen's editor for not recognizing the ageism and correcting it. The story as a whole is not well done and the characters do not develop. It hardly deserves one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a mystery, a polemic on evils of govt and nuclear power.","review":"The \\"old Quaker\\", as she is constantly and irritatingly referred to in Quaker Indictment, should not have left Massachusetts.

Very Challenging\\". So far, I've only purchased his books, but since only about 20% of them are really tough, I thought it would be nice to get a book with nothing but the brain-squeezers. Unfortunately, the Sudoku puzzles here all fall into the \\"Light 'n Easy\\" category.A rule of thumb for how difficult a Sudoku will be is how many digits the puzzle starts out with.

Most songs are written by Lovich and Les Chappel, including the quirky Lucky Number, which was a huge hit. Not all are bright, happy numbers: Home, Too Tender (To Touch) and Momentary Breakdown are sad but beautiful torch songs, and there's a great version of Nick Lowe's Tonight and the old standard I Think we're Alone Now. This music has aged well and in retrospect, the following could also have been chart singles: Say When (equally quirky!), Telepathy, and One In A Million. Although welcome, the additional (Plus?) tracks add nothing spectacular since this album has always been perfect as it was. With such talent, it's a pity Lene faded into obscurity."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Lene!","review":"I got \\"Stateless\\" on vinyl when I was 16 -- I still have that copy.

Wodehouse books, but this one is awful. The combination of poor reading by Ian Carmichael (IMHO) and a derivative story with no comic timing make this one I recommend you skip.I can not believe that Wodehouse actually wrote this one. It seems like a ghost writer took many of his favorite plot devices (star-crossed lovers prevented from getting married and a cow creamer for example) and many of his common expressions (\\"like the cat in the adage\\"), crammed them into a paper bag, shook the bag violently, and then pulled them out one by one, typing as he went.I strongly recommend that you avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Help","review":"Product came knocked down with a bag full of hardware and NO instructions for assembly.

A complete stranger who he knows for less than a few minutes. Was penpal Anne Hechte's character that desireable? The job search to become a liquor/deli store clerk or bust, seemed painfully degrading for this sucessful insurance executive who did not seem unhappy with his former life. The policeman who keeps his eye on Goldblum, seemingly knowing what is happening inside him while he undergoes this identity change, was also hard to buy. He had no motivation to do this as it did not appear that a crime was or would be committed. The speech about his only mini identity crisis near the end was a weak excuse for his watching Goldblum.I saw it through because I kept thinking something interesting would happen, a twist somewhere, but it failed to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I've been taking this trio for two weeks and have had nothing positive.

The characters in GATES are caricatures--I've seen characters developed much more fully in the space of a single comic book than this-- and the plot consisted of nothing more than a series of hokey hurdles for the main character to jump--even as he repeatedly, redundantly, insults and criticizes his relatives. Over and over. Farmer also suffers here from \\"tell, don't show.\\" Rather than watching the characters figure things out, we are often simply *informed* of this by the text. How disappointing. Unlike a previous reviewer, I don't wish to spoil the ending, but I have to question how someone can claim Urizen is a great villain when he scarcely even appears in the book. This is pulp material at its most mediocre and only the last few pages saves it from utter failure.

It is just too bad that Itami killed himself a couple of years back. . .Although Tampopo gets much more attention, this stands up against Juzo Itami's film in its own right. Featuring some of the same actors (look out for the truck driver from 'Tampopo'), this is an absolute must-see for anyone interested in Japanese cinema. It ranks with Mitani's best work, and is guaranteed to brighten up your day.

The character Zero Mostel plays is fastidious in his morals and attire, but even he changes. The character Gene Wilder plays resists to the end, but has to admit the sound of a rhinoceros is stranglely compelling.

You may only drag vertically but can form groups either horizontally or vertically. Half the time you are dragging, you ignite Meteos you werent aware you were trying to connect.So I tried an experiment. Frustrated, I quickly ran the stylus up and down without even looking at what I was doing.

Jane Miller will shock you, and she's not scared to lose the reader at points; but one is left in the end with the tangible sense that these poems respect the reader. Truly, to have this much Jane Miller in one collection is a wonderful value and a genuine treat.

Listening to him brought back great memories of good friends and college days. He talks about the environment and how much we can help save our planet.

It is both engaging and relaxing at the same time, simultaneously driving and laid-back.As one reviewer said, this is a highly polished recording, but please don't take that to mean it lacks passion and soul. On the contrary -- I wish more of today's groups had Incognito's passion!As good as Incognito's other works are, I must confess that \\"No Time Like The Future\\" is their best one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Mix Of Music Styles.","review":"A surprise CD-it was sent to me, when I made a mistake on my order. I found sometimes we can really over look-great music and excellent team work in putting together a CD. So many great songs on here, like It Ain\`t Easy-great vocals-More Of Myself likewise. Jean-Paul Maunick and many gifted artist\`s have done a fine work here-with-R&B- Soul- Rock- Jazz it is all here-wonderful CD-I say if you like a wide range of music-this CD is for you-one can\`t go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME AS USUAL!!!","review":"Having been an Incognito fan for years, I eagerly awaited this release. I must say, I'm VERY impressed!!! Love Maysa's voice immensely. \\"Wild and Peaceful\\" is the perfect song to lead off with, \\"Fearless\\" reminds me of my old-school house music days, and their version of \\"Nights Over Egypt\\" is one of the best I've ever heard!!! Can't wait until they tour!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Incognito's Best CD's","review":"10 years ago when I first purchased this CD in 1999, everyone was worried about Y2k. I thought then that is was very cool that Incognito put out a cd Called \\"No time like the future\\". I felt the title was inspirational and could put most peoples concerns about Y2k at ease. But when I placed it in my CD player and listened, all my feelings about the title were correct. This cd is inspirational, It's cool and calming as well. I have been a Incognito fan since the early 1990's and this CD as well as 1993 Positivity are my Favorites. I love this CD from begining to end, and It will always be in my Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it had more Maysa.","review":"This album seems to return to the Tribes sound of Incognito, at least in its direction. Maysa does some great scat singing in at least 2 tracks; I wish we heard more of this. For long time Incognito fans this one is better than \\"100 Degrees\\", but still not as good as Positivity or Tribes because the material isn't quite as deep, both musically and lyrically."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally - REAL music!","review":"In a day when everything is \\"studio magic,\\" it's refreshing to find a band that is authentic. This CD encapsulates the essence of music itself: creativity, passion, skill - it is amazing! Before hearing Incognito, I thought I had heard good music, now I KNOW what good music truly is. This album is worth the extra cash for \\"Yesterday's Dream,\\" one of the bonus tracks. Add to that, the elegant and exotic sounds of \\"Marrakech\\" (which happens to have a brilliant B-3 in it), the funk of \\"Get Into My Groove,\\" and the cutting-edge creativity of \\"Fearless,\\" and you've got a CD I'd pay $50 to have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No time like now to buy this CD!","review":"\\"No Time Like the Future\\" is the album Dexter Wansel would make today. Bluey has made a masterpiece. Every track is a winner. But then, every Incognito album I've purchased has restored my faith in music. In \\"No Time Like the Future,\\" my favorite tracks are the groovin'\\"Get Into My Groove,\\" the light, bouncy \\"More of Myself,\\" and the driving \\"I Can See the Future.\\" At first, I couldn't \\"get into\\" the remake of \\"Nights Over Egypt,\\" but the more I listened to the whole disc, (and believe me, I've played it and played it) I got into Jocelyn Brown's vocals. And Maysa is one of the best vocalists in music today. Since the first Incognito album that I bought, (\\"Tribes, Vibes, and Scribes\\" on a whim) to now, the Incognito listening experience has only gotten better and better. \\"100% and Rising\\" is my favorite, but this is a close second, and depending on my mood, is #1. Keeps alive the jazz fusion tradition started by artists like Dexter Wansel."},{"rating":"2","title":"voices and sounds to dream","review":"First of all, i need to say that i love MAYSA LEAK's voice, but, JOCELYN BROWN showed to us that she is the best r&b singer all around the world. \\"Nights over egypt\\" is a incredible song, with her \\"disco\\" call, strings and horns, chorusses and the duel of titans between jocelyn and maysa can takes everybody to heaven. \\"Wild and peacefull\\" makes me fell so good,and very proud to be fan of INCOGNITO at long time ago.Please,you that are reading me, buy this cd right now, and enjoy it!INCOGNITO ARE A BIG FAMILY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluey & Co. have done it again!!!","review":"Incognito has to be the most unique jazz groups around. Although they get their due, I believe they deserve much more acclaim from the jazz community than they get. Bluey is a jazz genius and should be recognized for the ability to captivate such a large crossover auience. Every where from reggae clubs, jazz clubs, disco's, etc. people love Incognito. I've been a fan for years and each release is a rejuvination on CD....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was introduced to the techno genre by a friend from Florida, an area rife with clubs very much unlike the usual fare where I'm from. My techno fan-hood was carefully groomed through artists such as Darude, Mirwais, Zombie Nation, New Order, Prodigy, and Rob Zombie. After experiencing such talent, I obviously have a hunger for more, equally well-done fare. Maybe this CD *is* equally well-done, but I just don't see it. Its beats and vocals are entirely too reminiscent of the disco era; and though I can see the inflence of the 70s on techno, I'd prefer for the genre to show where it's *going*, not where it's been.In a nutshell, if you're looking for pulse-pounding beats to get your adrenaline going, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low budget, high impact","review":"This relativley low budget wire ridden feast is truly a joy to behold. Flying warriors, ridiculous super powers and some very impressive choreography round out this entertaining fantasy flick. You'll be laughing at the hilarious wire work but also sit up in awe as you view some very intricate martial arts sequences that don't rely too heavily on wires. The main bad guy is \\"Iron Robe Yim\\" from the first Once Upon a Time in China and you really can't go wrong with that. All in all this is a great movie but be warned that if you're a newcomer to the world of asian cinema or you don't appreciate ludicrous wire work, you probably won't enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the modern emperors new cologne.","review":"Like the title says emperors new cologne.For people that think if it costs a lot then it is really good.They do not have the talent to go out and judge colognes.People who would go out in public wearing this crap have to be pretty simple.If people tell you that you smell good,they might be getting a good laugh.TRY BEFORE YOU BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative for raw beginner only","review":"I read this \\"book\\" and listened to the CD with sample mixes in about a half hour.

It explains naval terms, etc. as to a child which is who it was written for; stripped from the tale is what makes a good Douglas Reeman book: conflict with superiors, bravery, and the love affair between the young flier and his superior's wife. It is less than half the tale indeed. The ad for the book described it as a Bulls-Eye edition, no where was it mentioned that it was an adaption, which might have given me a clue.

I put thought into my menu, scoped out the competition, and even developed signature dishes. Food Service Menus took me several steps further. It provided samples of market and competitor surveys so I could determine if what I was offering was something that customers would actually want. The book really came in handy with links to menu building software and nutritional calculations. It seems like a lot of work to put into a menu. When you consider that that the majority of your profit rests on your menu, the hard work is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chet Baker strikes again...","review":"Speaking as a person who has almost everything out there that is on CD...this is not a huge departure from what you can find on other albums...but I will say that this album does capture the strength of Chet's trumpet playing during this live recording...there are no vocals on this set but the playing is fierce and the cats playing with Chet definitely have it together.I would recommend this CD to anyone seeking to get a better understanding to Chet's trumpet style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A $130 aquarium ornament...","review":"What a piece of junk!

I've used it for cutting clay out of a backhoe bucket, opening packages, pulling weeds, and cutting cheese. It is easy to handle, easy to clean, and really holds and edge well.The serrated edge is now essential to me. I really don't have any use for common straight blades that don't have that saw edge to work through tough stems or ornery boxes.You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Knive","review":"Once I removed the pocket clip (which I can't stand; you'll need a T6), it instantly became my favorite daily carry knife. After some adjustment, I find the combination of the finger guard and thumb stud a vast improvement for one-handed operation over a thumb stud alone. The liner lock is an excellent, reliable design; unlike the ones on my Buck knives which can easily release while using the knife. Thin, light weight, sturdy construction, nice feel and grip. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this knife","review":"Unlike some people I like the clip on this knife. It allows me to carry it clipped to my right front pocket and it stays out of my way. The thin design and profile of the knife keep it out of my way when reaching into my pocket for spare change or car keys. I stopped carrying a knife for a long time because I couldn't find just the knife that I wanted. This one is it though. I've had it now for about three weeks and haven't had a need to re-edge it yet.

Unlike others I actually like the pocket clip, which for me is unusual, but the combo of light weight and clip design make it easy to clip to your front pocket.The knife has an adequate (but not great) edge from the factory, but cleans up nicely. I have the non-serrated version. Amazon also sells a combo pack with the Evo and Evo Jr for $26 which is probably the best deal out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent knife","review":"I really like this knife for a umber of reasons, the first being the price. for the few bucks i spent, i can't complain one bit. it didn't come razor sharp from the factory, but close. a few swipes on my sharpening steel and this thing was ready to go. it opens fairly easily, and the locking mechanism holds it open securely.Overall, i'd recommend this blade for anyone who wants a good all-around beater knife that will hold an edge well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect carry along","review":"Gerber makes good quality knives and this is one of them.

I kept this one, but I rarely use it since without a clip its easy to lose. I would definitely recommend the next size up in the evo line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good knife","review":"Held up pretty decent so far.

But again, it was my fault for assuming it to be bigger.What isn't my fault, however, is how difficult it is to push open with just your thumb.

Very dissapointed and sent it back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Ordered this knife based on Gerber name. Mistake. It is extremely stiff and difficult to open with one hand. The handle is too small and does not have a good feel for me. (I probably should have looked closer at the specs). The clip is too snug for a pair of jeans and from what I've read here, will probably snap off after a couple of uses. All in all, this knife should sell for about five bucks. In the drawer it goes! Just my take. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice knife for the size.","review":"I have bought many Gerber knifes in the past and the quality is always high. This knife is no exception. The only thing that I didn't realize, but was due to me not looking closely at the measurements before I ordered it was how small it is. The pictures make this knife look a lot bigger than it really is. I'm sure the knife will hold up fine and it's nice having one that is a little smaller and light weight in my pocket. So I'm still pretty happy with it, but if your looking for something that can handle bigger jobs if need be I would just go with the full size version of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than I thought; awkward to open","review":"In retrospect, I should have bought a knife with a 3\\" blade. Everything about this knife--blade and handle--is just a bit too small for my taste.The blade was super sharp right out of the box.To open the knife is a two-step deal. Use your forefinger on a bump at the base of the blade to open the knife half way; then, use your thumb on the stud to open the rest of the way. You cannot open it using just the thumb/stud method. I find the opening process more awkward than other knives.Seems to be of typical good Gerber quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Foward Review","review":"I'll make this short and sweet. Ive had this knife for 3 months now and Ive had to sharpen it 7 times already. The only action this knife sees is a few boxes and my mail. Opening it is very stiff, you actually need to put some wrist action while you open it.I tried loosening the privet screw a bit,it was faster...but for the cost of blade play. The reason it has two star is for its weight and size. Honestly this knife is not worth it, if you want a knife with the same design, faster deployment, and a more durable blade.... Get the CRKT M16-01z its less then ten bucks more...Ps.. Whoever posted those pictures must think we're clueless... We all know what a fricken liner lock is!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The blade came very dull. After I sharpened it, it worked reasonably well for a few weeks. Then it broke. The studs came out which means it is very hard to open and it doesn't stay open at the right angle. I didn't even do anything that would be hard on it. It stayed in my pants pocket and I used it for opening an occasional box or package. Overall I am very frustrated with this knife and will be looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very useful","review":"I just can't imagine any good use for this knife. I liked the CRKT M-16 that I had. So I figured a smaller, cheaper version would be nice. This knife is just too small to be useful. I never realized this before on the M-16, because it's a larger knife, but the flipper stud makes the knife very difficult to hold near the blade. On a small knife like this, it reduces the gripping area of the already diminuitive handle.This knife is completely useless to me. I threw it in a drawer shortly after I got it, and I have not seen it, since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pointed and sharp","review":"Excellent pocket knife. Opening not as easy as other comparable knifes. Very sharp from the factory, impressive. I use my pocket knifes a lot. I am far from easy on them. This blade stands up to my use very well.

It is not removable, too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"good knife","review":"Had a Evo but lost it and got a evo Jr. instead. It was a great choice.

It had the worst acting, terrible dialogue, no suspense, and half the time I was wondering what the characters thought they were doing. The main character barely says anything. This series is played up because of the Mormon aspect, which is not a weakness, but everything else about it was painful. Nothing was resolved and at the end, you still have no idea what the \\"mysterious object\\" is, who is chasing after it, or why it needs protecting.

Is Steven Gage somehow responsible for said nightmare, or is there something far more sinister going on? There are some chilling and disturbing twists in this novel.The Anniversary is quite a clever thriller. The building of tension is intense -- and the aforementioned tension kept me turning the pages until the wee hours of the night. Amy Gutman has created a wonderful novel full of suspense and thrill rides. I couldn't recommend this novel enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAP","review":"I am a huge fan of Morcheeba, in fact, I bought \\"Who can you trust?\\" from Amazon.com and have since then been addicted to their sound. They have the modern sound and approach to music, but still offer fresh and unique flavor of their own. However, this album disappointed me and several of my friends who are also big fans of the band. In general, it sounds like 2 seasons of GAP commericals...cheeky and sweet; a little too sweet....like bubble gums! First catchy because it is quite different from the previous 2 releases, but does not have any substance to it.For those of you who have never heard of Morcheeba, please try their first 2 albums first ( I am sure you will be blown away) and listen to the samples of the songs from this album before you purchase. As to the band, if they do read these reivews, keep up your work b/c you ARE so tight, but perhaps stay away from the mass market influence and stay true to your sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you like disco","review":"I had never bought a Morcheeba album, but what I had heard sounded smooth, inventive, mellow and subtly funky (especially the amazing Blindfold). So when this CD came out I gave it a chance. This was a mistake. The way so much of it borrows from the worst of disco is a bad move. It's supposed to be uplifting, but this type of thing always sounds cheesy. Only the opening track is good in any way. I may still get Big Calm, but fingers crossed the band will not follow this direction long term. Maybe they should have took some valium during its production, because this turned my stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"virtually a complete departure from what this group did so well on their first two albums. heavily laden with boring choruses and a couple of straight out of left field rap songs, this album almost never delves into the deep dub vocals and soothing, tripped out rhythmns of Big Calm and Who Can You Trust? Quite a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragments of Big Calm","review":"This lastest effort from Morcheeba is a struggle to listen to. It's as if Hanson and the Bee Gees decided to get together to collaborate on some more real cheesy pop tunes. Where \\"Who Can You Trust\\" and \\"Big Calm\\" are both excellent albums in that the mellow, trippy vibe of the music instills a unique mood, this album makes me want to throw up. I'm not sure what happened here, but it is far from good, and far from the sound that origianally made me a Morcheeba fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who can you trust? Not Morcheeba.","review":"Man, I hate to knock fellow artists, but I have to say, COME ON GUYS!! I saw the track \\"Rome Wasn't Built in a Day\\" in the record store, and I thought, \\"Sounds cliche.\\" But believing strongly in the previous work of this group, I bought the album anyway.I couldn't stomach it. I believe strongly in Artists' Right to Mature and produce an album that I don't get at first. (Hasn't Dylan made a doofus out of everyone at some point?) But this album is all the same textural-musical sound put back together in a very poppy way. I feel almost like they reduced their sound to a formula and applied it to THEMSELVES to make their new record. They made a knock-off of themselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Morcheeba makes it better","review":"This album is another example of the innovative and futurisitc sound that we have grown to love. Well worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Morceeba I knew...","review":"This should not be taken as an in-depth review of the album, and perhaps I am being unfairly biased. However, I purchased this album expecting the signature trip-hop down-tempo Morceeba sound that they have been crafting for the past few years, and this album deviates quite a bit from that. Just a warning to those wanting a first glimpse of Morceeba or an extension of what they used to sound like -- this album is not representative of their other work. And personally, I much prefer Morceeba's older offerings, such as Big Calm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great Album","review":"When I read all these reviews of disappointed people stating how great \\"Who Can You Trust\\" and \\"Big Calm\\" were, one thing came to my mind: if you love Morcheeba so much, why did you miss their main point, to be open minded? Sure this album has different sounds, but it definitly is a Morcheeba-Style album, and it just makes people feel good (which was Morcheeba's intention). Perfectly done.Every single tone is well-placed, and Skye's vocals are smooth as ever. So, if your ears are not capable of listening to much more than one specific style, do not buy this one. But if you are up to keep track of the development of a great band which seems always to know when to play a specific note at a specific volume to sound good, regardless what style of music, get this album. And I'm really curios what comes next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO stars is more appropriate","review":"You've read it before: this is horrible, spine tingling, embarassing stuff! Morcheeba went from making a classic first album (Who Can You Trust?) and a really good sophomore release (Big Calm) to THIS piece of garbage? Unbelievable!As I said in a different review, this album PROVES that the exit of Skye Edwards (after 2002's Charango) had absolutely nothing to do with the demise of Morcheeba, 'cause it really doesn't get much worse than this!Only the title track deserves praise as being really good. The opening track \\"World Looking In\\" is okay, in that it MAY not give you the chills.But everything else? DON'T BOTHER! There are plenty of less painful ways to inflict misery on oneself: root canal without anesthesia comes to mind as something I'd much rather try than to give this CD another listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORCHEEBA'S Misunderstood Masterpiece","review":"This is an EXCELLENT CD...however, I know that had I bought it 5 or 10 years ago I would have gave it the same bad reviews it's been getting here...I am 32 now, and I find that as you grow older, you start viewing music more as entertainment and art, and less as a life saving prophecy...Morcheeba are growing older...and they're growing in a marvellous way...and I'm sure that it's only a matter of time before a lot of the fans who disliked this cd today will end up adoring it sometimes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO yourelf a favor..dotn buy this one.","review":"Who Can you trust ..a classic..Big Calm...a classic..Morcheeba are a great band..what happened...this album sounds like the bcakstreetboys havin a bad day!

Now with \\"FoF\\" it just went down hill...and never came back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sure Thing Gone Wrong","review":"I had purchased \\"Fragments of Freedom\\" looking forward to the quality music I had come to expect from Morcheeba. The flow of \\"Big Calm\\" that placed them in my heart is, sadly, nowhere to be found on this album.It is definitely more upbeat then their previous albums, yet I feel that it's a style not well suited to their talents. Although the first track, \\"World Looking In\\", has more frequently been the one coming through my speakers, it all seems just too pushed. The lyrics bring reminders of a certain sense of pop that I didn't think I was getting myself into upon this album's purchase.I suppose change is good for anyone, and I don't deny that right to any artist. Yet, I feel this change was pushed possibly by record label execs trying to reach another spectrum of audiences. Unfortunately, though, I don't seem to be a member of that crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"Fragments of Clich��s\\"","review":"Well, I made the mistake of buying this cd without listening to it first. I normally would do that, but I went ahead and got it solely based on the merits of the group's first two albums. I LOVE \\"Who can you trust\\" and \\"The Big Calm.\\" I don't know what happened with this effort. Perhaps no *effort* was put into it in the first place?! The music and lyrics are marred with clich�� after clich��. Many of the songs seem like a pathetic try at being disco-esque rather than laid back trip-hop. This style just doesn't work here, though it has worked on some recent albums (ie: Beck's \\"Midnite Vultures.\\" I'm sorely disappointed with \\"Fragments of Freedom\\" and will try to sell it before people realize just how bad it is. If you're interested in Morcheeba and don't have their albums yet, go with the first two. If you already have the first two, save your money and hope that their next album warrants more than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: Lousy.","review":"Compared to their first two albums, I feel I have been had. I can't even listen to it. I bought it w/out sampling it first. It really is pretty sad to get a bad album.

Unfortunately Fragments of Freedom has rarely been in my cd player after my initial listen. The songs are boring, repetative and the lyrics lack the airy beauty of their earlier work. The album falls flat as it trys to combine rap, steal drum music and the brand of trip-hop that Morcheba does so well. If you've got Big Calm and Who Can You Trust skip this album and get something by, say, Hooverphonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad... How could this happen?","review":"Big Calm is one of my favorite CD's of all time, and it's great from start to finish. I can't believe the same band made \\"Fragments of Freedom\\". I went into the CD store and bought it without listening because I thought it would be a sure thing, or even if it was 60% as good as Big Calm it would be worth the [money]. I was wrong. This should have been their peak work, their greatest moment as a band. But, sadly these days great artists are limited to one or two CD's before they eat it. Don't waste your money on this CD, buy some old Massive Attack..."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY GOOD FOR A PARTY!","review":"FRAGMENTS OF FREEDOM is really different from the 2 great previous MORCHEEBA albuns, WHO CAN YOU TRUST and BIG CALM...it's way more ROCK POP, FUNKY and FAST! at first, it's not the same MORCHEEBA, but after some spins i can really enjoy all the songs...just don't expect the same sound of BIG CALM...this one is REALLY GOOD FOR A PARTY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid Fragments and Horrid Rhymes","review":"Morcheeba's latest is miserable at best. The lyrics are incipid and the sounds are tacky. Morcheeba has regressed from edgy triphop to bubbly pop inspired nonsense. This album reminds me of accidently leaving that terrible Vitamin C song on the radio too long. Don't waste your money,stick with Who Can You Trust."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I'm afraid I must add my voice to the chorus of Morcheeba fans disappointed by this release. A weak attempt at commercial R&B/Dance, the edge and quirkiness that made their previous recordings so entertaining is almost entirely absent.Here's hoping that Morcheeba have gotten it out of their system, and get back in the groove. It would be a shame to leave so much potential unrealized."},{"rating":"1","title":"More cheeba, less pop.","review":"I am a huge trip-hop fan and have been following the likes of Massive Attack and Morcheeba since the get-go...this album was a shock! It seems that Morcheeba has gotten off the cheeba, gone to rehab, had their mind filled with tra-la-la thoughts and they documented it by making an album....\\"you and me were ment to be, walking free in harmony\\"....give me a break! Morcheeba is not Jamiroquai or Parliment - can't touch that funk...they should stick to what they do best...mello, lounge trip-hop the kind that makes you melt into the chair. They are trying to follow on the coat tails of Macey Gray....bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"insufferable, sacharine, dance skiffle","review":"This record was an absolute disappoint from start to finish. It's one of those experiences of loving a band, buying the new record, and trying desperately to ferret through each track to find something enjoyable to latch onto. And forget the people who wax pretentious about not judging the record in terms of its predecessor, broadening their catalogue or other such nonsense. It's unbearable from start to finish, a motley collection of misplaced disco riffs, grating dance pop and hip hop cameos that would stand much better on their own, divorced from this rubbish. I hope their next record is a return to sanity, or at least something palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Departure","review":"I often see ratings of one or two stars and think to myself that the reviewer was either a) too quick to judge or b) rates everything in their life as either good (5) or bad (1). But this is an album that I truly believe deserves a 2 star rating. This album is almost a complete departure from either of Morcheeba's previous two albums, and not a good departure at that. The wailing saxophone in the background of a few songs made me squeal. I beg anyone just now entering the \\"Trip-Hop\\" genre to please consider Morcheeba's other albums, or any Portishead album, but please look past this poppy creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, how the mighty have fallen...","review":"Having been a fan of Morcheeba since 'Who Can You Trust?' came out way back in the day, I was looking forward to their latest release. After the logical progression they made on 'Big Calm' to more accessible hooks and more mainstream beats, I expected another leap forward in song structure and lyrics. How disappointed I was! They've largely lost that Morcheeba \\"atmosphere\\" they're known for and their lyrics have become a mere afterthought. There may be two or three tracks that are worth owning here, but much of the rest is actually unlistenable. A major disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the . . . . ?!?!?","review":"Ok, the first two albums were great. Infact, they were better than great, they were greater-er (uh, yeah). Then came this album. Since then, I am afraid to waste my hard earned money on following releases. This album basically sucks (minus the short track featuring good ol' biz). It's like going to a disco on prozac and speed. They were doing great, and then the artistic momentum that they had created all of a sudden stopped. Don't take my word for it, look at the average # of stars it got compaired to previous albums. Simply put, this album bombed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad... and not in a good way!","review":"I want to respond to what a lot of other reviewers have said, here. I agree, the album is horribly boring. And it's absolutely fine to be a group that doesn't want to be labeled... genre-benders are the best in art, music, and literature. The issue I take with the album isn't simply that it's not trip hop, but that it's BAD. It's just poorly made music. Saying that \\"maybe they were purposefully trying to be corny with their lyrics\\" doesn't make the lyrics any less painful, nor does it save the poorly- and boringly-written tunes themselves. I'm simply not buying that this was some big experiment in sarcasm or irony. These are not \\"feel good\\" songs, they're \\"Ouch, are these really the same guys that did Trigger Hippie?\\" songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely worst CD on earth","review":"This is the very worst CD I have ever owned in my whole life and I'm not exaggerating here. I own a fair amount of CDs and this is definately the most horrible CD I have ever paid good money for. The lyrics are shallow and insipid and the music reminds one of the cheesy disco pop music of the 60s/70s. Do yourself a favour - don't even bother downloading the mp3s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sell out, with me oh yeah...","review":"After hearing Big Calm it broke my heart that Morcheeba could do an album like this one. The dreamy, trippy funk of their earlier days is gone, and has been replaced by catered-to-the-masses pseudopop that is, on the whole, flat and shallow. Almost like a critical mother, I have to say about this album, \\"they could have done so much better.\\" Well, hopefully this won't catch on and they'll go back to making good music (fingers crossed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I patiently awaited Morcheeba's new album. After listening to Big Calm and Who Can You Trust? I expected something grand. Needless to say when I picked up Fragments of Freedom, I felt let down. I would say that this pop direction definitely doesn't suit them. Skye is such a great singer and her talent becomes lost in weak lyrics and radio-friendly dribble. Hopefully their next album will return to their former glory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts OK, gets progressively worse","review":"The tracks on this album seem to be arranged in the order of quality, unfortunately in decending order. As a previously devoted fan, I can say that this latest work is really quite depressing. Oh well, maybe next time....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morcheeba, is just bad!","review":"I heard both Big Calm and Fragments of Freedom, and Fragments is just terrible. This is like cheesy 70's disco. I don't understand why anyone would buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum","review":"This is the most purile garbage I've heard in years.

I threw mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't trust Morcheeba with fragments","review":"\\"Who can I trust?\\" was an instant classic for me, and I don't even yet own big calm. When I wanted to own more Morcheeba music, all I could get in town was \\"Fragments of freedom\\". Big calm is nowhere to be gotten around here. Fragments of freedom is a fragmentation of Morcheeba's style. I literally skipped over most of the songs when I listened to the album the first time (something I almost NEVER do), because it just ain't right. On re-listening I can still find little to justify the money I spent on this album. I look forward to Morcheeba's return to their earlier style, or at least an evolution toward something worth listening to. And by the way, what up with that rap track, so not fitting....trying to keep up with \\"the sales chart\\" jones's???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing can be worse","review":"I bought this album on a whim because I love Trust. I have two words to describe the decision - \\"big mistake\\". This is the worst album I have listened to in quite awhile. I am not opposed to groups changing their musical style in the least - provided they have some merits in the new style. Whatever you want to call what Morcheeba is doing on this album - it bites.I literally cant wait to sell it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am an adult and wore it hilariously.","review":"I was attending a robot party (don't ask why), and I wore this because it was cheap, easy to put on, and easy to get drunk without having tin foil all over your body.

Anyhow, my 15-year-old son saw it and wants to wear it for trick-or-treat. It's big, shiney and lightweight. I'm sure it will fit a smaller head than our adult-sized heads too! Well-made and a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great robot hat for kids","review":"My daughter loves robots, and she wore this hat/mask for Halloween with a leotard and silver tights. She's 2, and it was big on her, but it seems like it would fit a kid of almost any size. The quality of the mask is great- shiny silver material with blue, black and pinkish-red accents. It even has little pockets inside for money or small treasures. It would be good for a boy or girl. I think this mask will be fun for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats off to Romanesca","review":"If I can only take one Baroque recording to a deserted island, this would be it. My favorite track in this 2-CD set is track 2 on CD#1. I must have played this track hundreds of times in my car during the past year and a half. I have never gotten tired of listening to it and doubt I ever will. I have another recording (a 1994 recording with violinist Marianne Ronez of Switzerland) of these Biber sonatas from Cavalli Records and it sounds no where as impressive as Romanesca's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Seriously Fantastic CD","review":"This CD is probably one of the best reocrdings that i own, and it find that it is strage that i had never heard of Andrew Manze before the Gramaphone review that i read, which compelled me to buy this CD. And what a CD !! The playing is magnificent, and improvisational, and, just like Andrew Manze playing of the Pandolfi sonatas, impeccably in tune, perfectly phrazed, and played with great flourish, and beat of drum.

My favorites include the hand grenade and speaker covers. The designs some may find silly such as knit sandwiches and cakes I found entertaining and helpful technically. The author, though British translates well to an American audience and her quirky photos as well as the collage-type designs add a homeyness and familiarity to the book as a whole. A must have for old hands and beginners, go out and get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Maybe I'm not imaginative, but most of the things this book offers are decorative items, not functional items. And they're not particularly attractive or interesting decorative items. A knitted pint glass? What FOR? I don't mind the occasional tchotchky, but these items are both silly and useless, as far as I'm concerned. There are two exceptions, a cute nightgown designed in the style of a twenties flapper dress, and a pair of ear muffs made of knitted fried eggs. If you like this kind of thing, and I don't know anyone who does, or if you like to knit and want to punish everyone you know with presents they'll hate, this is the book for you.

There have been NO RECORDS of Christians SINGING while they burned the Synagogue, hell, it's already been made clear that there were no Jews inside while it was being burned. I gave it one star for the anti-Christianity. I don't tolerate it.This book is just more liberal nonsense to attack the religious. If you want a proper book on the Holocaust, try something else.

I have nostalgia attacks ocasionally and a listen to this will usually bring me back to the present. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida should make even the most hardcore Summer Of Lover blush. The title cut is musically competent but goes on about 15 minutes too long. The endless noodlings will make The Grateful Dead seem like The Ramones. The rest of the songs are basically filler of the peace, love, and dope variety with the possible exception being \\"Most Anything You Want\\" which at least manages a melody and some cheesy organ for fun. If you yearn for the sillier part of the Sixties, make the purchase. It's kinda fun in a campy Village People sort of way, although I'm sure that was inadvertant.

The original album is only 36 minutes, roughly half of which is \\"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida\\". The preceeding five tracks aren't just \\"bonus\\" songs, they're actually pretty decent, though more pop. Think Strawberry Alarm Clock meets The Doors. Obviously the draw here however is the title track, 17 minutes long, and pure psychedelic bliss. The remastering and extra tracks aren't essential to me, but may be to you. The beauty of this album is that the music can be heavy AND light, kind of like an iron butterfly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Song Wonders","review":"Iron Butterfly: In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida: Let's face it, the only really memorable song they ever did was this title track, but I wouldn't want to be without it.

The title track is the only one worthy of a listen, as the rest are outdated hippy garbage. The title track contains an interesting and very creative main riff. However, to carry this basic riff for 17+ minutes is ridiculous. Several complaints: a) Main riff is good, but more suited to a 3 min. single, b) musicianship is not that great, c) Guitar solos are uninspired, simplistic, and quite annoying, d) Sound quality is poor, tinny, and annoying, e) drum solo is to simplistic, poorly recorded, and obviously didn't require much talent, and f) the lyrics, which are sparse, are repetitive, boring, and don't stimulate the imagination as psychelic music should. Overall, I consider this album to be quite poor, and even on acid, would'nt find it very interesting. Try some Pink Floyd if you want a good, honest to God, psychedelic trip.

The sound quality of the CD is the worst of any album I've ever heard. The guitar solos in particular were mixed down way low and lose the ambience and sonic clarity of the record.

That track is obviously the selling point for this album.

It is a psych-pop legend for a reason, after all.Will you be disappointed by the rest of the album? Possibly, but I think it holds a couple gems in its pocket. \\"Flowers and Beads\\" is a solid 60's psych-pop track which sounds dated lyrically, but it's perfectly fine musically. \\"My Mirage\\" sounds dark by comparison, and it's a pefectly groovy track for the instrumentation being used here.Do you want to buy this album? Well, the classic title track is half the album's run time, and you may as well buy the album for that alone. Treat the album's first side like a bonus, or like an extended B-side to a single, it's just icing on the cake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a masterpiece, but it's a truly good record","review":"This record made a great success in the 60's, and the title track is a shinny moment of the american psychedelia. Other very good moment is the song \\"My Mirage\\". But \\"Flowers and Beads\\" is pretty weak. You can enjoy listening this record on a Sunday afternoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ina gadda","review":"I bought this album just for In a Gadda da vida and it was the worst reproduction of a song I have ever heard. I felt ripped off. You couldn't hear the base. You couldn't hear the drum solo very well. I was extremely disappointed. There is absolutely no place to get a good copy. This cheesy copy should be taken off the market. I remember how good the original vinyl album sounded and this isn't even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory coverage","review":"I found this book to be extremely unsatisfactory. The authors have rushed their manuscript to the printer so soon after the start of the epidemic that many salient facts about the virus and the disease could not be included in time for publication. I just can't understand why the authors didn't wait until more facts about the disease have been established before publishing their work if they do intend to provide the public with useful information about SARS.The coverage of the Sars outbreak in Hong Kong (the place where I live) is also far from satisfactory. Many of the important events have not been mentioned. Some research results have been totally ignored. There is also not much analysis of the initial outbreak at the hospitals. Such sloppy scholarship is unacceptable, even if the book is intended for the mass market.I can only give this book one star at most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited use","review":"I don't think this short book is good at all. Like the reader below, I found the information in the book to outdated. While the authors may wish to alert people on the risk of SARS, it's often inappropriate to rush out such a kind of book so soon, in particular when our knowledge of the disease is advancing by the day. Because of this, I don't think the book can be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This publication is, to me, an utter disappointment. Not only is it not up-to-date, and therefore of practically no use to the more serious reader, its contents are also sloppily put together. Insights and detailed analysis are also short in supply. It consequently fails to do justice to both the new disease as well as those fighting it on the front-line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"This book is almost useful for me, as it throws practically no fresh insight on the latest findings on Sars. The contents are poorly produced and evidently put together in great haste. A one-star publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely Beautiful","review":"She really left a wonderful gift in this cd.

Complete musicians are a wonderful treat and I never tire of listening to her wonderful voice and interpretations.The recording sounds like a collection from other dics; it is not as pure in fidelity as an original. I still enjoyed it, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging, down-to-earth advice for adults","review":"Really liked this book -- great tips on everything from riding to choosing a horse/stable to buying tack to not being too hard on yourself for having a busy schedule. I would highly recommend this to any riding adult who has a professional life to consider as well - not to mention a spouse, family, other pets to look after, etc. Also very insightful as to etiquette and how to gracefully exit from situations that don't suit you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Questions...no answers","review":"This book is a disappointingly shallow treatment of the subject. It raises many good questions an adult rider needs to ask... but doesn't help at all in finding or interpreting the answers! Everything is dealt with in a single paragraph, and that's just not long enough. I just didn't walk away from this one with an improved point of view as I'd hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Book for Adult Riders","review":"Riding for the Rest of Us is the perfect guide for adult riders - especially ones that have started riding for the first time. It is practical, empathetic and a great resource. I have had this book for many years and now have passed it on to my new partner who has become enthralled in horsemanship. Its a great way for me to share, without telling him. I love Dr Jahiel's common sense approach and the way she knows how we feel, that we may be a little bit nervous, we may not have a lot of money, or time, we know that we don't bounce like we used to. I recommend this book to everyone - even teenagers who might want to get an insight into how us \\"oldies\\" feel :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the title","review":"This book really should be called Horse Ownership for the Rest Of Us -- it's not about riding, really, its more about owning a horse, how to choose your barn, etc. But if this is supposed to be written \\"for the rest of us\\" I don't know who the other people they're referring to are -- this book still assumes that you have the time and resources to get to the barn and ride YOUR OWN HORSE every day or thereabouts -- I'm not poor but there's no way I have the resources to buy the horse in the first place much less pay for boarding and vet care -- how about starting there? What if you don't own your own horse and have a full-time job but still want to be the best rider you can be? It was an interesting read but I gave it away, if you're looking for actual riding tips and techniques for older riders you should probably look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding for the rest of us: A practical guide for adult ridere","review":"It is not a necessary book to read.

Victor Buono was a true Renaissance man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud","review":"Victor Buono reminds us all that we must be able to laugh at ourselves. The gifted actor gives us something to ponder in his short and longer poems on everyday life. Some make me smile, some laugh out loud, but mostly, I hear his distinctive voice just as I remember it from his recorded works and that adds a whole new level of enjoyment. If you can, get a copy of one of his old albums, then sit down with a copy of this volume and you will hear them the way they were meant to be heard. No disappointment here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man of many talents!","review":"I loved Victor Buono's \\"Heavy\\" album! He was such a talented actor and when I saw him perform some of his poetry on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show, I laughed till my sides ached! I received one as a gift at Christmas the year it came out and made the regrettable decision to take it to my Weight Watchers' meeting. The lecturer borrowed it to share with her other classes and left it on the seat of her car (this was in south Florida!) where it warped into a useless mass of vinyl. I was never able to get another copy....does anyone know if it's still available and where I can get a copy?

Since when can't people just read a good book without looking for social \\"significance\\". It's a novel,people. Why not read it just for the pleasure. I was thoroughly caught up in the story and very much enjoyed it. It's fast moving and,in my opinion, scary. I have read several other books by the same authors and have enjoyed most of them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"how Aliens shouls have been","review":"This truley is excellent, despite some wooden charactors and stiff dialogue. The science is interesting without being dull and the action is shockingly violent. The beasties are believable after a fashion which makes them more scarey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many cooks?","review":"I normally like Barnes/Pournelle/Niven, but this book isn't their best work - or at least for me it wasn't. I found myself skipping past large chunks of narrative that did little to move the story along. There's a good idea here, but the characters, pacing and bloated narrative makes it hard to plow through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wasn't expecting it to be this good...","review":"When I first saw this book in someones personal library I thought \\"This is probably just going to be one of those Sci-Fi books that will bore me\\". I was wrong! I loved this book and it's consistantly fast pace! Even when there is no action there seems to be this aura of uneasynes. I am definatly going to tell my friends about this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed Sci Fi Thriller","review":"Great Niven work. Somewhat like the movie Alien, then morphs into the sequel Aliens, with a little of High Noon in the background. Different from books written solo by Niven. More science and more adventure with fewer wild scenarios (while the setting here is certainly sci fi, it is not as unusual as other Niven works such as Integral Trees). A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grendels scared me half-to-death ...","review":"From the first description of the Grendal, I was hooked to the end. Giant, smooth-skinned, toothed, barb-tailed, murderously fast, and smarter than apes with a peculilar reproductive cycle that surprises the colonists, and could also end the lives of all. Couple this with good characterization, sexual tension and depth gets you a very good read that you can't put down. It's true. A fast reading delight of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Battle of Man Vs. Beast - A Classic!","review":"Wow. This one was quite well done. It really captures the harsh and alien environment, and how man's complacency can lead to terrible problems. The grendels are extremely intruguing and complicated (I loved seeing things from their perspective - there should have been more of that!). The ecological aspect was also very interesting - as usual Niven and Pournelle add some very psychological aspects to the book to make it a \\"smart\\" bloodbath. One note - STOP COMPARING IT TO ALIENS! I really think its nothing like it - its better, not similar."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in quite a while","review":"A definite must read for anyone who likes a fast-paced story with the kind of suspense that gets your own adrenaline running. This is the kind of book that you read in one long session, then to find out when you put it down that all your muscles have cramped up from the tension so much that you can hardly walk anymore. I can't summarise it without giving away the plot; all I'll say is that it surprised me. Very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Alien' meets the science of reality ...","review":"Fantastic. What all movies about aggressive First Contact should be like. A nightmare about the consequences of 'progress first'.From the first paragraphs the authors provide the reader with an image of Avalon so heavy with movement, sound, colour and emotion that reading it is as near as never mind to being there. The characters are dynamic and three-dimensional and as imperfect as any humans, and the plot is as driven by their flaws as it is by the danger posed by the frightening and explosively lethal Grendels. With fascinating plot-strands examining the consequences of cryo-technology, and a twist terrifying enough to make the most hardened industrialist examine the importance of eco-management, this is a book one can really call a page-turner. I was reluctant to eat while I read this book because it meant I had to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bright new twist on a centures old idea? I like it!","review":"How rare it is to see another author take a a book thats been around for hundreds of years, and then make it better. Niven has taken the Beowulf saga, and has advanced it a thousand years in \\"Legacy of Herot.\\" Easily my favourite Niven book, \\"Legacy\\" has all the things you come to expect in a fast paced, well descriptive book that leaves you thirsty for more. You become one of the colonists on Avalon and join the battle with them against the insidious Grendels.

I, fortunately, threw this one in the garbage. Rarely have I been unable to get through a chapter of a book, but I made an exception in this case. The people who gave this dog a glowing review either have no concept of what constitutes good Science Fiction, or have been so infected by the grade-Z [junk] coming out of Hollywood that panders to the mindless masses that they can't tell claptrap from something worth reading.Trust me, if you like SF, stay away from this one. If you find it in a pile at a garage sale or some flea-market stand, flip through it if you want, then tell the seller that if HE pays YOU, you will take it off his hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screaching good page turner-redux!","review":"I first read this book as a younger man,some 25 years ago, and found it to be one of the most chilling and scary stories I had ever read! Sure, character development could have been a bit better, and the story line could have been put together just a bit better-but gee whillikers fellas...give the guys a break! Three men who are fairly new to writing, have just sat down and collaborated together n a horror alien contact story which actually came off pretty darned good.I now have a Kindle and I am adding these two stories in as part of my permanent collection because they are stories I remember from time to time as vivid reminders that when in the wild, always keep your wits about you, protect what you love and be observant of the local flora and fauna.

I first ran across this book umpteen years ago and loved it. I've been looking to replace my long-lost copy, but couldn't find one. I've been clicking on \\"make this available on Kindle\\" off and on for a couple of years, and it is now Kindlized. I'm looking forward to meeting the Grendel again after a long absence. The use of \\"speed\\" in the Grendel's biology is one of the most unique things I've seen in a very long time. Definitely a must-read for serious SF fans. I can't recommend the sequel, though -- it's a yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been a fan of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle for, yes, decades. Maybe that's the problem. This book was shallow, no character development. Brutal action, excessively brutal in description of destruction of the helpless, adding nothing to the story value. The \\"plot\\" was hard to find.

Didn't get more than 60% through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven collection, but the high points are exceptional","review":"Trying to bring so many different artists to cover so many different types of material is a tough project. This entry in the Red Hot... series isn't the best, but it has some of the brightest spots. Most of the best moments are near the end of the disc, especially Sinead O'Connor's \\"Someone to Watch over Me\\" and the atmospheric \\"Bess You Is my Woman Now\\" and \\"A Foggy Day in London Town\\".

And Olson is ready - well, almost - for anything; he is a \\"seeing-eye-dog\\" for Superman, defends the honor of Lane, is a pugilist who packs a punch and can't avoid a little drama, with his friendship with the super hero briefly on the rocks.It is a nice collection that shows a fun and oftentimes very light-hearted dimension in the iconic story lines for Superman."},{"rating":"2","title":"DC KNUCKLEHEADS DO IT AGAIN!","review":"GREAT!

But on first listen I was a bit disappointed. How could Rusby live up to the claim that she was the best voice in English folk music in 100 years? She does have a lovely voice and the songs are nice. But she doesn't eclipse Sandy Denny. Her song writing doesn't match that of Kate Wolf or Lucy Kaplansky. Still, I'm right well pleased with and glad to have made the purchase now that I've given it a few listens.

The singer has a horrendous empty voice, even when supposedly singing something emotional he falls flat. This song evidently things it is very clever, by being a song about a song, but it comes across as a bunch of students showing off. Once you reach the end, where having supposedly poured his little heart out the singer tries to finish it off, it becomes cringeworthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection from a very overlooked duo","review":"Too bad this collection is no longer in print.

Having said that, everyone would have made a different selection, and this is a fine effort. It is also good to see that the under-rated 'Whomp that sucker' album is well represented by 'Tips for teens', 'Upstairs' and the strangely compelling 'Funny face'. Also benefits from the inlay having lyrics and photos, together with accompanying notes by Russell for each track, and an introduction by Ron.

Certainly his technical powers as a pianist are undeniable, but a thinking musician who allows the music to speak naturally without disruptive and individualistic statements he is not. As is sadly the case with many young performers these days, we are first made aware of Chiu's abilities and only afterward are we allowed to hear the beauty of Mendelssohn's music - and beautiful music it is. Anyone who has heard these works in the hands of a great musician (like Perahia) will hear at once the chasm that stands between such selfless interpretation and the land of Chiu. Menham Pressler said at the competition, \\"I want to meet another lover of music, I don't want to meet another player.\\" Perhaps this disc is the best explanation for Chiu's failure in Fort Worth - buy it if you want to hear him and not Mendelssohn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but expensive projects","review":"I like the ideas in this book but some of the projects are just too expensive. The first scarf requires you to buy six skeins of Colinette's Point 5 yarn which costs twenty dollars a skein. I think that it's a silly suggestion no matter how easy the big wool is. The book is also hard to keep open while you are trying to knit so you need to use some kind of book weight. It would have been a perfect book to be spiral bound. For the amount of projects it has, the price is right, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I rented this book from the library, and just came out to Amazon to buy it so I can have it forever. It's the only book that ACTUALLY showed me how to purl in a way that made sense!

BTW: The person who wrote the review saying that the 1st scarf project required you to buy 6 skeins of $20 yarn was wrong: it only calls for two. $40 for a handmade scarf is a bargain, in my book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great oriental thriller...","review":"a sexy, mind bending thriller-a film that starts out pretty straight forward and then throws you 360 degrees.Fairly tame as to the sex and violence compared to American thrillers, but that, IMO, makes the film more enjoyable-you need to use your brain instead of being clubbed in the head with gratatious imagery. You'll need to pay attention to this one if you hope to keep up.A surprising ending but one appropriate for a Japanese film-known for their moralizing undertones. A enjoyable, thought provoking movie. 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have been better if I hadn't seen VERTIGO","review":"I suppose the plot would have been more of a mind-bender if I hadn't seen Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO. As it was, many of the plot twists were the same, and the character construction just couldn't live up to Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.

I just don't think I've found it with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to get into","review":"This book is really hard to read. The Scotch slang is really hard to decipher at times, and wading through English-Scottish politics is not my idea of a captivating book.

I'm only a few chapters into it so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predator Novel","review":"The Predator novel is more of a mythic story than the movie. In the novel, the alien changes its form to appear as different animals, and this ability seems to be found in the myths of different cultures of the distant past, while in the movie, the alien only uses its invisible technology. Also in the novel, the alien uses a spear, a symbol of primitive power, to kill the soldiers, while in the movie, the alien uses a directional plasma blaster. The novel also features scenes of greater emotional effect such as when Anna is watching in horrified fascination the alien closing the distance to the unaware Hawkins and when the soldiers find the alien's tracks and fearfully realize its presence. Overall, the novel is a good survival story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable product - failed after 2 years","review":"After only two years of use, the integrated circuit board ( Part # 20380S ) failed on this unit causing the door to close partially, then reopen.

Do not buy their products - you'll be very disappointed. It deserves one star - good use as a door stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lookin for more","review":"Great, spirit filled group. I have heard a couple of their songs once before, and am constantly looking for more. Great beats, great rhymes, just an all arround great group :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unity Klan rocks.","review":"This album has got to be the best. I love this group. This group is all about God and nothing but God. Its awesome. I love the lyrics and the beat. I would give anything to meet them and to have their CD again. I let a friend borrow it and she was gonna give it back, but they had set it on top of the car and by the time they had realized it, a truck had run over it :( I miss it so much. Anyway- this CD is tight and is da bomb. WEll, that's all I gots ta say about that right now- so lata and PEACE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"if you like christian rap and bass u will love this cd","review":"this cd is great. ilove it. this is a must for kids who like christian music and christian rap!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is up lifting","review":"this cd is great i listen to it all the time and i even take it with me every where i go.I love the bass and words. christian rap rocks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theresa:the body of Christ","review":"Theresa the body of Christ is an honest, clean, magnificent work of art, and of literary script.Explains the life of the saint in a clear and simple, straightforward manner.It casts the talent of the best actors and acresses like Paz Vega and Geraldine Chaplin and the essence of the life of one of the greatest saints of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's cheap and it doesn't work for long","review":"Maybe I got a dud, but mine worked during a recent trip to Europe, and that was the last time it worked. I went abroad again last month, second time I was to use it, and bam, it's dead. Thank God I still have my original charger from Canon (I wanted two, so that I could charge a few batteries at the same time). My original Canon charger is going on two years old at this point, and works like a song. Maybe I got a dud, or maybe there's a reason this thing is 1/3 the price of the real deal. But either way, I'm buying a Canon next time since, were this my only charger, I'd have been in real trouble during my trip (not sure where I'd buy a charger in rural Spain, but I suspect I'd have paid a pretty penny)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after a couple of months","review":"It worked good for a couple of months and then it broke. I was told I had to get a hold of CTA for a replacement/repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor fit but works","review":"It's cheap and it works. Beyond that the design isn't great, and I had to jam the battery in to make it charge. I haven't tried the car charger yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"Product is very inexpensive, and seems to work well. It has been a while since I lost my original charger, so I can't speak to the speed of this charger compared to the original Canon charger. But if you charge it overnight, it is ready in the morning. That is why an extra battery is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"CTA MR-NB5L MIni Battery Charger Kit","review":"This battery charger works out of box. A little too big compared to Canon's charger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charge at home or take it with you for less!","review":"This is a great charger that has the ability to charge over regular 110V, 220v (with adapter) & in your car cigarette lighter.This worked great for me & when charges are complete the light changes from red to green to show they are complete.My one reservation is that is slightly larger that the canon one. Considering the price thought, I would say this is a no brainer."},{"rating":"2","title":"CTA DIGITAL MR-NB5L Mini Battery Charger for Canon NB-5L Battery","review":"works OK but is slower than the OEM charger. Instead of a green when the charge is done, the indicator goes out...curiously backwards. Otherwise a good value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't even get my battery to fit in this thing!","review":"I don't know how anybody else is getting their battery to fit into this charger, mine isn't even close and I have a factory Canon NB-5L. Had to contact Amazon for a refund and will have to purchase a different brand"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not charge my battery","review":"The product info said it charges cannon batteries, and i have the model mentioned in the description, yet when i tried charging it, it wouldn't work at all. I don't know if the device itself was not working or it simply is not meant for my battery model. I still have a low charge in my battery (my camera still turns on). I regret buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, Not as intuitive as original Canon battery charger","review":"This charger works well. I have only one complaint, the battery will lock into the charger but not be in the correct position to actually charge. I left it plugged in overnight like this only to find the battery hadn't charged at all. Once properly oriented it charged well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supportive AND Realistic","review":"For me, this is undoubtedly the best of the breastfeeding guides. It not only provides gentle (not pushy, like some others) support for your decision to breastfeed, it is beautifully written and organized. I loved the stories of the author's own experiences and the clear, practical directions. Breastfeeding is a challenging but rewarding experience. She eloquently describes the rewards while providing practical advice for the difficulties rather than ignoring or down-playing them. Thank You for all your help Dr. Neifert. I wish you could be my Doula!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bola de Nieve at his best","review":"This is perhaps the best cd available of this great cuban singer and piano player, dead in 1971. The same songs recorded with a better sound than most of the others. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant performance","review":"After reading a rather negative review of this recording, I just had to post another review saying that in my opinion this is one of the best Handel recordings on the market - the singers are excellent, especially Jennifer Smith and Linda Maguire and Minkowski's conducting is absolutely brilliant. The structure of the work is like that of an opera seria (including the da capo arias) - so if you are a fan of baroque opera, this one is an absolute must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reluctant two stars","review":"I gave it two stars, reluctantly, because despite the libertarian politico-economic spouting of some of the characters, and the tired back and forth across centuries, the first half or so of the book at least had some suspense and (slow and creaky) character development, and an expectation of an exciting and interesting denouement. But by the end I was left sitting there thinking, \\"That's it? That's it?!\\"All along I kept thinking that there had to be something about the object of the search other than its simple existence. Why otherwise would one side try so valiantly to find it, and the other side so desperately to keep it hidden. Why, indeed? I'm still wondering...Pass this one up. I've been a fan of Poul Anderson's for a long time, but some of his latter-day stuff just isn't up to it. This is one fine example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated","review":"The book is twice the length it should have been.There are also jarring things like the gratuitious use ofcommon Spanish phrases, as if they would replace Englishones in common use but nothing else, and the gratuitoususe of Hawaiian (which far fewer of us know).And then there are the undefined neologisms"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I thought it was","review":"Don't waist your money this video doesn't provide you with no basic anything.
