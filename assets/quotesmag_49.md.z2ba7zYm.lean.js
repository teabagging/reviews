My family and I must have listened to The Soul Stirrers' \\"Be With Me, Jesus\\" over a million times in the first week that I had the album. Paul Foster's \\"sermon in a song\\" combined with Sam Cooke's response to his calls was powerful, to the say the least.

It's a rip off. The thing is huge and weighs a ton, also it's just too much. The thing sits next to the Genesis and makes it seem bigger, messier, and physicaly unpresentable. Best of all, it needs it's own power adapter. I don't recomend this model. If you own a model one Genesis you should get a model one CD add-on, it sits on the bottom so it doesn't take up as much space.

Worse even thanSheba, Baby, which is saying either quite a lot or nothing at all. The final séance is well-paced but the rest of the film is truly poor: not scary and not very funny, either. The supporting case is as supportive as month-old lettuce. I still have high hopes for 1972's originalBlaculabecause I adore this genre.

Of course, I can't try it for anything larger than 5/8\\" inch cuts as it gets too large for my spindle. After reversing the setup, I also had to get a washer so the screws wouldn't hit the motor mount.I think Freud has done an extremely poor job of testing and telling their customers what saws this blade works with and which ones it doesn't.

I have four different dado sets in my shop. The Freud SD608 Dial-A-Dado is by far the cleanest cutting dado I have ever used. The finished dado appears that it was cut with a straight router bit. The bottom of the dado is so clean it requires no claen up. The adjustment for narrowing or widening your cut slightly is a real time saver. It works just as advertized. If I only had one dado set to pick from the SD608, 8\\" would be the one I would buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit Bosch 4000-07","review":"Just does not fit a Bosch 4000-07 without removing the plastic panel that makes up the dust collection housing.The wrench supplied was of very poor quality consiting of what looked like a piece of metal welded onto a hex shaped channel that was supposed to resemble a 22mm or 23mm socket. Also the case seemd to be very flimsy for the money. I've since returned the dial-a-dado and replaced it with the super dado and it also comes with a similar case.On a postive note, Changing the arbor from right to left to fit the Bosch 4000-07 was straight forward and had it worked on my saw I would have kept it and just replaced the wrench with a real socket. Great concept but seems to be limited in application."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work with craftsman 10\\" saw","review":"Great reviews in magazines, but will not work with craftsman. nuts hit the arbor and the wrench will not fit the nut.

Very dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Craftman table saws","review":"Got this for Christmas, the case is cheap plastic, not what I would expect for the price. The back blade has lock nuts for the hub, I would expect tapped screws. On my 10in Sears Craftsman they hit the arbor casting so would have to be spaced out. The front blade has a recess in the hub for your arbor nut. In my case the recess is not large enough to get a wrench (socket) on the saw's nut ( the wrench that come with it is for a smaller nut); also, with all the blades on it's too wide for the arbor. I never cut anything with it as was too much trouble for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit DeWalt 748 hybrid table saw","review":"Technically, I suppose it DOES fit the saw. However, the supplied arbor wrench does not, nor will any combination of ratchet and socket that I could come up with since the throat opening on the saw interferes with getting anything other than a wrench onto the arbor shaft with the stack set up for a normal 3/4\\" dado cut. As popular as the DeWalt hybrid saw is, I can't imagine there aren't thousands of disgruntled woodworkers out there like me who are fuming over Freud's short-sighted designers."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T WORK ON ALL SETTINGS!!","review":"I puchased this blade to replace an old wobble blade. I didn't mine the cheap case it came in as much as when ajusting it to it's full width,it was to wide to fit on my arbor with a nut. After paying this price I expect it to work in all widths.

I'll be adding more of these women to my collection as $ permits.

I was however expecting this film to be at least watchable. This is without a doubt one of the worst pieces of garbage I have ever seen in my entire life. Again like usuall cheap teen slashers its the same thing all over again(the thing was this was even worse). A killer stalks actors of a low budget horror film. While they make this film each of the actors are killed one by one. I have never seen such bad acting before. But the thing that really got on my nerves about this film is the actual story. The film the actors are making is cursed? And then it leads to the most rediculous ending I had ever seen showing nothing but stupidity. I was thinking that this had to be a joke. But this didnt even make me laugh. This is the one film that shows to us just how BAD a movie can actually get."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T QUITE CUT IT !","review":"I rented the movie Cut at my local Blockbuster not expecting much at all,but I thought the movie would be watchable at least,it wasn't. First off the movie starts out the same way as Scream ,something left on the stove and a killer calling the house saying \\"now you die\\" and then appearing in the house next with ubber garden sheers. Later we learn that this is a movie that is being made and the director gets killed,then years later the same actors try to finish the film. An interesting story but very poorly acted and executed. With little lack of originality or flare that makes this movie sink just like most teeny horror films these days(Scream,I Know What You Did,Valentine,Urban Legend,Soul Survivors etc...)and in addition the accents sometimes are hard to follow and pretty amatuer acting. I CAN'T SAY I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut DOESN'T make the cut!","review":"I got this solely because I LOVE Molly Ringwald. Normally, she can pull off impossibly droll or stupid movies, just by lending her talent.

These teens these days don't know good Horror. I will stick to the classics(1978/Halloween, 1984/A Nightmare On Elm Street, 1984/Silent Night,Deadly Night(92 min UNCUT),not the (85 min) Censored Double Feature DVD ,1981/The Burning Uncut by Dragon,not Vipco), 1977/Dawn Of The Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewww... It's horrible","review":"I was at my local video store and i ran into CUT. The movie seemed interesting so i rented it. First of all the concept was interesting, a cursed movie, whomever tries to screen or finish the movie dies. The characers in the movie are very two-dimensional which translates into not caring who lives or dies. The killer eliminates them in very boring ways with very little imagination or even suspense. Molly Ringwald was ok her character(a washed-up actress,how appropriate) had only one setting (bitchy). The fabulous Kylie Minogue had a great cameo unfortunatly she was eliminated too soon. In conclusion i would not recommend this movie its very dull and uninteresting, a great concept that was poorly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated material","review":"My family was very disapointed to arrive in several U.S. cities(Sacramento, Los Angeles, Pasadena,and Northridge in California and Portland and Ashland, Oregon), armed with our veggie guide book, only to discover many of the restaurants were out of business.

That book, though seriously flawed on tactics and strategy, had a joie de vie about it which stimulated more than one beginner to carry on with the game. \\"Winners\\" is more a a damp, white bread, mayonaise sandwich.

Robertie writes clearly, and for beginners.If you want to play better backgammon, here's my formula: Read this book. At the same time, download and install the gnubg program. It's free, and it's the best. Use the \\"hint\\" mode in gnubg, and try to learn why it's recommending all those bizarre moves. Compare those moves to what Robertie says. Keep at it, then keep at it some more. Your backgammon will get better, I promise.I have two other Robertie books: Backgammon for Serious Players, and 501 Essential Backgammon Problems.

When it was new (to me), I played it over and over, as did all the other reviewers, even dancing around the room or on the steering wheel at times.However, playing it again today after a long break shocked me! The CD created a new listening experience. There's a sound machine in most of the tracks, too loud and way too annoying. I had to fast-forward on all tracks except the last two. I found most of the songs repetitive--the same beat, the same rhythm over and over.I gave the CD four stars because of my initial reaction, in gratitude for being introduced to a new music (to me). Putumayo does that: introduce listeners to new music, new experiences, ones that might not come across the table otherwise. I see this CD is no longer available. That's a shame.Even though I state my new dislike of the sound machine, I still recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I used to own 3 CD stores and ran a recording studio and a sound company.

I've tried to track down the artists on the disc and buy their cds, too. But, most of these groups don't have any releases you can buy in the states - just a couple do.

Basically this book is a collection of short essays he wrote as a movie critic. And while there were times I snorted out loud reading it, there were also boring times and a lot - I mean a lot - of swearing. I'm not enough of a movie fan to really get the full depth of this book, having not seen over 75% of the movies he talks about, but for a true movie connoisseur you will either love (if you agree with him) or hate (if you disagree with him) this book. It's also a book best read in small doses, and since they are just a collection of unrelated essays, that's easy enough to do. Reading it in one fell swoop gets tedious. True Believers was a far better book and a must-read for any sports fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Star?","review":"This book is a well-needed, tongue and cheek, throw at Hollywood,Backseat directors and reality impaired people.

This book is a disappointment. Part of the problem is that when put together, you realize that a lot of his essays consist either of: (a) the juxtaposition of movies with similar story lines to illustrate the point that Hollywood movies are formulaic (shocking revelation; its amusing the first time he does it, but wears thin after a while); or (b) attempting to do replicate feats in movies in real life to illustrate the concept that Hollywood movies are unrealistic (another shocking revleation; this wasn't funny to me even the first time). The essay which involved him acting like a jerk in movie theatres just didn't work for me either. Still has a few chuckles in it and good observations on movies. The piece about nun movies is quite amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Queenan","review":"So many nasty reviews about this book have missed one point entirely. Is Joe Queenan funny? Yes. Is Joe Queenan mean and cynical? Of course. Does Joe Queenan have a right to be? Well, have you seen the dreck that Hollywood releases every Friday? Of course Joe Queenan is going to be mean and cynical, especially when we could pay off the nation debt if we took all of our movie going and video renting money and sent it to the government instead of waiting in line to rent \\"Bring It On\\" or catch the matinee showing of \\"Dude, Where's My Car?\\" I wholeheartedly support Queenan's endeavours, and pray to God Jason Biggs and Freddie Prinze, Jr. will retire from acting. Write on, Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff from a mean guy.","review":"This a great collection of essays by Joe. There are some real treasures here and the beginning of the book had me crying in the aisles of the plane. Unfortunately as the book wears on you come across some less exciting articles. They're all well written and entertaining but the guffaws become a little less frequent. I can see why you'd apprciate coming across his articles once a month in Movieline rather and trying to chug through them all at once. Still I thought it was a lot of mean spirited fun and recommend this book. My only other recommendation is that you take a break between chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very funny, that's the blunt fact of the matter...","review":"I've got nothing against Joe Queenan's curmudgeon act--heck, that's been a staple among critics with attitude forever. But some indescrible something is lacking in his work. His jokes are all root and no tree, most of the time. I dunno, maybe it's something to do with his delivery. Mr. Cranky at mrcranky.com is good for a crude bellylaugh. P. J. O'Rourke, when he lampoons pop culture, usually puts a wicked twist in his observations. Queenan to me just seems more windy than pithy.You can add a star to this review if you are a knowledgeable movie lover, and you laugh when an actor's name serves as the punchline in a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive Essays","review":"This is the first Joe Queenan book I have read (it was a gift), so I had no expectations one way or the other. I gave this book two stars only because most of the essays, taken individually, were clever and amusing if not overly funny. But read consecutively, they were very repetitive and were characterized by the same theme... that this guy seems to hate most films. He also has a somewhat pretentious writing style, which is also accentuated by the repetitive themes. He really doesn't have much to say that isn't basically mean spirited. But he is quite clever and occasionally amusing. If you buy this book, try reading an essay every month or so... but not over a short period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Vaughan Williams Collection at rock bottom price","review":"This collection is an incredible bargain! Many of the recordings in the box are unmatched by any of the competition (Antarctica, Tuba Concerto, Symphony #6 especially). And not a single recording disappoints. The recorded sound is outstanding by any standards.I could not get any interest in Vaughan Williams for years. I remember exploring the EMI Boult recordings in the late 1970s. I was bored, to say the least. Then when RCA reissued these recordings individually in the late 1980s, I bought the Antarctica and gave it a try. I got hooked from there, and bought all of the rest one at a time. I couldn't believe how vibrant, exciting, and enjoyable the performancs were.And for the price, this box is a must for anyone even remotely interested in Vaughan Williams.You get all the symphonies and more, for less than the cost of 2 full price CDs.The booklet is decent also."},{"rating":"1","title":"USED BOOKS SELLING AS NEW","review":"Regrettably, we purchased a brand new copy of a book from 'ourbookloft' showing as new.

I learned about neoliberalism and the corporate grip on American youth; the societal abandonment of youth and the social divestment in the future, and; the wholesale disenfranchisement of the American public in the face of capitalistic greed and personal opportunism.

If your only option is stereo output on a headphone jack on your laptop the Matrix surround feature of the Logitech system is actually quite good at playing surround (background) sound on the appropriate speakers. The audio quality is definitely better than what you would expect for $70, but you're not buying yourself a top notch performer. I've got a REALLY good stereo system back home and the two system are hardly comparable.If you're not an audiophile, you want to listen to music (sometimes loudly), and you are looking at this price range I would highly recommend this set.Just FYI: I have been listening to the speaker set for about a month now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the sound quality","review":"I'm currently only using the set as stereo speakers instead of surround, but so far the sound quality is excellent for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing sound!!","review":"Reasonable price. Sounds spectacular without buzzing when turned loud. Makes for great immersive sound in PC gaming. With the sub on the floor you feel the gunfire. Is def intended for PC use though. I'm sure it'd work great for home theater but the length of the surround speakers are short so limits distance. Other than that, great purchase.

I ordered them to replace an older Logitech 2 speaker system that really wasn't cutting it anymore. Works great right out of the box, and the sound is further complimented by the external Creative USB soundcard I'm using. They are easy to wall mount and despite what others have said I found that there is plenty of length on the back speaker cords. Unless the room you are installing these in is huge, you should be OK with what is provided in the box. The base is pretty good too, the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is I feel the base kicks ass at the desk - but as you get a little further away it definitely diminishes quickly.

You can make up for it somewhat by using your sound cards graphic equalizer. Make no mistake there is a problem in that area.As other reviewers have noted, the back cords are way to short. We hung ours from the basement ceiling so that wasn't a problem.Also most of the software out there does not support 5.1. Some do and for those programs is sure can be a lot of fun!The speakers look nice, heck fact they look, well kind of cool. They also work good for the price and if this is your budget, consider this system. But for goodness sakes if you can spend more money get something else.Good luck and don't forget as Red Green says, \\"if the women don't find you handsome they should at least find you handy\\".Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out great... Then down hill.","review":"Initially these speakers were terrific. When I first hooked them up it was incredible. But within about a week the center speaker shorted out and will kick in only occasionally. As frustrating as this was, I got over it. I use the speakers mostly to play music that I am writing on a MIDI program, and I started noticing that a certain note on the piano would make the speakers buzz. This got worse and worse, and gradually other notes near the original trouble note (D5) started making the speakers buzz. Within about two weeks since this problem started the speakers now buzz on every song, on every instrument. They sound like cheap phone's speakers now. My laptop itself has more defined sound at this point. What a waste of money. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"well they are speakers.","review":"This is not a product for the audio savant in your life. It is a product that sorta gets the job done. It does work. Its just not entirely the sound that makes you feel like you are in the middle of the scene you are trying to get into. But for the price range, you really cant complain. So because of the ridiculously cheap price, you have to give it a 5 star.

I have absolutely no regrets:Sound quality (from my Xbox, no adapter required) is clear, even when loud.Plenty of volume for me. I can fill my small room with sound at about 55%.Matrix Mode is extremely helpful for me because my Xbox outputs only 2 channels. With Matrix mode, all the speakers play from 2 channels (which is what most devices use). But be aware it is not \\"true\\" surround sound. But it's not that big of a deal unless you're a professional.Like others say, be prepared to spend $5 on speaker cable extensions for the Rear speakers.The subwoofer is good. Don't expect the walls to shake, but it provides solid, powerful lows.Excellent Speaker set.

And yes like other ppl have noted there are some occassional popping noises, but that's from the laptop soundcard, i attached the speakers to a desktop with a 5.1 card and the sound is even nicer, no popping yet.I recommend watching for the occassional logitech 15 or 20 dollar rebate which brings the price down to about $35+$17 shipping.

I had to buy a separate converter to get the product to work.The worst part is, I contacted the seller, even went to their own website and contacted them there, and I never even got a response.

Both are very ignorable... except when something is happening on one of the right or left rear speakers. It'll come from both of them. Quite annoying, at least for me.I've heard some people complain that the cables are too short and that there are cables. Umm... you do realize these were made for a pc, not a tv/dvd.

And I can either have the center or the front speakers dominate but not share the sound equally.

The sounds were crisp, the bass was great, gunfire and explosions sounded realistic, and there was nothing I could compain about.I paid 75 for these speakers, which seems great for 5 speakers and one subwoofer, but the satelites still does not satisfy me fully. If you played music and put your ear next to one of the satelite speakers, it sounded like the speakers of your monitor. But collectively, all 5 speakers put you in a great, relaxing environment.Overall, I fulfilled my need of getting an affordable speaker set.

They soud even better then the day I got them. Clear as day and the bass is at a perfect level. By just hearing these speakers they should be at least $200.

We had to upgrade (if that's the correct term) the computer first. Since this is my oldest son's field of experience, it wasn't a big deal.We've had the set up for about three months now and there isn't one negative thing I can say about it.

I was, however, repeatedly amazed at the author's minimizations of how this work was damaging and dangerous to her, not just physically and emotionally, but at a soul level. I didn't need for the author to experience redemption, but rather transformation of some sort beyond just changing the circumstances of her life from teaching & prostitution to marriage and kids.

While I would gladly clean toilets than choose her path, I now have a less stereotypical view of the women who do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a provocative account","review":"\\"Callgirl\\" is more than titillating remembrances from a sordid past, but is instead a literate recollection of one woman's three-year foray into the oldest profession. Blunt and provocative, sometimes even funny, it can turn breathtakingly tender and often heartbreaking.Ms. Angell was more than just a \\"hooker with a heart of gold,\\" (a term the author disdains).

While her stories ring quite true, the writing is just terrible. The entire book reads like a long email.

Jeannette Angell has written a raw, passionate and honest novel that shows people who makes decisions, such as joining an escort service, are very similar to you or I. She brings up an interesting point about how we are so free to given our heart and bodies away to people who cause us pain, what difference is there if we do this but are paid for the service?

I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing","review":"There's a difference in the profession and Ms. Angell tells it all like it is. She was a callgirl which is different from a drug induced prostitute baiting for a customer at the side of a dark road in a red-light district. A callgirl has more fun, so it seems. It is not a diary per se but revelation of an occupation. In this book, Ms. Angell explains how she managed to end up in the business of pleasuring many men, detailing the specie quite prominently in the process. The mechanism that involved of being with them is very much an element of discussion also. Ms. Angell tells her story from her own experiences. Her world was in turmoil thanks to a horrible boyfriend. Lecturer by day and party girl by night - sometimes over the weekend - she survived one ordeal after another. The incidents she went through are eye-openers for many situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical and suports the stereotype of \\"hookers\\".","review":"I did read Tracey Quans book and that was like a Penthouse Forum of sexcapades and this book makes her seem like she's on an ego trip and like other s have said..stereotypes everyone else while not realizing that's what she has done to herself.

It just goes to show a degree doesn't help in this business unless you plan on writing a self absorbed memoir. Her writing is so-so as well. A lot of it goes like this, \\"I did this... and then I did that.\\" You get the feeling that she thinks she's very elegant and sharp, but really, she was only charged $200 and hour.

Then again, I didn't go back and look.I can't recommend this book, either to read or run away from.It is bland and forgettable, but does offer insight to a world most of us know little about.

I related well to Jeannette's story; while I've never been a call girl, I've had to make some pretty tough decisions in my life to make it through tough times. This book should be a wake-up call to society that just because you don't agree morally or socially for someone else's choices, doesn't make their choice(s) wrong.

There is a scene in which the ship is at sea and the owner is giving orders to the captain. Give me a break! When a ship is at sea, the captain is in absolute command and has absolutely responsibility for the conduct of all persons aboard the ship. All other persons who are on board are either crew or passenger, and both are under the control of the captain. No sensible owner would have it any other way. First of all, under the Harter Act, an owner who undertook to run the ship directly could incur severe legal liability for any misconduct that occurred, and secondly, such an action would undermine the captain in his dealings with the crew and the passengers. Any captain who would put up with such demeaning conduct is a wimp who should be deprived of his command."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take this book with you!","review":"Being a traveller who usually swears by Lonely Planet guides, I have to admit that when it came down to taking one or the other, the Lonely Planet book stayed at home and this one made it into my backpack.

And when I saw it on this side of the Atlantic in my local record store - 6 drum n' bass CDs for the price of 1, featuring artists like Krust, Roni Size, and Photek - how could I pass it up?Any compilation of this size is bound to contain some filler, and Essential Drum & Bass has its share. There are musicians here that you will never hear their name anywhere else ever again. Some of the tracks differ little in their beats and sounds, and if you're not paying attention it's hard to tell when one track ends and another begins.There are some standout tracks here, but I find it's just a great collection to keep in the car or at work for when you just want an electronic soundtrack to whatever it is you're doing.

In the history of teen/twenty-something comedies, there may never before have been a movie as cliché as Surf School. Following the genre formula to a tee, there are a ton of cheesy jokes, ridiculous situations, and good looking people wearing very very little. Three guys, Three girls, a quirky old couple, a veteran comedy actor making a cameo, it has it all, and it's absolutely as cheesy as it gets. The movie isn't funny, the story isn't good, and the acting is very bland. It was pretty much everything I expected when I added it to my queue. Sometimes you add these comedies and you find a gem, like National Lampoon's Barely Legal.

Alexi Murdoch is no exception. His music is simple and complacent, perfect for relaxing to. While there isn't anything particularly unique about his particular style, that is perhaps what makes his 4-song disc enjoyable, in that it isn't striving to experiment in new formats or sounds, but that he is just creating enjoyable music.\\"Orange Sky\\" is the song getting the most praise (and criticism) of all of Murdoch's tracks, and is the one I first heard by him. A 6+ minute song it is quite simple lyrically but one of the most peaceful and tranquil songs I have heard in quite a while. I also enjoy \\"Song For You\\" as its a little bit more melodic and structured in comparison the other songs, which have a continuous non-stop flow throughout.All in all a good album to check out, for some to love, some to hate, and most to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!","review":"alexi's lyrics and music are the most beautiful artistic expression of the inner soul that i have run across thus far. four simple songs that i cannot get enough of! i crave more... his performance is as genuine as his music. i recommend this cd without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning stuff","review":"Alexi is at one with space in his songs.

Take, for example, this following para from page 96 as it relates to Kundalini Mudra and sexuality-\\"If a person feels no sexual desire, but feels good otherwise, then this is fine and normal. When the desire is there, it should be indulged, either with a partner or alone.\\" I suppose, that's not what you want to read in this book.That said, feel free to read a copy from the library, practise the mudras as you see fit, but understand that this is nowhere close to imbibing the essence of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mudras that work!","review":"It is always a pleasure to find practical books where one actually feels like doing the exercises.

I also found one that I have unconsciously done for years when needing inspiration, and I found that it actually IS for inspiration and creativity!

It wasn't exactly like he was all that original when he came out. Nevertheless, I really liked the remedy when it came out when i first started high school. I thought it was creative, unique, and a very fun, upbeat style. I decided to listen to Jason Mraz again after a friend was a huge fan of his. I downloaded this album and thought most of the tracks were simply awesome! The songs were all simple(very little instrumentation, no synthsizers). But they all still tended to be catchy and upbeat. This guy does a great job of writing catchy songs that can appeal to a mass audience. There were def. a few surprises on this cd in terms of listening to it.

This cd was great because it does everything a good cd should. It's more upbeat songs such as Remedy and Curbside Prophet draw you in to the music and then the other songs open up to you more as you listen to it.My personal favorites areYou and I both- a good opener for the cd with a nice sound to it.Remedy- The first song I ever heard by Mraz I love this song.Curbside Prophet- While not as good as remedy in my opinion its a great song thats fun to listen to.Too Much Food- I like the sound of the song even if the lyrics are a little bit different on this song.Absolutley Zero- Jason Mraz really showcases his vocal abilitys on this song .The Boy's Gone- I love this song you just have to get past the slow opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive debut album","review":"I got the cd after i heard his song, Remedy on the radio and have no regrets.

It's a great mystery how much popular press and fame John Mayer gets than Jason Mraz, because, in my opinion, Mraz's album has much more to offer. He's voice sounds more appealing, his music is more upbeat, his lyrics are clever and oftentimes funny (ie The Remedy, Curbside Prophet, and Sleep All Day). His lyrics, the way they flow from his mouth make his more upbeat songs infectious to listen to over and over. Why doesn't this guy get played more or get more airtime? Basically, if you want good, original, acoustic-based music, you have to try this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"Jason Mraz is a disciple of the gospel of do it now, purveyed by Dave and Dave Lite, aka John Mayer. It's a fine enabler of a message, of course, and people who like their naivete served with a hearty dose of cynicism lap it up. But this guy actually sounds happy, and that makes Jason Mraz stand out. The joy of Mraz's logophilic lyrics, delivered in a style that sounds like the sprightly bastard child of Broadway tenor and Village hipster, deliver the \\"don't worry/be happy/for tomorrow we go poof\\" philosophy with somewhat more credibility than its other promulgators. He's not as morbidly obsessed as Matthews, and seems less self-absorbed than Mayer. It may be laughable to buy the conclusion that \\"nothing really matters in the end\\" from twentysomethings, but Mraz is one \\"curbside prophet\\" who lets you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened in the studio","review":"After listening to a couple of tracks I can't beleive what I heard.

I am left wondering what did the industry do with Jason."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-round stunning album!!","review":"To put it concisely: Jason Mraz has the most heart-warming and 'human' of voices - an album definitely worth buying!! Endorsed by singer/song-writer, Jewel, you can instantly tell that this guy must ooze talent. Boy does he do that. Despite being compared to John Mayer, his music still conveys a unique and refreshing style, in particular 'You And I Both' is song which demonstrates that fresh sound, an instant hook.If you like the acoustic sound of John Mayer, you're going to love the sound of Jason Mraz. The sheer effort that's put into his music compells me to come back to this album. His voice perpetuates its own vibe - it creates its own rhythms and sticks in ones mind for a long time. A must get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone!!!","review":"This cd is the favorite one in my whole collection!! Marz's voice and instrumentals are easy to listen to.

I'm so glad i bought this cd... jason's lyrics are catchy, as are the songs themselves, and while i don't know a thing about riffs and chords, i do know that this cd is one of my all time favorites, and i've already bought tickets to see his live show when he comes through town. GO buy this cd, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"jason mraz will blow you away","review":"i love jason mraz, and first got into his music after listening to an acoustic version of \\"the remedy.\\" personally, i find the acoustic rendition much more appealing and raw than the album one, but that's just me. you know someone's got talent when their voice and unbelievable talent cannot fully be shown in their album - jason mraz live is UNBELIEVABLE. one of the greatest experiences of my life, and everyone deserves to hear him in concert. unlike a lot of pop artists, he does not stay within the confines of the background music from his album. he dabbles around all the time, experimenting and expressing, and he is just incredible live. i cannot even describe. a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"Jason Mraz is the consomate singer-songwriter that comes around once in a blue moon. His stream-of-consciousness lyrics are something that I find intriguing. Songs are full of great hooks and good beats, although at first listen, songs do sound quite similar. Jason Mraz has outstanding vocal range and quality, buy shines most in his improvisation. He is an amazing live performer. Some favorites from WFMRTC include \\"You and I Both\\", \\"On Love, In Sadness\\", \\"Too Much Food\\" \\"Absolutely Zero\\", and \\"The Boy Is Gone\\". Other songs to check out: \\"Unfold\\", \\"Zero Percent Interest\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAITED over a year to......","review":"I had this album for over a year and this definitely had become my default music when I go to sleep and I ended up singing along instead. The lyrics are witty , which reminded me of BNL without the comical music and at the same time very heartwarming biography of Jason. It is like you travelled back with him from Mechanicsville,Va. to San Diego,Ca and watch as his career blossomed. Coupled that with his blog and there you go, he is your best cyberfriend now. The music are not really jewels but it is the words that makes you play this album again and again and again. So for Mrazters, hurray!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy","review":"This is a sweet album full of funny catch phrases. It's just a fun album. If you like this CD, you'll love Joe Sneva from Seattle. I've seen him 4 times and he reminds me a lot of Jason Mraz and Jack Johnson. www.joesneva.com check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lose the band","review":"Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of artists with actual musicians backing them up. But in Mraz's case, the backup turns his music into \\"bright shimmering pop.\\" Which personally, I'm not a fan of, in fact I'm upset I actually bought the cd. Mraz's musicianship and talent is lost in these grossly cheerful and superficial renditions of his music. I think he's an decent artist, with a lot of growth to come, which is apparent in his live music. Want to hear some of his best stuff where he sheds the \\"Mayer sound\\"? Download some of his live stuff, then support Jason for the true musician he is and see his show, preferably one with just a acoustic guitar and maybe a conga or two accompanying him."},{"rating":"1","title":"over produced","review":"I heard Mraz on a sunday morning tv program with a stand up bass and percussionist. I was quite impressed with his vocal talents and the raw power of the songs. This CD is not that musican I heard. I can't believe the praise on this CD and the high ratings. It is over produced pop and not very good at that. The young man should find himself another producer and cut loose any advise to clean up his sound. I don't know what the folks that are rating this CD are getting excited about as I read and disagreed with most of the reviews.I will say that this young man has talent and I would most likely buy his next attempt. I would recommend that anyone who hasn't bought this one do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live is better","review":"This cd was, in my opinion, not very good. I feel it was overproduced, making the stuff sound too poppy and perfect. Also, the selection of songs seems to have no cohesion. Every song is a different style, making it hard to listen too and difficult to read.I had just about given up on Mraz when my friend got me a copy of his \\"Live at Java Joe's\\" CD. It is so much better. This live stuff is pretty cohesive in one style and also shows off Mraz's skill as a vocalist, (skat solos are great). Also, i feel the setup of Mraz with a guitar, and his sideman Toka on hand percussion really lightens the sound and gives it a easy to listen to quality.So anyways, I'd say check out his live stuff if you can. im not sure where my friend got this CD, but, in my opinion, Mraz should have it on Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jason Mraz review","review":"I loved the remedy, and I thought the the c.d. would be fabulous based on it. Turns out the c.d. was not that good. The remedy was the best song and the others were slow and boring. I was extremely disappointed. I expected much better. I would save my money or listen to all the songs on the c.d. before buying. Humph! Signed Ashley!"},{"rating":"1","title":"John Mayer has nothing to worry about!!","review":"I love John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares\\", so I thought I'd give this a try as well. While John's debut has a \\"Dave Matthews but better\\" sound, Jason's debut is sort of a folk-type album. Now, why they get compared to each other a lot is beyond me. But the fact of the matter is that they do get compared. Now Jason's folk sound would be good if most of the songs weren't either sleep inducing (The Boy's Gone, Absolutely Zero), or just straight up silly (Too Much Food, Curbside Prophet). Sorry to all you die hard fans, but this just isn't cutting it for me. Sure, I admit that I like \\"The Remedy\\", \\"Sleep All Day\\", and \\"On Love, In Sadness\\", but the rest is just a waste! Like the review title says, John Mayer shouldn't really worry about any competition with this guy! Save your hard earned dollars for John Mayer's album instead!! When are more of these so-called \\"real\\" artists going to realize that \\"real\\" doesn't always have to equal painfully dull?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Set switch to \\"fizzy pop overdive\\"","review":"It is so hard to make this kind of music. Think of the effort the profucer had to go to find the right drum machines. And drown the songs in synth and lovely glitter. And syrupify Jason's young voice. And turn this record into a sugarcoated masterpiece. Delicious- swallow it kids, its good for you! Just like candy and bubblegum!Poor Jason, hes supposed to be talented too. Maybe next time he should go it without the bigwigs. Because the bigwigs want to do one thing, they want to sell units! And so they turn talented kids into candy factories. Like our friend Jason.Do it alone, Jason! Go with some low key label. You'll find they don't turn your sound into liquid glucose to shove it down the throats of impressionable audiences everywhere. Mmmm. As someone said, start small, gather clout, and then you can dictate your own sound! Artistic freedom is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Message to Jason","review":"The one time my friend and I caught his live show, we were put through hours or boring chat from Mr. Mraz. People come to hear you sing Jason, not jabber on muchadoaboutnothing. I'm not sure if he was drunk, or other, but his sets were boring and it made me realize so is his music. Good voice, but learn to take it more seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This cd is horrible and overrated. If I could give it zero stars, I would. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh look, something to click 'NO' at!!","review":"Haha. Yes I've heard this album. It's not bad, and the guy's original. I just thought I'd make my own comparison. Everybody else stated their opinion, which is a good thing to do (most of the time), so I'll state mine. There is no conceivable way Mraz is superior to Mayer, vocally or instrumentally, period. That's all I wanted to do with this \\"review\\". This album in and of itself is definitley not bad whatsoever. But if I put five stars, would you have read?? Don't think so. One star makes it juicy =) Now lets see how many times we can click the 'no' button before mama calls us in for supper."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's Open Mic night at the Student Lounge!","review":"uh-oh, here's comes another psuedo-talented fratboy from his college's open mic \\"makin' it big\\"...who's this guy, the next Chester J.

A friend turned me onto the album a couple weeks ago and I can't stop listening to it. It's almost like a DMB meets John Mayer meets 70's funk soul groove meets lyrical genius. If you're a fan of lyric and really great melody, this album is for you... There are some really great songs that are reminiscent of early Paul McCartney. Trust me when I say this album is definately worth a purchase!

RUN, do not walk to get this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth your time and money","review":"Jason Mraz has a better voice than any male singer i've heard in a while. He's unique, witty, and his music has VARIETY. Not every song sounds the same, which is nice. It's an awesome CD, worth the buy.(I rarely take it out of my CD player!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD But...","review":"This is a fabulous and well orchestrated CD, but a friend had downloaded some of his mp3's and to my dismay his live stuff is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You rocket has come!","review":"The word gem comes to mind when I think about this album. It is an amazing mix of eclectic styles. I was genuinely surprized and extremely pleased. Jason Mraz is BillyJoel, Spin Doctors, Paul McCartney -bluegrass, funky fun!!! just when you think that you have his style pinned the next track will totally blow your theory out of the water. Worth every penny!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Jason Mraz","review":"I was introduced to Jason Mraz through his \\"Live @ Java Joes\\" album and I haven't stopped listening since. He is an electric, mad-scatting vocal and musical prodigy and I knew he was going to be big.I eagerly awaited his Electra release and when I listened to it the first time, I thought I must have the wrong album.This CD is remarkably slow paced, low energy. His signature vocal styles have been cut out. His lovable and talented percussionist, Toca was inaudible and drowned in cheesy synth sounds and horrible drum machines. The only thing that sounded like Mraz was the title track. The rest were a big let down.I love Mraz's music and want other people to hear it; But not this. This is obviously the offspring of an overbearing producer trying to put out radio tracks for the yuppie pop music crowd. If you want to hear Mraz, go to his website and Order \\"Live @ Java Joes.\\" ... You will not be disappointed, unless you buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful transition from coffee shop to the record store","review":"Jason Mraz is an incredibly dynamic performer whose ability to scat, improvise, and just flat out deliver a killer performance is hard to match these days. Being a Mraz junky for several years now, I much prefer his live performances, but his first studio album was a welcome surprise.Give this dude a try - he'll certainly not let you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"not my usual style of music...but great","review":"usually i listen to punk,hardcore,metal,etc-not pop.but this is great for anyone.hes really talented.people might say im a poser cause i have this cd in between green day,system of a down,metallica,sex pistols,etc-but if i like it i like it and jason mraz is just great.every song is perfectly put together and there are great lyrics.best songs-id do anything,the remedy,curbside prophet,too much food.anyone would dig this cd.if you like hard stuff and think your a sissy or something for listenin to this talented dude,your a loser.BUY THIS NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, NOW!","review":"This cd literally changed my life. I recieved it for christmas a few years ago, and fell in love with it and everything else Jason does. I've listened to this cd continuously for over two years and I still love it.

He has a great voice (superb range, control) and he's a fun, new personality. Love him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome music","review":"First, to compair Jason Mraz to John Mayer isn't really necessary just because their music is actually very different. Their lyrics are different, their music is different, their feel is different. Mraz's CD is great. To make this short and sweet, I'm really happy I bought this CD! It's fun and sweet and a great CD to listen anywhere at any time. He's not John Mayer, he's Jason Mraz and his CD rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I really enjoyed this cd. I think because it has a different style then some of the other stuff that is out there right now. Especially the songs that are getting alot of playtime right now.Love the combination of the pop and jazz sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for an amazing major label debut.","review":"Waiting for my rocket to come is a great album and the first one i've picked up from Jason Mraz i like the combination of genres in this release with reggae, folk and blues coming across as the main influences and with this been a major label debut it's pretty good it does'nt seem to have much wrong with it at all. This is a near perfect release and the music grows on you more every time you listen to it for example last week i would have probably rated this a four star album now it's a 5 star album, Waiting for my rocket is also a pretty catchy album so if you're into catchy music then this is a good album for you to pick up, another thing i like about this album (which is nowhere near as important as the music) is the artwork on the album, it just has a raw look about it, though the album is not raw it's very well recorded and produced and elektra have found a good artist in Jason Mraz."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing new blend","review":"I thought this was an excellent cd, if you like this cd or want to know about ones like it, I suggest a band that not many people know about, \\"Dispatch\\" and of course John Mayer, Counting Crows, and Dave Mathews Band"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for a rocket to come...and blow his ass away!","review":"Okay. I love the song 'The Remedy (I Won't Worry)'. The song 'You and I Both' is alright. It just goes downhill after that. I mean...STRAIGHT down. I bought this CD, listened to it ONE TIME, most of the songs I couldn't even get half-way through without skipping to the next, and sold it in the Amazon.com Marketplace the same day, for fear of it's wretchedness infecting my good CDs by being in the same collection. lol...The melodies are pretty much non-existent, the songs are very boring. The Remedy and You & I Both sound SO out of place it's hysterical. Bottom Line: If you're curious, buy it on Amazon.com used first, instead of blowing the full 15 bux at a record store"},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU SHIPPED ME THE WRONG CD","review":"When I received my cd of waiting for my Rocket to come I was very excited, only to find that inside the case was he cd Lou Reed, Newyork!

It was one of those rare occasions where the supporting act was at least as good as the headliner. This album is better than words can describe, and when Jason performes live he is ten times better than this album. If you get the chance go see him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd i've ever heard in a longlong time!","review":"I'm unfortunately not from the California area, so I have a friend to thank for my newfound adoration. One of my friends told me to check him out because I love John Mayer. I did, and he's probably one of my most favorite artists out there. Now that he's out there, that is. I'm not a huge fan of DMB, but I love Jason. So if you're not a fan of dmb (and I believe I'm probably the only one.. lol), who he's been compared to, check him out anyway. You'll be pleasently surprised. :) It's a fun cd to listen to and to sing along with, so go buy it.. now. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason ROCKS!!!","review":"If you do not yet own this CD, GO GET IT NOW!

He has been the newest and best sound in the music industry, and his music is winning fans over every minute.

Congrats to Jason on his great accomplishments, we WILL see more amazing things from this great performer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for a better album to come","review":"The only songs worth listening to on this album are the ones that bear similarity to the hit \\"The Remedy\\", which is good for its interesting lyrical flow and rhythm. What I found as I listened to this C.D. was that most of the melodies had overly simplistic beats, not enough instruments, or rather crappy songwriting. It seems to me that Jason needs to take his music to the next level, for the album as a whole creates the impression that he simply rushed through it and then called it a day. While Jason appears relatively skilled with his all-out rock pieces, his softer songs all have a dull feel to them and do not have enough variation to be likeable for their full lengths. If nothing else, though, this C.D. seems to be a lot more outgoing as well as more commendable than Jason Mraz's \\"Mr. A to Z\\" album. I would not recommend Waiting for My Rocket to Come, for Jason has a fairly tedious style which has yet to be improved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's oh so pleasant.","review":"Jason Mraz is the new Hootie! Stilted and self-conscious, and just a bit aloof. Strictly for the foam-trucker-hat, \\"we want to rock but can't loosen up\\" crowd. This one has an expiration date, and it's coming up fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt Cut It","review":"With so-called 'witty' lyrics, it just doesn't cut it, his first single 'the remedy' which is obviously a crowd pleaser, and possibly the only song on his debut album that makes you want to buy the cd isnt worth it. although he does have talent i dont think you should buy this cd, maybe wait for the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"One man... two songs...","review":"... and I only like one of them. This album is a boring and derivative waste of time. It would have put me to sleep if it didn't annoy me so much. I bought it because I thought \\"The Remedy\\" was clever. It doesn't seem so clever now that I know half the songs on the album are almost exactly the same - stream-of-consciousness words pulled from commercials and the media, and a warbly up-and-down melody that gets old really fast. The other half consists of whiny, twangy navel-gazing that I find unlistenable. When Mraz' rocket comes, I hope for his sake and mine that it brings some new ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanna know where it started from","review":"Considering Mraz' unmatched voice, songwriting depth, incredible taste and unique style, it's disappointing to hear something so average.

This is just kinda average, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO ORIGINAL AND SO AMAZING","review":"If I get just one person to discover how amazing Jason is, then I've made a difference in this world. His music has touched my soul. His lyrics are so deep and full of feeling! He has a live CD that can be bought via curbsideprophet.com and it is SO good. mrazmerized.com is another website where you can download live versions of some unreleased stuff. I have seen him in concert many times and i reccommend that you get hook on MRAZ!!! Look for his live DVD/CD coming August 2004...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The rocket they call Mraz","review":"Everyone listen up, The album waiting for my rocket to come is a vessel that is filled with heartache, love, growth, dreams, and all around talent that is heading no where but up the charts. When you buy this album you will automatically lose yourself in his voice, wit, and power that can only be described as Mraz. You can choose from a palette of tracks such as \\"Curbside Prophet\\" which gives off an aroma of quick wit somewhat similar to the Barenaked Ladies. Or you could be struck in the chest with a bat engraved by Mraz and listen to \\"You and I both\\", which is a song about growth and space from that someone, who used to be, someone you shared secrets and cigarettes with. I would like to write a review on all the songs but how about you just pick it up and see for yourself. Overall this album is a sign of hope in the shape of a rocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate","review":"I thought I might like this artist. I was sadly mistaken. I really dont like anything about him and I really dont like his lyrics.

His lyrics are refreshing and moving, changing from scatting to almost rapping at times. He is full of raw talent and you can feel the emotion he puts into his work. Unlike other artists his voice can stand alone without the aid of instruments, yet it is complimented wonderfuly with them. This CD is well worth it times ten! I too would suggest seeing Jason Mraz live if the opportunity arrises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd","review":"When my friend Natalie told me about this cd I didn't think that it would be as great as she described it. I decided to buy it after seeing one of his videos online. JASON MRAZ IS GREAT! I'm a Josh Groban and this fits perfectly in my collection. WHERE HAS JASON MRAZ BEEN ALL OF MY LIFE? His music is so much fun. It has a playful feel to it that makes me want to listen again and again. This is also a great buy for anyone who plays the guitar for fun. I haven't found the tabs for these songs online but they're pretty easy to learn. If you like Josh Groban or Billy Gilman, Jason Mraz's cd is the perfect thing to buy. All of the songs on the cd were written by Jason Mraz which makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!!!","review":"Great batting jacket!

There are a few like that in this DVD (eg. Tina Jordan). Still, it's produced to the usual slick, upmarket playboy standard; though often shot in a decidedly 'music video' style that looks good, but isn't always very erotic or sensual.

My first white hairs started appearing when I was 16 and I didn't want to become a slave to the salon.White hair, and mine is snow white, has no pigment so it shows everything it absorbs. When mine started turning yellow at the top I had to do something so I tried this shampoo.It did remove the yellow (or color-neutralize?, I'm not sure it actually removed it) in just a couple of shampoos. So it does what it says but the smell is very strong. I have allergic asthma and the smell literally takes my breath away. It also lingers in your hair for days.I will probably use it once a week or so for maintenance but not as an every time shampoo. The smell is really off-putting.

I still have the brassy tone. I left it on for 2 and a half minutes then for 4 and a half minutes. Still brassy. It did leave my hair tangled, as others complained. The smell was fine. Reminded me of something that happened to me hair-wise in the 90s...can't quite place it. Maybe an Aussie product?Just here to counter the rave reviews and share my truth. Will repost if something changes. Let me know if I did something wrong and that's why it didn't work. But I followed all the tips on here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I used this shampoo as directed, and I also tried the trick of leaving it in for 30 minutes like a dye after a particularly brassy dye job, but I did not see any decrease in orangeness. I have naturally dirty blonde hair and only dye about three shades lighter at home, so I was really hopeful about this product, but I did not get the results others have seemed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does work!","review":"I have never used this shampoo until today.

I have highlighted blonde hair and it was looking rather brassy and a little dull, after one use, this product made a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!!","review":"this shampoo is a must have if you have blonde highlighted hair!! i tried Jhirmack because of it's better reviews but it doesn't hold a flame to Shimmer Lights. this shampoo works better than all of the purple shampoos that i have used, and i've used pretty much all of them to include Shwartzkopf and Bumble & Bumble. this stuff is cheap and does the trick; i will never use another purple shampoo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased","review":"I haven't used this product in a while but once I lightened my hair again I needed some. I ordered a new bottle on here because Sally's beauty Supply has some ridiculous pricing...and what the hell free shipping and only $8 compared to $15 and the price of gas to get to Sally's. This stuff works well, a little slower than I'd like, I have used it four times once daily since I got it and my hair still have yellow tints to it, but compared to what it was, I know it's working. I don't use the matching conditioner because I have the John Freida version already which works well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"I have white hair and used Pantene Silver Expressions until they decided to discontinue--Grrrrrr!! I have actively been in search of a replacement and this shampoo came highly recommended by other reviewers. I personally don't like it for 2 reasons-- 1 is because it leaves your hands purple when using it and I'm pretty sure if it colors your hands, it's adding some color to your hair!! I WANT mine as white as possible! 2 is because it stinks! It smells like really strong bath soap or kitchen soap. NOT good!! I've found the best product so far to be the Jhirmack silver shampoo. Hope this helps!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do a thing","review":"After reading all the positive reviews I was excited and hopeful to try a product that hopefully would take out the brassiness from my hair. I have light brown hair with blonde highlights. My highlights are a full yellow color and my brown hair has brassiness from a bad dye job. After using this product I didn't notice an improvement at all. I rinsed and repeated and left on my hair about 4 mins the second time. Left my hair rather dry and hard to brush (tangled). The smell isn't that bad, kind of reminds me of old lady smell. I will keep using this until the bottle runs out to see if I'll ever see an improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Received quickly, great packing, and reasonable price.

Turned my blonde hair purple :(","review":"My hairdresser suggested I use this product on my bleach blonde hair to eliminate some of the brassy yellow tones. I went out and bought the shampoo and conditioner w/o even thinking about reading some reviews first. Well, I washed and conditioned my hair with it, and I ended up with purple highlights! So not only did I spend $20 on the shampoo and conditioner, I now also have to spend money to have my hair recolored. What I don't understand is that it says right on the label \\"will not leave residue, no patch test required\\". All I have to say to that is yeah, ok. Thanks Clairol!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This product turned my hair blue!","review":"I used this shampoo and conditioner on my blonde highlighted hair for about a week. First of all the purple color of the product stained my hands and my towels. It took all the yellow out of my blonde highlights and then proceeded to turn my hair blue. The next day I used a normal shampoo and conditioner and it turned my green. Needless to say I had to go to my hairdresser and get my color fixed. PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT OR YOU WILL END UP PAYING MORE MONEY TO FIX YOUR COLOR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this product","review":"The product came in the mail with the top loose and purple shampoo everywhere. It would have been a good idea to tape the top. It also smells like \\"old lady\\" shampoo. It really is a gross smell that stays with your hair for days. The instructions also say to wash, rinse and repeat, so you end up using twice as much product. This turned my platinum hair grey in several areas. I bought the biggest size, because this is a staple for blondes, and ended up throwing it out after just 5 uses. I would highly recommend investing in the Unite Blonda Shampoo instead. It smells amazing, you only leave it on for 45 seconds and it is less drying than this product- truly the Unite is worth the money. Skip the Shimmer Lights completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Followed directions but it does not work at all","review":"I have used this 6 times and have followed all the directions and advice.

After quite a search, I finally bought the shampoo and conditioner. The shampoo has a dark purple color and very thick, gloppy texture. Both shampoo and conditioner have an annoying, cheap fragrance.

I went shopping for a replacement. Tried Shimmer Lights, the shampoo and the conditioner. Sure isn't anything like the Pantene :o( The shampoo was acceptable but nothing to write home about but the big disappointment was in the conditioner. My hair is currently very short, thankfully, because I can't imagine using it on hair that needs to be combed. There is no sense of any conditioners being in there at all - no slipperiness, for lack of a better term. I'll keep looking for a replacement to the Pantene I loved but Shimmer Lights is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried out my hair","review":"This shampoo is horrible.

I found that Shimmer Lights worked better than much pricer products like Phyto's whitening shampoo (to my surprise). Please note this product is not an everyday shampoo- I only use once every week or two weeks to keep my color fresh. Overuse will turn your hair temporarily purple-tinted. I purchased both the shampoo and conditioner, but find just using the shampoo gives me good results."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Shining Silver Hair","review":"My first attempt at using a product for silver hair and it worked just fine.

Hated it, my beautician suggested shimmer lights for blonde & white hair. First time I used it I got wonderful gray to silver color. Will not stop using it! It gives my hair such life. Only wish I had found it several years ago. In the sunlight it is truly beautiful. Even what little brown hair I have is now a soft silver brown. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers What It Promises","review":"Clairol Shimmer Light Shampoo Blonde & Silver 8 oz. is a popular-priced shampoo that really, so far as I'm concerned, delivers what it promises. It reinforces blonde or light brown hair color, giving it lots of sheen; and it punches up blonde highlights, in between those expensive trips to the beauty salon. (And we all know that to go blonde, even just for highlights, means you might as well keep a sleeping bag at your favorite salon.) And, although I haven't tried most of the colors, I can tell you that several years ago, I wore my naturally reddish hair in a reddish shade, how's about that! And the Clairol Red Shampoo punched that up almost too much. Finally, this shampoo is relatively economical as just a little dab will do you, and it lathers up nicely, with a pleasant aroma, to which perfume, thankfully, I am not allergic, and I'm allergic to so many scents. No downside that I can see."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"I used this when I dyed my hair a light ash blonde. It works well to brighten blonde hair and tone down the yellow/brassy tones. Keep in mind though that it won't take place of a toner. It's not that strong. It is simply brightening. If your hair is extremely yellow or brassy, it will only make minimal difference. Also, I wouldn't use it every day. It can be quite drying and I notice my ends became brittle if I used it too much. It shouldn't turn your hair purple if you wash it out thoroughly. Overall a good product especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver of a Product","review":"I have been using this for a couple months at this point, but it just now saved me from a hair crisis and I felt moved to write a review. I bought this when I lightened the ends of my hair to a near white and wanted to maintain the tone. It always did the job and I'd notice the difference if I skipped a week. Just tonight I cut my hair and had to touch the color up again, but I used a different product (1st time: Revlon Frost & Glow = GOOD 2nd time: Clairol Frost & Tip = BAD). Yellow. Gross. Horrified; I start a new job tomorrow. I lathered my hair up with this and left it on for just short of ten minutes and it saved my tone. It looks like it did before. This will stain light-colored things if you don't rinse it off immediately, which is the reason behind my 4-star rating. I guess that's to be expected when this is as effective as it is, but it's still a hassle. I highly recommend this to anyone in need of tone correcting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Purple Glop","review":"If you are thinking of using this product and you have ANY sensitivities to hair coloring products, dyes or perfumes, DO NOT order it.

Yes, it worked a little but the smell was so unpleasant for me that I will not use this again. I was avoiding people all day so that they wouldn't smell me!

I followed the simple instruction, and tried to be very careful for each step. Still, I got blackend pan bottom with burned smell all over the house.I'd recommend you buy a non-stick one for peace of mind. I can't imagine you have to spend 4*15 minutes=1 hour for the seasoning and so easily have a mess. Even after that, after each use, you still have to apply cooking oil to avoid rust. If I still bother to spend so much time and care for a wok, why wouldn't I just get a $10 wok.

It does have a bit of a hum but then the noise of my strat overwhelms that - need humbuckers I guess.

First of all, I've played both the electric and bass guitars for many years now and have gone through many practice amps during that time. I think this Behringer amp is the best bang for the buck. This amp packs a nice like punch and is plenty loud to practice with around the house. What people need to realize is that this isn't the type of amp that you will perform at gigs with, nor should you expect to, especially with a $60 price tag. But if you do need a nice, reliable, powerful little amp to practice with around the house, this is perfect.

Gallagher does this by selecting weak points of various historian's arguments (without engaging their strong points), focusing on particularly weak books, and making various special pleadings. Although he occasionally makes very valid points, in the end, his arguments are very weak. Providing quotations from people who supported the Confederacy in no way diminishes the fact that many other people were disenchanted with it. In the end, Gallagher's attempt to stem the historiographical tide will be seen to have been unsuccessful."},{"rating":"1","title":"One man's view","review":"This book was obviously a research paper, written from the Confederate point of view, which the author frankly stated.

I only finished the book because I wanted to be able to discuss it in a book club.

Fortunately, the novel is excellent so I forged ahead even though the physical characteristics of the book were not very appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside my head","review":"An astounding novel that revels with science fiction. Under unbelievable circumstances the realistic story of Yakov Bok comes to life through the Fixer. Any genre-preferring reader will enjoy this book.

Based on a factual murder or not, this book is definitely full of pointless details that don't move the story (if it can even be called that) along, but only impede it. The writing and phrasing are flat and lifeless. Nothing can be felt for the characters because there isn't any kind of \\"life\\" vibe from them. That said, the book should be re-titled \\"Yakov Calls His Wife Horrible Names And Disrespects God\\". I had to read this pathetic trash of a novel for my English class, and nothing irritates me more. I can barely stay awake when my teacher talks about it. If you want real authors that actually have talent, check out books by Grimson, Bloch, or Blatty. Don't waste your time with The Fixer. The book was a waste of paper and ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"torture and persecution","review":"this book is wonderful and at the end one marvels that it was written by an american author, but he is esentially a human being, talking about another human being in deep pain at being persecuted. the book is subtle and wonderful, one gets lost in all the suffering, i hpe people enjoy it and learn the lesson all the writers throughout time have tried to teach us, humanity is one and we are all brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fixer- What a Mind Bender!","review":"It is just sad to realize you live in a world full of hate and violence. That's just what this book was all about.The story takes place in Russia just before WWI. The main character, Yakov Bok, is accused of murdering a young, Russian boy. To make things worse, he's a Jew. Because of this he is looked upon with hate and unjustful eyes from the surrounding Russian community.This book was very intense and kept me wanting to read (which is very tough for a high school student). I couldn't believe the amount of hatred towards Yakov just because he was Jewish. And to think that that same amount of hatred still exists today.The Fixer was a well written, well configured book. Personally, this book made me think about how to treat people no matter what they do or how they act, or even for who they are.I would encourge others to read this book and hopefully finish with the realization that racism and hatred are completely destructive to any civilized society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harsh.","review":"I continued reading because it was a book club selection.

About half of it talks about the well-known price-benefit map. No question it's a fundamental idea, but hardly leading edge. Plus you need a McKinsey team to execute it. Given the pedigree of the authors I was hoping for more.

Now I really love that synth riff, but the way they use it makes it immensely redundant. Most of these tracks are just repetitive beats and grooves with no variation or dynamic pacing. They even stick with the same chord progression. Every track has a pounding bead, but a droning feel to it except for The Viper Remix. That one actually put some interesting variation to the song and is the only track I can recommend.Looks like this is a rare CD and fetches a premium price. Why is beyond me.

These reviewers, like myself, are not panning the series; they love the series and that is why they are so angry about the manner in which it is being released. I have not (and will not) purchase any TV series on DVD that is not released in complete seasons. The length of the shows cannot be a factor -- the Star Trek series were all one hour in length and they were released in complete seasons. And these early Gunsmoke episodes were only 20(30)mins in length, so there is no excuse (other than greed) for this method of release.

Release the sets on a faster timeline. No one will keep buying them for 11 years. Those who are interested are interested NOW. As another said, they are pushing me hard toward those who are providing the entire series.

The way Gunsmoke is being treated only encourages that trend. They hurt their own market. A word of caution; We live in a capitalist system, supply and demand. If owners of a program don't supply a show in a timely reasonable way they CREATE a bootleg market. Gunsmoke is widely pirated for that reason. It's a shame, and owners of such programs like to bemoan this illegal activity, but in some cases they are among the biggest contributers to it! Another larger segment of the public will simply stay away from slowly released and over priced sets like this. (There is certainly no lack of shows competing for sales out there, even if most are much lower quality programs.) You are shooting yourself in the foot and denying the public a great show at the same time.

Ridiculous!I thoroughly enjoyed season 1, but I will NOT buy any subsequent seasons or half seasons until the price comes down to equal the first season's price per episode. I cannot afford it.

But caught with their hand in the digital cookie jar, CBS is trying to sell half seasons for the price of a whole.CBS will not halt production because of weak sales - fear not. This series alone is a goldmine. But those who think the cost is high and are still willing to pay are only propping up an artificially inflated price. And the more who pay, the longer the price will stay stratospheric.Those of us who are not paying (and not paying loudly) are merely renegotiating the price.

Comparing this to Spinal Tap is like comparing toilet water to holy water (okay, I'm exaggerating but it was a ridiculous comparison to begin with). Spinal Tap was an enjoyable mockumentary for a lot of people whether they enjoyed the music or not - the humor and the distinguishable characters were enough to drive the movie. With Hard Core Logo, it wasn't so much that I didn't understand what was going on or who the characters were... I just didn't care. This is a 90 minute experiment in pointless, witless, and directionless drivel that begs to be ejected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Gimmicry","review":"I was almost able to forgive this film it's glaring inconsistencies.

However the (psuedo) tragic ending was nothing short of a betrayel. It seemed just like a cheap quasi-Tarantino-esque mechanism.

Search within the pages to put your hand up to the actual size of a gorilla's hand. Stand in the mouth of a great white shark and awe at his sharp razor teeth that are so close you can touch them. Throughout this book are interesting and amazing facts such as the goliath birdeater tarantula (12 inches across) who eats birds and small animals,or the atlas moth (12 inches) who is sometimes thought to be a bird. All readers, no matter what age, will enjoy the paper torn pictures that make this book brilliant! The paper gives each animal the texture needed to look real such as the saltwater crocodile who has rough, brown, aged skin. Highly enjoyed, Actual Size is a wonderful book with information everyone needs to know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Kohl's book!","review":"This book can be bought at Kohl's department store for $5.00.

The animals or, if a large animal, part of an animal is illustrated using handmade paper collage. What may sound like just a clever concept, when skillfully executed, resulted in an awesome book. Some of the animals shown are the pigmy shrew, atlas moth, dwarf goby, Goliath frog, and giant squid. The dimensions of the animal is noted and as well as a paragraph about such things as habitat and diet which makes this a very interesting book.

His unadorned demonstration of his distaste for those who would attempt to ban him from his beliefs is readily noted in his acerbic remarks. If your looking for potions and spells you won't find it in this book nor will you find knitted together \\"history\\" of witchcraft and wica. What you will find is what it was like in the early years in the United States to practice openly a religion/belief that was regarded as evil. What you will read is the history of a practicing witch in the face of adversity. Well worth the read to get the true insight without the \\"new age\\" fluff and bright blessings or the catty smugness of posuers using words like \\"quaint\\" when remarking on Martello's recollections of those early years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witchcraft is not a religion","review":"This book was terrible. The author engages in witch wars and bias opinions. Witch craft is not the Old Religion, because witch craft is not a religion, it is a craft.

What is helpful about this book is that it offers a step by step way to identify how your painful past is prohibiting you from living the most fulfilling life you can. Survivors deny and often bury the pain from their childhoods because they think that will free them from the past, but the truth is that the only way to get over the pain is to remember and release it.

After removing the plastic, the mirror brightened some, but its finish is dull and scratchy. It has easily visible scratches from being polished with a too-coarse abrasive. They stopped short of the fine polishing step that might have given the \\"mirror\\" a mirror-quality finish.Better than nothing, I guess.I bought this mirror to replace an older, slightly smaller stainless mirror I'd had for years.

I have no background at all in formal writing; however, even I find typo's and grammatical errors in every single chapter. There is no outline for each chapter. The material skips around continuously and you have to read the chapters 2 or 3 times each just to mentally reformat them into a logical order. Intro, body conclusion. It works for paragraphs, chapters and entire books. I wish the author would find a co-writer who could help him.

I've been trying to write a story about a teenage girl band, and when I spotted this book I knew that it would help me out some. I didn't expect to fall in love with it.Pop Princess tells the story about a girl named Wonder Blake who went from having a home and summer house to moving into her summer home. She had a regular crush and a regular rival, a family falling a part, and a nice singing voice. One day the guy who signed her dead sister Lucky to his record label walked into Dairy Queen, and thought that he would love for her to be his new discovery.I don't want to give away the whole book, but I will guarantee that you will enjoy this book if you like characters that tell it like it is, and a lot of juicy details. At the end of the book there will get to be more emotion, and hopefully you'll get a new insight on how it can be being a teenage pop star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Pop Princess is a great book! It probably won't be your favorite book, it's not touching or memorable or anything... but it's very entertaining and the characters are awesome. I love the plot. This was probably a little better than Guitar Girl becuase it's not as trashy, it is more interesting, and it actually has a good ending.

It portrays the entire state of Florida with all the enthusiasm of a glorified rest home. If I had not already been to Florida many times and known what it's really like, I would most likely be having second thoughts about visiting Florida after viewing this video. The photography is bad and the background music puts you to sleep. If I could do it again, I'd look around and find something better to spend my money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get it now!","review":"Whether or not you liked the film, this score is one of Zimmer's forgotten treasures! It is beautifully written and performed. There is a combination of orchestra and synthesized sounds that blend seamlessly together. My favorite tracks are actually the first and last ones. Both tracks flourish into lush and moving orchestral melodies, although I have to say that the last track is slightly more moving. If you have seen the film, you may agree with this considering what takes place in the film. The score is pretty short, and the tracks are divided up slightly funny, but overall these things are minor drawbacks. If you come across this score (which can be somewhat tricky to find) pick it up! You won't be disappointed! Especially Zimmer fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE BEAUTY","review":"What can I say? This album is a proof, that Hans Zimmer is a living Genius!

Go Here...","review":"The Audio Unlimited Wireless Speakers are a good deal, they are working fine for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turns my pc monitor into a TV screen!","review":"The speaker system is a low cost alternative, and delivers on its promises. Amazon delivered in a timely manner, and the product was well packaged. I enjoy watching streaming movies on my pc monitor, and with the speakers, at last, I can hear the audio across the room.I tried the speakers on the patio, away from the base, and that seems to work as well. Before purchasing, I had read the bad review someone had posted here, and when I got my set, and read the instructions, it was obvious the reviewer had NOT read them, and was pushing the product to limits for which it was never designed. The system does NOT replace the higher cost wireless entertainment audio system, but for people with simpler requirments, and limited budgets - it works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"These speakers are OK. Not the best. They work. Sound quality is tinny, static, and fades in and out. I keep them to remind me STOP, THINK, AND SPEND WISELY!! I want to buy Bose wireless speakers, but I need to be constantly reminded, and I would rather be reminded with $80 speakers then maybe something that costs a lot more. I would not recommend these speakers to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I mainly use these to listen to talk radio, so stereo audio and audiophile-approved sound quality aren't concerns for me. With that in mind, I have one speaker in the basement and one in a detached garage which sits about 20' from the house (total distance from transmitter to speaker is about 40' and through 3 walls).To clarify, yes they can work in stereo, I just don't use them that way. Additionally, the sound quality is pretty much on par with the price.Reception has always been great for me.I do wish the units would remember the last volume setting instead of resetting to the lowest volume upon power-up, but other than that, they have been perfect for my use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...Ok, with some really irritating issues","review":"I just wanted a set of wireless speakers that I could hook to my PC and install in my living room so I could listen to the music on my PC without having to be in my office. These work ok - they're not stereo speakers, but they sound ok. You have to adjust the volume on each one seperately which is no big deal except that you have to re-adjust every time you turn them on. The on/off control on the remote doesn't work, so I have to turn each one on manually which is a pain in the neck. The volume control on the remote works fine, but again - you have to adjust each speaker seperately. The most annoying thing is that every 5 minutes or so, one of the speakers pops. The other one seems to work ok. Overall, I think my money could have been better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing sound quality","review":"I replaced a little wired $65 JBL speaker with these based on the positive reviews. What a let down. What a downgrade.The sound is all treble to the point you hear high end distortion or fuzz.

Could not get a clear signal. Music kept breaking up. I returned the product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereo?","review":"Bought these with the hope of extending sound to outside the house. Sound was plenty loud but the speakers are only delivering sound from one channel! In other words, left side only comes to both speakers, so if you listen to music with intruments mixed to the right side, you WON'T HEAR THEM. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Every once in a while you make a decision or buy a product that makes you smile for weeks after the event. My purchase of this speaker system is one of those times. The transmitter is attached to the output of my DishTV receiver and we listen to background music from various audio stations. One speaker is outdoors and works on battories 30' and two walls away from the transmitter while the other speaker works on AC power only 15' and one wall away. Both work great. I recommend this solution to anyone needing a wireless speaker system."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is our second order for these speakers","review":"Our original order lasted us over two years of very hard use.We take them traveling with us in our RV are able to move them outside and even to the beach. Last year we spent five months in Mexico with lots of humidity and sand. One remote controller does work for both speakers, just hit the Auto Tune at each speaker and adjust on/off or volume. We suggest you turn off the main transmitter when not in use, we didn't and might be the cause having to replace after two years.Enjoy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I purchased these speakers hoping to extend my music about 20 feet.

As someone else noted, they advertise 120 feet range, but the user manual states 35 feet (an estimate, based on my memory). They work fine at short distances, but that's not what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working, manuf. won't repair or return","review":"These speakers were pretty good while they lasted.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sound quality!!!","review":"Price is right. Setup is easy. Sound quality is the worst possible. I wanted to use these speakers indoor to carry the music from the computer in one room to the living room -- 35 feet away. I tried 3 different locations in the living room... The sound was horrible at each location. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Please","review":"For the price and to have music outside it is great.It's not for those that want to blast music, but everyone else it is great.It does eat batteries kinda quick, so I plug them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interference","review":"These speakers will not operate noise free. They are prone to unknown interference. I don't have any 900mhz devices in my home, but these speakers constantly pop while audio is playing. If the speakers are in very close proximity to the transmitter, the popping is minimized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dad'd day gift","review":"I recieved these as a Father's Day gift and they have been wonderful. The quality of the sound is pretty good, but the ease of use and flexibilty are awesome. The whole family can enjoy music from my computer or Mp3 player anywhere around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than I'd hoped for","review":"First of all, they do work. In fact they received a decent signal upstairs, through several walls. I didn't expect a lot of bass and didn't get it. And as mentioned in other reviews, the blue light they use on it is annoyingly bright. You have to turn it away from you and then it still lights up the whole room if there are no other lights. A little black electrical tape does wonders. However, what I didn't expect is sometimes when no music was playing and the speaker was on, it would squawk loudly, possibly due to wireless interference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for talk, tinny sounding for music","review":"I use these mostly to listen to podcasts, so they work great for that. But if you are an audiophile, you will be as sorely dissapointed as I was in the sound. Very tinny and poor bass response. I have a pair of Advent wireless speakers that sound MUCH better with music; however, I haven't tried them with my computer as the transmitter accepts only analog input. The Audio Unlimited speakers were easy to set up with the computer and worked right out of the box. And yes, the remote won't work after ten minutes even if the units are on AC power. Dumb design if you are putting them out of reach. If they had named them Audio Limited, that would have been more accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speakers","review":"Pros: Good speakers, good range, remote is a nice feature.Cons: Uses 6C batteries per speaker, audio device has to be on 50-75% volume before it will connect to the wireless speakers. Not much bass, but quality sound for size.I use them mostly with my mp3 player & computer, but have connected them to tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speakers","review":"Returned after 1 day- speakers had static when only 30 ft away- remote only worked if you were 2 ft away and pointing directly at the unit- not happy with this purchase whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good answer to speaker problem","review":"I have been using these speakers for several weeks now and like them a lot. I use them outside on a three level deck by the pool with input from an XM home receiver, my daughter's i-Pod or the MP-3s on a computer; all do well. I use two spealers with the farthest from the transmitter about 75' removed. I use the AC adapters to power them. The remote is especially handy.

Unless you can afford to wire your entire house for sound, this fits the bill for those on a budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used at an outdoor wedding","review":"I recently bought these speaker to use at my garden wedding. I put batteries in the speakers, hooked up my IPOD and set one speaker in the middle of the garden and one speaker near the altar. The speakers made each song sound crystal clear an gave the illusion of surround sound. We only had the speakers turned half way up and the music was loud enough for everyone to hear even during the reception. We played many genres of music: love songs, jazz and rap included. Everything sounded great--no popping, no static--just the integrity of the music. My in-laws are so impressed with the speakers they are getting a pair for themselves. I will absolutely reuse these speakers over and over again. It is so convenient to put the music where you want it and not where you have an outlet. I put one set of batteries in these speakers which got us through the rehearsal and the complete wedding (about 7 hours) with battery power to spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, tinny sound","review":"These speakers are garbage. My wife, who's no audiophile, commented immediately on how terrible they sounded. We had them for two days and through them away.

I kept the batteries though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's the BAD","review":"I like the sound & wireless option BUT this system had fritzed out on me during parties as well as general listening and no combo of actions has gotten it back on track.

After hooking them up, I do have to say that I was disappointed. These have a hollow sound to them. I would say that you could buy them for voice audio only . I would not buy these for playing music. I myself own a older pair of i think they are a research or ar something speakers which are much better, problem is they now longer make them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out for us.","review":"Works great when they are not squelching or cracking with interference. Like another reviewer said, it's not a little background static or interference, it is loud painful, disturbing squelching. Maybe we have too much wireless stuff operating around here (Internet, garage doors, mouse, keyboard, alarm system, phones). Who knows, but i can't get it to operate cleanly.Haven't been able to try it in a location with no other wireless disturbance, but overall they're not working out for my intended purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded expectations","review":"I purchased the exact same speakers branded Jensen from a local Kohl's.(on sale plus 15% off) Great buy.I brought them home and hooked them up in about 10 minutes. The sound is better than the KML wired speakers I have in my garage. Some mentioned not enough base...these are under a $100! Turn up the base on your output and you actually will have a nice sound. I actually cannot believe the sound coming from these. Love them. Just one thing I am confused about. It says if you shut the power down on your output after five minutes the base station will shut off automatically. On these the red power light on the transmitter is on constant. Don't know if this is right or not. I thought it would shut down all the way. Other than that, keep the speakers in a spot you can reach or hang them up as the remote will not work unless pointed right at it. Definitely a great buy if you want music outside or in another room without wires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Speakers","review":"The speakers are used in Legion bingo hall and work as advertised. I bought two sets and use four speakers and one transmitter. So far I am pleased with battery life and performance. Two speakers are within 25 ft and two are within 50 ft. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that one of the speakers has upside down wall mounting plate and I am not changing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps making hissing sound","review":"I'm very disappointed. These speakers are a good size. But for wireless... there are still wires everywhere unless you want to keep pumping sets of 12 batteries into these babies.I could live with that part.

I guess I have to return them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers","review":"I wanted some speakers for my pool deck without running wires. I researched many different brands and modelsof wireless speakers. Many didnt seem like they would have the range I needed. I took a chance on these and got what I was looking for.

Once I received the speakers and easily connected them, I have been enjoying the music that plays through them in rooms where I always wanted music.

I have 2 of the four that have crackling going on in background after just a few weeks of use. These speakers cannot do stereo sound. Considering you receive 2 in a package you would think that they can be mono/stereo as a choice but no. The remote is nice and either remote works on all four speakers I bought so they are interchangable. The unit cannot be turned on by the remote, it can only be controlled by remote after manual power on button has been pressed which is annoying. If I had a choice now I would have chosen different outside speakers. They do have good sound as long as you do not turn the volumn up very high since they will start bust speaker easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously not waterproof","review":"We bought these speakers to use on our brick patio. They lasted about 6 weeks. We don't think they are really waterproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underperforming","review":"I tried using these from my basement stereo with the speakers placed on my back patio (about 80 feet away) and they get no signal. I've also tried these in my kitchen, directly above my stereo but they still have trouble getting a signal and you can hear static when music is playing.These might be fine if they were in the same room as the receiver but the stated capabilities of 150 feet and zero line of site limitations are an exaggeration"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything we hoped for","review":"We can definately recommend these speakers! They sound good, the reception is excellent, they are everything we were hoping they would be. The remote is very handy. One note: In the manual it says the speaker and the transmitter should be at least 7 meters apart. I emailed Cables Unlimited and they said that was a mistake in the manual. I can attest that it's not a problem. I have one speaker about two feet from the transmitter and it works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"good and not so good","review":"Though I was impressed by the basic function of these speakers, the sound quality and speaker quality was disappointing. It was Mother's day, I was strapped for cash and I saw these on sale so they fit the bill. I thought the range was o.k. I didn't expect the world from these as I only needed the signal to carry about 30 feet. The biggest downside was sound quality. Basically, the sound wasn't too bad until the night time came. When the air got heavy and damp, the speaker bass became muffled and distorted to the point where we had to turn them off. I did bring them with camping and plugged them into the laptop in the camper, that was kind of nice, but I didn't need a cordless application for that situation. I'm kind of a quality guy and if I had to do it again, I would spend the money to get something that is a lot more versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"Read other reviews about the speakers, I did have mixed emotions. I received them and they work great. The remote works great. It's so nice to sit outside doing yard work or just relaxing on the deck and listening to the music.

I already have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what previous reviews built up.","review":"I needed to spread music around my house for an upcoming party and found these mentioned here on Amazon.

Big disappointment and waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as advertised but worthless","review":"I just hooked these up. They work as advertised (wireless, outdoor, etc). However, the speakers are very weak. The max volume is so low that the crickets outside chirp louder than the music produced through these speakers. They are useless in anything but the quietest of environments. Why bother. You would have better luck just turning up the volume on your speakers in the house. Since they were not sold directly by Amazon, I don't know what my return / refund options are. Hopefully I can get my money back for these pieces of trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice speakers, good sound, glaring blue led is only problem","review":"I got these speakers after reading the good reviews. They work very well. I put one outside and one in my dining room to stream my favorite Pandora channels. The only issue is the incredibly bright blue light on each speaker.

Easy to set up too."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the speakers","review":"I bought the speakers to use on the patio. We hung them on the wall and they are fantastic.

Firstly, you have to turn the volume all the way up on the sourc player to get a signal. So if they are later unplugged, the volume is extremely loud. Secondly, when you are connecting them, the give very loud screaching feedback. Thirdly, they just turn off by themselves often in the middle of using them. Further, when reconnected, the volume is all the way down, so you have to turn it up each time. On the plus side, the design is great, and I like the option to use with batteries or a plug. I just wishe they actually worked better for their intended purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"The sound quality of these speakers, when the sound isn't dropped altogether, doesn't quite measure up to the worst portable radio you've ever heard. Even at close range the sound quality and performance was unbearable, and I'm not particularly fussy about sound quality. These speakers aren't worth the price of shipping.

Once I got them working though, even at the highest volume you could not hear them from more than 3 feet away. Based on other reviews, I can only assume that my speakers were defective. I had to return them. On a positive note, the return process is really easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor reception","review":"Very poor reception.I had the speakers not 20 feet from the base and they would loose the conection and put out very loud static.I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing sound","review":"I should preface my review by saying I got these off a clearance table at Lowes, so that may explain my dismay. I mounted these up high on an inclosed patio. The speakers are about 25 feet from the power source. Simply put, the the sound quality is bad. I have tried adjusting the channels, moving the transmitter, moving the speakers and the sound is marginal at best. I have noticed with reviews of wireless speakers that either you get a decent set or a pair of dogs, so it probably is advisable to buy them where you know you can return them. Adding to the other reviewer's comment concerning the remote; mine will not turn on with the remote, just turn off in the same stand by mode as the other reviewer. This means I have to get up on my tiptoes and turn them on, negating the 50% of the remote functionality. Overall I will be replacing these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless, remote speakers","review":"One of the speakers makes static noises when the transmitter is not activated i.e. not plugged into the audio output of the TV. Also, by design, the Remote Control does not turn the speakers on. They must be turned on at each individual speaker. Speakers are very sensitive to interference."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for while then one of the speakers just died","review":"When they were new, sound quality was decent, as was range, but then the batteries get used up quickly and the SQ goes down with it. you can use the included adapter, but that defeats the wireless point.remote cant turn them on, and volume adjustment is independent of each speaker (not in stereo)today, one of the speakers just died!good esthetic design thoughupdate 12/14/08Amazon and Cables unlimited have been great about exchanging the defective speakers, even though it was right at the warranty end (1yr). i noticed the replacements say cables unlimited on them instead of velocity wireless, they look the same, but seem to sound a lot better, than the original. for that, i would upgrade to maybe 3.5 stars, and even 4 if these last longer than the originals (call me in a year) :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cables Unlimited Wireless Speakers","review":"Overall am very pleased with the quality of the speakers. I have an upstairs deck and a downstairs patio that I wanted these speakers for so we could listen to our favorite music outside. These speakers did the trick. The one issue I had is, I could not connect the transmitter to my speaker system in the house. I am having to use the earphone jack on my receiver to transmit to my outside speakers. This in turns mutes the speakers inside the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic buy","review":"I was skeptical on how good the reception and sound of this two set system would be with a price under $80. My biggest concern over all was poor sound quality. The sound is rich and most importantly this system didn't interfere with my wirless N router. I moved these speakers to rooms on a lower floor from the transmitter , into the garage and outside.... the reception was very clear. I couldn't be happier with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like these speakers","review":"I got these speakers a few weeks ago and they have performed quite nicely. The signal goes well through my wood stud and plaster walls. Set-up was easy and did not really require looking at the directions. The sound is good. The loudness is good (I am not however a teenager). They tolerate the high humidity environment of my fish room well.I heave not yet tested their range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Interference","review":"Sound quality is OK, but no matter what I did, the speakers had crackles and sound dropouts while listening. I bought these for my back porch, but after messing around with them for 4 or 5 hours, I decided I had to send them back. I am now going to go through the hassle of connecting wired ceiling speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wireless Speakers working great...","review":"The speakers were easy to install and the quality of sound is great. We have them in the kitchen, making it easier to hear what's on the TV without blaring the volume on the TV. It is also nice to be able to move the speakers around as the kithcen is rearranged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome speakers","review":"These speakers are awesome for any part of the home. I have installed them in the kitchen and it's very easy to do it too. Plug in the pc or tv audio, U can hear from any part of your house and the output is pretty good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I was very disappointed in this product especially after reading all the favorable reviews before I bought it. The speakers crackled a lot, no matter if they were close to or far from the receiver. The sound quality was bad - muffeled and tingy. I returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beeps and interferences","review":"There are two main gripes about these speakers -1. Random beeping and interferences - every few minutes while playing music, one of the speakers (randomly) will beep. Sometimes, you can hear some serious interferences. I have wi-fi and 5.8GHZ phones at home. Not sure if they are the culprit. But come on, everyone has these nowadays. I even went through the hassle to get an exchange from the manufacturer, but the new ones beeps just as often.2. As many reviewers point out, the remote is poorly designed and thought out. You cannot turn on the speakers with the remote. I mean, how stupid is that?I wish I had waited on buying these. Maybe I will sell them on Craigslist and recoop some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate Volume + Monaural + Beeping","review":"Just got these speakers, unpacked them and tested. Now I am returning them. They work fine as per the other reviews - clear sound, no cracking or hissing. They even work all the way up on the third floor. However, the volume at its max is totally insufficient, the music is not in stereo, and as I walk around, the speakers emit a high pitched beep when I pass through specific areas of the room. Recommendation: if you buy these, buy them as a fill for the bathroom or hallway, not for general listening in a family room, porch or bedroom.** EDIT: In User Manual under Technical Specifications: \\"Output Power: 2 x 5W\\". This is also in the product description somewhat cryptically as \\"(10H x 5W)\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible clicking noises and not in stereo!","review":"I purchased these in the hope they would work as a good speaker system for my outdoor theater. Upon opening the box I was a little surprised to see how cheaply the speakers, transmitter, and remote were made. Never the less I proceeded to set them up using AC power instead of batteries ( I didn't have 12 C-cells) and test them out. The first problem is that the transmitter doesn't sent out a stereo signal! Beyond that problem I was getting a intermittent screeching, clicking noise that would not go away by hitting the \\"auto tune\\" button. So I have packed this speaker system back up and have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste you money or time!","review":"I purchased these speakers for my garage which is about 20 foot from the radio that the base to speakers were plugged into, however it could not keep the signal or it had a poor signal. I returned them to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"intermittent","review":"The speakers look good, but are intermittent at 50% of the time. They will lose the signal for 10 to 30 minutes at a time. The blue transmit led light goes off from the sending unit and the music mutes, about 10 to 30 minutes it comes back on. I use it with an Ipod so it is not an unusual audio set up. The distance is not a problem as it is only 20 feet unobstructed. I haven't called the company yet, we'll see what they say and I'll post a new review.Joe Cousins"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great System","review":"Purchased this system a month or so ago and could not be happier. I use the system in an area where there are few radio stations and the reception is poor so I need to use my computer and the internet to listen. The sound quality is better than I anticipated for a reasonably priced wireless system. I have one speaker on a back porch, another in the kitchen an a third(which I purchased seperately) I use as a portable radio (6 c batteries required). I highly recommend this system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Purchased to use with TV. Quickly found out that the volumn on the TV needed to be above 50% full volumn before the transmitter would stay activated and transmit to the speakers. Even when transmitter was active the range of the volumn control for the speakers is very limited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged product, poor customer service","review":"When my speakers arrived, one worked and one did not. I went through the trouble-shooting steps, trying to make the speaker work every which way. No go. The company does not provide a phone number to address these issues. You have to correspond by email. In response, they asked me to send back the damaged speaker and so on and so on. It became easier to just send the whole thing back to Amazon, which is what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio 123","review":"It is as easy as 123. Fast and easy hook-up. A very nice sound from sleek looking speakers. Easy to place and blends into the surrounding area. It is worth the price and performs better than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speakers, great price","review":"These speakers are really good for the price, normally to get good quality sound around the room you need to put a few hundred dollars into speakers, especially if you don't want excess wires running across the room. Mine worked wonderfully straight out of the box. I know it's been mentioned in other reviews bu keep in mind that they aren't stereo and the remote doesn't turn them on but they work great and are perfect for get togethers when you want music throughout the house. I threw a holiday party and placed speakers all around my apartment to play festive music and the speakers performed wonderfully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST","review":"These speakers are all one could ask for. They are quite clear and noise free with PLENTY of volume. I attached the transmitter to the TV in my bedroom and placed the speakers on my bedside tables. This allowed me to clearly hear the television without blaring volume from the set. I STRONGLY recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product just didn't work for what we wanted","review":"This product didn't work for us because we wanted to have the ability to have the television muted at its location and move the sound to another part of the room. The sound from the speakers was fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"These speakers sound good when they work. There is an input thresh hold problem with the transmitter. I had these hooked to a TV for an elderly person to be able to hear their programs with out having the TV so loud it blasted everyone in the next room basically they were sitting on either side of the viewer within 25 ft of the transmitter. The signal light on the transmitter would blink on stay on for 20 to 30 minutes then go off for 1 to 3 hrs. I could unplug the transmitter, the sound on the TV would come back to full.There fix was to max the volume on the TV but it made no difference. They even stated that the transmitter needed to be plugged into the Headphone jack on the TV not the Audio out on the back of the set which was ridiculous. There tech support was threw e-mail only no quick fixes there on any solution. Thank you Amazon for your return policy that is one of the many reasons I shop with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Lots of problems w/ these speakers but the deal breakers are 1) the auto shutoff power saving feature is horrible. You have to have the audio source set high for the receiver to kick on and the audio source has to be constant so if you ever plug the speakers into a computer the activity of day to day business will not be enough to keep them on 2) the transmitter needs a battery power option. It would be nice for true mobility for say and iPod or something like that. 3) overall sound quality and ascetics could be better. 4) Power button on remote doesn't turn speakers on - only off (go figure). No way of telling how load you have set each speaker - you just push the button a bunch and listen to see if they are balanced. // Not happy w/ the speakers I would have rather spent more for better speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wireless speakers- do not work","review":"Got these speakers for my son as a holiday gift. They worked great and easy to set up in his apartment. After 3 weeks, they stopped working, had lots of interference and just were very poor quality. Had to return and buy a more expensive set, that is of much higher quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere","review":"I bought this thinking it was the solution to my wireless surround sound answers. It isn't and the connections are for plug in to TV R & L and won't mute when you mute your receiver. The auto adjust for volume and sound sometimes works and when using the remote to turn them on only works some of the time. I have hooked them up to another TV without using a receiver and found them to be good for direct connection.I recommend this product: Rocketfish(tm) - Universal Wireless Rear Speaker KitModel: RF-WHTIB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound, crackle heard even from 2 feet away","review":"I was very disappointed by these speakers and had to return them. There was a steady crackle heard unless the speaker was right next to the transmitter. It sounded like a radio station that didn't quite come in... What a waste of money that I had to pay on shipping!!!! I'm surprised because of how many good reviews there are. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone based on my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate until they quit","review":"While they lasted, the sound was pretty good. The signal would hiccup sometimes, but it didn't bother me. I was surprised by the quality of the bass. It was disappointing that they required so dang many batteries - Six C's in each speaker, not to mention the transmitter and remote. There are A/C adapters for the speakers and transmitters though.However, after about 2 months of indoor use, the transmitter started to futz out. Over the course of a week or two, it went from losing signal for 10 minutes at a time to 30 minutes or more. It's not a transmission problem - the transmitter \\"signal\\" light goes off, meaning it thinks it's not getting sound and therefore isn't transmitting - I tried it with a couple different input devices with the same result. Can't use these speakers for much if they can't get a signal. Very expensive trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Cheap sound and totally annoying interference.","review":"Cheap, muddy sound when working. Picks up interference from cell phones and wireless routers. Terrible if you live in an apartment building. Lots of loud screeching, interference random loud \\"snow\\" when idle. Mono, NOT stereo. Takes 12! C batteries (not included) Blue LED power indicator lights up the entire room at night.

They arrived promptly, however when my brother-in-law went to hook them up only one speaker worked.

I sure hope that this set works......"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best","review":"I was using Sony wireless however the constant popping sounds drove me crazy so i needed to upgrade. the clarity on the Audio Unlimited is perfect the only flaws are the excessively bright blue led light, the remote is useless because it wont turn on the speakers,and there is no internal battery. If you want to unplug it you need batteries to put in it. If you are going for sound quality and do not plan to drag the speakers all over the house these are the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a well built product","review":"I have bought two of these audio systems. The first one worked for awhile and then a loud tapping noise started coming from one of the speakers. I tried everything - pressing the auto tune button both on the speaker and on the remote, changing the location of the speaker, switching from batteries to power cord... nothing worked. I threw the system out and bought another one thinking I would have better luck. No so. The second one keeps losing the signal and the music shuts off. I have it connected to my computer to play Pandora and to listen in another room.I didn't give this system 1 star because as I am writing this the signal is on after fiddling with the connection cord to the computer. This is going to be constant work to keep the music flowing - not a well made product - it is made in China - need I say more.... It is a great idea to have cordless speakers, just wish it worked as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy these speakers","review":"My friend had a set of these speakers and loved them; she bought me a set and I paid her back. At first, they seemed to work, but within a few months the transmitter device simply would not turn on when plugged in.

The gift was opened and hooked upAFTER the 30 day return policy - so guess I'm stuck with them ???:-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers for Great Price","review":"I think that everyone who reviewed these speakers poorly was expecting too much for the money. For what they cost, they are fantastic and exceeded my expectations.So far, I've used them with battery power only for an outdoor party and the batteries lasted at least the 9 hours the speakers were on at the party. I have yet to test the maximum life I can expect from battery power, but so far I'm quite pleased.As a few other people mentioned, the sound is best when the source is put at 80% of the maximum volume. Beyond that level, the sounds does begin to cut out occasionally. But seriously here, it's a super easy fix - just turn the source sounds down.For what they cost, great speakers for outdoor get-togethers or taking from room to room indoors.

If you were to use them under a cover or indoors strictly as a wireless accy (like in kids room, kitchen,etc,) they would do the job. ut, for my intended use, they didnt work out and I ended buying wired Polk Atrium 45's.

This set of blocks is just as sturdy and well made, but comes in a simple brown box. It's the best deal out there for the number of blocks to expand your Duplo collection. Now she can build a small castle and an airplane without running out of pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO WHEELS IN THIS SET!","review":"One of the pictures on amazon submitted by the same person (I'm only guessing he works at Kaplan) showed the wrong box!

Other sets come with half the amount of legos for the same price, which is okay if you want a specialty set or if you want it to come in a nice reusable box/tub.

The issue with Megabloks is that they are unable to stay together in stacks for children who are strong toddlers. So I would recommend duplos for either strong children, or for kids who are devloping strength too. because it is hard to get the large base blocks separated from some of the smaller duplo blocks, the child may get frustrated with that aspect. but its easy to distract them. kids love these toys.i kept a couple of the duplos for visitors and donated the rest.we like duplos a lot. i also got the car-plane kit which is so cute. it is a lot of fun to add to a tower which also has eyes (from this kit). lots of smaller pieces. lots of options. nice. i think i will get a few other smaller kits tho for variety in my sons duplo play."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"My husband loves the bigger print although it could be a little larger as it says \\"Giant\\".

Lots of great, practical advice in short, readable chapters. It provides dads-to-be with coping strategies for everything from fussy babies to overexcited mothers and mothers-in-law, and encourages them to play an equal role in the process from day one. I found it to be very helpful in getting a glimpse of the father's possible mindset- how he might feel, react, and how to best share the joys of parenting. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for new dads!","review":"I ordered this book for my husband and he has really enjoyed reading it.

Must read!","review":"I bought this for my husband because it was a small, fairly quick reading book with good information. Not that he's a bad reader, or a poor reader.

And I was glad he did :) We also have the one for mothers...another great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you aren't breastfeeding, it probably isn't for you","review":"The book has good advice in many sections, but it pushes breastfeeding so hard that it annoyed me so I stopped reading. There were quite a few areas of the book that were all about scaring a new parent into believing what the authors believe. A shame that it is so heavy-handed in parts, because in other areas it is a nice book.If you (or your partner, rather) plan to breastfeed, then you'll probably like this book. If not, it's probably not the book for you - I felt like it was trying to convince me that any mother who doesn't breastfeed is neglecting their child horribly (which of course isn't true)."},{"rating":"1","title":"25 Things. It's a good thing the Sears brothers have day jobs.","review":"25 Things was a trite little book, composed mostly of filler. I bought a whole book, but all I really nedded was a pamphlet to get this information. It was not funny or entertaining, like the authors claim. A funny baby preperation book is \\"Be Prepared; A Practical Handbook for New Dads.\\" It has all of the same techniques as 25 Things but is less biased and easier to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs both hot and cold","review":"The Syndicate book is rather good, attempting to show that not all Syndies are evil, and giving a fairly decent explanation of the Bottom Line. The history is good. This book seems to say that the Syndies are even less \\"magickal\\" than the rest of the Technocracy. It's not a bad book, but it's not as good as the NWO book.Then there's the book that brings this rating down. This is not the Void Engineer book; it is the Void Engineer Barabbi book. The narrator is a barabbi, and the entire book is tinged with her Nephandic taint. I hardly think that a barabbi is the best narrator for an overview of a Convention, unless one is assuming that over half the Convention is barabbi. (I do not.) I think this is a miserable book, completely lacking in useful information.I do not recommend this book, unless you're like me and want everything WW puts out for the Technocracy.

Helpful for plantar fasciitis!","review":"I bought these about a year ago when I got plantar fasciitis ... a strain of the sheet of muscles and tendons attaching the ball of the foot and the heel. If your heel says \\"YOOOOOW\\" when you get out of bed in the AM, you have it!This is one size fits all... just slips on, and really gives relief and support of the foot, plantar, even when I no longer have Plantar F. If your feet are tired, or in my case flat, you will enjoy the relief this gives too.The other product you should buy for plantar fasciitis is a night splint, which prevents your muscles from tightening and pulling your toes down straight. I tried every other home remedy.. the stretching, the rolling the foot on a can or ball etc. and the night splint started improving my situation the very first night I wore it. I bought the version with the fiberglass on top for the most comfort.. don't see it available now, but all that keep foot from straightening out should work."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"Simple & effective.

She played beautifully. Line should stick with the type of music that made her popular. Her pop orchestra drowns her playing out, and all the other \\"extras\\" in this CD are too distracting. I can hardly hear her piano, which is the reason I buy her CDs. When I heard a portion of Three Dog Night's \\"Joy to the World\\" blended into the holiday version - what does this have to do with the Holiday - it was just too much.Save your money on this CD and spend it wisely on others, such as David Lanz, Jim Brickman, George Winston, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Musak Stinks!","review":"I have some of Lorie's other music and have really enjoyed her lyrical playing and phrasing. However, this CD is tripe! It all sounds canned, the arrangements are shallow, and the other instrumentalists just aren't that good.

The wire leading to the battery pack is only 3-4 inches, so ends up dangling from the vase. The lights are not very bright and aren't noticeable unless the room is dark.

I was disappointed, to say the least.The authors' racist and homophobic attitudes are almost laughable. They can be explained away, I suppose (though not excused), by the times they were living in. After a while, though, there was nothing even to laugh at. It was like being bludgeoned over the head, again and again, with the same prejudices.Even more surprising was the authors' almost virulent hated of Eleanor Roosevelt. They never missed an opportunity to attack her. To hear them talk, you'd think she was personally responsible for almost all of D.C.'s ills.Yes, these guys (Lait and Mortimer) were truly amazing.

The only problems are that the claw makes strange noises when I move the claw left and right, sometimes the sensor doesn't register when I win, it plays loud music all the time, and it uses batteries up quickly.

It still moved side to side and front to back, just the up and down was affected, which it needs to work. It's really not that hard to unscrew the top to get to the crane and then unscrew the top of the crane to fiddle with the chain that makes it go up and down.Overall, I am glad I got it.

It has a good story line, beautiful black and white cinematography, and fine acting. In fact my only objection is that the actors did not have much of a southern accent and looked \\"too pretty\\" at times for their environment.This is a film that cries out for restoration, as has been done with the wonderful Criterion Collection DVD of \\"Grand Illusion\\". As it is, I rated this 4 stars because of the 2 to 3 star poor condition of the print used...black lines, jumping images at times and poor soundtrack. Well, you can't have everything and would still recommend seeing this movie. Together with \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" and \\"Salt of the Earth\\", it draws a powerful portrait of the power of a family and human kindness in a struggle against grinding poverty."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Great movie! Shows what being POOR really is!","review":"Most people in our affluent society today have no real concept of what true poverty is. This movie brings the reality home just as \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" brought home to us what REAL war is like. My family is from eastern Kentucky and we LOVE this movie because we can relate to it. It also shows how people can be so uncaring about their fellow man, even little children. This movie truly is a \\"wake up call\\" to the human psyche. I wish more people would watch it and learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"I saw this movie during a Renoir retrospective at Los Angeles County Museum of Art, recently. I don't love all of Renoir's work, but this is one of his masterpieces. One of my favorite movies is The Grapes of Wrath. The Southerner is Wrath's brother. Two Masterpieces!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The American South As Seen by a French Director","review":"If you loved Grand Illusion and Rules of the Game, this movie is probably not for you. Directing in a language and culture not his own, Jean Renoir drifts toward the corny and stereotypical in this melodrama about a desperate Southern farmer and his beautiful wife. The dialog is especially artificial, spoken by handsome, well-groomed actors out of central casting. If you're interested in the authentic southern or Appalachian poor, see Walker Evans's 1930s photographs. Stick with the Renoir movies shot in France."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pull handle separated from bag in less than 2 months","review":"Purchased this bag in mid-November of 08' for my daughter in 5th grade.

If you or your loved one has Rheumatoid Arthritis, this is the book to get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed with arrangement.","review":"When I purchased this music book, I had high hopes that the arrangement would be the one that Vanessa would use if she was perfoming. Just flipping through the book, you can automatically tell that she had NO involvement at all in arranging these songs. They all suck.I love Vanessa, she's a wonderfull musician with a talent that the rest lack. But this book isn't the best. If you're looking for a good arrangement, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF Book","review":"None of the songs in this book are written in the way that Vanessa plays it on the CD. All of it is just the melody of the song and some chords added to it. Some of the lyrics don't even match up to what she really sings (ex. in \\"Who's to Say,\\" the book said 'who's to say that this is not our love' when on the cd it's 'who's to say this is not enough')I was extremely disappointed, with this book, especially since Vanessa's first book (Be Not Nobody) was true to the CD. I don't know what happend to this one. If you would like to buy the actual version of the songs that Vanessa plays, get it somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I think this book is great! Yes, I know that they are not true to the album, but it isn't to hard to arrange the music yourself to what Vanessa plays. As long as you have the right key signature and chord progressions(which Harmonium has!!!) you can play it by ear. Try improvising, that's what I do and you can come up with great sounding music from this book. Regards to the vocal in the piano part: I personally think that some songs need it!!! Songs like San Francisco and white houses are simply to repetative. it gets easy to get bored.Anyway, this book is awesome with great music. My personal favorites to play are Half a week before the winter(The piano solo bridge is exactely what vanessa plays!!!) and papa. Private radio is catchy and annie is a gem.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, tsk, tsk.....","review":"While I do not own this CD, I have seen what is on it. What the maker of this disk does is go to a DoD website, download (for free) all the publications there, then segregate them according to subject header.If you purchase this, all you will get is Service and Technical Bulletins, with an occasional Technical or Field manual. While they may help you to identify some US ordnance, and might help you to understand the EOD mission, there is nothing on here applicable to EOD Technical Operations. It's mostly Ammunition Servicablilty Procedures and white papers.The actual publications that reference the identification and rendering safe of ordnance, US and foreign, called the 60 series, are Classified Confidential Publications, and (hopefully) will never be for public sale.....PS - It's spelled ORDNANCE, not ordinance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste","review":"As an EOD Technician, I was curious to see what information is available to the general public.

All their records are freshly recreated cover versions and here they tackle (in order) Melvin Smith (a local singer), the Olympics, Gloria Jones, the Kingston Trio, the 5 Royales, Dorothy Love Coates' Ninety-Nine And A Half Won't Do (not the Wilson Pickett song, as so many reviewers seemed to think) and Koko Taylor, all played with passion and verve. To make it harder to fathom their origins, they change or miss-spell some of the song titles or composer credits or omit them completely so some detective work went into finding the above list of names, but this is part of their charm.

It's very \\"touristy,\\" touching on the standard cliches, such as haggis and what folks wear under their kilts. The program sadly offers little depth on Scotland's history. For example, William Wallace is mentioned but depicted only as the Braveheart film character. The accompanying music is by no means rousing; non-descript filler type that doesn't scratch the surface of Scotland's musical depths. As mentioned by others, the female host is annoying, and she even mispronounces some of the Scottish place names.

But, I almost become addicted to this book, reviewing it 10 mins everyday and still learn something new everday.The book starts with a general overlook of the organic chemicals with reference to atomic structure & periodic table. Then, all the monomers, important hydrocarbons are explained in detail along with production methods and application areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant with the Internet","review":"Even at the time, this bibliography was a crude work, a checklist indeed; there are question marks before some of the early works, and there's never a full bibliographic writeup of any book.

I loaned it to a friend and never got it back, so I had to repurchase it... THAT alone should tell you how much I loved it!This group would be considered to be a \\"One Hit Wonder\\" here in the US with their very popular club hit \\"Jellyhead\\". However, I consider some of their other songs on the album to be just as strong, upbeat, and electrifying... Genre would be \\"Dance, Electronica, Euro-Pop!\\" And in the same league with Bananarama, Booty Luv, Gina G., Hoku, and Selena Gomez."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wouldn't Go Here If I Were You","review":"When I got this Cd I Thought this album would have the total club feel. Man, I was wrong. The best song on here is the Motiv8 remix to Jellyhead and basically the rest of the songs are crap. There is no soul, the lyrics make no sense whatsoever, and the music is mediocre at best. The vocalist of the group put no feeling into the music and didn't really add much of anything to the music. They should've auditioned for the spie girls. All in all I wouldn't spend 50 cents on this album let alone anything over $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having to pay for advertising is unacceptable","review":"This book was a total waste of time. Rather than being a comprehensive source for design resources, it is merely a one glorified ad after another for builders and dealers that chose to pay to be included.

The palm is entirely smooth, no stitching. So until they break in a bit, the palms tend to bulge OUT when closing your fist. These run SMALL due to the thick foam/gel/whatever construction. Order a size LARGER that normal! Like another reviewer stated, these are NOT for small hands. The padding is so thick that you would compromise the strength of your grip just overcoming the padding. They are great for LARGE handled tools (jackhammers, hammer drills, etc.), but forget it for anything else. They are just too thick for any kind of tactile feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another French electropop failure - <sigh>","review":"The ONLY reason this disc gets 1 star is for the song \\"The Sound of Violence\\".

If you have to have \\"The Sound of Violence\\", try to find it on a CD single to save yourself a few bucks or buy it used.

Like many others before me, I considered buying this CD after hearing 'The Sound of Violence' but hearing 'Thrilla' and 'I'm a Woman' pushed me to actually dish out the cash. As expected, 'Thrilla' and 'I'm a Woman' didn't disappoint. The album version of 'The Sound of Violence' isn't quite as good as the narcotic thrust remix of the track that I grew used to.Since purchasing this cd, 'Under Influence' and 'Till We Got You and Me' also became favorites of mine. However, to me, the crown jewel of the CD is 'Nothing' which really is nothing like a lot of the songs on the CD. It's very chilling and soothing all at the same time. 'Telephone Love' is VERY hard for me to sit through; it's not good on my ears although I don't doubt that the song may appeal to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassius - Au Rve","review":"The disco aesthetic has always been a part of the French house scene, and it certainly played a part in Cassius' first album, 1999. On their new album, Au Reve, however, disco seems to have taken over entirely -- and not necessarily in a good way. Ghostface Killah from the Wu-Tang Clan puts in an appearance, and while is flow is fine, the final product sounds like a hip-house project from the late 80s, when such a thing was new. Now, however, it just sounds tired. \\"Telephone Love\\" shows a little inventiveness, but not even the might Jocelyn Brown can save \\"I'm A Woman, \\" which becomes generic diva house. \\"20 Years (How Do You See Me Now)\\" isn't completely realized, while \\"Au Reve\\" don't really go anywhere. I was really hoping for more, especially since Cassius is of Motorbass -- now there's something to dream about."},{"rating":"1","title":"1999 way better","review":"I Loved 1999 but this one just sucked.

If you are looking for something that is large enough to go all the way around a queen-sized bed--this is it! It is made of sheer organza and is of good quality. It is also very long. It can be used to make a large private playspace, or as a very nice bed canopy. It is NOT like all the other small, cheap ones, and is very cheap for the kind of canopy that it is. I have seen others of this quality listed for $30 more elsewhere. The colors are pastel pink and purple with a little green. Very subtle coloring, but very girly. The flowers on top are removeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent urban-folk-blue-etc album","review":"Fans of Tom Waits, Howlin' Wolf, and Cohen will want to check this CD out.

I love the way he puts everything into perspective (comparing himself and the love of his kids to the relationship GOD wants to have with us), and lots of other great information that I had not yet found in my new relationship with the LORD.

Snobbery is evident within the narrative - i.e. from the writer not the characters, - ranks below officer are as a seperate species. Some of the images created within the trilogy are worthwhile and memorable. Strange to see the author obviously relishing the deliberately crude language of the extremely graphic sex scenes, and yet shy away from the more extreme graphics of trench-warfare, but perhaps this is intentional; showing we are more disgusted by descriptions of sexual extremities than by the extreme violence of war. Billy Prior suddenly becomes a Poet in his diary. -This fluency does not fit with his earlier appearances. Generally, I thought, a very average book.

Clearly the award was to the trilogy as the book doesn't really stand alone very well.This is the conclusion where the protagonist Billy Prior returns to war. The whole trilogy deals very directly with WWI and why it was such a horrible experience and why it particularly caused breakdowns. The helplessness of trench warfare, the hours of waiting, the gas are all vividly decribed.I highly recommend the trilogy as an unflinching yet philosophical look at the many facets of war particularly WWI.

True, \\"Ragtime\\" has a great plot, but it's the music that makes it outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen-ed to that... RAGTIME!! Please Explain.","review":"last Year at my school we preformed RAGTIME and I played the role of Evylin Nesbit. After the first rehersal i ran out and got this CD and listened to it constantly. I loved it to death. with standout songs likeRagtimeJourney OnCrime of The CenturySuccessHenry FordNothing Like the CityYour Daddy's SonNew MusicThe Night That Goldman Spoke at Union SquareGlidingTill We Reach That DayWhat a GameBuffalo Nickel Photoplay, Inc.Our ChildrenSarah Brown EyesI didn't think Broadway could get any better. Then this year my school comissioned to do The Lion King. And I was BLOWN AWAY!!!! every single song was amazing.So Please explain to me howany one can believe that Ragtime deserved the Tony over The Lion King.While Ragtime is a beautiful sprawling epic on stage and on cd, The Lion King is a Stunning event both visually , emotionally and musically. So instead of telling you to buy one over the other, BUY BOTH, they are both worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Gorgeous!","review":"BY far, this is one of the best musicals out there. I was first introduced to this piece when our local orchestra and play group performed the concert version. I have been a fan ever since.The music presents a wide range of styles, from the fast and furious, to the slow and heartwrenching. THe story is gorgeous and the music fits along perfect.Some of the best songs are \\"Crime of the Century\\", \\"Henry Ford\\", \\"What a Game!\\", \\"Make them hear YOu\\", \\"He Wanted to say\\", and my very favorite, \\"Back to Before\\". Of course there are far too many to name here and in fact, the whole CD is a gem.This musical is very compelling and stirs up your patriotic spirit and thirst for justice. I HIGHLY recommend this to all. There is something for everyone here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and uplifting Cast recording!","review":"If I could I would give this recording a 20! If you would like to hear one of the most beautiful and perfect Broadway cast recordings ever made- I highly recommend Ragtime. It captures almost every wonderful moment of the show on two CDs (the almost $30 price is more than worth it!). \\"New Music\\" is by far my favorite song!! I could go on forever about Ragtime- just buy the CD!! And see the show:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational cast -- sensational score!","review":"This is what musical theatre lovers pray for: a dream cast of top notch musical actors singing the pants off a melodic and literate score. This is one of those increasingly rare Original Broadway Cast albums that sets a performance standard future casts may never be able to match. Yeah, two CD sets are not cheap, but this one is more than worth the price. So why are you sitting there -- get a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL CD/SHOW!","review":"OMG! You would not believe how wonderful the CD is compared to the show itself. The show is full of SO many different emotions. From being excited to being sad, it has it all! I saw the show in Chicago at the wonnderful Chicago theatre. I was So amazed at how WONDERFUL the show was!I couldn't believe it. The show had me in SO much \\"Ah\\" that I couldn't get it outof my head. I HAD to have the CD. Now my official thought was going to be, \\"The CDisn't going to satisfy my needs to recapture the show.\\" Bt it did! Listening to the CD, I could piture the WHOLE show in my head. You don't even have to see the show to get what's going on on the CD! You feel all the emotions that you felt while actually seeing the show! I'm amazed in EVERY way. I recommend this CD to ANY person who loves musicals in ANY WAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a Listen","review":"I have seen the show twice, but I had the good fortune to listen to the CD before seeing the show to familiarize myself with the plot. Unlike some other Broadway shows, the plot can be easily followed by listening to the CD. My favorite songs are \\"Ragtime,\\" \\"Crime of the Century,\\" and \\"What a Game!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Art!","review":"Ragtime the Musical is through and through a piece of artwork. It truely will go down as one ( if not THE) best musical of the twentieth century. The music ranges from upbeat songs ( Ragtime, Crime of the Century, and my favorite Atlantc City, etc.) to more solom, but still fun songs (Journey On, A Shtetl Iz Amereke, and New Music), to songs that start of lively but by the end you've got tiers in your eyes, ie. President/ Till We Reach That Day and Wheels of a dream. All in all, Ragtime is simply great music, that will certainly be enjoyed by millions for many years to come. I most certainly recommend it to anyone who has an intrest in the turn of the century, history, or broadway for that matter. This CD is truely perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA does it again.","review":"A beautifully produced OCR. One minor quibble for this listener -- I would have appreciated a few dialogue cuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful Score...but Aweful Recording","review":"A few songs in this recording were cut as well as several changed lines etc. The other recording which is a double cd is SOOOOO much better! Although the cast alter very little, the performers do so much better on the b-way cast version. Judy Kaye, who isn't featured on the above recording, is featured on the bway cast recording and her wonderful interpretation of Emma Goldman will move anyone who listens! Please get the other version! It is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure to be an American classic!","review":"This musical one might call the American version of Les Miserables. It tells the individual stories of several people, while at the same time giving the listener an overview of what life was like for all people in America at the turn of the century. The music is excellent, the casting even better, and the style is purely hip. This is a must for all musical lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh. Were the Best-Original-Score voters on CRACK in 1998?","review":"I particularly can't see why this show won ANY awards, when the Best Original Score definately deserves in the hands of The Lion King.

Any team which can compose a masterpiece such as RAGTIME deserves to be ranked up there with the greats. (They are the only living composers who remind me of Rodgers & Hammerstein.) This CD is about as perfect as you can find. The voices of the original cast members are incomparable.This score will make you laugh, weep, think, and savor some incredible melodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST MUSICAL EVER!","review":"When I bought the concept CD, Songs from Ragtime, I could never have suspected that it would draw me so close and never let go! I had to see the show, and did! Unfortunately, I just found out that the show is closing in January of 2000. I nearly cried when I heard this, for this is a musical like none other! I thought Les Mis was the best until I heard this. It simply blows Les Mis out of the water! BUT THIS CD! YOU MUST! And buy the concept one too! They both differ from each other. Ragtime is THE musical of the century, and deserved the Tony over Lion King without a doubt! Ragtime is all about heart and passion, love, devotion, and freedom! It does NOT disappoint! It does the opposite! It enthralls and amazes! Add this to your shopping cart--you won't regret it later!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE!! GET THE OTHER VERSION!","review":"The other version of ragtime may be more expensive but you get a Better emma Goldman (JUDY KAYE!) and more dialogue and more songs! It is SOOO much more heartfelt!

It looked to me like this book was oriented to the \\"Ididot's Guide To ... \\" readers who want to be 'Enterprise Developers' in 24 hours. Take for example their explanation of how JSPs are deployed in the Tomcat server:\\"1. Create a new Web application directory in Tomcat's webapps directory; call it basic-jsp.2. Create a subdirectory called WEB-INF in the basic-jsp directory.3. Copy Listing 5.1 into a file called date.jsp ...4. stop and restart Tomcat ...\\"That's it! See, to deploy any JSP in Tomcat you just have to copy Listin5.1 into date.jsp file and put it into the basic-jsp directory!Basically, this book tries to demonstrate how to develop enterprise applications on pretty weak examples, and this does not help you learn how to do these tasks in a generic manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get going quickly","review":"I think this is a very good book.Some who wrote in were expecting A and got B. A lot of books on the computer field are long on theory and short on practice. Tomcat Kick Start is more of the reverse, shorter on theory and longer in practice. This can frustrate someone who is expecting a lot more theory.One of the commenter's says, \\"Basically, this book tries to demonstrate how to develop enterprise applications on pretty weak examples, and this does not help you learn how to do these tasks in a generic manner.\\" I disagree with this comment, many people do learn by example. Lots of people don't like to wait and read and read and read, then try something... I think the Tomcat Kickstart appeals to the impatient. And the simplicity of the examples encourages users to try things. I think this is a great way to get going quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing useful here","review":"This book provides a lot of overly simplistic examples, and does not provide any explanations of how to get anything done. For example: instead of describing in detail what is involved in setting up a server, this book provides instructions without explanations for setting up a specific example - leaving the reader wondering how to adapt these instructions to different situations (beyond your basic 'hello world' example).The book is too high level to be useful for a developer or admin.

I thought they would come back to me when I heard them, but they didn't! The second comment I have is that I was disappointed that Y.M.C.A was not sung by the original singers and neither was Brand New Key. The people who did sing them did not do them well. On a positive note, I enjoyed Disco Duck by Rick Dees and That's the Way I Like it by KC & the Sunshine Band.

We needed a new sim card last year, three times they said they'd sent it and three times it never arrived. Bought a new phone and need a sim card but this time they tell me my cousin's address doesn't exist - funny she's been there a while and we've visited her. (We live in England but spend many weeks in the States each year).

You must have your remote at the ready when watching this. At times there is low sound with near whispers. Next (for effect, I assume) the sound blasts in an attempt to scare.

It's much better than it's made-for-cable pedigree may suggest -- there's even some really good music in the scenes set in the jazz club Caine owns.

This story has a future Disney production written all over it.It is the emotional daydream of every pre-teen girl without a father at home, who imagines that her father could be a wonderful man who left for honorable reasons, wishes that her mom and dad could get together again, and longs for a new best friend. The mother-daughter dialog rings true; Millie, her mother's New Age obsessed friend is delightful; and the fast paced, first person narrative is captivating.

Emily's emotions are highly relatable to this age group. Her issues with self-confidence and difficulties with friendships are something many girls this age range experience. Her adventures are exciting for little girls. My 11 year old dislikes reading, but once she started this book, not only could she not put it down, but she also asked me to buy her the rest of the series, which she read with great enthusiasm.

It totally sounds like they overdubbed his voice in the studio and used background singers to bolster his thin, quavering voice. Most of the backing tracks were also obviously programmed on a cheap synthesizer, Casio mayber? 3-minute ditties that sound like they were designed with the top-40 in mind, banal subject matter, and a real lack of conviction on lovett's part all add up to an album that will be in the cut-out bin within the month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a loyal Lyle fan from many years back I was ecstatic to hear that he had a new album, and when I saw the song list I was even more excited. The excitement ended when I played the CD the first time, and hasn't been rekindled with subsequent replays. For the first time ever I'm hearing Lyle with absolutely no soul - it's like he was walking through the recording sessions, without ever getting really involved with the music. The only track I like is the Toy Story theme with Randy Newman, and that's because Randy comes across so well on it. To me the CD is a huge disappointment - if you find it in a used CD bin at a greatly reduced price, you may want to check it out for yourself. My advice: Save your CD dollars for another time, and maybe even another artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking","review":"I didn't think Lyle Lovett could make a bad album. I have bought all of them as soon as they came out. However this one is a real disappointment. It is not what he does best and he doesn't have the voice to make this stinker work.

Let's hope that this is Lyle's only attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO KIND","review":"The last reviewer was too kind. This CD is awful. In fact it plain [stinks]. On some tracks it is hard to even tell that it is Lyle at all, particularly Blue Skies. I like the song Blue Skies, if Lyle was going for a Chet Baker sound, that may explain why it is so bad. Much as I liked Baker as a trumpet player, I could never stand more than a few seconds of his \\"singing\\".Only the last two tracks come close to his best material, which is to be found on most any of the releases through the \\"Joshua Judges Ruth\\" release. All of those early releases are solid efforts, since then Lyle has been a mixed bag at best. With this the worst effort of the lot, BY FAR. TOO BAD.Don't waste the money on it. Save it and see him in concert should he come to your area. If that is not an option, go for those earlier releases, if you haven't had the pleasure already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"Lyle Lovett has always been one of my favorite \\"singer-songwriters,\\" but I'm starting to wonder whether the label still fits. It's been seven long years since Lyle released an album of original material, and with the exception of 1998's brilliant Step Inside This House, his releases during that time have all been repackaged \\"filler.\\" Lyle's loyal fans deserve better.This album is a collection of songs previously released on movie soundtracks, and while it's nice to have them all together in one place, most of the performances are forgettable. \\"Summer Wind\\" and \\"I'm a Soldier in the Army of the Lord\\" are probably the best of the bunch; the remainder are pleasant but uninspired.

Imagine owning an exotic car and only driving it to the supermarket....great potential, but boring.This movie has more dialogue than \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Although \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has more action than this movie.Great cure for insomnia and will not cause nightmares."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"Wow. This one was about as bad as they get. I found the premise to be somewhat enticing, seeing that werewolf films seem to have died out and it would be nice for something refreshing in the genre...but this movie did absolutly zilch for me.The movie is so contrived and uninspired that it actually falls flat from right out of the gate. This is one of those films you will see on the sci-fi channel that you wind up watching and regretting one Sunday afternoon when you have nothing better to do.The acting is sub-par and I agree that some of the more familiar named stars are wasted in this poor example of a monster movie. The only redeemable aspect of Skinwalkers would be the actual quality and \\"look\\" of the film itself. The movie has a very high quality visual look to it, which helps a lot with actually VIEWING it...but it is still a bomb. seriously, i wouldn't waste my time buying this or even renting it. Wait till it airs on basic cable if you feel the need to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright for what it was worth","review":"Skin Walkers had some good points - namely a few hot actors - but other than that the movie was a bit tired. The story was one of those sort of been there done it before but with this tiny little twist in the plot that hooks you on the back cover. I mean who has seen X \\"evil\\" group riding Harley's and every time a fight scene starts so does the techno. Sorry but this horror fan is wanting a bit more these days. This flick was passable on a slow afternoon when you're home in bed sex (as I was) but other than that...skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good movie","review":"Sorry, I can't really recommend this movie. It was really boring and lame. The acting was 3rd rate and the script writing must have been done on the sly by some writer trying to break into the business while the other writes are on strike. The plot line is really weak and the dialog is cheesey and sophomoric. All in all, a waste of money. I would have rather seen a rerelease of the howling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evening of Rickie's Worst Day","review":"I purchased this CD without hearing it since I am such a big RLJ fan. In my opinion, this CD is a perfect example of why no one wants to pay retail for CD's anymore. If I had only listened to this CD first, I would have spent the money on a sleeve of golf balls instead. If anyone wants to buy this from me at a discount, it's available. Heck, I might even pay you to take it off my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star for pitty","review":"She has lost her grip on what use to make her good, the gritty narrative and street spunk style. Ulgy Man is a shameful attempt to jump on an already gone by bandwagon. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just \\"okay\\"","review":"This CD gives me a strange feeling when I hear it. For a new release it sure feels old. It's almost like everyone who worked on this project (Rickie included) were frozen in 1975 and thawed in 2003 just to make this album (not CD). I was inspired by Rickie's 1997 CD \\"Ghostyhead\\" and disappointed by this well- made but uninspired release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the Year","review":"Rickie Lee Jones is one of the great artists of our time. Up there with Laurie Anderson and Kate Bush for sure. This is simply her best album ever, it even surpasses The Magazine which was my favorite album of hers up until its release. She's never been more melodic, more emotional, and more in tune with the infinite repeatedness, the cycle massiveness. Ugly Man references the president but its message is delivered with a sublimity that transcends the crimes committed. Second Chances chorus advances with the progressions of life which are at their best when they are known. May this album bring you peace, harmony, and understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"keeps getting better","review":"I love this CD more every time I listen to it. This is on par with her best work.

Ms. Siva is very talented. It is terrific to see new talent like this entering the music scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars","review":"Identity is an energetic twist of British soul, R&B and contemporary jazz. This album had me listenning from start to finish. All the songs are melodic and catchy .. yet keep a pulse on jazz. Great musicians, great production. The first song -- I Cant Stop, with David Benoit is infectious and addictive like caffeine in the morning, twisting to the captivating cover of Scarborough Fair and ending with the European influenced piano instrumental Millenium. A must for the contemporary jazz fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNING VOICE","review":"I bought this as a recommendation from Amazon. Stunning voice. Just received CD today and have played 5 times! Wonderful vocal range. Reminds me somewhat of Sade.

I bought the CD based on the reviews on this site. I was really disappointed. Samantha's voice seems a bit weak if you are expecting the fullness and maturity of Sades' voice.

Not everyone purchases these basic colors exclusively."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"As a latecomer to the world of the internet fandom of Clay Aiken, I am enjoying this book immensely. I think Ms. Piper takes the whole fandom in perspective and gives a great overview. Obviously, not everyone is going to relate to every aspect of being a Clay fan. It's impossible to include every story of every fan's experience,it's just not going to happen with such a large group. Clay Aiken is an amazing talent, but there are a lot of people out there with amazing talent that won't get where he is without support of a great fan base. I believe that as talented as Clay is he needs the tremendous support of his Claynation to survive, considering the industry has not recognized him yet as a bonafide star. I agree with what Ms. Piper has written. This book is an enjoyable and interesting read into the world of internet fandom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt for attention","review":"I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my mother, who is a Clay Aiken fan. I asked her how it was after she finished it. I usually am reluctant to hear her \\"Clay praise\\", as we call it. Imagine my surprise when she told me it was terrible.Curious, I read it. Or I should say, I attempted to read it. I couldn't finish it. It's horribly written, self-involved and cheap looking. What an overblown semi-psychotic gesture from a fan who is obviously seeking attention from the very celebrity the book is about. Get a life, Ms. Piper.Clay Aiken is crazy talented. However his fans are just crazy. This book is proof."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wasted opportunity","review":"As one of the 'fans' whose words were included in this 'carefully researched' book without my permission, I ask that anyone who does read it understand that Ms. Piper speaks with many tongues---some not her own, and others that actually are but which she doesn't claim as such. I find that suspect. I also find it disappointing that a fan took a great concept and opportunity---the unique relationship between this remarkably talented and genuine man and his diverse and loyal fanbase---and gave it a less-than-fair or thorough treatment. Just because words are printed and published does not make them worth reading. I suggest you read instead Clay's own words and story---his own discussion of his fans and his relationship with them---by choosing \\"Learning to Sing: Hearing the Music in Your Life\\", written by Clay Aiken with Allison Glock (an established and respected writer). It speaks with only one 'tongue': Clay's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzling","review":"I find this puzzling. The title smacks of inaccuracy. Clay Aiken'stalent and hard work, his charisma, charm, sharp wit and intelligencemade him a star. Not fans. As I tell students, look at the source. Isit a known source? A source of authority? Do you know the publisher?When choosing a book, you need to choose based on more than the pictureon the cover.This one would not be high on my recommendation list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Misleading Book","review":"It concerns me that some may take the author's views as fact. When reading what Ms. Piper credits as the reasons \\"we\\" are such huge fans, my jaw dropped. These may be the reasons she is a fan, but in no way reflect my feelings nor are they representational of Clay fans as a whole. They should have been presented as opinion but were instead presented as fact.In addition, to credit 15,000 (a generous estimate) internet fans with Clay's degree of success when his cd went double platinum the first week and eventually triple platinum is arrogant. Even if each internet Clay fan bought ten cd's, that still leaves 2,850,000 cd's bought by non internet Clay fans. The statement is an insult to Clay's talent and to Clay.If you want to buy the book, so be it, but please do not lose sight of the fact that this is one person's opinion. Question every sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty research, faulty premise","review":"Physically, this book is poor quality. This paperback has out of focus pictures, larger-than-normal print, and seems very flimsy.That's just the outside. On the inside, the book is not only poorly written, it is poorly researched and begins with the faulty premise that Clay Aiken is only a star because his fans made him one. That's just dumb.I say poorly researched because she did not really look into what the fanboard culture is like at all. She left out huge chunks of fan history by only focusing on a few small boards, which aren't indicative of the larger groups. (Small boards may have 100 members or less, while other boards range from 1000 to over 10,000.) If this is supposed to be a sociological study of Clay's internet fanbase... it fails completely on so many levels.Considering everything, I would say this book is a waste of money to purchase. My copy is going out by way of the trash bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting study along with great memories","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book. The author's research raises an interesting point often missed. The internet has caused a number of changes in our everyday lives, and fanbases have not been excluded.Piper chronicles the chain of events that occurred during the course of Aiken's weekly appearances on American Idol and how his popularity rose even beyond that of the actual \\"winner\\" for the 2003 season. Undoubtedly, without the voice, there would be no following, but without the global organization via the internet, the entertainer would not have risen to where he is at this point in his career.Not only an entertaining \\"look back\\", the book is also a study of a new paradigm and could be enjoyed whether a fan or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Analysis by academic or attempt to cash in?","review":"I received the book as a Christmas gift from someone who knows I appreciate the singing talent of Clay Aiken, among others. I'm sorry to find out they spent $18.99 plus shipping for something of this poor quality. I can't determine whether the author is attempting to analyze how the internet now impacts celebrity fandoms or if she's just trying to cash in on Aiken's popularity. If it's an academic analysis it's sloppy and jumbled. If it's an attempt to make money off a celebrity's name value it's more successful. I won't even go into the quality of the photographs. If this were really an academic analysis the photos are not necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true representation","review":"I feel this book does not fully represent the entire Clay Fandom. Clay's fanbase is very diverse and people became fans for many different reasons, not necessarily those mentioned in the book. I do not agree with the way in which this book was written, i.e. the presentation of Ms. Piper's opinions as fact. I further think that insinuating that the fans are who made him a star is an insult to Clay and his talent. Sure, if he didn't have any fans there would be no stardom, but if he wasn't great on his own, there would be nothing to attract people to be his fans.My true rating of this book is ZERO stars, actually. But Amazon forces us to rate it at least one star. Piper should consider herself fortunate to rate the one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than impressed","review":"I think Clay Aiken is a gifted singer and performer and I am proud to be called a fan. This book does the fans an injustice by painting a picture that tells only part of the story. It is like painting a picture of an elephant and only showing a toenail and expecting the public to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"If you have anywhere to go...don't go here! A blatant ripoff of material you can get for free from multiple websites...which is what I assume Mr. or Ms. Piper did in order to make a little money from a pop phenomenon and his fans. Absolute crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why every non Clay fan should read this book.","review":"I've enjoyed reading this book \\"Clay Aiken and the fans that made him a star\\". In fact I'm reading it for the third time. There are a lot of facts the ordinary fans would not know,why his fans are so devoted to him.Aside from his glorious voice, he is an extraordinary man.As you can guess by now I'm a Clay fan, and will always be.Fan and non fans alike should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY????","review":"This book cost more that the new CD!Why do people try to write a book about a celibrity? To make money!! It should be against the law! Shame on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this bottle a well-deserved spin...","review":"Great performances and deliciously catty dialogue make this engaging indie film a winner.It begins as a reunion of five childhood friends, and turns into a deadly-sin indulgence. Sex, lust, anger, and long-awaited revenge mix up a tasty cocktail. Toss in a talented & attractive cast and some witty lines... and I think you'll walk away pleased.The DVD has a decent (and also often witty) director commentary, trailers, cast & crew bios, and the award-winning short film \\"Cowboy Jesus\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"He should have gone back in the end!","review":"Paybacks are hell. I wanted this to end happily ever after but it didn't. Instead it ended in emotional hell for a lot of people. Love was there but it got destroyed by the negative energy of revenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spin the Bottle","review":"Interesting movie....about a group of childhood friends who reunite...after many years. One of the members was made fun of...as a little boy...so this is his chance to get back to the group members. The cast of actors is excellent...the plot will def hold your interest throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimalistic, tasteful, somewhat dark-- very nice","review":"According to the liner notes, Eno recorded some basic tunes and mailed them to Jah Wobble to play with. Jah did his thing, adding light drums, simple guitars, and of course bass. Mailed them back to Eno, who then did the final tweaking. The end result is abstract, pensive keyboard meanderings (Eno), underlain by dark, driving, train-track-like repetitive rhythms, plus assorted disturbing sounds (Wobble). Or is it the meandering keyboards that underly the driving rhythms? These are very subtle tunes, and all in all, a great album from two great musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal Sound for half the CD","review":"I don't know how anybody can give five stars for this album. The sound quality for the first eight songs is really bad. Far worse than usual delmark live records from the 60s and 70s. The second half is about the same sound as comparable CDs by Jimmy Dawkins or Otis Rush, but still a little worse.This makes it impossible to enjoy the first half of the CD, while the second half is allright. If you're a completist, you'll go for this one, otherwise, I think there are better albums to enjoy Magic Sam's wild West Side Blues"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Sam","review":"The sound quality is not the best. If you crave more Magic Sam, then get this music. Whatever it is that some performers can deliver, Magic Sam has it and that comes across even better in a live performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, very stupid album","review":"These guys are just stupid. Too much Satanism, less musicianship. When I heard some of their songs, i was disappointed. It was just a waste of money to produce an album, trying to sound Nordic, but they absolutely can't. These Belgian band needs to practice more. Just cut the hype, you guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Whodunit","review":"This is an excellent movie featuring actors who've become much more well known since they made this one. Liam Neeson's hard-luck private eye is an extremely sympathetic character who really is played for the patsy. He knows he's getting screwed all along, but can't seem to do anything about it. The ending is satisfying and make the movie. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Film That Needs To Be Checked Out","review":"This is one of those decent crime movies that few people have heard about. It is, as the previous reviewer states, a \\"sleeper.\\" It has a lot going for it The story kept my interest all the way both times I saw it (four years apart).The violence and profanity are not overdone, the main characters are very interesting and the story finishes with a unique twist.Actually, that twist is something you have to ponder to determine whether it makes sense. I am not sure it did. You'd have to watch this again soon and check on a few things. It's either very clever or its totally unfair to the viewer.It's nicely photographed and I bet it looks much better on this widescreen DVD than on the tape I viewed it on in the '90s. Liam Neeson and Laura San Giacomo star. Those two are always interesting to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The actors have good (and excellent) acting performances and have won awards for other movies they've made.

It is an easy read, and the two games illustrate solid principles of tactics and strategy. You will want a board next to you to get the most out of the book (like many chess tomes), but the illustrations are good enough that you can go without if necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie... Widescreen?","review":"Be sure to compare this version with the \\"anamorphic\\" version for aspect ratio. Although listed as \\"widescreen\\" in part of the description, the Aspect Ratio given of 1.33:1 is for \\"standard\\", not widescreen televisions!Excellent film about proving your manhood and winning love. Horse lovers typically enjoy the movie for the man-horse bond and general nobility inferred to the animal. The trick horse riding through-out the feature, particularly the dangerous mountain riding, are thrilling to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but needs remastering.","review":"The movie itself is a classic and worthy of anyone's collection, however, the DVD edition badly needs digital remastering. It is slightly better than VHS quality. I'd hoped it would come out on DVD and pounced on it when I saw it, but when I sat down to watch, I was pretty disappointed with it.Still, if you can pick it up for a couple bucks, it's worth the buy until something better comes along. If you haven't seen the movie, it is definitely a must-see...particularily if you want an eyeful of some fantastic horse/rider scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man from Snowy River Review","review":"This is an excellent movie for the whole family, with good action and nothing offensive in it.

I've purchased a number of movies this way and in general I've been very happy with the quality. Note: I haven't purchased any HD versions of the movies I've downloaded. This movie was the exception.

Based on Banjo Paterson's iconic poem of the same name, The Man From Snowy River will always hold a place in my heart. It tells the story of Jim Craig, who lives a tough life in the mountains and has the riding prowess to show for it. The storyline is cleverly adapted to also interest the audience through romance and other action, but it stays true to the poem in the most crucial scenes. This movie always sends shivers up my spine ^_^.

The characters depicted in the movie are very real and believable with strong screen presences such as Kirk Douglas and Tom Burlinson. Tie that all up with the beautiful scenery of the Snowy Mountains and the award winning soundtrack of Bruce Rowland, make this DVD one of my all time favourites.Saying that, don't waste your time or money buying the sequel. It is possibly, one of the worst movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhh.","review":"I watched this movie recently after having a very stressful day of teaching children. THE MAN FROM SNOWY RIVER was quite relaxing and soothing.To be completely honest, this movie is a \\"chick flick\\". The main themes in the movie are the romance and the horses. The action sequences aren't that great and the plot is relatively simple.However, with that said, this is a well done chick flick. The acting is superb and I can just imagine how much fun Kirk Douglas must have had playing the dual roles his plays in the film. The setting is breathtaking spectacular and the score is moving. The directing is well paced and some of the scenes are unforgettable.However, as stated before, the plot is thin and there really aren't any action sequences (even the chase at the end isn't that impressive) and therefore the movie only gets 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't think much of the movie ...","review":"... but the dvd version I have has the text of Banjo Paterson's famous poem, dramatically read by Frankie J Holden. This short film is without peer.\\"Famous\\": the security feature of the Australian ten dollar bill features the text of the poem in microscript. Banjo Paterson graces the obverse of the bill.I was very sorry Australia declined to make the text of another Banjo Paterson poem their national anthem. Quintessential Waltzing Matilda was deemed not serious/dignified enough.

We enjoyed it very much.Jo Willie"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book for the person that must schedule life around visits to the doctor","review":"As we age, consulting health professionals becomes more and more frequent, with more body parts being examined in more and more detail. The extra scrutiny is not flattering; it is more in the line of frustrating, tedious, sometimes frightening and generally boring. Seuss captures all of these aspects of the life of the aging person and interjects a bit of humor into the natural consequences of aging. Few aspects of the inevitable medical consequences of growing old are enjoyable, so any humor or fun that can be poked at the process is of great value.Dr. Seuss is associated with verse and prose for children, that doesn't quite apply here, the target audience is older adults in need of a bit of refreshing. I found this adventure through the medical maze enjoyable and plan on reading it again right before my next visit to learn the results of the latest sequence of medical tests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a funny book for someone in their later years.

May many generations grow up and enjoy him through their years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seuss for Adults","review":"Yes, this really is a book for adults. It has page after page of insights about the clinic \\"Beckoner,\\" and the waiting room fish, and your gratitude that you're, \\" . . . not quite as deaf as a post.\\" For most of us, it has been far too long (since childhood?) since anyone read to us just to read to us, rather than pass along information. So for something very special, if you are over 50 or so, read YOU'RE ONLY OLD ONCE to your Significant Other. You'll probably end up hugging each other while you chuckle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant work from one of the world's best satirists","review":"Call me crazy, but I love the Seuss-meister. Hiswork is so often overlooked in the world of satire, and too often plunked into the children's book catagories.This book was not written for kids! How quaint; how rare! He's written for gram and even gramp-air! \\"Only Old Once\\" addresses adult fears of doctors in the unique Seuss way, without being distinctly childish. He mocks the testing methods and treatments that many of us don't even want to think about.Another Seuss gem in a similar vein, is \\"Daisey-Head Mayzie\\", who also endures the poking and prodding of modern medicine, all because she was different.If you haven't read Seuss since your youngest child entered middle school, shame on you; consider yourself properly rebuked, and go get a few Cat in the Hat logoed volumes.

Then the doctor said,\\"wait just a moment\\". next sombody told him to come here. Finally, he had to fill out a lot of papers and he also had to pay a very big bill.

It turns out this movie has little to to with buds and alot to do with a bud dealer(Luke Wilson) and a girl trying to control his life(Alicia Witt).i see some reviews saying that this was one of the worst stoner movie they have seen, and it would be if that was what the movie was about. Think of this movie as stoner style love story instead of a movie about nothing but smoking natures finest and getting into trouble. I recomend renting it before you buy it.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"smart, funny, irreverent","review":"cool slacker,stoner masterpiece with a few delicious hotties that don't get naked enough. Not as good as the book it's based upon, but hey, I might be a little bit biased. Any movie that begins in Mary's in PDX can only result in cult classic status, because almost everyone has had a long ...night in Portland that either began or ended in that closet of sin.

As stoner films go this one just doesn't have many laughs or story for that matter. If you like stoner films, stick to the early Cheech & Chong films. Andy Dick made me laugh a few times, but that's about it. Black has a small role, but he makes his presence known as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"why was this never in movie theaters?","review":"my friends and i love this movie. it's definitely become a classic for us. best part of the movie: jack black as a pot grower who lives in a hippy commune in the woods in oregon and trips out all the time. we were lucky to stumble upon this great film that really has no plot but is still enjoyable, alien encounters and all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Drink the Bongwater","review":"I don't get all the 4 and 5-star reviews for this movie. I watched it during a free preview weekend, and I suppose I got my money's worth. I like stoner movies as much as the next person, but this one isn't even in the same league as a Cheech and Chong movie or Half-Baked. It was not funny, and didn't really go anywhere - and what the hell was with the ending?Jack Black was somewhat funny in his small role, but I didn't even chuckle until the last 10 minutes. The funniest part was the series of answering machine messages that played during the credits (which I missed part of due to annoying movie channel voiceover ads). Maybe one has to be stoned to find this movie funny. However, a good movie will be funny regardless of the number of tokes taken while watching it (watch The Big Lebowski for a good example).I have to agree with the reviewer who said the movie's title was apt because the bongwater is the unwanted leftover. There are much better pot-themed movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"even the lovely jack black couldn't save this","review":"i did a really stupid thing and actually bought the dvd when i saw it, 'cause cool a classmate recommended it to me and i thought well why not. my boyfriend and i watched it and the only time we laughed at when we saw jack black emerge as a farmer. brittany murphy was not oversexed in the least. she was just annoying like every girl in the movie, along with luke wilson. but at least his brother owen wasn't in this. the whole art concept to it was boring, and it's a shame that this movie used something beautiful like art to attempt to have a plot. maybe you have to have smoken 40 40 ft bongs to enjoy this movie, who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone me now.","review":"This film calls itself \\"epic\\" and \\"outrageous\\". Bad choice of words. I'd go with disappointing and eh. It's not horrible, it just doesn't come close to living up to the cast. Of course I'd guess this movie was made just before this group became who they did.It would be a decent watch if you're a major Luke Wilson fan, or Alicia Witt. Jack Black is only in it for maybe 10-15 minutes. The ending was also anticlimactic despite what it said it would be. Still, a decent way to kill 96 minutes with a buzz on I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A BUMMER, MAN","review":"I had high hopes for this stoner movie, considering thecast, but was sorely let down when subjected to a ratherbanal script and disjointed action.The movie is low in the laugh dept. and would reallycall this more of a drama, as it tackles a corny romance,along with the buzz-kills of a house fire and rape.Would not recommend this movie to friend or foealike, though I would recommend a very funny stonermovie in \\"Smiley Face\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love This Movie, Man !!","review":"I love this film and have been wanting to own it.

It is barely watchable. I was so bored I only kept watching it because I didn't really have anything else to do. Maybe you can only enjoy watching other people who are stoned if you are stoned yourself, I don't know. If you are a fan of Jack Black, this is not worth getting, he is not in it all that much. I didn't care for any of the main characters, maybe that was the point, but they were not enjoyable to watch in the least. The ending is so lame I couldn't believe anyone thought it would be a good idea, but I won't give anything away."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 pair or 10 pair?? buyer beware","review":"I purchased what clearly reads 10/pr side shields for $2.00, plus shipping. when the order arrived I recieved one pair!

I contacted the company, and they sent me the other 9 pair, two days later. As of today, almost 2 weeks later, the error was never corrected on the web site.

If you are a fan of blurry camera work and sped up train trips, this is the movie for you. There are occasional bits of information, such as the information on hurling, and you get glimpses of the different towns but it seems to have a lot of drinking in pubs and very little other than bike riding on back roads in Ireland. The actual scenery of each area is a bit sketchy for me. I would like a bit more content and better filming. I have been to Ireland twice now, and was hoping for ideas of new places to visit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dis appointing","review":"The host is delightful but the content is extremely thin. I have been to Ireland 5 times, for a total of perhaps 60 days, and I wanted a DVD to show my son, with whom I am traveling to Ireland this summer. I couldn't believe how little substance there is in this DVD. It was raining in Kerry, OK, lots of jokes about the weather but what about Kilarney, the Ring of Kerry, Dingle peninsula? It made me wonder if the previous reviews were written by friends of the presenter.This is more like a home movie with a charming but egotistical host. There was more focus on the host than the country, really, what a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"I normally don't like the Globe Trekker series...","review":"but loved this one, mainly because of the host. He is a character and livened things up quite a bit!

Hans Zimmer makes beautiful scores for the first three minutes of each track, then dives into them and makes a tour de force of music magic! Don't get turned off because the CD only has eight tracks. The average time for each track is about eight minutes. If you're a film buff, then you have no business not owning this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Arrow is right on Target!","review":"Hans Zimmer's work on the soundtrack for Broken Arrow is one of the things that movie great. The track I like the most is Broken Arrow alot like Crimson Tide and The Rock. It has wastern sound to it and alot of guitar in Deakins theme and in Hale's theme. A ton of action music and simply Hans Zimmer. And if you are Hans Zimmer fan and you don't have this soundtrack yet, make sure you get this CD the next time you buy a soundtrack. Buy it and you want regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hans Zimmer's greatest","review":"I would give Broken Arrow 4 and 1/2 stars, but it doesn't deserve a 5 star rating. This original score is awsome. It may not be like Crimson Tide, but the power behind each note fits the atmosphere of the movie to make it alive. The excellent moments in the last track creates a powerful theme. The CD is rarely found in retail stores, so the best bet is to purchase over the internet. : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific...","review":"A pulse-pounding soundtrack from beginning to end.

Try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Zimmer's best,but still worth the money...","review":"\\"Broken Arrow\\" is a wonderful score that lacks the power of Zimmer's more famous scores(The Peacemaker,Crimson Tide and The Rock)but there are some nice themes in this one as well.Track one has a nice opening theme,Track 4 and 5 contain some powerful music and Track 8 is the best track in the CD.If you are a fan of Hans Zimmer you won't be dissapointed.This is a great soundtrack,However,If you don't have Hans Zimmer's best scores(Crimson Tide,The Rock and The Peacemaker)buy them first and only then this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Arrow Soundtrack","review":"The second best movie score ever.It is only topped by another Hans Zimmer score for Mission:Impossible 2. Which also has so of the same tune if you pay attention. I bought it because I remembered hearing that tune on this movie and liking it so much. Hans Zimmer is at his best when he does score such as this one. He has stummbled in my mind with not living up to this one with Hannibal and Gladiator, and I can't wait to hear another one like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Though of course I would expect nothing less than awesome from Hans Zimmer, this is still an amazing soundtrack that I find myself listening to over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Soul Is All About","review":"This cd is from Denise's mid to late 70's middle period. A talented songwriter and producer as well as heartfelt vocalist she penned 15 of the 17 tracks here. Most of them tell a story such as 'You oughta thank me' where she is telling another woman how she taught her husband everything 'a man should know'. There's country soul pain in 'Sit down and hurt' and dramatic southern soul in 'Too little in common to be lovers'. The sound is from real musicians so if you're tired of the computerised predictability of what passes for R'n'B today, do yourself a favour and pick this up.Denise is still recording and issued a superb cd 'This Real Woman' last year also available from Amazon. This lady has it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking...honestly!!!!","review":"The size of this air purifier is appealing.

The filter box bends easily and get crushed easily. The filter looks highly unattractive and very cheap. I will not diplay/use this anywhere and this was a total waste of $100 plus shipping.

The effect you \\"feel\\" is pretty subtle, but I think it's at least a little noticeable. But that's hardly the reason to take it. The research on this stuff shows that it is amazing for your health because of its helpful effects for the membranes that surround every cell in your body. Along with your normal supplements of B-complex and Omega-3s, I think it has the potential to really keep you young!Another thing is that I do not think it is hard to swallow at all, as another poster has stated. It's a slick gel-capsule almost the exact same size as a normal fish oil/flax seed oil capsule. If you already take an Omega-3 supplement in the form of fish oil or flax seed oil (cod liver oil tabs tend to be smaller), then you won't have trouble swallowing this pill.

Denise, a lady who's been married for 27 years, has decided that her husband will no longer walk all over her and run everything while she sits back and lets him. This premise was setup very well by page 50. The problem is, the remaining 100+ pages did NOTHING to advance the story. This 152 page book felt like 352 pages because it repeated itself over and over again. Also, why is it that every husband in this story \\"needed to be taught a lesson\\" with the exception of Edward's uncle? Why couldn't there be one husband who didn't feel appreciated by his wife?

For this application these magnets work great. I use to purchase a pack of 50 magnets at a large chain store for six bucks. That chain store is no longer carrying the magnets so I went to Amazon in search of a new supplier. I found these magnets in a pack of 200 for less money than the big chain store. I was hoping for similar holding power but these outperformed the others. For this review I conducted a test. I used 20 weight copy paper for this test. The chain store magnet would hold 4 sheets of this paper to the fridge. At 5 sheets the paper would slide down the fridge. These magnets I purchased from Amazon would hold 7 sheets of paper.

The intro to End of the Line totally blew me away, and I had to download the song. Soon, I found myself buying the actual album. I immediately fell in love with it, and it really is something else. I think the clean guitars are something new for them, but i'm glad they have em because I really like them. I guess touring with Opeth gave them some inspiration. Not only that, but it seems like there is more melody mixed with the brutality... which is my kind of metal. There's not much to say about this one except that it's great, I would definitely recommend it. Thanks for reading my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dez Belongs In Devildriver","review":"Dez Ferinha Was Better In Coal Chamber But Devildriver Is The Way DEZ Was Supposed TO bE In A Thrash Metal Band But I D0 Belive Coal Chamber Is Better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than their debut, but I think Dez was better in Coal Chamber","review":"I was a big fan of Coal Chamber, so I took interest in DD because I like Dez's vocal style. These guys are much, much heavier than CC, but they are talented. I just don't think they can take the next step to gain the popularity that CC had. Hopefully their new one (coming soon) will take them to the next level. 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Heavy Album","review":"DevilDriver really improved with the release of their dynamic sophomore album \\"The Fury of our Maker's Hand\\". This CD is excellent. The guitar riffs are amazing, and Dez Fafara is definitely unique with his vocals. The tracks vary in speed, whether it's the up-tempo of \\"Hold Back The Day\\" or \\"Driving Down the Darkness\\", or the doomy \\"Sin and Sacrifice\\". \\"Grinf**ked\\" is definitely the standout track and a definite anthem. Recommended if you like it heavy.P.S. This isn't \\"brutal death metal\\". Brutal death metal is stuff like Devourment, Saprogenic, Gorgasm, etc. Just so that you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET!!

The translator undertook a major task here, because the subtle meanings of language, the idioms, change with time. As best I can tell, he misses the mark often, and seems to have relied on a dictionary and his own poetic skill. You can actually look up in the Vien Ngon Ngu Hoc dictionary, and see how he pulled translations from the dictionary. People may or may not like the poems but I don't think they reflect the original of the author. It is too bad that the translator didn't consult more with native speakers, which generally would be standard practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing book","review":"As a bilingual native of Vietnam, I was very interested in reading this translation. Unfortunately, it turned out to be quite disappointing. Although the poems are nice, they have little relation to the actual Vietnamese. The translators appear to have simply translated the poems literally word for word, perhaps using a dictionary, without understanding any of the idioms upon which they were based.Nice poems but they are more the poetry of John Balaban than Ho Xuan Huong."},{"rating":"1","title":"I made the mistake of buying this book","review":"I was interested in Asian poetry, and after reading the reviews for this book, decided to buy this one.

But the songs run out of steam after a while.Little Favours is harmony Heaven. But otherwise, not the wisest choice as the initial start out to an album. Not by a long shot. White Bird is pleasant though and would've made for a strong opener. Sure, it's a little too calm for it's own good. But is a great song all the same.Yet another singer-songwriter caught up in the glitz and glamour of this particular lifestyle and destined to get lost in the everlasting sea of stars that shine for a split second and then aren't remembered at all.Buy this if You must but I'm glad I didn't.Download White Bird and Paper Aeroplane legally or illegally I don't care.

Unfortunately, it doesn't. In fact, even on the up beat opening track, there is no instrument break--a typical Tunstall song--unrealized potential. So, we now know that Tunstall can prance around and strum guitar but she can't PLAY guitar. However, all of the songs on the CD are decent if not exciting. It's disappointing that not more was done with them.At 39 minutes of music, this is not a generous offering and shows that Tunstall isn't a prolific songwriter. She has a fantastic voice and should have filled out the CD with cover songs. Also she needs a producer who has great musical ideas and can realize them with supporting musicians, lead guitar riffs and other rock 'n' roll ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling short...","review":"Much like her first album, this one falls short.

The hooks are weak, the production and playing are bone dry and this sounds like a half written batch of rushed songs given a high gloss with hopes of the listener loving the way it SOUNDS as opposed to hearing actual quality and content.

Cool cover though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent listening experience","review":"Her debut effort, Eye to the Telescope, connected with me right away.I'd still give it 6 stars out of 5 (even though that's not possible).At first this one, Drastic Fantastic, was not connecting very well at all.The image on the cover seemed from out of left field and the first cut was getting me irritated in a lasting way. Then I started playing it thru starting with the hot, dynamic \\"I Don't Want You Now\\". FANTASTIC! Next I started with the second song. Good that way too. If you dump that first song with it's too modern, in your face, all up front equally loud mix, this one rates 5/5 for me. But that song is there, so it's a 4/5.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One and Only!","review":"Digital Performer by motu is the best production software in the market today and the 5. 1 version continues the tradition of excellence. Unlike some music production shoftware, which shall remain Pro Tools, no propietary hardware is needed to get sound into and out of the program. MOTU does not, to my knowledge, have a 'entry level' DAW. It comes out of the box ready for music recording, non-linear editing, and for video post production. The manual is thorough and easy to follow and exhaustively indexed. I used it for two weeks without the manual and found myself able to use the program for ADR. I highly recommend buying DP 5.1.

A very good book for male spirituality, and those who take themselves too seriously.sp,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly ironic title for Maushart's book.","review":"Apparently, Susan Maushart views the conception-pregnancy-birth road to motherhood the only path worth giving voice to as she does not acknowledge those who come to motherhood through other avenues such as adoption and step-parenthood. This book, though seemingly well-researched, reads more like a defensive tract of the author's own choices. I do think there is valuable information here but Maushart missed a wonderful opportunity. Isn't Maushart's omission yet another form of the cultural negation of the experience of motherhood? What a shame that such a learned person can be so short-sighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"She manages to write many pages without saying anything","review":"I have purchased Susan Maushart's book recently because it was recommended as \\"debunking the myths of motherhood\\". The book indeed attempts to reveal and dissect the problems with mothers' identity in our society. Unfortunately, Ms Maushart is too enamored with the idea of making all options equal, not offending anyone, and with sounding scientific. She talks and talks, finding many different ways to say the same thing over and over and not telling us anything new. What's worse, she belittles breastfeeding as just one of those dumb old things we were led to believe are better, \\"like cooking things from scratch\\". It's too bad that Ms Maushart, in her attempt to sound well researched and scientific, has forgotten to actually look at scientific research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting.....but not helpful","review":"The book was somewhat interesting, but I came away from it with such a bad feeling. The author just struck me as being so very bitter! I would hate to be her daughter and read this book. She and her partner didn't seem to find any joy in parenting at all(except as a topic to write a book about?) I realize the focus of the book is supposed to be on the negatives, but still! I also wonder if a major part of her problems weren't really about sleep depravation combined with a lack of female support. I think there are better books that tackle the subject. It's worth reading only as one of many resources on the subject of modern motherhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed bag...bold ideas but is she unhappy mother!","review":"Hmm...really displeased with the anti-breastfeeding twist discussed at length. yes, she discusses the brutal and sometimes ugly feelings of mothering, but it is one-sided. Not one mention of a happy mother or women plesaed with their parenting choices. She's almost anti-female in some of the concepts. Just because no one has presented these ideas before doesn't make them real or true for the majority of mothers. Her unique and personal \\"mask\\" of motherhood is atypical and does not represent most modern women today. Not empowering, although cleverly done and presented in an adequate writing style. Would not recommend it or pass it on to other mommy's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly","review":"I began reading the Mask of Motherhood with some trepidation, fearing it was going to be a book-long rant against motherhood, as some of the other reviewers suggest. Instead, I loved it. Motherhood for women of Gen-X and beyond is complex beyond belief. Ms. Maushart reveals the aspects of motherhood that most women will not share - starting with pregnancy and going right through the marriage relationship. She speaks with gripping honesty, backs up her claims with some research and dares women to tell the truth. She is not intent on bemoaning motherhood; rather, she wants the truth about it to be openly & honestly discussed so that women are not blindsided by it (as I was). In the end, this will make us all better mothers and better women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Required reading if you DON'T want to be a mother","review":"I picked this book out hoping for some profound insight into the myths of motherhood and instead I got a hate-filled diatribe that is enough to make anyone wonder why this woman chose to have three children. She manages to be hateful and offensive about anyone who dares to say that their birth experience or breastfeeding experience (or any type of mothering experience, for that matter) was anything other than miserable. If one dares say anything that hints at positive about childbirth or breastfeeding, they must be lying, according to this book. I am so sorry for any children who are parented by someone who feels this way. This book is nothing more than pathetic and I can only feel sympathy for someone who obviously thinks that parenthood is something we are mired down in."},{"rating":"1","title":"relentlessly bleak","review":"Relentlessly bleak, this book makes motherhood sound like an endless nightmare. If you are already a mother, it will reassure you that your trials and tribulations are not unique. If you are not, it will probably scare you off ever becoming one. Over and over again, it describes how motherhood is painful, depressing, thankless, and a major cause of mental illness and poverty. If you managed to reach childbearing age thinking motherhood was pure bliss, this may be a needed reality check. But if you are uncertain about whether motherhood is for you, it will confirm, and magnify, your worst fears."},{"rating":"2","title":"The underpinnings of Perfect Madness","review":"The pressures and anxieties of motherhood are hot topics right now. Part of the difficulty of the whole situation is being able to honestly express one's feelings about motherhood (the good, the bad, and the ugly) without feeling like we are being judged as \\"Bad Mothers\\" for doing so.Maushart's socologial analysis helps explain the origins of the taboos of speaking honestly about motherhood, and in doing so, she may help us all gain the courage to take off our own Masks and allow ourselves to experience and express a full range of honest emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knife","review":"This knife is easily worth $20 or more. and yet it is dirt cheap. and so are the other rubber training knifes from coldsteel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Knife","review":"i use this training knife for airsoft and so far it has worked pretty well. its nice and big and definitely not flimsey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold steel for hard practice","review":"Accurate trainable copy of the Black bear fighting knife.

We were looking for a good knife to practice knife defense in Krav Maga, but on receiving these we were pretty disappointed. The checkering on the grip is nice, but the finger separator would get in the way while doing dis-arms. The knife feels more like a plastic than rubber, and has a rather sharp point for a training knife. It hardly takes any power to cause quite a bit of pain to the recipient, and so the attacker finds himself holding back quite a bit of power and speed.Our instructor uses the Applegate Fairbairn Rubber Training Knives, Black, Pair, and it is REAL rubber, not some weird rubber/plastic.

I don't mind an arrogant hero, seems to run with the genre, but this guy was unrelenting and abusive. The only reason she ends up with him is a) it's a romance novel and b) if running historically true she had no choice. Since Dodd is a mainstream writer it's all the more surprising. It almost reads like a porn novel written by a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"This is the first book I've read by Christina Dodd. Sebastian could have been portrayed much better, I didn't even like him (but I know thats subjective). I wasn't convinced that the pair were in love. The story wasn't ended properly in my eyes because Hadden and Ian's story wasn't reconciled with Sebastian and Guinevere's half (don't want to go into details so as not to spoil anything). Overall, way too many gaps.The odd thing was that I ended up more excited about what was going to happen to Hadden and Ian rather than Sebastian and Guinevere.I'm a little disappointed that my first Dodd book gave me such a negative impression but I'll try to read Ian's story (A well favored gentleman), you never know, it might fare better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Well Pleasured Lady","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot and the character development was weak. You didn't really care what happened to the characters. Sexual tension, though present, was not very tense! Not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last book by Christina Dodd that I will read.","review":"This is the last book by Christina Dodd that I will read unless I hear for a fact that she has improved her craft back to the excellence of intelligent & entertaining romance that I know she is capable of writing. A WELL PLEASURED LADY is a juvenile romance with a silly story, non-existant humor and shallow characterization. It appears that Ms Dodd's intent is to showcase a few titilating sexual scenes which are as empty as the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have enjoyed most of Christina Dodd's books, but this one was an extreme disappointment. The plot was weak, and the characters were confusing. Mary's obsession with the Guinevere/Mary thing is nearly schizophrenic. Also, the \\"love\\" scene (read, \\"rape\\") turned my stomach. Mary pleads with Sebastian to stop throughout almost the entire thing. I almost put the book down for good at that point, but I thought \\"Surely the characters will deal with this\\" and kept reading. But, no...what surely would have been a traumatic experience for Mary is practically ignored throughout the rest of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of hero...","review":"I normally enjoy Dodd's book, but this one I had to stop reading after the heroine was raped (I see it as rape- many people here call it \\"almost rape\\", but I am a firm believer that, even in fiction, no- especially when said that many times- really means no). I eventually went back to it, only to see if Dodd could somehow save the book, but the ending wasn't nearly worth that scene. I completely lost respect for the heroine, Mary, who, as a supposedly strong, sassy, and independant woman, could fall in love with the man who forced himself on her... and there was no way that I was able to view Sebastian as anything but an arrogant, domineering man who raped the woman he supposedly loves- and couldn't even bring himself to say I'm sorry because it was just that good. Not my idea of a hero. I don't need to read romantic fiction to read a rape scene like that, thanks, so I will stick with Dodd's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very HOT!","review":"Some romances are definitely tamer than this one -- for me, it fell more into fantasy romances, like 50 Shades of Grey (which I really enjoyed too). It's not real life! It's fantasy, and I thought it was hot and sexy and really fun. Sometimes, reading something un-PC is just the ticket. I'd kick a hero like Sebastian straight out of my house, but I liked reading about him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read but didn't really like the hero and heroine","review":"The story was well written but I felt that both the heroine and hero weren't as likeable as those in Christina Dodd's other books. First of all, Mary is a housekeeper who shows little to no emotions. Even though we learn early on in the story that she acts this way because she blames her youthful impulsiveness for what happened 10 years earlier, she still comes off as frigid.Sebastian is also not very likeable because he's domineering, selfish and at times downright mean. He doesn't really change until the last few pages of the book.As for the question of whether or not their first time together was rape....it's hard to tell because she does say \\"no\\" but then she actually has an orgasm. All I know is that the scene was very uncomfortable to read and made me really dislike Sebastian."},{"rating":"1","title":"the hero is as much a villain as the villains","review":"It is rare that I put a book down without finishing it. I considered it around 1/3 of the way through this book, as I found the hero self-centered and difficult to like, but I continued. But I quit reading around the 2/3 mark where he raped the heroine in spite of her clear protests. He did it because he was angry with her and believed lies told about her. This is not a man I can respect, nor is Dodd an author I can respect. I have only read a couple of her books; I won't be reading any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it.","review":"Forgettable historical romance without any historical detail OR romance. A highborn young woman hiding from her past and working as a housekeeper agrees to a pretend betrothal (how original!), discovers she's an heiress, and tries to avoid being blackmailed for killing the aristocrat who tried to bugger her young brother years before. Strangely tedious. This author has far better novels in her repertoire.

I found her focus in this book on \\"forcing\\" her heroine to do specific unpalatable things particurlarily hard to take. There seems to be more violence and overtones of rape in the book then I am generally comfortable with. I found myself thinking the heroine needed a lawyer and a restraining order rather than a marriage to the hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Christina Dodd's books, including this one","review":"I decided to read this book, because even though I love my authors, sometimes early works aren't up to their current standards, understandably, but after reading how this book \\"divided\\" her readers, I had to get it if only to see which category I fell into.

This book should come with a trigger warning.FROM THE TEXT:\\"Don't,\\" she cried again. Tears brought a husky edge to her voice and she brushed at her face with her shoulder. She didn't want him to see her crying, but there was no place to run, no place to hide. This act was the most intrusive she'd ever endured in her life.Yeah, that sounds like a loving seduction to me.I don't care how well it all works out in the end or how much they love each other eventually or whatever.

He tells great stories and uses great characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite HD but an excellent series","review":"This is without a doubt a great series. But given it deals with historical color film is it really High Definition and worth having on BluRay?Well, the titles, photographs and the modern day interviews and some scene locations are definitely HD. But, the historical film certainly isn't HD or even SD and unfortunately these soft looking and often amateur clips have not been digitally restored to what they could be. This is somewhat disappointing as most are in their raw 8mm and 16mm state with scratches, dirt, hair, blotches etc etc. There was probably a look-see whether digital restoration was possible by the History Channel but was possibly thought to be too time-consuming and expensive.Nevertheless, the answer is not to show this series on a home theatre HD projection screen but on a much smaller HDTV flat screen. After a while the contents and presentation of this excellent series will make you forget about the quality of the old WWII footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you want to Shake the hand of a Veteran","review":"Absolutely a MUST SEE for any WWII buffs. Virtually 100% real footage from the war that was restored. Truly shows the graphic reality of war and just what those soldiers had to endure to rid the world of evil at the time. Makes me want to shake the hand of every WWII vet that I see. Breathtaking what they had to endure, can't even imagine it personally. Get this now and watch every second of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WW II in HD","review":"The color quality is very good. I really enjoyed the entire set especially the comments and views of the vets that the documentary cover. If you are a WWII buff this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this series","review":"I saw some previews of this series on Youtube and decided to buy it. I'm very glad I did. While perhaps not as comprehensive as I might have liked, it provided a somewhat more intimate overview using the now familiar tactic of following the lives of several participants. Without wanting to spoil anything, I will say you occasionally felt a small sense of shock when a person you were following and getting to know via their letters and diaries suddenly and without warning, died.Having the old veterans talk about their experiences is invaluable too. There was no question that they still felt what occurred 60+ years later. I do wish the images and film clips were a better quality, but after a short time I forgot that this was supposed to be HD, at least HD as I've become accustomed. I enjoyed it and am glad I made the purchase. It arrived in good time and condition too. I will definitely watch this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"henrysmom","review":"My husband loves this DVD. He enjoys war documentaries and places this one near the top of his list."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Hollywood' should be kept away from War documentaries","review":"Very disappointing - typical 'Hollywood' treatment of pushing the \\"human story\\" behind the history rather than just telling the straightforward history of the war and using the color footage to that effect. Most annoying part is the use of 'celebrities' to voice over the actual people who were there. Right at the very beginning you start to hear a Jewish German survivor explain his past and his view of war but then the producers start to dub over him with an annoying actors voice! Why? The guy who actually lived through it was fascinating - do the producers think the celebrities give more credence to the stories or did they just want to mix with LL Cool J? Don't waste your time on this 'documentary' full of padding, over dramatized voice overs and the same clips being repeated. Get the original BBC series World at War instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some great shots but a same old story-telling..","review":"By reading other reviews, my expectations were high, but after watching the images frequently interrupted by a series of lengthy personal story telling, I found myself somewhat disappointed and got tired by the same old Ken Burns-nesque narratives.The original \\"World War II - The Lost Color Archives\\" (circa. 2000), which covered a bigger scope of this tragic war by witnesses chronicles from various walk of life around the globe, not just by the old glorious veterans, gave me a far more lasting impression of the recorded events.I think It's time for A&E; to come up with a new way of programming for such genre, rather than using a recycled, decade old schema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistitled DVD","review":"This is not a series about WW2 - it is misnamed. It is a very interesting account of 7 Americans but does not cover the war in its entirety. There is virtually no coverage of the war before Pearl Harbor and the Eastern Front (the largest war in history) is ignored. Practically no coverage of the air or Atlantic campaigns. If you want to see the whole war you have to go with \\"The World at War.\\" Very disappointing as a history of WW2."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Real Look","review":"Having been obsesed with WWII,maybe because I had Two newspaper delivery routes, I was aware of the battle areas of both theaters.This DVD goes beyond ones imagination of war.I have a collection of documentoriesof WWII, but this will go to the top of the list.I belive it to be the most factual available."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hollywood movie using actual colour footage from WW2.","review":"I dont see how this,,\\"documentary\\"..(if you can really call it such)....has received so many 5 star reviews. I suspect strongly the persons benefitting from the sale of it have written most of the 5 star reviews and rated badly anyone stating anything negative on it...((after all it is the History Channel..so surely has many invested in it..what is to stop them?)It is totally \\"chopping up\\" of real footage from the war and using \\"hollywood movie\\" style music and sound effects in background. Much of the time you will be watching one of 3 or 4 different people sitting in their living room or standing with sunglasses on while \\"remembering\\" their own PERSONAL stories. Most would think they are actually watching a movie on WW2 while watching real colour footage from war and listening to same accounts of A FEW (3?) persons who fought in WW2.NOT A REAL DOCUMENTARY. \\"THE HISTORY CHANNEL MAKES A MOVIE OUT OF WW2\\" would be a more appropriate title really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure to play on Sony BDP- S500 Blu-ray players","review":"I have tried 4 copies of this item on my Sony BDP- S500 Blu-ray players.

So I bought this expecting for once to see clear sharp images of WWII. However, most of the digital transfers in this program were made off of second and third generation footage, so the \\"HD\\" is meaningless hype. Further, absolutely no attempt was made to diminish scratches and dirt on the film. That technology is readily available, and expected from a genuine HD production. Sure, the film is old, but when an HD transfer is made off of the old original film, as was done in their promo, it looks clear and sharp. If you are strictly interested in the historical aspect of WWII this series is okay...no Ken Burns, but okay. But my motivation was to see clear images in real HD, as advertised, and from that point of view this is bait and switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray will not play on the S-300","review":"The first disc on thew Blu-Ray will no play if you have a Sony Blu-Ray player model s-300, it does not matter what firmware you are running.

Be prepared also that this is real war footage in all its gruesomness. This film covers a vast amount of knowledge and is great for every history buff. You will learn and see a lot. They did an amazing job following these marines, soldiers, sailors, and women of WWII. Telling thier stories, and teaching from a first person perspective without censorship.

It takes account of a select few soldiers lives though the war, and also does a great job of explaining events that led to the war as well.

A must have for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best WWII mini-series ever","review":"This came in a very close second in my favorite mini-series ever. Right behind Band of Brothers. Even though this series was different from B.o.B (being that the whole series was actual footage from WWII and not acting), it was still an amazing show to watch. Real footage from the war and interviews from actual soldiers that were in the war was perfect. Some of the video was graphic, but that made it real and worth watching. I rarely get teary eyed, but some of those interviews and some of the concentration camp footage, got to me. After seeing the first part, it makes you want to see more. And the other 9 parts of the series certainly delivered. I would highly recommend this to any World War buffs or to anyone who wants to see how much our veterans went through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth Watching","review":"For anyone interested in history, especially the history of the United States in the 20th Century, this series is well worth watching. The photography is excellent quality and there is plenty of war action to keep even the most adventurous viewer's interest. The best part about this series is that it is real, not fiction, and tells the story of WWII from the point of view of those who actually fought in the war. Some of them came back home and some of them didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This is a Wonderful Documentary and the BLU RAY conversion is a MASTERPIECE ...I can't stop watching it ...But I am also Watching \\"The Pacific\\" on HBO and it is equally impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding series.","review":"I missed this series when it aired on the History channel. I just received this DVD and have been mesmerized by the story, history and quality. Great DVD. Highly Recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest WWII documentary I've seen","review":"The History Channel did a magnificent job in producing this documentary. Finally, a documentary that tells the story of the United States' role and involvement in the war from a \\"warts and all\\" perspective rather than the \\"warts--that's all\\" perspective. This series should be required viewing for any student of American history. Simply excellent.As a word of caution, this series is not for those with weak stomachs. Raw footage is used to illustrate the horrors of war. The series effectively illustrates the notion that while America was completely determined to defeat her enemies, she did not take much pleasure in doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT video series! One of the best about WWII","review":"Excellent video series of WWII. Quite graphic and may not be suitable for youngsters.

Unfortunately, the character point system is confusing, and unimaginative. You may, if you'd like to, buy these character points! The psionicist section is the only part of the book that interests me. It is a vast improvement from the complete psionicist handbook (although you'll have to buy that is you want all of the powers and devotions).

I was very glad I borrowed it from my library rather than buying it. For some good reading on the same subject, check out something by Mary Hunt, or another true expert who will give some real, in-depth advice and actually set your mind to working.Pay It Down is fluff reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too lean to be useful","review":"There's useful stuff here but only ion the most rudimentary way. I might give this book to a newly wed couple if they haven't the faintest idea about how to manage money but anyone else would already be beyond the elementary concepts of the book.I think Chatzky is simplistic in her approach, too. Her idea is to save at least 10.00 daily by reducing discretionary spending - coffee, eating out, etc. - and using that money to reduce debt but I doubt that the average family can scrape up an extra 300.00 per month by washing their own car. There's just not enough here to make the book a worthwhile buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Stuff Most People Know","review":"I read this book thinking it would have the answers for the people I try to help and provide advice to. The jacket and cover reviews would lead one to assume that this book is workable and doable. The author tells you to evaluate what caused your financial problem, as if you had no idea. Then she tells you to set aside $10 each day to pay down debt, as if you don't know that is $300 per month. Then she tells you to refinance your mortgage or get an equity line of credit, call your credit card companies and ask for a lower interest rate, have a garage sale, and so on. All suggestions any person who desires to get out of debt can learn with a basic search of \\"get out of debt\\" on any reasonable internet search engine. Very basic information that most people know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile Debt Advice","review":"This is a terrific little book. Jean Chatzky writes in a clear, sensible style creating an easy-to-digest manual for getting out of debt. The straightforward approach is simple to follow and a must-read for any of us who struggle to manage a budget. Everyone can benefit from this book. It's a simple plan that will have great impact, and it's written in a breezy manner. I expect, over the next year or so, to have only a single debt -- a debt of gratitude to Jean Chatzky. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No new information","review":"I did not find this book particularly helpful or useful. The concept is that you cut back your spending by $10.00 a day, and then take this money and apply it toward your debt. That is basically it. I think that this concept would have been better suited to a financial advice column, not repeated over and over in book form.Purchasing this book is not money well spent.

We feel like the practice we are gaining from Pimsleur's Greek I will really help us have a background for being able to communicate our basic needs & feelings. We both feel very comfortable with the words & phrases we have learned from the CD's, as compared to trying to sound things out on our own from a textbook. The method used on the CD's takes the student past straight memorization and into further comprehension of the language's basic structure. My husband has spent time in Greece over the years, and he is so excited to return and show his Greek relatives his new skills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for people who type alot","review":"I got the skin for my Treo 750. The sleek skin is cute and is put on very easily. the only problem is i type alot on the keyboard and i couldn't type very easily at all. the skin goes around the keyboard making it impossible to hit the space bar and any buttons near the skin (the Q,A, P, backspace, Enter). This is because the skin kinda bulges out above these keys and is raised so high it's very uncomfortable to type. I keep hitting the sleek skin instead of the outer keys on my keyboard. unfortunately it's useless and i took it right off. MAYBE this is due to the fact that i do not have short nails (they're not that long) so if you have nails you won't be able to type on your treo with this thing on.Otherwise it fits well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would love to review","review":"Would love to write a review on this product.

Seems like a very good intro to spy music. I enjoy each work; the last one, Bloody Red Volga, is much different than the others because it is apparently a threnody in the style of Rus. Orthodox church music to the millions murdered in the Stalinist purges. Otherwise, spy music to me sounds like a dark and racy spin of the most sophisticated surf music.

Glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun soundtrack paying hommage to 60s spy music","review":"This is the soundtrack to the three part TV documentary series 'SpyTek' from The Discovery Channel, which premiered February 1998.

They were very highly rated on multiple web sites. He was having difficulty drinking and becoming frustrated. I tried the cup myself and got mostly air and very little liquid. I respositioned the insert multiple times with no improvement. Thinking it was that particular cup we opened the others and tried them. About 1/3 of the time they actually work. The rest of the time you/the baby sucks mostly air. We purchased Gerber brand and a no name brand to see if they were any better. Sadly enough they were. We have used Dr. Brown bottles for the past 14 months. They are great. The training cups are absolutely awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Could Give it a -10, I would!!","review":"This cup was ruined after using it only 2 times!

This thing should be on some kind of recall list!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if your child has any teeth!","review":"This sippy cup, in theory, is good. However, if your child has any teeth - even one - they will quickly pierce the softy part that they suck on, releasing a flow of whatever liquid contents were contained down their shirt. At that point, the cup is garbage bound because there is no possible way to fix it. Dr. Browns does a good job with bottles, but hasn't figured out the next step quite yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truck Trouble no trouble for little ones!","review":"I bought this book on a whim one year ago when my daughter was 3 years old. I wasn't sure if she would like a book about trucks. The first time I read it to her, she fell in love with it. She loves the pictures and story about the truck driver, his life in his truck (complete with bed), and his troubles on the road. I still have to read this book to her, now that she is four years old and into princess fairies. I highly recommend this book for all kids, even if you think they may not be truck lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Odd at All","review":"Very entertaining book about two great actors who may have starred in \\"The Odd Couple\\" but are not odd at all. It's a story of friendship and how important it is to reach out to others and not focus on yourself or your problems. It's easy to read. Jack Klugman was great on that show and as \\"Quincy\\" too. He talks about Tony Randall's life, about his own life and those great years on \\"The Odd Couple\\". I couldn't put it down. I was surprised by the life lessons at the end and I will remember them.

It was the right size, weight, form.My problems were:* Do not like that you cannot shut off all the beeps. If I get a call and do not answer it, it will beep every few minutes to remind me. This is hell in the middle of the night, you either have to put the phone far away, or answer it, or shut it off. What kind of an idiot designs something like this? I want to throw it across the room or stomp it when it does this.* The other problem is that the screen now has decided to go dead. I open the phone to make a call and aftera second of two it turns black. Then it may or may not intermittently light up again, but this is very irritating. I got the phone really cheap, but now if I replace it it will cost me a lot.Stay away from this POS even though it seems nice, and looks nice, it will cost you in irritation and you will have to buy a another one at full price at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"My company issued me this piece of crap. I hope they replace this flashy junk phone with a model that works. Im trying a Sanyo next when it arrives again threw my company. Razor phones suck, and so does motorola, Sanyo I hope is going to be a more reliable phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat phone, typical poor Motorola quality and service","review":"The phone is neat and comes with a lot of great features, but buyer beware-the warranty is basically non-existant. We had a problem with the keyboard and called for warranty service and they said that the warranty is invalid if there is any water damage. We explained that there was no water damage, it just stopped working. They asked us to check a \\"dot\\" sensor on the phone. If the dot is red, the warranty is invalid. We asked how the dot could be red when the phone (2 months old) never got wet, and their rep told us that rain, sweat or being exposed to humidity or condensation! An unscientific survy of razr uses at a soccer game found 4 of 5 with the dot turned red-and hense no warranty.So bottom line is, it is a good phone, as long as you don't sweat or live in a location where it rains or gets humid.There are much more reliable options out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country rock at its best","review":"Rick Robert's more softer tunes mixed with Larry Burnett's often edgier versions make this cd one that never becomes tiring.

I thought by the pictures it was a lunch box, not a replica of a lunch box. This thing is small enough to put A sandwich in and that's it. I mean It was bought as a collectors item and the way it is portrayed it is like the lunch box's we had as kids. But its like 4 inches by 6 not what I expected to be getting.

But if you are like myself and want one the regular size, then don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious Surf","review":"The first tune Nomad gives me chills every time I hear it.

A little bit of Surf, The Ventures and Spaghetti Western combined is the best way I can describe this awesome set of guitar tracks. This is a great CD to pop in when your stuck in the beach house during a rain storm or while you're driving across the desert at dusk. Absolutely stunning set. I am listening to it as I write this, trying to find a negative, but I'm at a loss. The CD runs the gamut from surf rave ups like \\"Holly Tiki\\" and odd time signature pieces like \\"Snorkle Mask Replica, to shimmering guitar pop on \\"Summer at Dreampoint\\" and nods to Ennio Morricone on \\"Return to Paia\\". What a great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Aqua Velvets are at the top of this form....","review":"Surf music has always had two sides: the raw, fuzzy raveups heard in live Dick Dale or in recent bands like the Mermen, & a cooler, cleaner, more \\"classical\\" sound descended from the Ventures. The latter, which includes the Aqua Velvets, has always flirted with lounge moods, but that's OK. It's beautiful music, well-played, often dreamy or mildly latinized. Get out those plastic cocktail glasses shaped like fish, mix yourself Tiki Terror & relax. The Aqua Velvets are at the top of this form.Bob Rixon, WFMU-FM"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Patient Nurse","review":"I love Diana Palmer; however, this was as disappointment. I felt there wasn't an even amount of tension, angst, and reconciliation. There was too much anger/cruelty toward the heroine from the hero/family.

But this video, my friends, is not helpful. I don't know if it's inexperience or bad instruction, but the stilted dialogue between the guide and the people she interacts with is painful to witness. I would have liked to have seen more of the countryside, and less bad French hip-hopping. The guide even makes a glib comment about how arrogant the French are toward you if you don't speak the language. Seemingly, the entire production crew has never traveled there if they allow tripe like that to remain in the film. Though there's nothing on the packaging to indicate it, perhaps this video is targeted at 20-something travelers. But that's no excuse for the high-school production end result. If you want to wallow in this video's awfulness, rent it at the library...but don't pay money for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful in some ways","review":"If you know little about the different millennial positions held by Christians, then this can be a helpful resource in getting a basic understanding of the views as well as the alleged weaknesses in each view as seen by the other perspectives. It was somewhat incomplete in my opinion because I found that it is impossible to have a true position on the millennium without knowing the implications of that on other eschatological elements that this book didn't go into by virtue of its focus. In other words, this is a good starting place in examining eschatological positions, but understand that further reading will be necessary on the topic in order to have a real handle on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big a subject for short arguments....","review":"The authors of this book have limited time to fully make and defend thier argument. As a result, each author assumes you understand the basic premise of each argument and never fully explains the scope of what they are trying to defend. In turn, there are many facets of each view the authors never address. I bought this book due to the fact that I am a long term fan of GE Ladd, however, he also fails to make a strong case. I would recommend as an alternative reading books on each individual subject by each author where they have time to formulate a formidable argument for their case and address the problems with their view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great.","review":"It was a good book that shows the various views well. I like that there are four different people saying what they believe.I didn't give it a five star because the author of the book puts his bias into it, and the book isn't supposed to be about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what I wanted!","review":"I like being able to look at an image on line, place an order for an agreed amount, and then receive exactly what I was hoping to have in my hands.

This book contains only melody lines with no accompaniment, except for chords above the melody lines. And to make matters worse, the music is not on solid colored paper, but on different colored paper with images superimposed on it.I'm surprised at how people liked this book, because unless you play guitar, or just want to plunk out a melody with cheesy block chords, it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And Always look on the Bright Side of life..\\"*Whistle*","review":"Wow.

Camille Dalmais doesn't have a strip-paint-from-sheet-metal kind of voice, but she chooses good material that fits her sound.The lyrics are ironic and sly, and worth repeated listens. The title track, pointing out that man's ultimate question is \\"what's in the girl's purse?\\" is a winner; it has a catchy, pop beat. I also like the wordplay on \\"Les Ex,\\" a song about ex-lovers. Since the lyrics are included in the booklet, it's a good record for French students to sing along with.If you like intelligent lyrics and snappy tunes you will like this record. Think Catatonia in French, not Welsh."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay but not as good as \\"Le Fil\\"","review":"I really like her album \\"Le Fil\\" and this album didn't measure up to my expectations.

It's a shame this song wasn't released in the US. I'd say very few singers(if any) could sing this song like Cyndi did. The vocal gymnastics are incredible.The christmas songs are also great. \\"December Child\\" (Lauper penned) is just plain beautiful. Her performance is incredible.

I was not expecting an examination of the Archetypal female witch through history from a feminist point of view. Despite my wrong expectations, I found this book to be extremely fascinating. The author follows the evolution of society's perception of the witch and how these perceptions helped to shape the roles of women. The material is presented is well written and insightful. The author's conversational style of writing draws the reader in, as she guides us through this sometimes-gruesome sometimes-funny history. While it is too short to a \\"definitive work,\\" it does present all the information someone with a casual interest would want. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this work and recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sound quality!","review":"This cd is like a low quality mp3. I can't stand listening to it.

But this is sadly lacking; an incomplete \\"complete hits\\" collection. I miss \\"Pieces of April\\" \\"My old Kentucky Home\\" and other of the lesser knowns (still hits in my book) from their old albums. Also, not sure if the equipment on which I played it was off, but I didn't like the mix I got--the balance of high-midrange was too heavy and I wanted the crisp kick from a good treble and bass peak. Still its good to have around just for refreshing me on the lyrics during my alone-time sing-alongs at the top of my lungs. Just want better \\"back up.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic music from a fantastic group","review":"It's true that they don't make music like this anymore, and probably won't again. But that doesn't mean we can't still enjoy great music, such as presented in this CD. These talented singers were truly blessed with wonderful voices to harmonize as one.One should listen especially to \\"Till The World Ends\\" to realize the beautiful background chords that accompany the entrancing vocalization of Chuck Negron on this marvelous tune. One of TDN's most beautiful and more deserving of wider recognition.From the shouting, hard-driving choruses of \\"Eli's Coming,\\" \\"Celebrate\\" and \\"One,\\" to the soothing melodies of \\"Out In The Country\\" and \\"Easy To Be Hard\\", this compilation showcases the writing and singing talents of this great 60'sand 70's super group. All unforgettable songs from the past, to be enjoyed in the present."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great group revisited","review":"I got this a week ago and have wandered around this house with it. They are of my college days and early professional days in 60s & 70s. What amazes me now is how they could really sing in tune rather than shout with loud music to cover lack of range, etc. The Beatles & Rolling Stones were also of my era. I enjoy listening to this group and their songs - some mellow and a few show country influence although we would never have admitted it back then (we did admit to the blues). I would have put at least 19 of these on greatest hits like Joy to the World & An Old Fashioned Love Song. Can't go wrong with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music from my memories and for my memories.","review":"My glory days music and such is more than what it seems to me.

In fact, I was pleasantly surprised when reconnected with their many hits -- so many that I'd actually forgotten! From their smooth harmonies in \\"Celebrate\\" and \\"Eli's Coming\\" to their strong solo voices in \\"Try A Little Tenderness\\" and \\"One,\\" no fan of their music will be disappointed in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!!!","review":"It's about time they released a single CD compilation with all 21 top 40 hits AND included the 45 single versions that we all loved listening too on the radio!!! This collection is long overdue and instantly becomes THE DEFINITVE single CD Three Dog Night collection! While Best of was great, this CD has something that it was missing: first, their last top 40 single from 1975, Til The World Ends, and secondly it includes the 45 single mixes of several of their classics (which were previously only available on the 2 CD Celebrate release). Some of Three Dog Night's 45 singles were pumped-up and sounded better than the album versions. The difference is most noticeable on Joy to the World, Liar, and Old Fashion Love Song. If you are only going to buy one Three Dog Night CD, this should be it! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase, for the most part","review":"Usually I purchase music like this to relive memories from when I was a teenager. For the most part this a good purchase but I noticed that several of the tracks have been re-mixed.

It was fascinating to see how Kate Constable created a world where magic was used through song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular entry","review":"Constable has made a fully realized fantasy world. Tremaris spans a globe, and is home to many types of people, all wonderfully diverse and vividly described. She does the same for her settings: lush descriptions and clever figurative language spare no color on this world. It's a beautiful place.Calwyn is a wonderful heroine: idealistic, strong-willed, yet she knows of her own weaknesses at times. I had a brilliant time imagining her voice as she sang (Personally, I am a Japanese-pop music fan, and the opening theme of Record of Lodoss War became a sort of anthem in my head for Calwyn's voice). I really do recommend busting out your foreign language tracks (OH what a candidate for a book with a soundtrack!)The supporting cast is well fleshed out with physically and emotionally differing characters, as well. From Darrow to Mica, everyone is their own.Anyone who is a fan of fantasy should read this book. It will leave you impatient for the next in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book definitely worth reading!","review":"Singer of All Songs is a short, captivating novel. This book took me from this world to a world full of magic and other wonders that you can only get through reading. Calwyn and her friends go on an epic adventure to stop the evil and ambitious, Samis, from trying to conquer all of Tremaris by becoming the 'singer of all songs'- possessing the ability to sing all the chantments.Kate Constable created a world that is unlike any other. How amazing it would be to be able to create ice, wind, fire, etc... with song, or as in Halasaa's case, through dance and body movements.This novel is definitely worth reading, as well as the other two books in the trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son is in this movie","review":"Back in '94-95 my oldest two kids Trevor and Joshua were with a talent agency in San Francisco (John Robert Powers) and we received a call to go to a movie shoot as extra's. Josh was the cute red head in the basket ball scene with Brendan Ryan Barrett and he had a close up in the fight scene. Josh and Brendan hung out between shoots playing Nintendo and playing 'Bloody Knuckles'. Josh had lines in both his scenes and never got paid a cent. I called SAG and AFTRA multiple times to complain about this but we were ignored because I had no proof?! 10 years later this movie comes out on HBO and my red head is in High school and his friends are all \\"Were you in a movie when you were younger?\\"Anyway I think the actors unions are crooks, arrogant and mentally deranged idiots.. but that's just me.Oh the movie Lloyd? It was actually a really cute and fun movie to watch and I recommend it highly.

Lloyd IS what every kid feels like; goofy, un-cool, and heartbreakingly in love. And Tom Arnold... Wow. I fell in love with the man because of his performance in this movie. Wish he would have been in it more. If you let your kids watch the Disney Channel, you should have absolutely no problem letting them watch Lloyd. It's entertaining, funny, and if you say you can't relate to it...you're LYING!! :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for adults; teenage/preteen humor","review":"My kids (19 & 16)loved this dvd.

It seems that the woman who reviewed this film for Amazon hasn't been on a playground for a very long time. LLOYD depicts reality or at least a child's perspective of reality in sixth grade. Bullies exist. Kids call each other names. It happens everyday. It even happened to me when I was growing up. I think it's utterly ridiculous for the reviewer to bring up the recent school shootings in her review. I know that parents and their kids will relate to the story and also enjoy it's message."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best \\"kid\\" movie about life ever!","review":"I thought this was a great movie. Most of the other movies about kids and school are all really boring. Lloyd is not your average person as he has no friends, is made fun of by his little brother, and is an ugly kid. Yet he manages to find confidence in himself to invite a kid over (Troy played by Brendon Ryan Barrett)and become his friend as well as going after a girl he likes. I thought it was very different than your average 6th grade flick. I love the part when Lloyd starts screaming in the playground after seeing the girl he likes go with someone else. I also think that Brendon Ryan Barrett is the best actor in the movie as he was 14 when he shot this movie and looks really young."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Feel-Bad Christmas Movie","review":"The first time I saw \\"The Miracle of the Bells\\" was a New Year's Eve party in 1980, and man, it was a bring down. Here is a somewhat nasty Fred MacMurray mourning the loss of Valli (from \\"The Third Man\\"), who had only just completed filming her Joan of Arc movie, the movie that would have catapulted this obscure nobody into a major star, it seems, but fate would have it otherwise, since she up and died. Frank Sinatra plays against type big time as a gentle young priest. I really disliked this movie, and I bet you would too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Miracle of the Bells","review":"I've looked for this movie for a long time and found out that I had the wrong title.

The first time I heard this song on the dance floors of Chicago, the people knew it would be a dance classic. And after almost a year of playing on Friday and Saturday nights, it still attracts legions of dance fanatics. The 12\\" Definitive Mix is very acoustic, hip and catchy.

The book gives us more about the \\"Lady Vader,\\" and the mystery of the Dark Force fleet.

Well the last four of them are from Heir to the Empire and if you hasn't read it yet (what are you doing here? - get Heir to the Empire first), do that now. I also agree with someone who said that there should be a movie. I hope that will happen someday, because I'd really like to see Mara and all new characters live, in movies. I've been wondering for a time now, why I always give 5 stars to all books I review.

First the mystery of the Dark Force! And the surprise ending. The last few chapters really made this book exciting.

For one things, in this book Thrawn is not once incorrect in one of his more important hunches. It is just a bunch of repetition of the good guy gets captured and then escapes, then Thrawn finds and captures another good guy until he escapes to. Grand Admiral or not Thrawn is not a know-it-all, and for once i would like to see him misjudge an attack, or have a hunch that Leia is not on a ship that she is on.

Such a bore! Zahn is a pathetic star wars author!","review":"How this book gets positive reviews mystifies me. Zahn has failed in all counts as a Star Wars author. His writing style is trash. In the Heir to the Empire series, he repeats the phrase \\"Han-Wedge-Mara Jade twisted his/her lip\\" at least a hundred times. He has very little action in any of the three novels. I hardly completed Dark Force Rising, and I did so after a 3 month break of reading it, because it is so poorly written. I could not finsih The Last Command! It was sooo bad! The whole trilogy tries to be a sci-fi action/political thriller. Zahn fails miserably adding political overtones to the novels, which ultimately causes the tedious expanse of bland characters babbling on about the New Republic politics... bottom line THE BOOK IS TERRIBLE - D"},{"rating":"2","title":"And Star Wars goes on....","review":"In this second novel of the Heir to the Empire trilogy Timothy Zahn splendidly continues the plots he began in the first book. Everything fits and is so exciuting that you can't put down the book. When Leia goes on a mission to the Noghri, the aliens that under the command of the empire tried to kill her, she finds herselfs in a snakes pit. Luke Skywalker is going on a search for the Jedi Master C'baoth and Han Solo tries to find a fleet of great battleships that vanished years before. To oppose the heroes Zahn once more lets Grand Admiral Thrawn give a great taste of his vicious genius. And between the fronts, Mara Jade and Talon Karrde have their own troubles.

The two opposing sides race for a lost fleet of about 200 ships. The winner will have the upper hand in the continuing battle. Meanwhile the newly surfaced Jedi master plots to capture Leia, her twins and Luke.The Good: The whole book (along with the other 2 were all very good).

Other reviewers on Amazon and elsewhere can better address the plot. All I'll append about this specific Kindle edition is that there are some oddball errors in the digitization: within the first ~30 [hardcopy] pages \\"kind\\" becomes \\"lamb,\\" \\"civilian's\\" loses its apostrophe.

The selection of guest vocalists and musicians, although there are many of them, fit perfectly into each song. Everyone that's saying Max sold out or whatever and should go back to Sepultura, it's not going to happen, so get over it. This is better than the latest Sepultura album and better than the many of the future most likely. Max is a genious and if you were a true fan, you could see that, and that Soulfly's a great project and medium for him to express himself. The best songs on this album are Jumpdafu_kup (with Corey from Slipknot), Pain (with Chino from deftones and Grady from Will Haven), Son Song (with Sean Lennon), and Bring It. This is an amazing album, Max deserves credit for creating one of the greatest pieces of music of all time. Buy this album, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Max, Please go back to Sepultura!","review":"Max Cavalera leaving Sepultura to form this band has added two lackluster metal groups to the fold.

If you are/were a fan of Sepultura and are unhappy with the way they sound now, do not seek refuge in Soulfly! I cannot think of one good thing to say about this record.

Max completely went nu-metal on us all. And not the good kind. Read the lyrics to \\"Back To The Primitive.\\" Then listen to the actual 'song.' WHY, MAX, WHY? There's even a rap song on here, as well as a duet with Tom Araya that promotes TERRORISM?! MAAAAAAXX! In fact, the only worthwhile song is \\"Jumpda****up\\" with Corey Taylor's vocal talents saving the song marginally. It's still filled with Max showing off his 'fat street-wyze rhym bustin'. What a shame. Just listen to Sepultura for this tribal-metal shtick done right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go listen to Sepultura","review":"If you want a great album with Max on it, then get Arise or Schitzophrenia.This album is terrible. The lyrics are basically swearing every other word, the sound is Max's most commercial yet, the tribal themes are overused and were done better on Roots, and quite frankly this lacks the heavy powerful punch of pre-Chaos AD Sepultura. Add to that the inclusion of RAP, this makes for a CD that makes me wanna puke. So unless you're into nu-metal and you want something that has the same old sound with a few tribal elements that have been done before (but better), stay away from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"I hate seeing Max trying to be trendy with nu rap metal .... I'm a Sepultura fan from the Beneath the Remains days. I wasn't a big fan of the first soulfly album,either. It seems he has been ripping himself off since the Brilliant Sepultura album Roots, but he dosen't have the talent of his old band to pull it off. He needs to get his thumb out of his a** and get back with Sepultura. The best track on this album is the one with Tom from Slayer. Forget Soulfly and pick up Shadows Fall or the new Nothingface album if you want something GOOD and heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brazilian Energy!","review":"The new Soulfly album, primitive is alot better than the self titled debut!

You can defend Lucille Ball all you want, but that fact still remains that she has not only a horrible singing voice, but her talking voice wasn't even right for the part. Call me a freak, but I like when singers have \\"pretty\\" voices. What's with the scratchy, squeeky crap they had goin' on throughout the whole miserable movie!

If you're looking for some fantastic flicks some shows to definately watch would be Kismet, Sound of Music, Anchors Aweigh, or Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."},{"rating":"1","title":"unforgettable, and not in a good way","review":"I saw this movie musical version of Mame twice, once around 1977 or 1978, and again in 1980. And although I'm sure I have forgotten some of it's virtues, I haven't forgotten Lucy's singing, and how inadequate it was for this role. I never could figure out why they didn't put Angela Lansbury in the film version.

Mame is a delightful character who always lands on her feet and never loses her class or elegance. Robert Preston is perfect and gorgeous as Beauregard, and the photography is lush and breathtaking. Heck, Vera Wang's costumes alone are worth a look! The high-energy, wonderfully choreographed dance numbers, the touching score, and the humor of the play, which remains intact, make this a very enjoyable treat. Weak links are the older Patrick, and Gooch, who could have been better cast...but that's splitting hairs. Try it - you might really be pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoulda been Angela Lansbury","review":"MAME is one of my two favorite Broadway musicals. Saw it three time, none with Angela however. When the musical was made, Angela Lansbury should have been allowed to recreate her character for the screen, but instead the role was given to Lucy as a \\"last hurrah.\\" I understand that, but Lucy (and I do love Lucy) was too far past her prime to do justice to the role for the movie. The production was super lavish, and everything was wonderful (including Bea Arthur) except for the leading lady. But because I love the show so, I had to have the DVD of MAME anyway. I can only imagine how much better it could have been with Angela in the role she was meant to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best","review":"Well, I've seen a couple versions of Mame, but the one with Lucille Ball was definatley the worst!

She is a great actor but has no talent for singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Lucy Ever","review":"Every one star review here is SO, SO right. I don't want to repeat all the excellent critique of this disaster of a film because it's been done.

What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Lucy's other movies, but not all that bad.","review":"This movie is not the best one Lucille Ball has ever done, but it is not as terrible as people seem to think.

Other than that, it was a little flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Lucy & this is one of the worst movies ever","review":"Lucille Ball was one of the greatest comedians of all time and I have every I Love Lucy possible on VHS or DVD. But she was in over her head on this one.It seemed like an act of arrogance for her to take on a singing role when she couldn't sing, she was supposed to be in her twenties but was 62 and she gives a leaden, unfunny performance. Even her physical comedy falls flat in this BOMB! It's not even \\"funny bad\\", it should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Cinematic Transfers of a Broadway Musical","review":"I'm sorry this is coming out on DVD. It is a terrible celluloid version of a wonderful Broadway musical. I saw the original with Angela Lansbury and it was marvelous. I couldn't wait to see the movie thinking that this would be Lucille Ball's crowning achievement. Alas, the only good thing about the show was Robert Preston and his new song entitled \\"Loving You.\\" The film \\"Mame\\" was touted as a must-see with Madeline Kahn portraying Gouch and the inimitable Bea Arthur as Vera, but alas Kahn and Lucy came to blows precipitating the former's walking off the set and Arthur looked like a very bad drag queen.I really am sorry this musical film has been transferred to DVD, while the lovely \\"Goodbye Mr. Chips,\\" with endearing performances by Peter O'Toole, Petula Clark and Sian Phillips, lies wasting somewhere in videoville.Life ain't fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"If not for The Song Of Norway, this could well be the worst musical movie ever made.The acting (apart from Bea Arthur) is dreadful, the production numbers are cloying, and the pacing is slow, slow, and painfully slow.Auntie Mame with Roz Russell is one of the great movies of all time. This one is on the other end of the spectrum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the original!","review":"There are a lot of remakes out there. Some fall into the category of great, some good and some terrible. \\"Mame\\" deserves it's very own category, horrendous.The classic \\"Auntie Mame\\" shouldn't be used in the same sentence as \\"Mame\\".

AND MORE VASELINE THAN USED IN A HOSPITAL BURN WARD IS GOBBED ON THE CAMERA LENS FOR HER CLOSE-UPS.

So open a new window, crack open the bubbly and have a great time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAME - Lucy tried, but it just didn't work","review":"MAME, starring Lucille Ball, I am sorry to say was a disappointment. It was not Lucy that ruined the film, but the film itself. It can not be compared to the earlier and I think better \\"Auntie Mame\\" with Rosalind Russel. MAME just didn't make it as a musical and the only memorable song in it was the main song, \\"Mame.\\" Although it had it's moments, and I adore Lucille Ball, I have to say it was not at all as good as the original \\"Auntie Mame.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch.. what were they thinking?","review":"A textbook example of how Hollywood can screw up a good musical. Poor Lucy. What was she thinking. Her singing is a croak, a growl, and a bark. She can barely walk, much less sing. And poor Robert Preston and Bea Arthur too be stuck in this mess. They deserved better. This movie is sad to watch when you realize that Angela Lansbury was available and would have been wonderful. But Lucy had the power and ego to match, and poor Angela was a \\"stage\\" star. If you love Mame, get \\"Auntie Mame\\" instead. Roz Russell is warm, funny, sincerely and loving. Lucy is none of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rosalind Russell version is better.","review":"I am a big fan of the non-musical, Rosalind Russell version, \\"Auntie Mame\\" (1948), so I view this movie with a slight bias. This version seems a little meaner than the earlier one -- perhaps an attempt to \\"modernize\\" it. But somehow, Lucy's portrayal fails capture the heart of what makes Mame Dennis so appealing... her whacky joie de vive and her absolute love (absolutely reciprocated) for her nephew Patrick. The best thing about this movie is Agnes Gooch's song, which comes almost towards the end. I was also surprised to find that the song \\"We Need a Little Christmas\\" is from this play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucy gets in the show","review":"Yea, yea, yea, Lucy's singing is not the greatest. As Lucy once said:\\"A Barbra Streisand I'm not\\". But isn't that part of what endeared her to us as Lucy Ricardo? Didn't we always route for her to get in the show, despite mean old Ricky? Well, he she is folks..she finally got in the show! So, don't knock her. The movie is darn funny, the songs are great, the cast is excellant, especially the chemistry between Lucy and Bea Arthur.Watch it, and remember Lucy Ricardo fondly. be happy our Lucy is in the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of the material","review":"This is one of the most ill conceived musical projects ever made. Lucille Ball was not appropriate for the role. It is a mystery to me why Hollywood didn't bring Angela Lansbury into this project. Every scene with Ms. Ball in it looks as if it was shot through milk. The costumes are garish and uninspired. Some of the decor was downright cheesy looking. If you are a fan of \\"Auntie Mame\\" with Rosiland Russell or \\"Mame\\" with Angela Lansbury then you will want to avoid this offering altogether. On the other hand if you are a diehard Lucille Ball fan, what I say will matter not. For classic wonderful Lucille Ball I would recommend \\"The Fuller Brush Lady\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE Lucy...as Mame!","review":"Lucille Ball was the amazing, gifted, hands down Queen of comedy during the golden age of television, but she was NO AUNTIE MAME! While the supporting actors are great in their performances, Ball hopelessly cackles out her lyrics with all the grace and talent of a bull frog with a severe case of laryngitis. It was truly one of the greatest crimes in modern cinema to have cast Lucille Ball over Angela Lansbury, and watching this movie only confirms the fact that the world was absolutely robbed by the film makers shameful decision to cast Ball in this cringe inducing performance. Do not waste your money on this version of Mame, stick with the original Rosalind Russell version instead. \\"Auntie Mame\\" is still the one and only best film based on the Patrick Dennis story to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TREASURE!","review":"i know alot of people don't care for lucy as mame, but this has so much charm, and the casting is so excellent, that you overlook the fact that lucy can't sing. that's the only thing that i have against this movie. i have watched it countless times, and we now make a point of watching it during the christmas holiday season. it has become a family tradition. i love the song \\"we need a little christmas\\", and it always makes us smile to watch this movie! bea arthur is fantastic, miss gooch, beau, his mother, sally kato, the upsons, etc, etc.everyone they picked to play the parts is just perfect! watch this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lucille ball","review":"love lucille ball enjoyed the movie glad i ordered it , love old movies a real enjoyable movie for the whole family. mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of Ball's musicals","review":"Lucille Ball started her movie career in musicals and more or less ended her career with arguably her best ever musical: Mame.

Mame is a movie that can be enjoyed by the entire family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucy Barks!","review":"Too terrible to be boring, you can fixated watching this wondering exactly what Lucille Ball thought she was doing. When that sound comes out-it's something between a bark and a quaver-does she really think she's singing? When she throws up her arms in their giant red bat sleeves and yells \\"Listen, everybody\\"! does she really think she's a fun person? Lucille Ball was a genius in her television series but she was too old, too basso in the voice & stringy in the legs to pull off Mame. Lucy at this point in her career had'nt the gregarious personality (a'la Lanbury or Russell) that is neccesary in the playing of this character; her performance seems tired, flat, self-conscious and insincere. Desi among others begged Lucy not to play this role, but she would'nt listen (just as she skied and broke her leg at 62) I love Lucy, too, but this has got to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I REALLY LOVE LUCY...","review":"...but, she's not good in this part.

Mame is, like the Rosalind Russell version of Gypsy, bad casting that can't be masked by glossy production values. The inability of either of these lead actresses to truly be able to sing, as brilliant as they were in virtually everything else that they did before the camera, carries no weight here and this inability sinks both films from the get go."},{"rating":"1","title":"not your typical Lucille Ball movie","review":"hi! ok so i'm a big Lucille Ball fan. but this is one of the worst! in this movie she goes from a brunett to a redhead in like everyother scene. my oppinion is this is a very confusing movie. i wached it and it took me about 3 days when Lucy movies usually take me about the amount its supposed 2 take.

Esp. of this awful sort?? Roz Russell reigns over all remakers and their casts. Her film is IT, and Herman and Lucy should have known better.I saw Lucy in Wildcat years ago..very funny, very unconventional,but limiting. Her kind of comedy is in the Marx Bros. tradition; and this is her genuius, not this stuff. Even Angela L. had trouble with Mamme's terrible lyrics and serious moments.Poor Lucy..she needed a better attraction than this, and the director, notoriously bad.Forget this and go to Roz Russell and Lucy's TV show from the 50's, not the later shows from the 60's, which have Mameish qualities that are best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"the original is still the best","review":"First of all the original version with Russel is much better.

The entire 1958 version is hilarious, and with the exception of the hydraulic furniture scene, stays true to the book.However, this Lucille version is a bomb if I've ever seen one. Since when is Agnes Gooch Patrick's nanny? She was Mame's first secretary until her pregnancy. Pegeen was changed completely. Lucille Ball was far past her prime to star in this part. To top it off, the cheesiness of turning a story like this into a musical was beyond description!I don't recommend spending your hard-earned money on this one.

I've listened to \\"Days of of my mind\\" alone for over and hour.Buy this CD, you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"this carboy cap does not really fit on my carboy nor does it have the correct size holes to fit what seems to me to be the fairly standard tubing and airlock. I would not recommend this to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Progressive dead?","review":"If it is, this may be the CD that drives the final nail into the coffin. Long, dull and uninspiring, Global provides little energy other than the usual long proggy build-ups that leave you wishing for something a little harder and faster. PVD needs to look to his fellow artists and see that they are moving along. I understand the need to please his fans, but for those who have followed him this is not a growth spurt, but rather a statement that the status quo is acceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Van Dyks Greatest Hits CD","review":"This is PVDs greatest hits in one CD. The best songs on this CD are: We are alive(the great female vocal with catchy chorus), Seven ways, Tell me why( featuring st. etienne) which is a great club track, and together we will conquer(great female vocal). PVD has made some great music in the past and these are just a sample of some of his great songs. Hope to see a new album in the future from PVD. Any fan of PVDs or of trance music will not be disappointed with this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"PVDs Greatest Hits?","review":"What? PVD just had 11 great hits? I know he had more hits than that. Basically, \\"Global\\" is only good for newbies. Why get \\"Global\\" if you have all first three of PVDs albums. One way to get people to buy \\"Global\\" is the dvd. Who wants to be in front of the screen all day watching videos? Nothing really new here except for two tracks \\"Animacion\\" and \\"My World\\". I actually liked them and wished he had put them on a separate new album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing... for hardcore PVD fans like me","review":"Of course this CD is awesome, it's PVD. But for those girls that have listened to ALL his albums, and have ALL his live sets, \\"Global\\" can be somewhat disappointing. Nothing emergency-pull-out-your-credit-card new, really. I would have instead purchased the single for the new songs, Animación and My World, if there had been one. *The DVD consists of shots of raves where PVD has spun, in sort of like a trip around the world. And there are moments when an asian raver or two scream out WOOoOOoooo!! Paul Van Dyk is the best! WhoOoooo!!! to bring you crashing down out of the trance trip. For one of the songs, I think it is \\"Tell Me Why\\", the DVD scene is the actual music video PVD made. But you already have that video in \\"Out there and Back\\"... so... GLOBAL is a nice mix, but I would have preferred just new material. Maybe this is the way PVD will get the money to produce a new album. I hope one comes out soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul Van Dyke.. Amazing I say!","review":"This cd is really good if you like trance. I think Paul Van Dyke has a natural born talent for mixing just this type of music. I've heard other things he has done that don't really fall into the category of trance and they weren't that good but this is just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Crazy Germans","review":"Paul Van Dyk is one of the worlds top DJ's today including the best trance DJ of 1999. The East Germany native has just released Global. It features 11 of is best songs including \\"For An Angel, Words, Forbidden Fruit, Another Way, We're Alive, Tell Me Why and more\\". There are also two never before released tracks (\\"Animacion \\" and \\"My World\\"). This is all in a continuous mix plus it comes with a DVD that goes great with the CD. I like it because of the songs \\"For An Angel, We're Alive and Another Way\\". However, \\"A Magical Moment\\" may be a turn on & it doesn't feature another Paul Van Dyk song that I like (Columbia). Overall not a bad album. I bought it the day before he came to Boston just to have it autographed (Cool, huh?). Paul Van Dyk deserves a well respected 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Millencolin Cd","review":"I love Millencolin and but this cd doesnt sound like them at all it has way too much Ska on it the only songs that are moderately acceptable are Da Strike and Mr. Clean both of which are more funny than anything else, if you wanna buy a millencolin cd buy For Monkeys it Kicks A$$!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Informative","review":"I bought this book for my five year old in order to help explain the significance of certain Jewish holidays.

However, I was disappointed because I guess I misunderstood what \\"simple yet thorough\\" meant. This is very simple; it is for 4-8 year olds and they mean it. I didn't learn a whole lot and that's a lot of money to pay for a simple book. I don't believe this is a complete list of holidays. There is no month listed for the holiday! There was no explanation of the Jewish calendar and of how they calculate years. I'm pretty sure there was not an activity for each holiday, which was a big minus (I borrowed this from the library). (Side note: if your child has food allergies, you would end up with not many activities to do at all.) So instead of billing this as an activity-filled \\"thorough\\" book, I would say it would probably be a nice read-aloud to your child. You could probably find the same information online (which is what I plan to do with my children)."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"there were no pictures to look at to aid in decision making process and the description was barely enough to tell what it was. it was basically a big gamble ordering it. even though it was described as being able to fit my pickup it was clearly not what i needed.....in short your AP exhaust products line needs better description and pictures!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robust statistics book with a funny title","review":"The authors offer a lot of useful material. However, they do not offer a bridge between the jargon of signal processing (filters) and robust statistics. It would have been much more useful with that having been done.It is written in the jargon of the robust statistics folks. If you have not read a book on that subject, you probably will be more than a little lost. If you understand signal processing and rubust statistics well, you don't need the book.Their main interest is in 2D processing and when I have to do some image processing, I will look at the book again and perhaps find something redeeming. I find Arce's book on Nonlinear Signal Processing quite a bit more useful in the general case.It is high priced at the used price. It is definitely not worth the full price. A good book on statistical signal processing and a good book on robust statistics cost less and has more value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a very long poor survey paper","review":"This book is simply a very long poor survey paper that constantly refers you to some paper or book for any meaningful detail.As text book, it has no value; as a collection of papers and books in the area, it is too expensive.

Most of these tunes run under the two-minute mark. With plenty of songs to choose from to mention - I liked \\"All Kinds Of Girls\\", the catchy \\"I Love My Gun\\", \\"I Never Wanted Anything To Change\\", their homage to AC/DC with \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", their cover of Sammy Hagar's \\"I've Done Everything For You\\", \\"We Go Together\\", the awesome \\"Young, Blonde And Dumb\\" and \\"Piece Of Ass\\" the best. An ideal find for fans of Rancid, Green Day, Dillinger Four and Blink-192. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG HIT","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter's first birthday party. It wasa HUGE hit with all the kids. The kids played for hours and hours andcried to go home!! The 100 balls it comes with are a joke. We purchasedan extra 200 balls for 300 total. It's roomy, it's durable and it packs up easy. I recommend this to all children."},{"rating":"2","title":"18 month twins love it","review":"I bought this for my 18 month old twin girls. They had outgrown the baby toys, and were too small for the big toys. This is great for them. They will play in it for quite awhile alone, and it is big enough that I can get into it as well. My girls love to toss around the balls. Even if one twin knocks it over, it is light and won't hurt them. Perfect gift as well! I would reccomend this!I gave 4 instead of 5 stars only because although it comes with 100 balls, it took 200 to really make it seem like enough. We bought an extra set of balls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us","review":"My kids have had ball pits since my first (age 6) was a baby. None last more than a year or so, so we are used to replacing them. This one, however, was the worst one we've ever gotten. The kids would run in, and it would fall over. The openings are so low to the ground, balls were constantly rolling out. It was a ridiculous mess. We kept it only a few days before deciding it definitely isn't for us. After returning it, we found a nice oval shaped blow-up pool at the store and bought that. Perfect ball bit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge Ball Pit","review":"I was so excited when we opened this up. It's huge! I can easily fit in with my four kids and have fun with them. I wasn't expecting it to be so big. Of course, like everyone says there's never enough balls, but we still have some more coming as another Christmas gift. Great Buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great toy for a great price","review":"I am very pleased with this product. We got it for our 1yr old's birthday with the thought in mind that it would be a great toy for our 4 year old as well. Both kids can climb in and out safely with out any worry that they will knock it over or get caught on something. Although if your going to buy this, make sure you are planning ahead with plenty of extra balls. What is provided is not nearly enough. Overall I would definetly recommend this to anyone with small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many openings for the balls to fall out","review":"I already had a ton of balls from an old inflatable ball pit when we purchased this. It has too many openings that aren't deep enough to hold the balls in. So the balls spill all over the place and the children are left with nothing but a mess to clean up. If I hadn't paid so much in shipping I would have returned it. I have massively duct taped two of the sides allowing only one entrance and one way for the balls to come out. I do plan to buy velcro to closed the front door to allow the kids to have fun playing in the balls. If you would like ball pit without balls and balls everywhere else but where they belong, this is the toy for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Year Old Raved!","review":"I purchased this for my sons 3rd birthday party. He loved it! It fits about 4 three-year olds at once. It's a messy good time. The balls don't really stay inside the ball pit as there are three doors and a big \\"skylight\\". Other than having to constantly throw the balls back inside it was a good purchase. It's absolutely a MUST to purchase extra balls. The ones that come with it only cover about two-thirds of the floor and definitely aren't enough to give it that \\"ball pit feel\\". I ordered an extra set of 100 balls. I may actually order another...about 300 balls total would give the desired effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fun for little ones!","review":"We bought this for our son's first birthday. He loves it! So does our five-year-old! Be sure to purchase at least 100 extra balls so it fills up, but be prepard to have lots of balls around the house! I would definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the Best","review":"I have just recently read this book and found it good. The only problem was i suspected who did it from the start. There was also one other thing that bothered me. In the story it said Becker started talking about the girl he was dating, but in Murder On The Iditarod Trail there was something about the wedding-ring status of Cas and Becker. I don't know if i missed something about if he got divorced or Henry forgot about that.

Her Alaska mystery series using Jessie Arnold, girl musher, as heroine, are interesting, full of vivid detail, and have enough \\"male\\" (stuff/point of view) in them to make a good read for men as well. I especially like her attention to detail of the Alaskan scenery and way of life. She must research like crazy! Cold Company is another book worth reading in this series.

Bah! Humbug! Usually, she manages to educate us about the frozen North as she entertains us, but this time, she resorts to the old Hollywood technique of having her main characters do stupid things to get into harm's way, and then rescues them just in the nick of time ( and sometimes lets them crash and burn ).

It doesn't of course and the installation that does come - 7.2 seems incomplete.

What were you thinking WWE? The Hogan-Andre utterly,totally,royally failed to live up to their WM3 match. Like ECW's first ONS event,the matches only lasted from 6 to 10 minutes with only the Jake Roberts-Rick Rude match lasting 15 minutes and that ended in a time limit draw and there were simply just too many matches in 1 night.

Unlike most other recordings of the cello concertos, Isserlis performs with a small orchestra and takes a faster tempo, sticking close to all of Haydn's musical instructions. As always, Isserlis breezes beautifully through the treacherous technical passages, playing them as music to equal the famous singing lines. Every note is heard crystal clear. The divertimento reveals Isserlis's lesser known (but no less sophisticated) side as a chamber musician. The instruments blend perfectly, and the music is reminiscent of one of Haydn's great symphonies. If you're looking for a recording of the Haydn cello concertos, this is certainly one of the very best, with the added bonus of the divertimento."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally infatuated","review":"I've lost count of all the soundtrack CD's I now own but \\"Angel Baby\\" remains one of my favorites.I have no idea who are the \\"The Big No No\\" but their songs on this album are definitely yes yes.

I've listened to it a zillion times and have yet to tire of it.The mix also really works -- Ustad Nusrat is awesome as usual, Peter Gabriel is terrific.

I plan to use it on my boat cover, belts, shoes, etc., as needed to repair the stiching which will come loose on many items that are sold in todays market, which seems to have a seam coming loose regularly on about everything you can buy. I've now sewn it up several times and the Speedy Sticher Sewing Awl 120 is much better than doing the job with just a needle and thread.

Yep, I'm talking about the Speedy Stitcher sewing awl. I absolutely love this thing.It took two years of it sitting on the shelf before I got around to using it for the first time, after consulting with a Youtube video from a leather worker depicting its use. After 15 minutes, I had the hang of the sewing technique, and after another hour-and-a-half, I had patched a large hole in my decrepit canvas duffle bag and repaired the straps. The result is ugly but with the very strong wax thread that came with it, my work is good enough to keep using the bag another year or two.Amazing tool.

I lost a little weight and I wanted to add a few notches to my belt: the awl is good for that. I ripped the edge of the pocket on my barn coat: the awl is good for that. One of the straps was coming loose on the duffel bag I use for laundry: the awl was good for that too. The needle doesn't look that strong at first glance, but it goes through tough canvas and even a fairly sturdy leather belt. I never felt like it was going to bend or break either.They're not expensive, and they come in handy in a lot of different ways.

My wife always borrows mine so now she is buying her own. We were looking at the other one because we liked that the spool was visible and easier to see internal snags, but after reading that the needles break, we went for this one again.

This is clearly a fantasy film aimed at an adolescent girl audience. Many of the monsters encountered become allies. The action scenes are more slapstick than violent; physical survival is never in doubt. Instead it is the soul of a family that is in peril. Wounded by the untimely death of the mother, can the two sisters and their father repair their relationships with each other and find a way to live with their tragic loss? Ultimately this is a film about grief and healing, a film which retains a surprising depth and sweetness, given the genre.

Because of the good reviews, I had expected a great movie and alhtough the storyline is intriguing, it looks low budget and unreal. I usually don't review anything but my disapointment with this one encouraged me to do so. If this movie is from a book then you'd probably be better off reading it and using your imagination.

The \\"R\\" suffix to the Kingston part ID signifies retail packaging - no real clue there. If you want the DCDM feature (the best performance), use the matched pair of modules - it does cost a bit more (~50%), but it is guaranteed to work whereas a pair of the individual \\"R\\" modules may or may not satisfy the Intel requirements for the DCDM feature, not a prudent gamble.

It's a tough one to pull off for many reasons, and all of the six or seven versions I've heard have weaknesses in one area or another.My benchmark for Les Troyens is the gorgeous love duet \\"\\"Nuits d'ivresse\\" in Act 4. The singing here is very good, but Pretre conducts it much too quickly and spoils the whole effect. The piece should flow, throbbing with both erotic ardor and erotic lassitude as it unfolds. Here it just sounds rushed. And speeds are bit bit brisk throughout. My all-time favorite for this duet is sung by Regine Crespin and Guy Chauvet on a 2-LP abridged set from the early 1960s, oddly enough also conducted by Pretre. Perhaps La Crespin fixed him with a steely glare and said \\"Slow down, Georges!\\" Nonethless there are many worthy moments in this recording, particularly when drama is required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galco sholder holster","review":"The product is as stated and worked out great.

I forgot to consider the trees, but since the mount was already on that section of the house and wire, I decided to keep it simple. When I programmed the tv to auto-find the channels, it turned out that the trees are not a factor at all even though the antenna is 10 ft below the tree line and there is a good 20+ trees in the line-of-sight. I am using the pre-amp since I am 30.1 miles from OKC according to [...]. I never attempted to use the product without the pre-amp since the manfacturer said it was only good for 20 miles.

Because it was inexpensive, and because I've been burned before, I also ordered a Winegard HD-1080. I hoped that if one didn't work well, maybe the other would. That was a good idea, because the Channel Master was seriously inferior to the Winegard. The channel Master did receive all local stations (all of which are 25 miles or less from my house and in the same general direction) the signal strength meter on my converter box indicated values from a low of 11% (abc) to a high of 36% (cbs). The channel that indicated 11% was prone to breaking up and sometimes just disappearing altogether.So I Installed the Winegard in place of the Channel Master. Wow. The signal strengths increased to the range of 55% to 73%. Rock Solid.I bought the Channel Master because of all the positive reviews. I guess I got the lemon. If you buy one, save the box. You may want to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good antenna","review":"Shipped was very fast. This antenna does the job quite well.

The stories he is recently producing seem too much re-hash of the other books he's produced.

I loved the idea of telling the Time of Troubles(a period when the gods were cast down from the heavens and magic went awry) from the drow perspective-- since they are creatures weaned on magic it made the situation all the more difficult for them(and interesting for the reader). We also got our first close-up look at the drow goddess Lloth, and she was as every bit as cunning as I hoped she would be. Salvatore handled the intrigue swirling around the Time of Troubles really well. The epic battle scenes of the second half of the book weren't quite as interesting, but still vividly rendered.

This time the microphone in the sending unit didn't work! I sent it back and about 3 weeks later they sent me just the sending unit! Finally they sent a package with both the sending AND recieving units. One of the recieving units was dead! Fortunately, I at least have one sending and one recieving unit which are working.

When I powered it up and tested it, it worked perfectly when the transmitter and receiver were just a few feet away, but at 40 feet and beyond, it was useless.I contacted Chamberlain Customer Service as they are the ones who now own the Reporter franchise.

Unfortunately, the tea shop and Charleston are about the best things this author has to offer. The mystery is light (I had the murderer pegged less than halfway through the book), and the characters are dull. The main character, Theodosia, is dull because she's impossibly perfect. She's beautiful, charming, successful, has impeccable taste in everything, and while one or two people don't outright worship her, they seem to always \\"respect\\" her or are \\"intrigued\\" by her. Even the stray mutt she took in for a pet is charming and spends his weekends as a therapy dog in a nursing home. It's too much.

A land developer is murdered and Theo decides to figure out who did the deed. Especially since one of her employees is on the suspect list.

This was a light easy read, very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cozy mystery","review":"\\"Death by Darjeeling\\" is a good mystery. The setting is nice - there's a lot of information about historic Charleston, which I found interesting. The characters were great - the tea shop employees and their neighbors, even Earl Grey the dog.

But I'm looking forward to the next book (\\"Gunpowder Green\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worse disappointment than decaf!","review":"This book just BLITHERS on and on. The author clearly knows far less about tea and the world of tea shops than she thinks she does - most of the brewing commentary would render you something more fit for the compost bin than the tea table - and the financial situations she creates for the tea related characters are overwhelmingly implausible. I found the book just about impossible to finish because there is nothing about the characters that makes them either plausible or interesting. The \\"plot\\" is also rather dismal.In summary: if you want a good book tea, read one of the fabulous FACTUAL histories of the brew. If you want a good mystery, try Allingham, Christie, Churchill or Dahiem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"This is the first in the series and I really enjoyed it.

She feels impelled to clear her friend and save her own reputation and business. Delightful characters with wonderful names abound. The ambiance of Charleston is wonderfully captured.A charming summer read that can be enjoyed by the young and old alike without insulting anyone's sensibilities.

For about three pages.I found it boring, badly written, and apparently unedited. (If it were edited, then the editor who allowed the sentence, \\"Ever the social butterfly and fashion maven, Samantha was fetchingly attired in a flouncy cream-colored silk skirt and pale peach cashmere sweater, generously scooped in front to reveal her matching peach skin and ample endowments,\\" should look for a new vocation.)

Note to self: read the reviews first.This book (along with the others) is poorly written, with clumsy plotting and ridden with cliches. Many other reviewers have pointed out its manifold weaknesses.The author has borrowed stock characters from many popular cozies, notably the main character, a single woman who has left the rat race for a girly business. She lets the business dominate the story, telling me much more about tea than I ever wanted to know, while stuffing her thin, gorgeous characters with rich pastries.The best character is the dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not good either","review":"I really wanted to like this book, but it didn't happen. I love the cover and I like the pooch (Earl Gray). But I found the characters dull. This book took me forever to read because it didn't interest me. Despite my boredom, I'm reading the second book in the series. And, I must say, that Theodosia Browning is just as dull in this book. On the other hand, I am enjoying reading about the teas--and I'm not much of a tea drinker. Those who like to drink a lot of different teas will likely love this aspect of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great comfy cozy","review":"I love mysteries that are cozy, and light hearted.

However, I think even Jessica Fletcher might have shyed from this mundane mystery murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I thought this book was very enjoyable and I was very interested in the characters. I bought this book hoping to be drawn into a new mystery series but I think the mystery \\"itself\\" lacked slightly. I think the likability of the characters saved the book.

I am a very avid reader so I thought this would be fun! Unfortunately for me, this was a grueling book to get through...it was only through my commitment to never let a book go unfinished that I got to the end.

If you are looking for a good foreign flick, you might wanna check out other movies. The soundtrack by Pink Floyd is quite good and fittingly placed in the movie. The best example of this is of the opening credits. The valley \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" song leaves a longing for the truth of the valley. Good movie overall, but it was quite special to hear the Floyd in a different media. True Floyd fan?? Get it. If not, dont bother. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensual Mood Film and Music","review":"I've always liked the alternative mood music that Pink Floydproduced in the early years and this film with its lush surroundings and sensual scenes in french (with subtitles) is a perfect sensory match.

Wow, that's groovy, and deep.Even forgetting that bit of intellectual/artistic cruelity to animals, there isn't much to this movie, beyond some good photography and some ancient pink floyd music.Nothing special about the actors, or dialogue, or even the few seconds of nudity.

Unfortunately, Wiltz's prose is at best workmanlike. Other than Norma Wallace, the title character, none of the prostitutes and none of the johns (or Wallace's husbands) are rendered in sufficiently distinct terms to tell them apart. Also, Wiltz references a phone book of political figures and corrupt cops, but doesn't provide any analysis of Wallace's connection to them, nor why Wallace flourished while others went to jail. Admittedly, there are a number of wonderful and picaresque snippets in Last Madam to put a grin on your face, but perhaps the fact that Wiltz never got to interview Wallace makes the treatment at best a mere scratching of the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great account!","review":"This story tells of the life of a New Orleans madam and how her youth shaped her whole life, from leaving a less-than-ideal family to set out on her own to build her own fortune and fame. Always adhering to strict rules to provide the highest class of service to her clients, Norma is on a constant search for true love, often finding that she couldn't give up her work to stay home and be a traditional wife and mother. In the end, Norma gets the guy, until her obsession with beauty and youth becomes more than even she can handle and her world slowly starts to fall apart.The only criticism is that this book is less like a story and more a historical account of her life.

It does tell a very interesting story, but the author destroys the book by being, quite simply, once of the worst writers in the history of mankind. The first few chapters are straight fact, without any effort to telling a story. Finally the pace slows down, but so much so that you want to scream for this person to move on with the story. I had to force myself to finish this book.

I've been reading everything and anything--cookbooks, fictional stories and works of non-fiction. I am quite disappointed at the missed opportunity this book represents.

As a French Quarter resident, any historic books are fascinating to me...this was no exception. The authors' description of architectural styles, addresses, and rooms were enriching. This book describes the political corroption that is historically prevelent to this day. The current mayor wants a third term (thus re-writting the city charter, so he want's to clean up the Quarter) the historic precedent is shown in this book.

She used anecdotes, transcripts of Norma's memories, and previous articles. Unfortunately, the whole thing reads like a list of facts with little style or wit. A story as interesting as this should grab the reader, draw them in, and keep them until the end.

The one, Riverdance is modern with electric guitars. If you don't like skip it, the rest I enjoy. Especially Big Storm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celticly appealing","review":"I am new to Celtic Music. I am just trying to get a hold of as many as possible. I happened upon an Eileen Ivers concert and i am a fan for life. I enjoyed this compilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This album disappointed me, and it's partially my fault for not listening to ALL the sound samples. I already have the Aine Minogue and Galway & Coulter CDs in which two of each albums' songs are included on this CD. I was looking for something new, not a sampling of other albums. I hate the Boston Pops version of Riverdance - electric guitars and the monotonous beat of pop-rock drums (something the sound bite sample did not reveal). Plus the selection of music ranges from lively to mellow, vocals to instrumental. I wanted an album of smooth meditative music.So if you want a generic selection of Celtic-sounding tunes, you may like this CD. But if you are looking for a cohesive group of melodies, avoid this one! I rated it two stars for the mismatched composition and my disappointment, but the artists deserve more than one star (buy their CDs, not this one)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful ... will get your head noddin'","review":"Reminiscent of Dieselboy's Soldier's Story at times, this disk has a punchy and powerful list of tracks.

But let's be honest. This mix was uninspired and dull. There was almost no creativity put into this. It was just a big promo with nothing but Bad Co. tracks(which wouldn't be bad if the mixs were on point). The best part about this cd was just the individual tracks on the first cd. If you are a new comer to the scene, I recommend you buy this just because it shows alot of styles of drum'n'bass and the tracks are top shelf. But if you're a real junglist that appreciates solid mixes with creativity involved, STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"ultra diverse","review":"This is a wonderful release by BC.

Bava blew him away, and Argento came in at a distant 2nd, but Fulci only had like 4 decent films, and those with almost no plots. This film, being part of his many attempts to return to horror, the fact of the matter is, goes limp. All good gore fans saw House, Gates, Zombie and the Beyond, and with good cause, cuz' they're the only semi-watchable films he made. This film had 2 or 3 cool gore scenes, ridiculously overdone, and completely unestablished. There were two shots of nekked nuns which added to the film's quick-scan-ability on DVD, otherwise, not worth a half hour of anybody's time. The plot rots, but the image transfer is great.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I am currently reading Ida B. as a read aloud to my 6th grade students. The book is taking entirely too long to read and has already lost my attention.The writing is rather monotonous and boring. I have really grown to dislike this main character. Yes. the book does have a lot of figurative language and challenging vocabulary for students to chew on for a while but the character is rather flat and strange. She is spoiled beyond belief. The author gives the main character an arrogance that is truly irritating.I'm plowing through this one and hope to never read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is missing here...","review":"My biggest complaint about this book is that Ida never acknowledges her spoiled, self-absorbed behavior toward her parents. I was expecting a scene at the end of the book where she grows up a little and shows compassion and concern for her mother's health. I was waiting for her to apologize to her parents for her behavior, realizing that her mother didn't get cancer on purpose and her father had no choice but to sell land to pay for medical bills. Instead, she apologizes to the trees and to the river and her classmate, and that's it. To make it worse, she \\"senses\\" that her father apologizes to her. It would have been so much better if Ida B. had learned a lesson about life's difficult choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This book is pretty bad.I read it and it did a bad job of explaining that Ida was actually angry that her mom got cancer and she had to go to school. Another reason that I rate this book two stars is that Ida's parents let her do a few days of school.Then since she did not like it, they just pulled her out and home schooled her. That can make a lot of children think that when they just don't like school, they can be pulled out and home schooled.Although this book has a lot of things that I don't like, I think the author had a pretty good idea of doing the home schooling business and then Ida having to go to school. It could have been a really great book for me, if the author had only made it a bit less confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"Ida B Applewood is certainly a character. Some here say she gets to be annoying, but I never felt that at all. Perhaps it is because I listened to the audio version of the book, read by actress Lili Taylor (I find listening to audio books in the car is the perfect way to preview read alouds for my class). Taylor's voice is PERFECT for Ida B, and I truly believed I was listening to a spirited, spunky 10 year old the entire time, just chattering away in the passenger's seat next to me. It could be that alone that won me over, but I have a feeling Hannigan's quirky voice for Ida B had something to do with it, too.The funny bits made me laugh out loud and the tender moments made me want to weep. I highly recommend this book and am planning on reading it to my third grade class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut Novel","review":"For a debut novel, I thought this was really very good. Ida B. has a strong, compelling voice and I loved her relationship with the trees and streams and nature all around her.I think girls will especially love this book because Ida B. isn't a perfect little kid, but she is a thoughtful kid and a kid who cares deeply about things.Ida B. is a good read and I will certainly pick up the next novel that Katherine Hannigan publishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is about a girl who is living the good life with her parents. She is homeschooled. She suddenly has to go back to school which she hates. I recommend this book to boys and girls within ages 9-12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters not believable, very negative","review":"The title is misleadingly upbeat. This very negative book has characters that our whole family could neither believe or support. Ida B, the main character, does virtually nothing to maximize fun or save the world. As a homeschooled girl, she is sent to 4th grade in public school and apparently knows no other children. She starts out withdrawn, then becomes antagonistic, and finds a weak \\"redemption\\" very late in the book. The setting is Wisconsin, but all the characters use language more like Tennessee. She continually refers to \\"my heart\\" - about every third sentence.I don't know what kind of childhood the author had, but I hope there are no real children like Ida B. If this is at all realistic, it is a good argument against home schooling."},{"rating":"1","title":"most selfish unlikable character","review":"I'm a 10-year-old home schooler, and I'm offended If people think that home schoolers are like that.

Katherin Hannagin is very good at expressing the characters feelings. Shes also very descriptive.

Events in the movie appear at first to move slowly, but not if you pay close attention to the little details. The ending throws a curve ball that is quite satisfying. This film won numerous awards at independent film conclaves. It deserved them all, although its appeal is mostly cerebral. Don't expect any special effects, it is not that sort of movie. It is, however, a profound movie about a rarely addressed aspect of human affairs. It might be called existential. It has greatness in it. It also requires some engagement in the story by the viewer. Unlike the in-your-face fantasy that currently pervades Hollywood (\\"Transformers\\", the \\"Terminator\\", movies and such) this movie requires a bit of thought. It is well worth that effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE!","review":"If the option was available, I would have rated this a \\"0\\".I have read many, many books on the subject of creating one's life, manifesting, changing one's reality, etc.---and this book just isn't worth the time OR the money.

Throughout, there are some stories of how some of her clients have changed their lives to some extent.But, as far as delivering information on how to actually accomplish this for yourself---the book contains practically no information. There are so very many better books available on this subject. Just do a search for \\"manifesting\\" or \\"manifest\\" or \\"manifestation\\" and you'll find them.

For artists, maybe even artists of today, Socialism seems to offer hope for mankind, a paradise for the movie-going proletariat, but understand, though only half right, this political film is cinema as good as any Serge Einstein.All this talk we hear in America of suave French sexes and their smooth, sophisticated approach to natural forces, after viewing Bunuel many times, Truffaut and Goddard as well, I say phsaw! The French of all classes seem to skip dating and go right to groping or raping. The brash male demands favors and the demur Jean Moreau merely nods her head, manipulating men without passion. The raped child or servant, hey that's real sex - I guess. The kindest man in the film is senile and a foot fetishist. You get the idea: French society is rotten to the core and in the 1930's blindly charging towards Jew killing and goose-stepping. That's half-right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if you're searching for the \\"why\\"","review":"This very thick book is full of detailed research, and chock full of studies, but completely devoid of answers to questions about why one submits to eating disorders.

If you want to do a research paper and site studies, this book is for you, but if you want some insight as to what makes someone give into the compulsive/addictive behavior, definitely look elsewhere.I gave it two stars because I didn't know how else to rate it.

Although the web site starts out as a small one with not more than three or four people visiting it a day, it soon becomes a sensation with thousands of people visiting it daily. Through his website, Josh runs into many problems.I would recommend this book to anybody who does not like society's love of looking good at any cost. The novel brings up many good points about commercialism and materialism that make you think about what is important in life. It also touches on teen issues, some in a humorous way. This book is an easy read that will make you examine your own habits, and it leaves you hoping that there will be a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book, The Gospel According to Larry","review":"The Gospel According to Larry is a very moving book. It's definately for teens. When i picked it up in my local library, i thought it was going to be a book about religious punks or something, looking at the cover of it.

Both were pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read it through..","review":"A (younger, yet intelligent) acquaintance recommended this book to me, and I have never read a book that I found so poorly written, banal, and callow. I would only recommend it to someone who has honestly never considered the notion that there might be something wrong with consumerism, or who wants to laugh at the naivete of these teenaged characters. Honestly, I found myself wondering if a young person reallly *had* written the thing, considering the jejune style of writing. It says ages 12 and up, but I'd really have to recommend it only for ages 15 and under - that, or I've sorely underestimated young people.

Anticonsumerism is something I sympathize highly with. But the book is written in such a watery, preachy way that it's almost unreadable.

Larry's sermons are banal and unoriginal. I don't see how this could ever happen in real life. There literally millions of anticonsumerist websites out there, and ALL of them are better than Larry's.TGATL is an unrealistic book targeted at pseudo-subversive teens.

You can drag bodies and switch clothes, but it all seems rather pointless. you can try and sneak around, but it seems like it doesnt matter. you can just kill them however you want anyway. reloading is riduclously slow too, and before you die, time slows down and so it seems like it takes f o r e v e r. There are a lot of other games out there. I don't recommend wasting cash on this one. if you're looking for a shooter like halo, try kill switch. if you're looking for a sneak around game like metal gear, try tenchu. if you're just looking for more violence, take it up a notch and try manhunt. save your money and pass on hitman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long","review":"These pants were described as having a 29 inch inseam but actually have a 32 inch inseam for the 2X size.

How many times MUST he re-package \\"the hits\\"? And one can't help but wonder: why are tracks like Vahevala and Angry Eyes, taken from the first and second Loggins and Messina records, played off here as strictly Loggins' material? Just because he was the principle writer on those tracks? Jim Messina wrote and produced some of the best moments that duo ever recorded, yet the only face on this compilation is that of Loggins.

While there is nothing from his 1980 live album, you do get a terrific live version of \\"What a Fool Believes\\" with it co-writer Michael McDonald from the 1993 live album OUTSIDE: FROM THE REDWOODS.

So I thought I wouldn't use so many kernals and see if I could dump it out faster. It ended up with the whole batch tasting burned since there wasn't enough volume to push the popcorn out of the kettle as it popped. The taste of the non-burned batch was good but I don't know if I'll use it again. It sure takes a knack to know the right timing. I didn't think clean-up was any harder than normal.

Any sane woman would tell him he's being inappropriate. Eleanor just deserved so much better than skanky Curry. C'mon, he's 14 years older than she is which is typical for a Diana Palmer book.Sorry, I got to page 135 before I ditched it. There are better D. Palmer books out there.

He was incredibly verbally abusive to her and she just took it and excused it. In the 2007 era the way Curry treated Eleanor would be verbally and emotionally abusive. So I guess based on that perspective I found myself asking myself why any woman in her sane mind would have stuck around to endure two weeks (her notice) of his actions. This was not what I would term a healthy relationship. I realize the author is getting from A to Z in the relationship in 200 plus pages, but puh-leez, can't we allow the female lead more dignity than to think so little of herself that she would put up with someone like this? But police, social workers and the like have been dealing with abused women and their refusal to leave an abusive relationship for decades--guess this is why Eleanor stayed.

Forde does a good job of structuring his book to allow entry into the complex and often counter intuitive thinking of the Theology of the Cross.I'd recommend this book to anyone who was seeking to gain entry into understanding the concepts of the Theology of the Cross, anyone who wanted a refresher course before diving deeper, or anyone who wanted to use it as a devotional guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theology of cross not theology of glory","review":"Forde explains clearly what Luther meant by \\"theology of cross\\" and \\"theology of glory.\\" it is worth reading just for these explanations, but is also an amazing commentary on Luther's classic Heidelberg Disputation.Forde celebrates the cross as proof that God will have mercy on sinners and he warns us not to seek God apart from the cross because it is in the cross that God will be found. The only solution for humans bound by sin is the forgiveness that comes from Christ alone. This is what all people feeling the guilt and shame of their sins need to hear, not some horrible message of self-help and behavior modification. If you aren't preaching salvation by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, you're probably preaching \\"moralistic therapeutic deism\\" as described in chapter 4 of Christian Smith'sSoul Searching: The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Theologian of Glory Exposed.","review":"In this gem, O Forde first gives some historical background to Luther's Heidelberg Disputation (nothing to do with the Heidelberg Catechism). Then he proceeds to compare throughout the book the Thologian of Glory with the Theologian of the Cross using the 25 thesis's of the Disputation. All along as it develops through sin, law, good works to the cross he hems in and leaves no escape for the 'theologian of glory' except death to self and faith in Christ for obtaining righteousness before God.

Mothers and wives all too often appear as suffering saints in similar accounts. Maura's account of the difficulties of motherhood and of her depression would be a very familiar one to the thousands of women who are on prescribed anti-depressants and tranquillisers and who are still expected not to upset anyone by complaining. There may not always be a neat resolution to life but Maura's determination to tell her story is a tribute to her human spirit - more power to her writing elbow."},{"rating":"1","title":"jumping on the bandwagon","review":"seriously disappointed by what is clearly an overated memoir.

There are numerous working class women who go through the same difficulties and who are not from Irish decent - again I suspect jumping on the Irish bandwagon which is a shame as I am sure there is a real story to tell which would be far more interesting...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I ordered this item because of the variety of great songs on it.

It might be okay for B&W printing, but I am an artist and need to reproduce high quality accurate prints of my paintings. The colors on this printer are terrible. Trying to talk with an Epson tech is a hopeless cause. Epson has made their printers too difficult for the average consumer to use. If it ain't broke, don't fix it!

The book mostly avoids a preachy tone, though, and brings a wonderful adventure that has just a slight supernatural background (much credence is put in dreams, here.)The characters in this book are strong, though they are in rather unbelievable positions. There is a beautiful friendship between two young girls, told from the point of view of one of them.

The two young women who escape Jamaica and become pirates, donning men's dress and fighting as men, are warmly-imagined: one feels almost as if they're in the same room with you as you are reading.The injustices that are treated in this book: slavery of blacks to whites, and slavery of women to the decisions of men, including and especially their fathers and brothers. You are made to understand how a pirate's life could be liberating.The tale includes some heavy-hitting scenes of murder; it's not a fantasy-land young adult book. Yet it's not written sensationalistically; in fact, the style is of high literary quality, so much so that while it can appeal to young people, it also was impressive reading for me (I am forty years old).In addition, there are great sea-action scenes and an informative depiction of the pirate way of life.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone, young or old, man or woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a superb read, and it's great so far!","review":"This book is VERY well written and I love the detail, I'm on page 180 and I love it.

I have read a few reviews claiming this book was easy to predict, and in parts, that is true, but I think there were enough surprises in the plot to keep any good read hooked for a while. I was recommend this book to anyone who enjoys pirate stories or even just adventure stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates!","review":"My book, Pirates, is full of wonderful and risk taking characters. My first character is Nancy Kington, she is a rich young lady who runs away to become a pirate. Nancy runs away because she shot and killed a rich slave owner named Duke. Another character is Minerva Sharp, she was Nancy's slave but they become friends so she joins Nancy and becomes a pirate as well. Later, Minerva tells Nancy that they are sisters and Nancy is shocked. Captain Broom is the captain of the pirate ship The Swift Retune. Broom reminds me of Jack Sparrow because he is crafty and unpredictable. The last character is The Brazilian, he wants to marry Nancy, but she loves William that is also why she ran away. The Brazilian chases Nancy all around the Pacific only to be killed in the end. These colorful characters make the book stick in the reader's mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book in a long time!","review":"Finally a book that was entertaining and engaging. I loved it! The character development was great and the plot moved at a good pace. I did find that at the end I was ready for the wrap up about 30 pages before it happened though. Still, I highly recommend this book! A great adventure story that is woven in a way that made it seem like it could happen even though many elements of it are purely make believe. I am very interested in this author now and I plan to read more of her books. The author was good at using imagery and emotion and kept you guessing what would happen to the main charachters. It was original and a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Pirates","review":"This book by Celia Rees was really good. It is set on the Atlantic Ocean in the late 17th century. Surprisingly it is more a book girls would enjoy then boys. There are some gory parts that might not be enjoyed. The writing is good and the plot filled with adventure. The author really makes the reader feel that you are on the ship right next to the characters. There is a lot of romance too but not too much. The book is a must read for anyone interested in pirates or the high seas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates!","review":"Nancy was born in the 1700's, and ever since she was a child she was put under limitations, since she was a woman. Even when she was a young lady, her father wouldn't let her father marry who she wanted. When he dies, she is sent to her inherited Jamaican sugar plantation. She meets Minerva, one of the slaves her age, and soon they are fleeing, trying to get away from a Brazilian man who is determined to take Nancy as his wife.This was entertaining and I was rooting for Nancy and William the whole time. It was great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Kindle Version, it is loaded with errors!","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but I am enjoying it so far. What I don't enjoy is tripping over text errors every 2 or 3 pages. Mostly you can figure out the word by context, but it seriously disrupts the flow of reading. To my eye the errors are a result of scanning the text and using OCR (optical character recognition) to convert it to an ebook. A previous review described some specific errors. There is no excuse for such a sloppy conversion job. Even if the author, or publisher, did not want to spend time manually proof reading it, a simple spell checker would have detected and corrected most of the errors in minutes. I recommend not buying the Kindle version until the text errors are corrected."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it","review":"i was unalbel to put put this sown if you like girl powere books read it! it's thrilling has romance in it it great. do't be worryed about's it's langth it gos by soo fast!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Casual Ride","review":"The Heart Health series is a slower pace, relaxing ride. The sights and music are well suited to a recovery ride, a relaxing journey, and no worries about heart rate, pace, or effort.

They're not too hard, not too easy so they fill the time well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good book","review":"This book is an interesting and intriguing fairy tale that many children will love. It is illustrated beautifully...the pictures almost could tell the entire story. This book could also be used to teach what the man-in-the-moon actually is (the rocky surface of the moon), and to teach about the phases of the moon (In the book, he actually \\"turns the lights off\\" in the wrong order...a waning moon will have its left side lit, not the right.). I enjoyed reading it as an adult, and I would highly recommend this book for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man un the Moon in Love","review":"I selected this title because it was written by Jeff Brumbeau , author of The Quiltmaker's Gift. It is a children's book but I don't think it would keep the interest of young children (3 - 6) and I think it would be nonsensical for older children. Illustrations are adaquate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have several Heath aluminum purple Martin houses and wanted to add an additional floor for my growing purple Martin families. I ordered an unassembled aluminum Heath purple Martin house ( add a unit) recently and was very disappointed after I had It assembled. The room dividers were too long and caused the unit to have an irregular shape instead of the standard triangle shape of previous houses. It was even impossible to fit the floors into the unit. My husband had to disassemble the house and cut down all six room dividers. Once he did that and reassembled it, the house lined up with the other floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great southern gospel songs in \\"Shout 2003\\"","review":"\\"Shout 2003\\" continues the tradition of listening to and enjoying top- notch southern gospel music.It's great to hear and listen to top gospel hits from many well knownsouthern gospel artists .

One of its strongest point is its focus on cultural issue, which I think significant for everyone willing to work outside of his/her own cultural background - You can trust the ability of the writers who transfer their knowledges to readers.HB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap product!!!!!!","review":"Sizes seem to be way off on this product.

I could not entice her back again, even after several days. The movie \\"Catnip\\" was more interesting to her even if it was more grainy and the sound not as good. Too bad I lent it to someone and never got it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't tell her to stop","review":"Once again Madonna has proven to world that she is at the top of her class.

To celerbate her 14th album the U.K has made avaliable a ltd. ed. box set of the Music album. The box set contains a t-shirt a sticker, and a sticker for your car. The cd also contains the bonus track American Pie which was only available on The Next Best Thing soundtrack. A sure collectable for any Madonna fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"like a rip off","review":"This is not an official set. The \\"box\\" is actually a cheap piece of plastic that doesn't even form a real box. It's a cut out but doesn't fold correctly. The CD is not rare, it can be found online. And everything else can also be purchased as well. A good way to tell if an item is real or fake is just by the way it looks. If it looks cheap or fake then it likely is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Education","review":"I first saw this video on NGHD (National Geographic HD).

At first, you must go this long intro, which is a little bit boring. Then your off starting your jobs. You are a young stubborn boy named Ryodo. Your first job is to escort Elena to point A safely. Along the way, you battle monsters. Normally, you try to avoid fighting because it's kind of boring, but in Grandia 2 I looked forward to fighting the monsters. The graphics are simply amazing, and the music is a nice mix. All in All, this totally has gotten me into the RPG games. Thank you, Grandia."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best RPG I've ever played!","review":"I usually don't play RPGs--at least not to completion, anyway. I am hooked on Grandia 2, however. The combination of an excellent battle system and no random battles makes this an RPG that anyone should be able to play, and play well. The character design is top notch, and the textures are almost photorealistic. I haven't played \\"Skies of Arcadia\\" yet, but I can't imagine any RPG being more fun to play than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best is only to be started over","review":"HEY, this is the greatest RP freaking G I have every played for dreamcast so far. I really like the battle style(a bit hard to grasp at first), not only that but the music and the characters are wonderfully emotional. The game has a big dead lead line heart beat of belief inself. This was a great game for me because of my veiws on the storyline(can't tell why or it,ll ruin it for ya!). But lets forget about the charaters for a sec and go into graphics. The graphics are the thing that makes me still think that the dreamcast is better than PS2. It really has beutifully animated cenes and spells not to mention the real time graphics. This game was one I couldn't put down it was so good i felt like I was in the game. I'll shut up now but THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE AND WILL BE REMEBERED FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

Huge numbers of different factions that each player quite differently. Amazing depth in the combat itself as each individual unit down to the basic footman can accomplish so much in a single battle. Good multiplayer support.Possibly the best fantasy themed strategy game that's come out since Masters of Magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this game","review":"The other reviewers did a pretty good job of addressing it but left out a bit that I would like to address.1) Yes, the graphics are poor. This is a strategy game, though--this isn't a big deal at all.2) The one real downside to the game is too much micromanagement.

That's not the case here in this huge (over 600 pages), ambitious, and vividly written novel that is concerned with a Pittsburgh industrial family over the course of about 70 years. Mary, the \\"Irish peasant girl from Shantytown\\" is the main character, and she's wonderfully drawn by Davenport. Her goal in life is to hold the Scott family together: \\"she was hellbent that nothing should ever happen to reflect on this family,\\" says Paul, the head of the family and the man she's loved (and who has loved her back) but wouldn't marry, feeling his real love was his steel mill. The book spans a very large canvas from Pittsburgh to Eastern Europe and a large cast of characters; Davenport's skill at manipulating events and people is on full display in this novel, and despite its length the book is interesting from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"a much-loved book","review":"My father had this on his bookshelf when I was growing up in Pittsburgh. I read it as a teenager in the mid-60s and was bowled over by its storyline and history of my town. When I graduated from college in California in the '70s, I bought my own copy. I still read it from time and time, and the magic of the book hasn't faded; the romance, the immigrants' stories, the underlying power of the mills over the lives of every character, they all still enchant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Valley of Decision","review":"I received a new copy, not the one I expected when the description did not read \\"soft cover\\" nor had original copyright date along with the recent one in the description. On the other hand, the book was printed well AND it was a USA University Press. So, I will forgive you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good historic look at social taboos in the 1940s","review":"Valley of Decision is a book about the forbidden love between a steel magnate's son and the family's Irish-American upstairs maid. But it's not at all romantic because the star-crossed lovers are caught up in maintaining the strict and rigid separation between the rich and the poor, the served and the servant. Neither character can get past the social taboos and find happiness in each other's love. But the book is still compelling and worth reading to understand just how conventional and rigid the lines between the classes still were, so recently. It could be rewritten today, with gay or married would-be lovers who can't overcome social pressures and let themselves be happy. I'd read it again, and I can't say that about most books I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pentax Flash","review":"The product arrived in a timely manner. I had purchased this for my novice daughter and we were expecting the unit to be compatible with a Pentax 100D which it was not - well not exactly. It functioned but there were no automatic features that were needed. In truth, I thought I was ordering a Pentax AF-500 FGZ which would have been compatible with the 100D. Had documentation advising of the incompatibility been available on the order page, I would not have ordered it. Instead there was mention of other cameras it was compatible with but not the ones it was not. Picky maybe but for a novice photographer it was important. Pentax accessories are usually compatible across a wide range of models.So far the usual promptness in both the order process and the return process Amazon provides has been exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I first became aware of Daniel Drennan through his online wrapups of \\"Beverly Hills 90210\\". His weekly commentary/recap became even more entertaining than watching the show. As the show began to tip the scales towards the \\"guilty\\" side of \\"guilty pleasure,\\" even Danny gave up on it! And, boy did I miss his writing.This book has all of the attitude, all of the style, all of the fascinating observations and none of the spoiled Beverly Hills kids. If you are from New York, or you have any interest in New York, or even if you think that people must be crazy to go anywhere near New York, you will find this book a fun and interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A laff-riot with heart, truth, & right bit of bitterness.","review":"I guess I've lived in NYC (or maybe just lived!) long enough to know how all too true Danny's stories are.

Danny's observations are always precise, slightly off beat, and painfully true. His stream of consciousness writing makes you feel as if you are on the receiving end of a coffee date from heaven.

It covers, in brief, most of the questions I had. It also contains sample forms, addresses for obtaining forms, checklists... in short, more than you are likely to need. O'Neill and Warda also provide guidance for agencies to contact and additional books to read. The fact that it is written for one state is reassuring. This is not EVERYTHING you need to know, but it is a starting place for the nearly overwhelming number of things a new business owner needs to consider.

This is diffently not a book for the casual Batman reader, although anyone who feels they have a basic knowledge of the the Batverse will probably enjoy seeing the character developments.

But I decided to give it another go last week and I was impressed. Jim Gordon gets shot and it is up to the Bat family to track down the killer. It sounds like a simple story but things are not as they seem and the story has a lot of political machinations. It is a well thought out and structured story.

The 5-cup model will stay on my counter for all the everyday jobs though, it is SOO convenient and easy to clean.

It cuts fine but the disk rattles and sounds like its hitting the side of the bowl. The disk mounts on a tall stem that sits slopply on a rotating stud. The disk starts making noises with every inch of pressure that you put on it.Also, I was sad to find that there isn't any other disks for a 5 cup which I sure could use for different foods.I tried to grate parmesan cheese. The disk makes too much noise and doesn't cut it into very fine pieces like what you buy at the store.

I tried all the switches in the house and made sure the bowl was on properly etc..but nothing to do. I couldn't believe it because the last time I used it it worked fine! Of course, it was no longer under the 1year Kitchen Aid warranty. I was given the name of a local Kitchen Aid repair shop and this is what it would have cost me to fix the problem: $45 up front fee, regardless of what needed to be done, plus the cost of labor and parts. It could have easily gone as high as $100-125. Just not worth it.I always thought Kitchen-Aid was a reliable name but after this, I will definitely think twice before buying any KitchenAid item again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a food processor that works properly","review":"I had almost given up on ever finding a functional food processor. This was my last hope. I find that this unit slices, chops, and shreds beautifully and uniformly--unlike previous units that produced mangled or soupy product. This is a great unit for small and medium jobs, and as a household of one, it's perfect for me. If you do larger jobs or a larger household with bigger cooking volumes, then perhaps try the larger Kitchen Aid food processor (11 cup). I've been doing fall apple recipes lately, and this processor has been perfect. Easy to assemble, easy to lock the bowl and lid into place, easy cleanup. I love the mini bowl for smaller jobs like chopping nuts, herbs, garlic, etc. Small enough to keep on the counter, even in a small apartment kitchen. Thank you KitchenAid for the best food processor on the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"only one little problem","review":"I started out with the large processor,it took up too much counterspace so I sent it back.Then I went with this one and was very pleased . . .until I tried to order more slicing discs for it.There aren't any avaiable for this size. I was very disappointedbecause the slices from the disc are amlost paperthin (2mm) and don't work well with salads etc. When I ordered a 6mm slicing disc it didn't fit. When I called the company they said, too bad, no other discs available. We still use it but as we are a big salad famiy I am still slicing by hand...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grey is the color of hope book","review":"I received the book right on time and was able to read it (couldn't put it down actually) before our ladies meeting at which we are discussing the author.

After a few games it is hard to tel the difference between space and groudn combat. You go thru the same motions, every thing is played out on a 2D battlefield (yes the graphics are 3d but the play area is only in 2 dimensions). This game is a big improvement over the last attempt (Star Wars: Rebellion) but suffers form the same plague. IT RELIES ON ITS STAR WARS THEME far too much and doesn't focus on playability.Bottom line: Save you money or get Lord of the Rings Battel for Middle Earth II. Fun, enjoyable, and has more than a handful of unique features that put it above the usual RTS game. Star Wars Empire at War....boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME","review":"Many people (including my son) are getting an exception error every time they play the game. This renders it unplayable. Before you buy this game, go to the LUCASARTS technical support site (or, search the internet for \\"Empire at War\\" \\"Exception_Access_Violation\\") There are 576 posts at the LUCASARTS site complaining about this problem, from experienced computer geeks who have spent days or weeks trying to resolve it. And Lucas Arts has not come out with a reasonable fix. The latest patch (1.04) does not address it. Buy this game, and sorry will you be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire at War","review":"This is one of the greatest RTS' out there right now. Petroglyph has gotten rid of the pointless resource collecting, which makes the game very easy to get into and play. My only complaint with the game is the graphics, close up, they look horrendous(at least in ground battles), but the good thing thing that comes out of the bad graphics is that you don't need a power pc to play this game. So if you like Star Wars, or just RTS', go out and buy this game, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"quickly gets old...","review":"it's really a superficial game lacking any real depth. like many rts's, once you figure out how to win the game its basically over for you. you will stick around to launch a few star destroyers and play with the heroes, but this game doesn't have more than a week's (or less) worth of play to it really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Rebellion, but I wish it was","review":"Man, I was really hoping for an updated version of Rebellion, with actual strategy and not just RTS elements. This isn't it. The strategic portion of the game is only a thin veneer built on top of the combat engine, which is a pretty good RTS. But this isn't really a strategy game. It's Starcraft with multiple battlefields. If that's what you're looking for, then this is a good game for you. I should have held out for Rebellion 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire at War- love it now wheres the expansion","review":"The game is a blast to play-it is a lot more fun than Rebellion and damned entertaining to play. I just love running around with Vader and the Emporer kicking the crap out of everything. And look at those AT-AT-the game rocks pure and simple.The comments about the AI might be accurate on galactic conquest but the AI seems better on the Campaign screens that sort of follow the movies.I hope that in the future a patch or expansion will become available that allows the building of Super Star Destroyers, the naming of your minor heros, the addition of more heros from the original trilogy and some of the books (the prequals stink like a dairy farm).A rebellion element that is missing is the diplomacy of some of the characters- maybe not need in this game but liking rebellion I expected to see that in the game.Overall- game rocks but theres lots that could be added. I love the cinimatic views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the movie - flash but little substance","review":"As far as games go this one has beautiful graphics. The game play is not innovative but is done well so it is fun to play. SW fans will like the theme and characters. It may use old game play, but that is not unusual. I would have liked to see more surprises. But then the latest SW films were mediocre and relied on FX and graphics. Of course it didn't have to to be a hit. The game company doesn't have to follow suit and could try to expand the boundaries of gaming, but then they knew it would sell anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really fun game","review":"I bought this game a few months ago, and I play it almost every day. I first want to mention that if you are a star wars fan, then this game is deffinately for you. There are many units to command in both space and land modes. The only bad thing is that when you first buy the game, all of the units are WAY out of scale. But you can fix this by just going to google and searching \\"empire at war mods\\". There are some really great modifications that make the game way better, so you might want to check those out after you buy the game.It's an excellent game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big let down!","review":"I played the game on/off for several days playing the rebels, (I like challenges). My major problems are the space maps are not that big, with all the firepower the IMP displayed in the game does not matter since the AI is a joke, and the game ended too quick.

This game has absolutely very little tactics, it's all about who has the most units.

I would strongly suggest trying the demo before wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....................................................","review":"when i first purchased this game I thought it would have action not strategy. all you do is command not live the battles. When I first played it i nearly fell asleep. Dont buy this crappy game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible","review":"I had high expectations for this game... but I think it falls short. The campaigns are a bit rigid and don't leave much room for player improvisation. For actual battles, an organized way of using units tactically is very difficult to come by.Most unfortunately the opponent's position, strength, movement, etc. is almost always completely shrouded! Droids, smugglers, and bounty hunters do little to remedy this fact... Consequently there is not much strategy going on here; just build up as big a force, as quickly as possible and be ready for an attack at any time. Even after an attack has begun, there is so little info. regarding the other side you can't do much in the way of tactics.On the plus side, the cinimatic views are very cool, and the grafics are good, and Star Wars characters add a mystique to the whole thing... If you like being the brains of your game I wouldn't pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"While many reviewers are insinuating that finally a decent Star Wars game has surfaced, beware! I decided to purchase this game solely on reviews I had read here and elsewhere. I was extremely disappointed when after only a few hours of playing I had mastered it completely and was left with nowhere else to go. I can now finish the game on the hardest setting in under 20 minutes.There is no challenge, no replayability factor, and certainly nothing in-game worth experiencing again. What I'm stuck with now is a $50 piece of software that I will never use again."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fun","review":"C & C but with star wars... fun and exciting with 2 moeds of play. though doesnt always install correctly"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh RTS","review":"different units in this game are very well balanced out. For this reason, it is difficult to produce only one unit and try to overrun the opponent. The method of reinforcement is also different than anything I've seen before. Units no longer appear outside their respective structure but can be brought out onto the field at different locations, changing the tactical dynamics of the game. The ability to hold units in reserve without having them take up population points also changes the dynamic. Different units can be used better tactically because of this.Overall the game is very enjoyable and well worth the price. It is surprisingly good for a Star Wars franchise game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun moments, but tires quickly","review":"This is a fun game and allows you to command both land and space forces. It's more of a strategy game where you direct units. I enjoyed the ability to play battles at the head of Star Wars fleets. The game includes most of the main ships from the movies (although the TIE Interceptor and B-Wing are conspicuous absences), as well as new vehicles. As fun as it is though, the concept gets old pretty quickly. There are only a limited number of combat spaces, and aside from the background scenery there are few differences between them. Moreover, the game limits the number of forces you can build, so at most you can only fight with 2-3 large capital ships at a time. Perhaps the biggest problem is that it's fairly easy to build a huge fleet and conquer at will. Despite that, it's a great opportunity to command Star Wars fleets. I got mine as part of a pack of games, and I don't know if I'd buy it alone, but I'm glad I did eventually get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average psych rock","review":"To put a little reality check on the gushing: The riffs, songwriting, and overall sound of T.I.M.E. is banal and characterless, sort of like Steppenwolf if they had no songs.

The music is fresh here although maybe we want the old Orleans style once again. Just once in a while it would be nice to get back to the original roots of Harry.But you won't go wrong getting it, it's just not perfect.

MY favorites are \\"My Blue Heaven\\" and \\"All the Things\\" He even snuck his own work in there with \\"Other Hours\\" The CD has a very relaxing feel about it (similar to his \\"To See You\\" CD). This would be a great CD to put on for Valentine's Day.I have since listened to older versions of all of these songs. Some of them have been slowed down a lot, some sound SO MUCH better, but mostly they all just have a different flavor. If you are looking for duplicate of the old stuff in their original style---then you won't like this. If you want to hear a new spin on the old stuff, go check this out. I really love this CD.

When I found the soundtrack in a bargain bin recently, I thought perhaps it would contain some nice background music for driving or for a living room Scrabble game.

A jarring leap from 1870 to 1915, just the period when bats were developing from wagon tongues to modern bats, is unforgiveable. The tales of idiosyncratic bat habits and preferences of major league stars is interesting, but the book utterly fails in its titular premise -- the history -- and is graded accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know what you are getting yourself into","review":"We had no idea what we were in for when we rented this movie. I enjoy foreign films, so I probably would still have rented it knowing it was a Danish movie and based on the description, but I was unaware that I would be a guinea pig for an experimental film style. The description makes it sound like your normal, everyday feel-good romantic comedy with a few quirks, twists, and turns that will amuse and entertain...instead this felt like a poorly done student filmshot on a home video camera, with uninteresting characters, no plotline, no humor, and generally no redeeming qualities whatsoever, except the one Grand Canal vista about 5 minutes before the movie ends.

We just hated the way it looked and the pace it moved at from frame #1. We packed it in early on and were glad we only rented it. It looks as if it were shot by someone first using a home video camera the day after unpacking it from the underneath the Christmas tree. It looks nothing like its beautiful cover on the box. I am thus in shock that this film just scored slot #7 on \\"Time\\" Magazine's Top 10 Films of 2002. Amazon customer/reviewer Tom Reynolds made it all the way through, hating every frame, and likened it to watching paint dry.

I don't even know where to begin. The film (or shall I say \\"tape\\") must have been shot by a 6-year-old.There is absolutely zero character development. There's no music. The acting is eighth-grade-drama-class quality. They can't even get one of the \\"actors\\" to cry real tears, opting instead for what was sure to be an eye-dropper. The subtitles look like they were done in the early 80s.I'm normally a huge fan of foreign films, figuring that if they make it to the shelves of our local video stores, they're high quality. This film shot thousands of holes in my theory. This is no \\"Talk to her.\\" This is no \\"Y Tu Mama.\\" This is no \\"Open your eyes.\\"I give the \\"fim\\" an F-.

The fact that it is shot using only a hand-held camera means nothing to me. What it does mean is this: The movie has the look and feel of a final project for a college level drama course. I don't understand what critics and viewers see in this movie. I honestly can't believe this film found it's way into even limited release.Maybe this type of filmmaking appeals to some people. I don't know; I fast forwarded through 90% of the movie in complete disbelief. My friends and I got a good laugh out of it...But I asked for my money back when I returned it to the video store.

There's a furious restauraneur, a dippy hairdresser with a dying mother, a clumsy bakery worker who can't keep a job, a trouble-free Italian waitress, and many others. Shot as a video rather than as a cogent hang-together movie, there's a bit of a slap-dash quality about this one that is part of why it's a little hard to become engaged at the beginning - but it turns out to be its biggest appeal by the end.It's worthwhile spending an evening with these folks as they try to learn the language of love."},{"rating":"2","title":"response to Peter Lorenzi","review":"I like \\"Hollywood movies\\" just as much as the next person, I like the fact that the good guy always wins, and that romantic comedies are full of just that...romance and comedy. But as a movie lover, I enjoy and love foreign film. For the most part, foreign films seperate from the fantasy world Hollywood lives in, and portray life more like real life. Italian for beginners is a wonderful movie, a little weird as to the way it's filmed, but very good. I rented this movie and now own a copy; I recommend you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Bad But Always Mediocre","review":"There are a thousand amateur writers who could come up with a better screenplay than this.

Even the description on the back of the movie conveniently leaves out the fact that it is an experimental Danish movie. We, however, moved past our anger at the marketing ploy and watched the movie anyway. Long story short, the script was boring and somewhat nonsensical, the actors were completely unbelievable, and the characters were unlikeable.

But I would suggest that money would be better spent on Spring-Heeled Jack, or the Pilfers, or some other punk-ska band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great if you loved the movie Grease","review":"This CD is awsome.

It's a bad attempt at some sort of action movie about some guy who blackmails some businessman who sends some gangsters to kill the blackmailer and get a CD from him. When the blackmailer goes to Mexico to visit his brother, he also becomes a target of the gangsters. Add two or three scenes involving a shark and you have \\"Night of the Sharks\\".

David's brother(Carlo Mucari) has some sort of mafia dealings where he blackmails them with a CD disc claiming to have information or something.To make a long movie short, the disc ends up with David and the mob wants it back. This leads to...whatever except a night scene with sharks, the title of the film. The plot was confusing, but the movie wasn't that great that I really cared. It was funny in an unintentional way.

There are always those who will argue baseball is better, but college football is always talked about from July through February with a childlike zeal. \\"Rites of Autumn\\" attempts to give a history of the coaches and players that shaped the sport into the NCAA and NFL we know today. The series is ten episodes narrated by Burt Reynolds and each one has themes similiar to a Ken Burns' documentary. The only holes in the show are the lack of information on teams other than Alabama,any Big Ten teams, Notre Dame, USC,Oklahoma, and Miami. There are many teams that really helped shape the sport that were totally looked over. Perhaps time did not permit, but this is a very entertaining view of sports history. Overall I would recommend anyone at least renting it or borrowing from a friend because if you love football...you will love \\"Rites of Autumn\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"First, let me say that this is a great buy for the price. However, if you are a fan of midwest schools, they really don't give enough attention to these universities.I'm a Nebraska fan and they didn't even mention Osborne in the greatest coaches sections, and barely any of Bob Devaney who started it all. Texas is mentioned during the time of Darrel Royal and Oklahoma is discussed during Bud Wilkenson's tenure. Barry Switzer's tenure is pretty much completely left out. Its very centered with the eastern schools, USC and Notre Dame.

Although it is an over-worked metaphor, Patty's music is a tapestry. From electric Celtic jazz to polished honky-tonk lounge, influential threads converge in well-tuned settings of rich textures and original flavors. A hushed voice with burnished rock-blues grit sails over the tight weave of angelic choirs and intricate guitar. Blues meet global beats as infectious grooves are brought to a languid boil, half-untamed and bewitchingly seductive. Exotic fates dance to crackling passions, familiar feelings awake and unfold in poetic phrases, making the casually sophisticated, \\"Red = Luck,\\" this year's safest bet.

The arguments for these missions that despite the large political cost that eventually occurred (as the result of Gary Powers capture showed) were worth paying.You can feel what the pilots on the missions felt though their stories on the missions that they flew.

Steven Mackintosh is quite good as the transgendered person and Rupert Graves is dynamite as he is in everything he does.If there is a problem with this film, it's that it seems to be preaching a bit more than I think it should.

Ms. Stevens has done a fantastic job of portraying the real persons of Regency England and the society that ruled them, all with a wonderfully humorous and sympathetic touch. As a student and author of the Regency era myself, I was absolutely delighted, after approaching the book with skepticism. It has made me retract all my nasty comments against mystery stories that use real historical figures as detectives. Terrific work, Rosemary Stevens!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Beau, please!","review":"For serial readers like me, coming to the end of a first book in a series and not being able to wait for the next one...well, that's pure fun! I loved this first book about sleuth and snappy dresser Beau Brummell. You CAN write a mystery that is fun, fresh and entertaining as well as having a great plot. Rosemary makes the Regency period come to life--warts and all--and with supporting characters like Robinson the butler (some of the scenes about Beau's \\"dressing hour\\" cracked me up to the point of tears) and a mysterious visitor from Siam, the book rolls right along. The mystery part of the story is very well done as well. Kudos! On to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Enchanting Beau Brummell","review":"I was totally caught up in \\"Death on a Silver Tray\\" from the very first page. My usual mystery reading revolves around medical and techno thrillers, so this was a completely different read for me and I loved it. Rosemary Stevens has brought Beau Brummell to life and beautifully depicts the Regency era of England. Brummell's character kept my attention. I stopped thinking of him as a superficial fashion confection and came to see him has a true and loyal friend to those he cares about. What I especially enjoyed is the way he deftly and subtely insulted those who are overbearing and arrogant, with them smiling all along!This was a fast, fun read filled with great humor and the killer is a complete surprise. I was way off base with my suspect. I'm actually looking forward to the next Brummell installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice glasses","review":"I bought the glasses for my son and he really likes the way they fit. great price for a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for a DigiTech JML2 JamMan Stereo Looper","review":"To get the full functionality out of the JamMan, my son needed this switch.Like all of the DigiTech pedals and switches, this one is well-built and sturdy.My son is still integrating the use of the JamMan into his music and it and the three-button switch have only just been added to his pedal board. But we expect this combo to last YEARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"This a a great item to have combined with my Jam man solo.

Beware of bad design...","review":"I had mine for 1 week before it fell off the keychain shell and is now lost with my data. It is not permanently attached to the swivel shell. Only buy this if you are NOT going to take it with you. Also, record the serial number which is on the drive itself so that they may replace it for you if you do lose it. The barcode is useless and the s/n is not anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lingo Voyager 12 is great.","review":"The Lingo Voyager 12 is easy to use, flexible and powerful - yet still small and lightweight. An extremely nice feature is the ability to use any of its languages as the base language, not just English. The screen is large and easy to read. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 is that the spoken voice is a bit difficult to understand if you don't already know the language. However, the included earbud helps with that. Overall, I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not give the gender of nouns","review":"I bought this to help with my French studies prior to moving to Paris. I quickly discovered that the translations do NOT give you the gender of nouns. If you have ever studied French (or German, Italian, Spanish...), you know how important this is.If your intended use is trying to figure out the meaning of words on a sign or menu, this will serve you well. If you are trying to actually learn the language, look elsewhere.I will be returning this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome football(soccer) movie","review":"I love this movie, yeah it was predictable but it was funny, entertaining, and heart-felt. The main character is a loser but lovable, his mom a typical single working parent, his coach a washed up has been, his father figure married to another woman but loveable nontheless, but my favourite character would have to be the boyfriend with his \\"Kung Fu\\". You may have to watch this movie 2 or 3 times to understand what they are saying but all in all its a good movie. If you liked Billy Elliott then you'll love this movie. Also if you are a Man. City fan of course you'll love Jimmy Grimble. Also there is a sample of the movie in Matthew Good's avalanche"},{"rating":"2","title":"People \\"get\\" TOC at different levels","review":"This book separates those readers who get TOC at a deep level from those who don't.

Poorly written, repetitive, full of irritating conversational tics, it is a poor source for students of Goldratt's innovative thinking on manufacturing systems. I picked it up second-hand since it is out of print, but now regret it. There are much better books on TOC, information systems design and scheduling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, noisy and confusing finish","review":"Goldratt starts the book with a solid and useful explanation of TOC.

Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz on Stage and Screen to 1939) is an amazingly well researched and thorough piece of work by archivist Mark Evan Swartz. This piercing view is directed at the 1902-3 stage version and the three subsequent incorporations of the story into the silent movies, often rather loosely incorporated in odd and often surprising ways for those familiar only with the book. All of these versions of Baum's first book have fallen out of public consciousness, pushed aside, as it were, by the memorable 1939 film verion (the version that remained the truest to the spirit and not just some of the ideas of the book). Concepts from the previous incarnations do leak into the 1939 movie and it is fascinating to watch this evolution. This is a tremondous piece of research that is a must for fans of Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, but no","review":"Everything you've ever wanted to know about Baum's Oz career, written, alas, by a perfectly dreadful stylist who can't synthesize information, can't shape a thought, and, basically, can't write.The photos are nifty, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Perfection","review":"We use this text to teach a course on color therapy and how these vibrations affect the mind, body and spirit.

He has other scenerios too where it takes forever for them to play out. Then they play out to a dead end. When the next scenerio came about I knew I was being taken for a long ride to no where.I read Frankenstein and The Face which he wrote, and they were good. This book almost made me feel as if he didn't write it. Yeah, it had that bizarre factor to it, but there was something missing. I mean, I could skip 3-4 pages and not miss anything in the book's plot. That's not good!I also have his second book out, the sequal, Seize the Night, but I wonder if I should really even begin to read it if it is any way similar to Fear Nothing. I can only hope that whatever problems came about with Fear Nothing with this Chris Snow do not reappear in Seize the Night, because if they do, I'm outta here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...literally , I threw it in my garbage","review":"Admittedly, this is/was my first attempt at reading Koontz. I normally don't read this type of fiction, but wanted to try something light and he is an author whose name I've heard a lot but never read.If ever there were an argument to be made for book burning 'Fear Nothing' is it. It will better serve you getting your fireplace started, or possibly propping up a wobbly table at the annual Spaghetti Dinner held by your local Knights of Columbus.This reads like the first draft of something written over a sleepless weekend by some tool who read some horror novel and was suddenly inspired to pursue writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from the king.......","review":"Mr. Koontz has done it again. Although not his scariest book to date, he has raised his prose to a new level with more characters we empathize with, and plot development that keeps the pages turning. It's as if he took the cast of \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and turned them into a street gang. I'm just disappointed that we Koontz fans will have to wait another year for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Nothing, then Fear Everything","review":"This was my first Koontz novel, and I must say that it did frighten me. When you are first reading it, you will be saying to yourself, \\"what is going on? Why are these strange things happening? What kind of a person could do this?\\" After learning the answer, you will fear for the photo-sensitive hero. You will know how close he came to death, and be truly afraid to venture out at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"weirdo walks by night with his animal pals","review":"If you liked Watchers by Dean Koontz, don't read Fear Nothing. You'll be very disappointed.A daylight impaired hero, his cardboard girlfriend, and his noble canine companion. The dog is by far the most interesting character.A quick nod to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, a few psycho cops, a surfer dud (whoops, dude) with rilly rilly bad dialogue and of course, something EVIL going on in the old lab down the road. Don't bother, just go read Watchers again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear Nothing, Dean Koontz, eBook","review":"The story was OK, though I prefer Odd Thomas... The problem was the eBook / Kindle edition was almost painful to read due to the double spaced lines. Blech...UPDATE....I was very new to Kindle when I wrote the above review and now know how to adjust line spacing. Still not overly impressed with the story, but I'm so taken with Odd Thomas that it may well be biasing my opinions of other work by Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear this","review":"Dean Koontz does write very suspensful books and creates good characters. Yet this book is'nt suspensful and the characters are perfect examples of modern morality. This is anouther one of Dean's book's where he is fantasising about being a 28 year old cool dude. Yet I don't know where he gets the idea that the banter he creates between characters is 'cool'. Koontz idea of what is popular and right makes me sick at times, merely for the complete simplisity of this man's world veiw. You read Koontz for suspense, to forget about the world and immerse yourself in his well developed characters. None of this happened in Fear Nothing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You have nothing to fear, sensational characters, great book","review":"This is a sensational book due mainly to sensational characters. A small American town has some weird happenings going on with people being killed. A lot of this book takes place at night time due to the fact that one of the main characters has a skin conditionnot allowing him to be out in the day. The police seem a little to well funded then they should be for an FBI investigator there to find answers. Why is a doctor visiting so many patients? Why are the town's people changing? Why is a little girl afraid of her parents all of a sudden?This is a sensational thriller. You'll keep turning the pages wanting to know what will happen next. The pace doesn't drop until the last page. You have to buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"be prepared to do lots of skimming","review":"I have read many of Dean Koontz's books, and have enjoyed most of them, even though a lot of his novels story lines are so similiar you have a hard time remembering which story line was from which novel. Fear nothing had all the classic Koontz ingredients: A young aspiring writer, his love interest, his \\"chuffing\\" dog, and a government conspiracy. This novel just didn't cut it for me. I found myself speed reading most of it, too much description and scene setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it! Can't wait for the next one!","review":"One of the better books I've read this summer. I like the surfer talk and the descriptive writing in this book. The details were cool and thoughtful. ***** I oredered another novel called, 'The Fist of God' by A.T. Nicholas that was really great. It has a good -vs- evil plot and some cool twists and subplots. Both books are great reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Nothing this book is worth the money","review":"The beginnig is a simple introduction to Christopher Snow life, and after around 3-4 pages the drama begins. I feel that this book is worth all the money that it is going for, because you will sitting there continously reading hardly ever wanting to put the book down. The only problem I had with this book was the ending I feel Mr. Koontz could have developed the ending a little better. Other than that I had no problems with this book. I finished it in 4 days in it usually takes me around a week to two weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! 5 star ratings are from wyvern mutants.","review":"The most fearful thing about this book are the 5 star ratings. I've been more frightened by cartoons. I have to admit I liked the story line, but there was very little tension to keep this story moving. \\"Watchers\\" and \\"Intensity\\", this book is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUMMER DUD!","review":"Too different for me. The surfer stuff bugged me. Give me the old Koontz style. But I do have something positive to say. I bought two books from Amazon last month, and the other one was killer! It's called, 'The Fist of God' by A.T. Nicholas. It's an awesome 'good against evil' story with some cool twists. This book has a great plot and sub-plots. I was very happy with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm still waiting for the \\"Daylights to be scared out of me\\"","review":"I was given this book by a coworker, who highly recommended it. I kept reading to the end, in hopes of finding what she found so thrilling in it. I was very disappointed, to say the least. I did find the humor given to Christopher Snow, made the book more enjoyable, along with his view of his limitations, enlightening. I was left feeling two days of my time lost in reading too many boring, monotonous details. The author could have left out over half the details, cut to the chase, and written half the book, and MAYBE, it would have been more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adventurous at the beggining, and then a slow paced climax!","review":"This book was very disappointing! It lacked intensity, and could've had a better storyline. It took you so high in the beggining,that you had no place left to go but down. Very bad first impression!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Like many of the readers who reviewed this book, I'm a great fan of Dean's (at least 20 paperbacks from half-priced books). However, this book seems to continue a disturbing downhill trend in his writing (& I paid $20 for this at the supermarket); books like \\"Tick Tock\\" and \\"Sole Survivor\\" were also badly written. There is hardly any character development other than that of Snow's in this latest book; I've always enjoyed the insights into the characters of his villains in his older books --- nothing here however. I'll give my hardcover away to anyone who wants it. A poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear nothing as bsd as tick tick tick thats bad.","review":"To much nonscence it just go'es on and on and there is nothing to the story. you don't know much more when you're finished than you did at the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a \\"wanna-be-like-Chricton\\" all the way through.","review":"I kept thinking through this entire novel Koontz was trying to one-up Chricton on technical and social commentary. Entertaining to a point, but the surfer stuff was getting a little ridiculous. I prefer a great deal of \\"well, maybe that could happen\\", but this had something missing. Certainly, Koontz is a talented writer with many accomplishments. Try another Koontz before this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good character development with an interesting plot.","review":"This is a first time read of a Koontz novel and I would probably read another. I liked the character development of Chris, his canine hero, Bobby, and Shasha. There are several places where the story drags, and vocabulary is used in some instances that might stop the reader, long enough to figure out what was meant, causing them to loose the flow of the story line.The ending sort of left things up in the air for me and there was no closure to the problem. Perhaps Koontz is leaving room for a sequal. Overall I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read, if you understand the idea","review":"I read the reviews here before I bought the book, I thoughy twice before buying it. after reading it, I want to come back and say, \\"those of you whining about too much description and not enough violence, get a clue!!!\\" The book is first person through a man who studies poetry! Of course it's descriptive. I found the book very engaging and have read all the Koontz books. I put this behind Watchers and infront of Midnight. Very good reading, buy it own it read it. and if you're reading this Mr. Koontz, nice work... now get offline and write as I'm patiently waiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read. Yep!","review":"I'm a huge Koontz fan and have read every one of his books. I must say this book wasn't his best, but I can still recommend it. Though, it doesn't come close to \\"Watchers\\" and \\"Sole Survivor.\\" \\"Dark Rivers of the Heart\\" was the best for characters, plot development, and action. Dark Rivers, a thriller-conspiracy novel is a lot like the new Steiger book, Alien Rapture which is selling faster than they can print it. Steiger, like Koontz in Dark Rivers, has created a masterpiece and the story is spellbinding and a page turner. All this said, Koontz is such a superb story teller and one of the best in this genre. It's still a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This, in my opinion, is the least interesting and most contrived novel Dean Koontz has written to date. Neither the story nor the characters were believable, in contrast to many of his earlier works. Inconsistencies abound. For example, the main character is described as not knowing much about firearms, and later in the story proceeds to describe a certain weapon and its characteristics in detail. I usually enjoy Mr. Koontz's technical explanations, but I don't think he researched the scientific nuances for this plot very carefully. Also, I think he would do well to have main characters closer to his own age. Despite all this, as a loyal fan, I will purchase his next novel as soon as it appears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I had just finished reading an older book by Koontz with the dog Einstein - thoroughly enjoyable. This book went no where very slowly. Like many readers I kept waiting for something to take off or explain something about the story. The only thing this story did was mention Einstein and go no where. Twenty pages from the end I was still waiting and now that I have finished, I wonder why I even bothered reading the book. Cover said \\"best he has ever written\\" - not so, probably the worst. I have two more books by Koontz to read, older ones since I have read all the recent books by Koontz. He is usually very strange and very enjoyable to read. Fear Nothing was a real let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money...","review":"A story that was scattered without the first hint of mystery. I turned the pages because I believed the story was bound to take off at some point...I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Read","review":"If you like Stephen King and Robert McCammon or just like horror books you will like this book. Just be forwarned that you cannot read too many of Dean Koontz's books in a row or you will become bored. All Koontz's books seem to follow a pattern; A guy ,a dog, a best friend, sometimes a girl and something very creepy. I have not read any of Dean Koontz's novels in many years so I found this book refreshing and I also like the first person format that he used. I found this to be a very fast read. I am looking forward to reading this books sequel, SEIZE THE NIGHT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissaponited","review":"I am a huge fan of Dean Koontz but after reading books like Sole survivor and intensity i cant help feeling dissapointed. The characters are well developed with the main one Being Bobby who has a dog called Orson (who likes to drink beer) and his girlfriend Sascha who is also a deejay. The story is a bit too lose for my liking the story develops well with you finding out his father and the suspicious circumstances but then the story falls flat on its back. I would read this book again as i am a huge fan of Dean Koontz and own nearly all his books, but it wouldn't be the first on my list"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Nothing? Not After Reading Koontz","review":"Dean Koontz has written any number of superb suspense novels and this is one of the best. He has wonderful characters, tight yet almost poetic prose, an incredible plot and suspense galore. I won't go into the plot, really don't want to spoil it for other readers. Guess it's impossible to rate Koontz's books but Watchers is a great favorite and so was Phantoms. This book is just as strong as those two.It's also one of the few books that Koontz writes in the first person. Christopher Snow is a one of the finest characters in all of Koontz's fiction.The author is so skilled that the reader does believe every aspect of the plot and it is chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a Hit","review":"Dean Koontz can definitely let you down sometimes with his far fetched ideas that don't always mesh well. However, in the book Fear Nothing, I have to say that Koontz hit the mark by combining the improbable/impossible in such a way that one expects that it could, perhaps, even be real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear Something- This Book","review":"I am actually a big fan of Dean Koontz's work. Unfortunately, many times I find his writing to be uneven. One book will blow me away, and the next will have me vowing that I will never read one of his books again. Fear Nothing falls into the latter category. This book is just too boring and predictable. If this had been my first time reading Koontz, I'm not so sure there would have been a second time. If you want to read a Dean Koontz book try Phantoms or Whispers. Only after reading one of those far superior books will you be able to forgive Koontz for this one. Skip Fear Nothing and come back to it after you have read all of Koontz's other work. Better yet re-read them all a second time and save yourself the bother of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear Something","review":"Fear this book. Once again Koontz foists his own paranoid \\"the goverment is out to get us\\" fantasies on his readers. This book is full of tortured metaphors and hollow sounding \\"surfer speak\\". If not for the dog, Orson, the thing would be a total loser. As it stands it's packed full of useless musings and slow-paced \\"tension building\\" that could easily be cut. As it stands the book is bloated by 200 pages.Fear this book. Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear nothing because nothing happens","review":"Suspense lingers too much as promised in the cover reviews so one turn pages and pages expecting a twist but nothing happens.

It took over half the book for the plot to really kick in and nothing exciting happened until the last 50 pages. Even then, the \\"excitement\\" was pathetic and sad.

However, I don't think I can stand to read another 400+ pages on a 12 year old reading level."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great author repeating himself","review":"I used to be a HUGE fan of Dean Koontz. Some of his early novels created a truly new horizon for sci-fi/action. Unfortunately it is now obvious that Koontz needs a new source of inspiration. This \\"Watchers\\" part 2 could have been great if the author had been able to develop his story more around the challenges of a disabled person than using the old \\"talking dog\\" story.Endless descriptions render the story painful to read. You'll be waiting a lot for meaningful action."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am still amazed at how shallow and plotless this book was.","review":"I am one of Dean Koontz most avid reader. I have always bought his books without even reading what it was about. This book has me in shock still...it was so drawn out and dull I didn't even wish to finish it cause I really didn't care what happened to the main character. I will let this one slid by and remain a loyal reader but please Mr. Koontz write like Mr. Dean Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read \\"watchers\\", you've basically read this book.","review":"With the exception of the lead character having a physical disability, this book is pretty much the same as \\"Watchers\\". Koontz even made the two animals characters the same, one a super intelligent dog who is definitely man's best friend, the other a rage-filled monkey and his buddies intent on killing all humans. The writing is way too verbose, with Koontz over-describing everything from the color of the leaves on the trees to the way the wind blows through the grass. He could have cut out about 50 pages and it would have been the same book. I'm a big Koontz fan, and I'd have to say, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time or money","review":"I have read all of Dean Koontz's books and I must say that this is by far the worst by him that I've ever read (yes, worse than Tick-Tock). Normally a superb author, Koontz just really didn't seem to put much effort into this novel, which left me exasperated to say the least. If you want a good thriller from Koontz don't read this, try Watchers or Strangers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't see the story for the description.","review":"I love Dean Koontz. I have read everything he has done. BUT, this one was a challenge for me. There was so much description that it was hard to get into the story. I know that Christopher Snow, Bobby Halloway, Sasha Goodall and Orson are real (as per the authors note)and there could have been a very good story here but I lost interest when Mr. Koontz kept describing every little thing. Please Mr. Koontz, cut back on the filler and give us more of the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in my top 10 of Koontz books","review":"Dean Koontz is my absolute favorite writer, but I was dissapointed with \\"Fear Nothing\\".

The plot is thick with twists and turns. Keeps you reading from cover to cover. I didn't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing read.","review":"This is not \\"Intensity\\"!! No doubt many readers bought \\"Fear Nothing\\" thinking this would contain the fast-paced thrill ride \\"Intensity\\" was. Instead, \\"Fear Nothing\\" is a solemn journey through a small, strangely tweaked town on the California coast. Koontz's descriptive narration is especially inviting as it takes the reader deeper into the mind of the lead character Chris Snow, while also throwing in a few high suspense moments. Yes, there are many aspects of the plot that are quite similar to past Koontz books. But those similarities are the characteristics of Koontz's books I find especially worth reading. I recommend reading this book with the knowledge that this is a story...not a carnival ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disapointing Introduction to Dean Koontz's Works","review":"This was my first introduction to the writings of Dean Koontz. After the first few chapters I was bored and put the book away. Thought it was a waste of time. Having read several reviews of his other works, especially \\"Watchers\\" I bit the bullet and deceided finish \\"Fear Nothing\\". Perhaps I was not familiar with his overly long discriptive style and the lack of action or suspense. I just wanted to get this \\"night\\" overwith. I now have something to base his other works on and in comparing this book to the \\"Watchers\\" is like night and day. Not recommended as a first read of his works."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best effort","review":"I can't believe this isn't one of his first books. Generally you begin to care for the characters pretty quickly - not so in this one. We just weren't given very much information until the end and at that point I was simply glad to be through it. I usually can't put a book of his down - this one was put aside for days. I was disappointed in Dean for what I felt was ripping off Watchers, and when it became so blatant that he was doing exactly that , he just tried to explain it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and mysterious","review":"I started to read this book at night before going to sleep. Needless to say, I couldn't put it down and my heartbeat was racing so fast I eventually had trouble falling asleep. The plot focuses on a boy with a pigment disease who can only come out into the world at night. He discovers a whole underworld of life in his small town and it is interesting to see who is involved and who isn't. The basis is on genetics and it is scary that it really could happen. I would definately recommend reading this story. It will make you look over the side of the bed at night to make sure nothing is there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Koontz's usual, but still exciting","review":"Wow, this book is DKs first attempt at writing first person, and in my opinion he does it very well, this nook is what most readers expect when they read dean koontz and i beleive that that is why i didnt get great reviews, this book is much more science fiction than it is horror or suspense, it follows a character named chris snow around moonlight bay california. well written and just as exciting as any other, i recomend that any reader who enjoys koontz or science fiction, to give this book a chance, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Beginning, Too Wordy","review":"This is the 1st Koontz book I read. I enjoyed the beginning of this book and the main character's youthful exploits were interesting. Then, it seemed to drag after that. I found myself skipping all the overly descriptive parts and just searching out the dialog. It is weird that the next Koontz book I read (The Watchers) would deal with pretty much the same subject matter. What are the odds?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and interesting plot. Held my attention to the end","review":"The book started a little slow, but once it got going, the travels of Chris Snow, in the two nights the book takes place, held my attention completely. In places Koontz got a little over discriptive, but generally the book read well and was fun. I would recommend the book for anyone who likes some sci-fi type plots and who likes to see the good guy win in the end; at least the end of this book anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"Everyone must go out right now and by this book. Right when I started to read, I could not put it down until the end. And you wouldn't believe who the killer is. This book is so suspenful and very, very funny. A must read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"to fluffy for me, try Phantoms instead","review":"When I first picked up this book, I made the unfortunate mistake of reading the quote on the front cover that said \\"Fear Nothing will make you fear almost everything.\\" I assumed('nother mistake) that this book would be a somewhat intense or dark journey into a fantasy world rich with horrifying creatures and mind bending enigmas. What I found inside was,in my opinion of course, a fluffy childrens tale about a man and his dog. Sure there were mysteries to be solved, but I began wondering if Koontz had read to many \\"Encyclopedia Brown\\" books as a kid. If you want to read a better attempt at dark and intense, try \\"Phantoms\\" also by Koontz. He has the right idea in that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How long can one night be?","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I have enjoyed Koonz in the past, and look forward to enjoying him again, but this was not one of those books. My biggest problem centers around just how long one night can be! If I were to do all of the things Snow does in this book in one night, I would have about 2 minutes for each thing. Snow apparently had approximately 36 hours in one night! How unrealistic! It was kind of like watching Die Hard 2--the one set in the airport. No matter how good the movie(it wasn't very good), there was just no way Bruce Willis could be in all those places in such rapid succession. The same goes with this book. It does help a little to know that this book is part of a trilogy. That does explain the ending. I will probably read the next one just to find out what happens to Orson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous","review":"I find Koontz to all to often be hit or miss. This is clearly a miss. I found myself wanting to tear pages out of the book. This book is a Koontz metaphore collection. Constantly droning on and on with one descritive metaphore after another. Get to the story. This was a 10 page short story dragged out to fill a book. The overall premise is okay and I did finish the book to see how it ended. But with the hit and miss record and poderous page filler I think this will be my last Koontz book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Bust","review":"Horrible book. It gets an F. A guy with a weird genetic disease is on to some government genetic thing gone wrong. Ends up in a big shoot out involving lots of monkies. Is this for real? What a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"a seat of your pants ride!!!","review":"Koontz is finally back on track! With the exception of INTENSITY his last few books have been lacking \\"something\\". Not so with FEAR NOTHING, the ingenious plot kept me riveted. Chris Snow is a great protagonist. I didnt care for the surfer dude lingo, and even though it is bk 1 in a trilogy the ending could have had more closure. I cant wait for bk 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disapointment.","review":"I've been a fan of Koontz's earlier books and had stopped reading his most recent ones, which were not close to the suspense and character development as his earlier ones. I was quite disappointed with \\"Fear Nothing\\", especially after hearing good reviews of it. I think that the pretense of the story was promising, but most of the book was spent in Mr. Snow's mind, trapped among endless questions and thoughts. The plot dragged on and on and by the time you got to the middle of the book, you were yearning for some kind of knowledge. I wished Mr. Koontz spent more time and detail about the actual experiments and about \\"becoming\\", instead of beach lingo, and empty characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book very much.","review":"Fear Nothing is one of Koontz's best books in a long time. It kept me riveted (especially the scene in Angela Ferryman's house) and was very chilling at times. Koontz seems to be back on a good track, and most people will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe he tried too hard to sequel \\"Watchers\\"","review":"A very good read, but it was easy to spot story lines from other Koontz novels and (disturbingly) a term that was associated with Stephen King's \\"The Tommyknockers\\" (\\"becoming\\"). Putting those minor flaws aside, Koontz has created a very good book. \\"Fear Nothing\\" feeds you enough information to keep you wanting to read, unlike \\"Sole Survivor\\", where everthing is explained at the end. All in all, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was too complex &made you wonder \\"why is he doing this?!\\"","review":"The book was extended and had alot of uneccesary details I beleive. In the book Christopher Snow did alot of things that I beleive were dumb or he really shouldn't have done if he had any right mind.The book in a whole was good at the beginning ,dragged through the middle, and had a pretty pointless end. I had to do a book report on it and realized how outlandish this book really was when summarized."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring I could barely finish..","review":"I read Koontz a lot as a teenager and really loved his stuff, but this book was so boring and so unlikely that I had to force myself to finish it. There was absolutely nothing to fear in this book because it was just plain stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"The characters were good. But I didn't like the story. Koontz builds the characters, describes the setting. But the story never kind of starts. When I finished the book I thought is this it? Nothing more? Just when the action started? I got the feeling the author must have got tired of writing this book and decided to abruptly terminate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book Kontz ever wrote","review":"I am a great fan of Dean Koontz and have read every book he has ever written, but Fear Nothing was garbage. He must have phoned it in. It took over two months to finish, instead of not being able to put it down, I couldn't pick it up. He left too many loose ends, there was too much filler narrative about nothing, he just ran on and on and went nowhere. I'm sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to try to read, couldn't finish it.","review":"I tried, I really tried. By the time I was half way through this needlessly wordy book I was scanning, seeking the plot through the murk of blather. When I got the basics, with 60 pages to go, I ended the pain. Have no idea how he ended it and don't care to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Poison","review":"RE: UNABRIDGED AUDIO TAPE. I read Koontz's SEIZE THE NIGHT first, not realizing it was a sequel and rathered enjoyed it as a guilty pleasure. Now I find in the tape version of FEAR that there's no place to hide from the narrator-hero's tedious mood-setting, mind-numbing overdescription and maddening reluctance to get to the point of any scene. This apparently passes for suspense-building. I realize now that as a reader I skimmed over all this nonsense in SEIZE, somewhat masking the failure of the book's editors. But no-can-do with the unabridged tape version - one must sit there and take it. Either that or fast forward and risk missing the fleeting pay-off moments. Yes, I understand that thoughtful introspection and eloquent description can enhance great literature. Here it doesn't and this isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"3.5 Stars??? No Way!!!!","review":"Koontz amoung other popular aurthors has fallen into the mode of more quanity and less quality. The main charectors where great but where's the story line? It never go's anywhere nore did it give me anything to FEAR!. Dean Koontz please go back to the quality work we all learned to love and be thrilled by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean is on his way down","review":"This worst book that Dean has written, I have all of his books and enjoyed most of them. His last three books don't hold my interest the way his earlier ones did. I'm not sure if I will read any more of his books or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING TO FEAR","review":"I've given this book a rating of 4, and that's because I'm a fan of Dean Koontz books. Lately he hasn't been writing compelling tales. The story is very long in telling. Once you realize who the bad guys are, you really don't care to finish the story (I did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Dean: Make this a solo, not a trilogy.","review":"I really usually like Dean's novels, but Fear Nothing really stretched my capacity to suspend belief past the breaking point. If I were even close to Chris in affliction or intellectual capacity (a New York Times best seller book), long before p. 225 (on the boat with Roosevelt), I and everyone else we all know would have grabbed a few people by the throats and said: \\"What the hell is going on?\\" Chris is disengenuous; Bobby is a surf-dork without a brain; the dog has some potential, but I'm putting this puppy down now and starting the new Grisham novel. Get a grip, Dean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trucking Through....","review":"Being an avid reader of as many of Koontz's books as I can get my hands on, I have to say that this is very slow material to truck through..I am used to being on the edge of my chair, and waking up with bloodshot eyes because I cant put his books down until the wee hours. This book was a major disappointment, but not enough to keep me from pressing on with his collection..Love Ya Dean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This was an interesting change for Koontz. The gene splicing idea is very 90's. The characters were fun to follow especially Orson. I enjoy Koontz because you never know what to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best characters of any DK book!","review":"I had read Koontz before (Demon Seed, Whispers) but was only slightly impressed. The characters in this book were as realistic as any I've ever read. The book is more Sci-fi than horror. It is spooky first turning to action. I've already read the sequel \\"Sieze the Night\\", and I hope for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZ","review":"I've read many of Mr. Koontz's previous books and this one is a real letdown. Way too slow and really never goes anywhere. Especially frustrating is to find out that this is nothing more than a prelude to the next installment. I really don't care what happens to these so-called \\"real\\" characters. The author at the end of the book says he plans to spend \\"years\\" with these people. That's ok because it will give me a chance to read some other authors until Mr. Koontz gets them out of his system."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL BELOW QUALITY OF KOONTZ'S PAST WORKS!!!","review":"An avid reader of Koontz, this is the first time I have ever been disappointed. I normally read his novels in 2 to 10 days, but this one took about five weeks!! It seemed to promise something, teasing you with suspense, then nothing happened, nothing happened at all. I almost gave it three stars but felt that would be overly generous which Koontz was not with this book. Maybe the sequel will make up for it, will let you know when I get the guts to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"I read the book Icebound and loved it, but this book is no comparison. You find yourself saying \\"Get it over! Solve the mystery already!\\" If you are an avid Koontz reader you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Watchers was my first book by Dean Koontz and I loved it. THis is nothing in comparison. The hero comes across as too sanctimonious,his thoughts are expressed in a way too lenghty and boring for the reader to like him. Definitely, will not read seize the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker!","review":"I kept reading it cuz I thought it would get better. I mean it was a Koontz novel, I like Koontz novels... By the way for those of you who loved it and feel that those of us who hate it just don't like something different... You're right, if I wanted different I would have grabbed a book randomly off the shelf. I wanted Koontz style novel writing. This is not.I'll come here and read reviews FIRST next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH--INSULTING","review":"I have been reading Koontz for at least 10 years. This novel is by far the worst he has written. Dean--stay away from the first person--It gets in the way of the action. Also that surfer language--plastic and cheap. I forced myself to finish this awful book because I didn't want to feel like I wasted my money. Stay away from this title. If you like Koontz, read his last good book, \\"Intensity\\". There's a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think that this was really written by Koontz.","review":"Why does it take so long for this moron Snow to get out of the house on fire? He wasn't familiar with weapons, but he was going to \\"squeeze off a shot\\"? And with a Glock (really hip gun) no less. Why does the author's style suddenly turn surfer-hip when the scene changes to Bobbie's place? Why does the radio station manager, apart from being spectacular looking and referring to main character as \\"Snowman\\" (Hill Street Blues \\"Pizzaman\\"), work the night shift. Whoever wrote this junk should be ashamed and have his or her license to type revoked. One star is one too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky.","review":"A bit more into the conspiracy theory than I would have liked, but Dean Koontz hooks you and holds on fast to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Author/Book","review":"This book was very interesting. Usually I don't like reading but this book made me want to keep on going. It was a little sad but always intriguing to find out what happens next. Dean Koontz words were always welling to pull you in when least expected. He is a great author. I never really read one of his books until now and I regretted what I was missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear What?","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"Fear Nothing\\" it was a great book. I have heard that Dean Koontz was a good author, but I had never read any of his books until now. And I too think he is a good author and I will continue to read his books,(I never thought I would have a favorite author!). \\"Fear Nothing\\" was a very interesting book, it kept me in suspense and I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. The words he uses to describe whats happening makes you feel like you are actually there! I literally got chills while reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"This book didn't have much point to it. I had to force myself to finish it. Although I love most of Dean Koontz books, this one just wasn't a good book. It had interesting parts but most were pointless. If you have never read Dean Konntz, I highly suggest you don't start with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is my book missing some pages?","review":"I love Dean Koontz and his earlier books, they have always been fantastic, I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I read the book, and was so disappointed in the ending...I thought the content was good, but the ending was so abrupt, I thought I was missing a chapter or two. It could've been better, and I hope Koontz gets back his old fire, and stops trying to be so..whatever he's trying to be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This was the first Koontz book I've read, and it was dreadful. I certainly won't read the remaining two books in this series, and it's doubtful I'll attempt to read another Koontz book at all. This is not good writing. The story was not interesting, not entertaining, and simply not scary. Like others have said, I went ahead and finished it just so I wouldn't have wasted the money, but it was no avoiding the waste--it turned into a complete waste of my time. Just because this book is the first in a series doesn't give it an excuse to be this bad. Prologue or no, it's not time well-spent. If you want scary, read McCammon or King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Nothing: A Novel (Moonlight Bay","review":"I gave it a 5 because I couldn't put it down. ONE of his best. I'll never look at monkeys the same way again. This book is for anyone who loves humour & fear in a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his book, but still great!","review":"Although I think this is not Koontz'best book, it's still great. An interesting story, and some nice characters. This book is worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's deja vu all over again!! This reminds me of Mr. Murder","review":"What can I say? Fear Nothing is one of Dean Koontz's best works, no question. I began reading Koontz about three years ago and have gone through about a dozen of his novels. By far the most original of the ones that I have read is Fear Nothing. It's a story of a man faced with nature's adversity-a man plagued by a rare disorder. Supported by a cast of friendly faces, Christopher Snow aka Snowman, seek answers to a bizarre mystery that unfolds in dramatic fashion. It's heart-warming, it's taut, it's definitely Dean Koontz. Try it and you won't regret it. Trust me on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear Nothing, except maybe being bored out of you gourd!","review":"I read the 1st few pages and skimmed the book while at the book stand. I liked the author's writing style and the story line seemed to offer an engrossing read. Unfortunately, when I read on and found that the book's basic theme is \\"science gone wrong\\" and \\"government research project out of control\\", I was really disappointed. There is no real substance or suspense, and I found myself leafing through the last half just to get to the end and get it over with. Borrring !"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ONE OF HIS BEST!","review":"Fear Nothing is the first Dean Koontz novel I've read that has left me feeling a little disappointed. As I read the book, I kept waiting for it to draw me in but that really didn't happen 'till the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will the next book in the trilogy be on the shelves?","review":"Loved Chris Snow and all the excitement and suspense in his life. I'm dying for the second book in the series to come out. Does anyone know when it will appear?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book and loved it.","review":"This book was captivating fom the moment I picked it up. Yes the book has many chapters, but it is a fast reading book and the writing is convincing (convincing as fiction can be). The tail that Christopher Snow and his faithful dog are able to communicate on a level higher than people really communicate with their pets, gives the story an interesting touch. Cool book for those who like the heartpounding excitement of a murder-suspense, and the scientific possibilities of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved Fear Nothing! The only part I hated was having to wait for the next installation. I have been hoping for another book on \\"Watchers\\" but will content myself with \\"Fear Nothing\\" until you come out with a continued story of \\"Watchers\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ENDING SINCE DRAGON TEARS","review":"Okay, I really like Koontz and read all his books. But this time he has gone to far. We not find out nothing about what is going on in Moonlight Bay (Can you say...Midnight)until the last 10 pages. The story itself is stupid and a rehash of 10 Koontz novels. Koontz needs to try and write....ORIGINAl stories. I was soooo disapointed and I yearn for the man who brought us In The House of Thunder... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"Don't listen to the worst of the worst critics Dean!It was excellent.Only those with little knowledge and no intellect at all could bad-mouth your writing..I for one look forward{as always}to the next Koonz book..whether it be the sequel to Fear Nothing,or another masterpiece by the Master of Suspense..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even die hard Koontz fans like myself will be disappointed","review":"This was a relatively interesting, if somewhat wordy, novel until Mr Koontz either ran out of time, paper or interest. The ending is absolutely the biggest let down. What the heck happened? If you really must read this one .....check it out at the Library. that way you will only waste time and not money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear Nothing : A recipe for disaster.","review":"Take one scoop \\"Watchers\\" (genetically engineered superdog). Mix in two quarts of \\"Midnight\\" (good ol' townspeople changing into weirdos with the by-now-familiar sexual aberrations). Add a dash of \\"Intensity\\" (animals out to get hero). Stir in generous quantities of flowery adjectives, fruity adverbs, 'cool' surfer slang and melt-in-your-mouth metaphors. Bake for one night in lukewarm oven. Serves the steadily decreasing population of Dean Koontz fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant surprise","review":"I read this book while in the hospital recovering from a severe bout with pneumonia. I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled when my mother brought it in for me, as I'd read some Koontz in the past and did not enjoy it. However, I had quite a bit of free time on my hands and nothing else to do with it, so I gave it a try.It was (thankfully) unlike anything of his that I'd read before. The characters were very three-dimensional and it was easy to empathize with them. The plot was intriguing and artfully disclosed, as well as suspenseful and spine-tinglingly spooky. I had nightmares about monkeys for several days after reading it!I would recommend Fear Nothing highly, even to people who aren't fans of Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much imagery and too many side-journeys","review":"Vivid imagery and philosophical side-journeys can be good, but when overused, can dramatically slow down suspense. Sadly, this book is laden with things that slow the book almost to a crawl. I kept wanting to skip over long sections--several pages at a time--just to get back to the real action. I am writing a novel myself, and this book taught me what NOT to do. Also, I've decided that plots like this one are a bit too evil for my taste; I prefer plots with wholesome messages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell him, already!","review":"This is one of those books that annoys. There is a secret in Moonlight Bay. It involves Chris Snow's past, present, and future. Conveniently, he doesn't feel compelled to ask many of those who might enlighten him. Or, when he does ask, the other characters talk around the secret or tell him he doesn't want to know (which he seems to accept). This all seems to be the author's device to maintain this story as a novel instead of novella (or short story). I found it frustrating and hoped for more twist and turns. Instead, it is Chris searching for the answer to the secret and being thwarted by his \\"I'm too cool to ask\\" or by those who seem motivated not to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which is Worse?That This Was Published/that People Like it","review":"This was the worst commercialized crap I've actually managed to read. I have loved some Koontz Novels, and disliked others, but none have earned as much loathing as this. The human interest part of this story was blown up way out of preportion (nothing new to Koontz), and the plot was obnoxious. I'm sorry, but super-itelligent psychotic killer monkeys is far too 50s-pulp-horror for my stomach to handle without getting sick. Not to mention how slow and dull the reading was between attacks of the mutant monkeys. Silly little book ought to be a sci-fi thriller for three year olds; though of course, you'd have to edit and tone done some of the scenes first; the watching of a cremation, for example. Anyway, do your brain cells a favor and pass this one by. If you actually enjoy it, then you would also like the mindless comercial tripe of Danielle Steele and Mary Higgins Clark; in which case, I pity you and the state of literacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Every situation is contrived","review":"While I loved INTENSITY, the premise of this one did not ring very true. I didn't feel like even Koontz felt much for his main character. The character's disorder felt like it was contrived so that Koontz could keep the action after dark. Every \\"twist\\" in the plot felt manipulated, and the dialogue (especially between Snow and his surfer friend) was horrible.Read INTENSITY. Then move on to other authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but dont waste time with Seize the Night","review":"As a huge fan of the book Watchers, the parallel in the two books was clear and overall this was a good book.The characters are somewhat interesting and the genius/killer monkeys were an interesting touch. Koontz has really used the genetic engineering aspect to the breaking point; If he continues to write with this idea then his novels will surely suffer. He also has overused the rogue Government agency idea, he needs a new angle. The book had some good aspects and was fairly enjoyable but not one of his best works.By the way, avoid Seize the Night, it was just a lame attempt at a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your All Insane","review":"To give this book anything less than 5 stars should be the eighth deadly sin. This book was great the story line was fantastic and the characters were more real than any ive come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"fear this book!","review":"By far, the worst Koontz book I've ever read. I did force my way through it but it was difficult. I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. Maybe \\"Lightning\\" by Koontz is a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your money","review":"I have heard so much about Dean Koontz that I thought I ought to give the author a try. Ok, so I tried and it is awful. Not only is the 'suspense' predictable but the author tries to impress the reader with off-the-beaten-track vocabulary and it comes across as extremely contrived. Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"Sorry Dean, but this book was just not up to your usually great works. I've been a fan a very long time, have read all your books, but this one just didn't cut it, the last 3rd of the book was when the story got going. Don't think I'll bother with the 2nd part. \\"INTENSITY\\" was GREAT so I know you've got what it takes, please try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Boring!!!!!!!!","review":"You can't compare this book with Watchers, simply because Watchers is a great book, and this one is awful!! Very wordy, too much detail (as usual), I could not get into this book. No more Dean Koontz books for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE AFRAID OF THE DARK","review":"I read this book over a weekend and purchased the sequel before the weekend was out. This book and it's sequel worked my nerves and can't wait for the next book to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"KOONTZ SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF","review":"Just a terrible book. If it wasn't Koontz, I don't think a first time author would even get this published. Don't get me wrong, I like Koontz, (Strangers is one of my favorite books), but this book can only be described by one word. BORING. - which is the worse possible adjective for a novel. I hope puts more effort into his next effort for his fan's sake. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his most lovable characters","review":"Christopher Snow is one of Koontz's most lovable & memorable characters. And that's saying alot because Koontz has written many novels & all with great characters!!Imagine living with XP, not being able to go into the sunlight. That in itself is a scary thought, leaving you feeling trapped. No imagine someone is trying to kill you.This is one of Koontz's best books. Go out & get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!!","review":"This was the first Koontz book I read and I could not put it down. The characters were brilliant and I particularly liked Orson, the dog, and the main character Snow. This story is very, very original and filled with plots, intrigue and secrets, all hidden in the quiet town of Moonlight Bay. Well done Koontz, you've outdone yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst koontz book of all time","review":"I love deans books, but this one is so boring, I really found it hard to finish it and it was not memorable"},{"rating":"2","title":"FEAR ITSELF!","review":"What can I say....I was hooked from page 1.An intriguing and satisfying read. I would thoroughly recommend to anyone to read this book, whether they are a fan or not!If you read this one you HAVE to read the follow up book Seize The Night - it answers a lot of questions from this book.Finally, ENJOY this EXCELLENT bookP.S. worry if the Wyvern monkey troop appear at your local supermarket! - it will all become clear if you read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean Koontz has gotten on the wrong track.","review":"I love Dean Koontz novels and have read all of the ones I can find. But this one just pissed me off. How can you go back to a town that was haunted by weird super race people that became their computers, a super race, and start a whole new novel. Then this Sieze the Night crap is just making me more angry, because I hate series, I promise I cursed King when he did his Green Mile bull. If Koontz wants to succeed he should write some more of those earlier types of novels, like Twilight Eyes, Strangers, Night Chills, and The Funhouse. Those are his best novels and if he can regain the urge to write more of these, he will become the hottest thing since Brittney Spears. Hey I know I am only fourteen, but I just want to read some more good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Great Entertainment","review":"One of my all time favorite Dean Koontz books. It's one of the best books I have ever read. It is not as scary as it is interesting, the plot falls short of a true ending, however \\"SEIZE THE NIGHT\\" continues the story so that makes it okay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the fear??","review":"I read Dean Koontz to be frightened silly, which he's accomplished in the past pretty regularly. This book was a laugh -- it lacks a truly scary plot, action, and a satisfying closure. If it is just an installment in a series that will all revolve around this same evil, I think he's just writing books to make a buck and that I'll pass on the remaining books in the series. Too bad -- I've always enjoyed his work before."},{"rating":"1","title":"I FEARED THAT IT WOULD NEVER END OR GET TO THE POINT","review":"I have been a Dean Koontz fan for many years, looking forward to the next book. Fear Nothing is my 10th Dean Koontz book so I know how great his writing can be. Unfortunately, in this book, there is no point to the story or the characters. I have no problems with poetic license, understanding the psyche of the characters, or an in depth story, but 300 pages of scenery is excessive. The entire book could have been summed up better as a short story. If you are looking for prime Koontz, read Mr. Murder or Whispers both of which still make me shiver long after I put the books down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit","review":"Dean is back with another hit and one to follow this one. I have recently become a Koontz fan and this is one of the best in his line of many. What is exciting is the upcoming \\"Seize the Night\\" to follow Chris Snow in his adventures. The typical CA life and addition of the dog was great too. For all you dog lovers out there. Get it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once More The Master Suceeds In His Own Dark World","review":"Average rating 3.5 stars? No way This book in essence brings together everything Dean Koontz is good at, the characters, the plot, and the settings. There's also an unmistakable feeling throughout the novel that \\"Midnight Bay\\" is the only place in the world. The thing that most impressed me about this book are the settings and the conversations between Christopher Snow and others - the dark kitchen, the sheriff's car - normally they'd seem cosy but instead there's a perfectly crafted atmosphere that someone is out there watching. All three of the main characters are fascinating Christopher Snow, Sasha Goodall and Bobby Halloway - lets hope that Koontz's hint comes true and we do spend more time with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"eerie transportion into the horror and mysteries of night","review":"An avid Koontz reader, I was taken right beside Snow into the bowels of the abandened military establishment, into a pitch black world. Chased by rhesus monkies, I could smell the rotting flesh, agonized when Bobby was killed. I was maddened when the dog disappeared and was mad at myself for not being able help Snow and his friends in their nightly sojourn. At a most critically, scary point...\\"Snow felt a presence behind him, turned and reaching out, touched...his face.\\" my truck reading light snapped out, plunging me into Snow's dark world. I grabbed my flashlight and continued reading, I couldn't put the book down. I had to get Snow out of there. Koontz takes you places your mind could never fathom. Fear Nothing is emotional and sensitive and transports the reader into his absolute world of darkness. Mr. Koontz, please hurry and write another book, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened!!!!!","review":"Let me first point out that four of my top ten favourite books of all time are written by Dean Koontz. I literally devour his books and they are usually satisfying in a way or another. When I first heard he was working in a trilogy I could not wait to buy my copy of the first volume. But, What a mayor dissapointment!. Difficult to explain , the idea is good and the characters original but nothing in this book is appealing. And that annoying surfing lingo!. This smells to contract obligations. So I will skip the next two and wait for the real Koontz to come back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Good - one star taken off for too much scenery","review":"This is a very good book with a great plot, characters, etc. but some of the descriptions of the scenery and the fog became a little burdensome to read but that's a minor complaint. I think this is better than his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling and fun to read, scary and not without humor.","review":"After a slow start, Fear Nothing became increasingly interesting and frightening. The continual affirmations and surfer lingo might have gotten old after awhile, however, I highly recommend the book. It leaves a lasting memory and raises ethical questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my least favorite books by my most favorite author","review":"I was actually disappointed with this book. I wasn't at all drawn to the characters or hooked into the storyline as I am with so many of his books. I will probably read the sequel despite my less than positive review."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't put it down","review":"I went to camp this summer and I had this book with me. I started it out in the beginnig of camp and finished it all during camp. I sat out of some of the activities just to read this great book. I kept it in my pocket the whole time. I can't wait until Seize The Night comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 'The Stand', but worth a read.","review":"This was about the fifth Koontz novel that I read since running out of Stephen King books, and I have to say that it's not bad for an end-of-the-world-is-coming kind of affair. Intelligent dogs and cats, creepy menacing people, and a secret that could change the face life on the planet combine to form, with Koontz's dry humor, a very compelling tale that made me want to read it in one sitting. I didn't, of course, but it didn't take long. It's the creepy journey of a man who's just lost his second parent and goes looking for answers and finds instead... Well, I'll let you find out for yourself. I loved this book so much that I was praying for a sequel when I finished it. Fortunately, 'Seize the Night' just came out in paper, so if you like this one, you'll want that one. (Review coming soon)"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Only Go Out at Night","review":"Dean Koontz's propensity for creating unusual characters is unequalled. In Fear Nothing, Christopher Snow, due to a rare disorder that renders him fatally sensitive to light, only goes out when the sun goes down. Snow suspects his parent's recent deaths are connected to the secretive genetic work they'd been involved with.Christopher Snow sets out, working only in the dark of course, to find out who is behind it all. What he finds will shock you.Vintage Koontz. You won't be disappointed.Fear Nothing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not one of his best works","review":"The story starts slow, too much descriptive language, and ends without satiating my appetite. It really doesn't explain anything and the ending is quite predictable. Would not recommend. Instead, read \\"Midnight\\" which is one of his best novels yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"My husband and I are big Dean Koontz fans, so I was astonished to hear that he had never read Fear Nothing or Seize the Night! I ordered them for him immediately. The characters are fun and interesting, and the adventures and conspiracies they encounter keep you hooked. Watchers is my all-time favorite, but the Chris Snow books come a close second. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another page-turner with cool characters","review":"I love scary books with humor and Koontz always delivers. You have to adore the characters, especially Orson, the dog/brother. I can't wait to read the sequels just to see what Orson is up to. Plus, I have a feeling (hope) we'll see more of some of the colorful minor players.Overall, I was anxious to see what would happen--some good mystery and suspense here and Koontz does a great job with setting and characterization. (I love the Chris Isaak references, too. Dancin' is playing as I write this!)But, I only gave it four stars because the plot felt a bit stitched together and in some parts, descriptions and back story got rather long and seemed to go nowhere.Still a great read, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeping With The Lights On","review":"Fear Nothing was an explosive fast paced thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the story. This was the first novel that I have read by Dean Koontz but I can defiantly say that it will not be my last. One of the big reasons that I enjoyed reading this novel was because of the way that Dean Koontz describes every scene. Every small detail seems to be written causing you to think twice before you turn off the light and retire for the evening. I am looking forward to reading other novels written by Dean Koontz. I would recomend this book to anyone who enyjoys mystery type thrillers. I gave Fear Nothing a 5 out of 5 stars. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy","review":"I have read many of Koontz's books and found this one to be extremely boring. He could have cut it in half and come to the point sooner. His descriptions were more than I wanted or needed to know in order to tell the story. Go back to writing short stories and forget the novels. Listening to the audio version, I was unable to skim through the descriptions and had to sit through too much muck to get to the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Koontz book I have ever read.","review":"I really look forward to a Dean Koontz book but this book was not worth the time I spent reading it. The book drug and the end was not at all climatic I think this one was wrote only for sake of putting out another best seller with little regard for quality. I hope the next one returns to the fun reads Koontz has given us in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent-Koont's best yet","review":"Fear Nothing is one of Dean Koont'z best novel. It contains lot of suspense, mistery and a great plot. I recommend it to anyone; a Koont'z fan or not. Great work Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the best of Dean Koontz to date!!!","review":"I have liked all of Dean Koontz's books, but this is the best of all. I hope there will be more of Chris Snow & Co. I would love to see where he, Sausha, Orson & Bobby go from here. Thanks Dean for another great read (or in my case, listen). Cynthia Rooney"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever with interesting and complex characters","review":"I am not generally a Koontz fan but this book was quick paced and witty. The book's characters are almost as colorful as those in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. The books maintains a high level of suspense, however, I would not dscribe it as horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz's worst","review":"This in my opinion, was Dean Koontz's worst book ever and I have read everyone of his novels. The characters were lame, the plot bad, and the endig was the worst. Koontz's needs to go back to his Phantoms and Lightning days, now those were great books. If this is gonna be the first Koontz book that you read, then don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The basic plot was good but very poorly developed","review":"The story line had good potential but was never developed. The reader finds himself wading through obscure philosophical discussions that smack of filler in between significant happenings in the life of Mr. Snow. If all of the filler were removed this would actually be a short story. Mr Koontz must have cranked this book out in record short time. While he may be laughing all the was to the bank, anyone who purchased this book was taken. It is one of the poorest books I have read in a long time and definitely not worth reading. If an unkown had sent this book to a publisher it would have been rejected. Mr. Koontz appears to have run out of gas. I will waste no more time on him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping look at the constant battles within ones self.","review":"Dean Koontz, a formidable writer when compared to Stephen King and the like has released another great book. In this tale of mystery, confusion and mental inner battles, Dean has taken the reader through a roller coaster of feelings, thoughts and an adventure that few experience. Put aside the suspense appeal and the mystery of Moonlight Bay and take a look at the importance of Christopher Snow. There is a little (if not alot) of Christopher in each and every one of us. Put yourself in the shoes of the main character, and you will soon realize the appeal of the novel. Also, Mr. Koontz's writing style is a true work of art. His sentences flow with metaphors, similies and accute observations which enrich the content exponentially. This is a must read for any suspense/thriller readers, or for the ones who like twisted plots of deception and murder. Koontz will keep you flipping pages in the early hours of the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"FEAR NOTHING","review":"WHILE THIS BOOK IS GOOD READING, IT IS MERELY THE FIRST PART OF WHAT OBVIOUSLY IS A LARGER BOOK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS HALVED IN ORDER TO SELL TWO BOOKS. THIS BOOK SIMPLY INTRODUCES THE READER TO THE CHARACTERS THAT EXIST IN THE SECOND BOOK,\\"SEIZE THE NIGHT\\". MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO BYPASS \\"FEAR NOTHING\\" AND READ THE MORE DIFINITIVE \\"SEIZE THE NIGHT\\", UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY TO WASTE. \\"SEIZE THE NIGHT\\" IS A MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE AND SCARY BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watchers Recycled (badly)","review":"Well, I just finished \\"Fear Nothing\\" and I thought it was awful. Dean Koontz has written some excellent novels; Watchers, Lightning, Strangers. This was *not* one of them, merely a cheap knock off of some of his earlier work, spliced with howlingly bad surfer dialogue. The surfer dialogue is particularly annoying because it doesn't appear until nearly 150 pages into the book when Christopher Snow meets his surfer friend. After that meeting, bizarre surf metaphors and similes figure regularly into the main character's speech. Forget the lame \\"genetic infection\\" plot, what really scared me was the idea that surfer-speak might be contagious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Poetic.","review":"The story is a good one but in my opinion it is Koontz's worst title. Paragraph after paragraph of lengthly descriptions that beat around the bush. It makes me think that he was trying too hard to be poetic. The situations are described so different than his previous work that I wonder if he wrote this entire book on his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toshiba 17\\" Laptop - NOT","review":"A lot to like about this product - shape, weight, dual purpose plug ... just don't buy it to use in a car with a Toshiba 17\\" screen laptop.

This movie is especially funny because the Gremlins take all these potions that change them. There is the smart one, the gargoyle, the spider, and the lightning bolt. Christopher Lee is in this movie as a crazy scientist. He is funny in that role. If you are looking to be scared, don't watch this movie. If you are looking for a funny movie, try this one out. Make sure to stick around for the ending in the bathroom. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of Funny Jokes","review":"Gremlins 2 is great just like the first.

It was a ridiculous follow up to the destruction of Kingston Falls instead taking place in the Big Apple inside a skyscraper rather than a small town.Billy Peltzer and his girlfriend have moved from their small town to New York, and are working at the same company within a skyscraper. Somehow Gizmo has returned to them, having escaped the clutches of the mad scientist lab in the basement of their same workplace. The story is exactly like the one before, except that the art direction team had a few more liberties and went further with the new cute mogwai, and even greater creativity with the monsterous gremlins. The plot was more overtly campy than the first one, without the slightest hit of a horror movie and just a bunch of screwball comedy antics. Gizmo is still cute, and I still want to squeeze him, but don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I'm not sure why anyone would find this film better than watching the grass grow. It certainly is not better than the first Gremlins film, which was charming, funny, and frankly, a story. Gremiln's 2 relies on cheap call backs from its predecessor, slap-dash antics and the weakest excuse of a story. It just doesn't add up to much. Don't bother with this one, especially if you loved Gremlins 1. Gremlins 2 is a waste of both time and money. Maybe rent it with one hand--and hold your nose with the other. Gremlins 2--you've been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie so much.","review":"The first movie never left much of an impression on me, but this one is just hilarious; even named one of my cats Gizmo in it's honor. It's just as funny seeing it as an adult as it was when I was a little girl. This is my idea of both a babysitting movie & a date night movie.You'll find that you just remember a lot of scenes from this movie, that you'll be humming the background music, 7 that the death of the talking brainy singing Magwai is almost as sad as there not being a 3ed movie.Well, I hadn't seen this in years & I found myself thinking \\"Hey, those Furby things were totally modeled after Magwai\\" & \\"This is what Pokemon would be like as a horror comedy.\\"Fans who prefer 2 over 1 should enjoy Jim Henson's Labyrinth, Child's Play: Bride of Chucky, & Child's Play: Seed of Chucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool !!!","review":"Better than the first.

McGills tombe reads like a clinical diatribe with no humour or pazazz. And for me if stage hypnosis doesn't have that then it has nothing.Much of this book is directly 'borrowed' from the works of Coue, Braid and Eisdale and has little or nothing entertaining in it. The routines are simply banal or unoriginal and much of the history of the art is inacurate at best.I've no doubt that McGill was a wonderful person but his book should pass on as well.

I'm glad they got rid of most of the rap sounds, and kicked in with a more harder rhythm. Even though the only reason they did it is because they got booed off of the Ozzfest stage, but, at least they're still trying. My favorite songs are Decorated, Drowning, Waste of My Time, Battle Cry, and Take it to the Bridge. Which are basically the only songs that sound decent.

The first album was real rap/metal and they came out with some aggressive rap lines backed by some strong distortion and catchy hooks.I was looking forward to this album DarkHorse coming out... when I bought it I was so dissapointed. Their style changed into some teeny-bopping bubblegum pop. They really put their skirts on for this one. The once rough edged hard lined lyrics and guitar chops from the earlier album were replaced by them trying to sing, harmonize and get in touch with their feminine side.Huge disappoinment.

The angry songs aren't angry enough. The sexual songs aren't sexual enough. Basically, it's a big let-down. Crazytown are dead, people.

That CD deserves 4 or 5 stars but this one is a cheapo on 3 counts. Firstly the general quality on this Milan isn't as good as the Teldec, even though it was recorded recently (1996). Secondly the playing time 39'31 is skimpy. Thirdly there are no texts and barely a word on the collaboration between Borges and Piazolla.

We take it on road trips and it never fails to jiggle a tickle when we're all ready for a good laugh.

Many of these tricks are sort of old too, so this book isn't like a collection of all the tricks you know, but rather a collection of classical tricks that you may have never even heard of.

I found that one toy is enough - if the baby likes it he/she will stick to it - so it's a personal choice to get more than one.

Both OUTLAND and HIGH NOON are classics with great casts and well crafted scripts, but DARK DESCENT is a remake of these classics only in the sense that Frankenstein's Monster is a recreation of humanity. Some of the parts are there, but you don't want to take them home. There is a lot of dialogue, none memorable, and little action. The plot pacing favors insomniacs. Many of the actors are unknown even in their own native countries, whatever they may be. Let's not forget the special features, which consist of a menu that offers a single \\"choice\\": \\"play movie\\", thus demonstrating that the menu's only useful function is to demonstrate that it has no useful function.

The acting was minimal but Hurt does a good job of persuading the audience to look beyond the acting skills and fall into the trance of Allison and the mystery surrounding Jody, their young daughter who was in a car accident 6 months prior to the movie.Through each room and each character the movie develops and becomes almost addictive.

Their inaugural disc, Impure, is remarkably un-digital, with a heavy horror influence. Distorted bass, spidery guitar giggles and a percussion array that includes such demented additions as a bent-up one way sign and a provocatively miked water cooler bottle help yield the astonishing result of an ambitious resurrection and update of a sound that peaked in early '80s London. It's a welcome break from over-programmed, over-sampled \\"underground\\" music that's never two steps away from techno, and from so-called alternative music that's hashed from a static formula unchanged since 1989. Evocative and infectious, Impure has a beguiling energy that demands your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautifully written, but not useful for this reader","review":"This cookbook, witty and wonderful as it is, will never be very useful to me. I loved the narrative; I don't think I've ever read a cookbook so intently. However, this book does not suit my needs as a cook. The base ingredients are butter, flour, and sour cream, for instance. As much as I would love to eat liqueur-spiked sour cream-based dishes every night, I cannot. I don't have time, and need a more modern, health-sensitive approach to cooking. The writer's assertion that anything fresh is healthful is not accurate, obviously. I also disagree with the writer that anything combination of ingredients that one comes up with is wonderful...maybe needing only the addition of salt (paraphrase).In short, I guess this cookbook is too sophisticated for me. I consider myself a good cook with eclectic tastes, but apparently I'm not as sophisticated as all that.I find this book entertaining and inspiring to read, but not useful for everyday application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dil Se never arrived","review":"This purchase is not with me...

(A really great scene, by the way!)I already owned the Moserbaer version of this movie before I bought this one, and it's a pretty bad version of the movie. It just seems really cheap, cuts off in places and has their watermark glaringly obvious in the corner the whole time, and also doesn't look very clear.

It is so finicky with paper size that it will constantly give errors of paper not loaded correctly, it will pull the paper from the tray and then give an error that paper is out, with the paper locked under the printer heads. Tried resetting to factory settings, tried messing with the fine tuning, the presets, everything. If you had this set up at home and only did one type of thing with it, maybe it would be ok, but like the other reviewer stated, it is so finicky and difficult I have wasted days of my life just trying to get one decent print out of it.

Courtney Love just wishes she had the talent of Tucker, Kinney and Macfarlane. The gals wax sensitive on \\"good things\\" but create a melodic punk tornado on \\"call the doctor\\", \\"little mouth\\" and \\"i wanna be your joey ramone\\". \\"i'm not waiting\\" is an evocative anthem with some little distorted Butthole Surfer vocals thrown in the mix for good measure.

And you'd never guess that the lineup here is two guitarists and no bassist, because Corin and Carrie work so well together to make such a solid sound.Easily one of my top 10 albums of the last few years, and SK hasn't quite matched it since; in fact, DIG ME OUT, their next album, just plain blows (in fact, I gave it a one-star review on the Amazon site), while THE HOT ROCK has a few good songs but isn't the masterpiece that CALL THE DOCTOR is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye-Opening Book","review":"What a wonderful book.

Peter Wagner and his miriad of followers, \\"prophets\\" and \\"apostles\\", are indeed teaching and promoting the heresy of the New Order of the Latter Rain. If you are a true bibilical Christian please be aware that this stuff is the Apostasy that Jesus Christ and the Apostles (not these \\"apostles\\") predicted would take place long ago. We are commanded by Jesus Christ to reject those who teach things that corrupt the core doctrines of the Faith. Christ and the Apostles warned us many times to stay away from false teachers and false prophets. You need to decide whether to obey the Lord Jesus Christ, or obey these people. Remember that those who say they love the Lord prove that love by obeying His commands.

A must have for cooks (and not so good cooks) alike!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for elementary and preschool music teachers","review":"As a teacher of music students in grades 3-6, I have found this book to be extremely helpful. The games are designed to help students learn to read, write, dictate music, etc. The \\"Blue Jello\\" game and its variations alone are worth the price of the book. Although this is not a band or orchestra method book, students who spend time playing these games will certainly be more prepared when they begin to learn more advanced instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Practical","review":"I agree with the other review in that this book requires way too much preparation before each activity.

They actually make learning theory a fun experience, and the students learn without much \\"teaching\\". The cards are colorful, sturdy, and easy to use. The materials are also very versatile. This method is so successful in helping students learn painlessly, because it uses terms that are familiar and fun to teach the basics to very young children.

Now, however, I have the studio versions of just about all of these songs, and find just about everything on this album lame, and its very existence pointless, with the exception of \\"Kill Your Sons\\" which is actually better than the version on \\"Sally Can't Dance.\\" So, overall, I recommend seeing if you can download an mp3 version of it somewhere, and skipping the rest of this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best guitar-oriented albums ever!","review":"Ah....the magical combination of Lou Reed and the late great Robert Quine changed my life.

I could have done without the falsetto 'do de do de do do de do do' chorus of 'Walk On The Wild Side', but given the amazing, chiming, snarling, living, fire-breathing guitar work throughout it's a very minor annoyance.

It can be a little frustrating sometimes, but that's one thing that makes it realistic. It's really fun when things are going well and you're making serious money as a farmer!The game lasts longer than I thought it would.

I watched the first two episodes of the HBO John Adams and it can't hold a candle (or oil-lamp)to this. Grizzard and Daniels are especially solid, giving two of the best performances ever to be seen on television. PBS would be wise to reprise this series for broadcast.

This series is like watching a historical documentary that was written and produced to be an adapted English Romance novel. The first few episodes are marginal and the series goes down hill shortly after. The makers of this series also need a lesson in lighting. Awkward shadows mixed with ultra bright faces takes the viewer our of the 1800s and into a low budget 1970s studio.

Beyond merely stating the facts, he also punctuates the listings with his own elucidating commentary on characters, actors, set designers, costume designers, with bits of trivia, etc. The text is further buttressed with hundreds of rare, never before seen color and black-and-white stills.

I'm a concept artist and a James Bond fan, so I eagerly anticipated the arrival of this book. When I finally got it, I skimmed through the many pages just to get an initial impression. It wasn't good. I asked myself repeatedly, \\"where's the artwork?\\" -- where's the many conceptual sketches, prop designs, miniatures, paintings, novel illustrations, etc. Don't get me wrong, the book does contain such content, but only to a surprising minimal degree. The book should be more accurately titled, Bond: A Derivative Photo Album. Most all of the content is comprised of snap-shots from newer movies.If you are an artist I would not recommend this.

The program does not correctly run under Windows XP even though it claims compatibility; it will only run as the (administrator) account that installed it. Even Microsoft states that you should not run ordinary applications as an administrator, so I did not test the program any further. Cosmi support was unable to provide a solution to this. Worse, I discovered after the fact that it bundles the Alset HelpExpress adware package, which is installed silently along with PrintPerfect, proceeds to try downloading additional components without any notification, and which is not removed when you uninstall PrintPerfect!

The epispode dealing with the young maid raped and hung for defending herself left a bitter taste in my mouth. It seemed frankly...pointless.The second season went from fair to just plain bad. Two of the characters were switch out with a different actor and actress. The personalities changed dramatically in the husband/wife couple, and the soap opera became boring and unbelievable.

The story was so smarmy and the people in the series are so very unlikable and cruel that it was hard for me to care about the show at all. The Grand bears not the slightest resemblance to Upstairs, Downstairs. In USDS, the servants were part of the family and treated with dignity; however, in\\"The Grand\\" the servants are used and discarded like so many pieces of trash, and as for the owners of the Grand hotel, they are unsavory humans and completely unbelievable.

But, almost each track conveys a number of moods that changes sometimes abruptly, sometimes subtly in the space of that track. More complex than typical film scores, when that sendimental melody rises from the murk, in those moments, you feel the grace of Millie's love with bracing clarity. This balance of love/friendship and deception, pervasive in the music, beautifully evokes those same conflicts in the characters of the movie.

All the same, this looks pretty good. But it is a bit surprisingly weak on cultural or art history. On p. 278 the author asserts that in the Renaissance Tapestry artisans, who he calls \\"weavers\\" were considered mere \\"imitators\\". I think he is pretty misinformed about critical art history, and the pre-eminence of tapestry over \\"cartoons\\" which sadly were often lost because they were of lesser value. He has it the wrong way around. As in so much in religion, the devil and the angels are in the details, and the very arch style of Catholic reasoning often misses what simply, actually went on in history. That raises question of truth, of course, but that is another matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Waste of money: the size is too small and it is not strong for the purpose.

This one happens to be my current favorite because he does mix in several beats that you've already heard (assuming you're an MF Doom fan). I would usually want to hear all different beats, but this is a fantastic compilation of some of his best instrumentals. The mix starts off with the relentless scratching of \\"Saffron\\" (Operation Doomsday title cut), then moves on to the jazz inflicted \\"Arrow Root\\". \\"Coriander\\" is the beat from Doom's cameo on the Monster Island Czars album. \\"Shallots\\" boasts an effective dirty guitar sample nicely. \\"Monosodium Glutamate\\" (\\"Rhymes Like Dimes\\" beat from Operation Doomsday), \\"All Spice\\", and \\"Lovage\\" are smooth and sexy joints. The tweaked out super villain voices and cuts on \\"Red #40\\" remains a strong cut as well. Overall, there's plenty of tasty beats to hold a Doom fanatic over until he drops his next LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whole Album?","review":"Coriander and Eucalyptus are the best tracks out of this compilation.

We Love You Very Much!","review":"This is only the 5th Bond Book that I have read, but it is definately one of the best! It takes a different turn by making the whole book through the eyes of the Bond girl, Vivienne Michel. I also loved that it was plain and simple. No bio-war fare, or fancy villain plans, just two gangsters who want insurance money. Taking away the fancy plot made it easier to focus on the characters and the fantastic writing. So, BUY THIS BOOK! IT's GREAT! (even throughout the soap-opra-ish first half.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want James Bond, avoid this like the plague","review":"I am a huge James Bond fan, of both the movies and Ian Fleming's books. I am quite aware that a lot of the books are not like the movies of the same title and I don't expect that. But I had to comment on this book. It is different in that it is told by a woman and shares her views on Mr. Bond, from a feminine perspective. Hmmm, could be interesting. The only problem is that the edition I have is 143 pages long, but James Bond is not even mentioned until page 90! Here I have read almost 2/3 of the book, but nothing about Bond, just a fill in of this woman's failed relationships up until the time James shows up for a meager 50 pages. If you're not waiting to get your fix of Bond and just want to read something different you might want to give it a try. However if Bond is what you're after I suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, okay voice acting","review":"This is a Bond book taken from the perspective of someone he meets, and so we see him as others might see him: a dangerous man, but by his actions and charisma making him the sexiest spy, now and forever.The voice actor Samantha Bond... not trying to be unkind, but her mispronunciation of \\"Adirondack\\" drove me nuts and broke my attention away from the story, every time I heard it. If not for this I would have loved this audiobook.Listen to the other books read by Rufus Sewell and he will spoil you. You'll never want to listen to anyone else read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the best of Fleming!","review":"Well, after writing so many wonderful books Ian Fleming obviously thought he could get away with writing a bad one. There are a few good points, the character of Vivienne Michel is well written, but the first half of the book is nothing more than a soppy love story (or two, come to think of it) and Bond doesn't even appear until the last third. The villains, Sluggsy and Horror, are dirty, unsophisticated gangsters rather than the usual dignified megalomaniacs. I can't say how many times better the film is."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Okay Book","review":"I thought 'The Spy Who Loved Me' was much to be desired.

This 164 novella took over 100 pages to introduce James Bond. Really? That is like reading a book about the Revolution without mention of Thomas Jefferson. The plot was HIGHLY uninteresting and nothing to do with espionage, and rather bland. Bond just happened to go to Washington D.C. and happened to have a flat tire outside of the setting. Really? I'm glad this bore was a quick read.Feminists would abhor this book - as the main character uses sex to placate a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"By no means is the best of the Bond novels...","review":"First of all MAKE SURE this isn't the first James Bond novel you ever read! If you are interested in knowing more about the \\"literary version\\" of James Bond, this novel will not impress you. Bond is not even in the book until around chapter 10. You have to read about a woman who falls in love several times, and is a hopeless romantic, and then she moves from England to the United States where she has a chance encounter with James Bond. This novel is more for the \\"Ian Fleming fan\\" rather than the \\"James Bond fan.\\" If you have read a few of Fleming's novels, and you like his style then you may like this book. Let me repeat, BOND IS HARDLY IN THIS BOOK, he's just \\"tacked on\\" at the very end of a relatively boring novel. This book is completely different than the movie, there is nothing in common. If you want to read about Bond, and learn about Ian Fleming's version of him, try From Russia With Love, or Live and Let Die, they are far better novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"RRIOT GIRL POP PUNK......that doesn't SUCK!","review":"I remember hearing Bikini Kill a few years back along with some other bands of the ilk, and thinking, hey, these bands would actually be somewhat good if they were at least BARELY competent on their instruments. Ironically, The NEED fills the NEED for such a group. Try putting old-school brit girl new-wave punk like early Siouxsie, the Maneaters, X-Ray Spex and Action PACT with the B-52s and the freakish likes of Mr. Bungle, then throw in a generous helping of the great sixties garage-group the Music Machine in the blender, and you will get a nice big serving of the NEED.

I ended up not only not caring about why he was there, but also not caring about anything he had to say.If you want a great American travel book, try The Lost Continent by Bill Bryson, if you want a funny view of a Brit in America, read California Dreaming by Lawrence Donegan.

Other people will be pleasantly surprised that there is something new in the ambient genre. Slow - moves and changes at a glacial pace, but it does move and change, in clever, unexpected ways. Imagine five minutes of music played at a tenth of its normal speed through a computer, this will give you an idea of what is going on here. I have fallen asleep many times listening to this.

Diverse as that album is, Buddha Of Suburbia may be even more so. The score is a mix of dance music, someLodger-like pop, ambient, and even free jazz.

Originally, this wasn't even released in the U.S. until there was a Bowie reissue campaign around the time of his then-recent album, Earthling (i believe @ the time Bowie had just signed with Virgin)There's a healthy portion of instrumentals, which are quite good and some great vocal tracks too, like the original version of Strangers When We Meet (which later appeared on Outside, albeit a much different version), Sex And The Church, Bleed Like A Craze Dad, Ian Fish UK Heir, and the title track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Argueably one of Bowie's best album","review":"This album features the original version of the song\\"strangers when we meet\\".

How supposedly intelligent people could become beguiled by such obvious and juvenile tripe is more than a rational person can endure. I even went so far - again, purely for reasons of amusement - as to actually try out some of the incantations, spells, and even some of the more 'dreaded' (HAR! HAR!) keys. Now, as I sit here at my computer typing this, I am embarrassed to admit that I committed such a waste of time. But I must be honest with .. hmmm .. what's that scratching at the windowpane?

One can assume that 'NECRONOMICON' is simply a fictional rendition of the title 'BOOK OF THE DEAD'. There are several of these from several areas. Assuming that a book called NECRONOMICON did exist prior to this century, there is no reason to assume this volume would be it. For a magician, objective validity is as much about truth as is belief. A certain store in New York, called THE WARLOCK SHOP, are variously claimed to own originals, though they will not visually verify. Only the publishers of the book make any connection, though the hoaxers were likely aware of these books, and kept them in mind during authorship. Interesting, but valueless."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"How much does the average joe know about the Sumerian Race? The original text is in Ancient Arabic and the translations into English are amateurish to say the very least. The symbols are accurate, the incantations are nothing to mess with because they are poorly translated and the text lacks the proper spells for banishing what may appear as the result of tampering or dabbling with the rituals.

Although it is famous, there is precious little Necronomicon in this Necronomicon. The loin's share of this book is devoted to Colin Wilson's rambling indignation of Lovecraft and his oh-so-interesting-if-you-are-a-dry-british-critic story about how he came upon this vile volume. The basic premis of Wilson is this;Lovecraft was such a hack writer with so little imagination or talent that he could not possibly have made it up. Therefore, it is real.Yep, that's it folks.

I wouldgive this five stars if it weren't for the fact that several of the invocatory protocols seem hopelessly flawed, resulting in the materialization of positively dangerous minor imps.

Fits very well in the Death/Gore Metal genre. Blast beats, rugged guitar, gutteral vocals, dark and violent lyrics, the works. I really like this CD, though I hate most metal of this kind. I was suprised because I was a little skeptical at first to listen to this album. I admit that I snagged it up because of the sole fact that Akerfelt is the vocalist, and his vocals are ferocious and raw. The guitars are decent, with no riffs that will blow your mind, virtually no bass, as is usual in this genre. The drums are decent.Overall this album is average at best, and I am thankful that Mikael left this band and went to work full time with Opeth, nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's sad such albums get 5*...","review":"The only reason for 2* instead of 1* is that there are plenty much worse bands out there. At least all of the band's members are accomplished musicians (I never liked Swano or Akerfeldt's other bands though, including much hyped Edge of Sanity).Anyway - monotonous music, songs indistiguishable from one another, simplistic and uninspired drumming, excessive (almost silly) guitar distortion and AWFUL processed vocals - what not to like about it? Oh, by the way - \\"artwork\\" looks like their label didn't want to pay for it, at all.It's such a shame people don't even want to know a little bit more about genre of which they consider themselves \\"fans\\". ANY album from Vomitory or Fleshcrawl is light years ahead of this childish crap.

Perhaps you all should think about doing the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...","review":"There's two things i hate in deathmetal... 1 is clean vocals and 2 is melodic deathmetal. If you like your deathmetal to have clean vocals? Your an idiot. Bloodbath's \\"resurrection through carnage\\" sounds like sh*t and the production and drummer both blows. Listing to brutal deathmetal such as impure, disgorge, christdenied etc... Melodic dm with clean vocals blows! Dont support trash. It's all about guttural vocals and brutality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad..........","review":"This album is very dissapointing, love Nightmares Made Flesh, and have heard the new Unblessing the Purity and its good so thought i would go and buy the older album with the same singer as the new ep. The vocals are good enough, but lack the range and personality of Peter. Production is ridiculously poor and guitar sound is a joke. This is supossed to be a super group, must have had no super producer. And the drummer, ehhh the drummer, don't know where he came from, but it must not be a death metal band. If you want Bloodbath then get Nightmares Made Flesh it is lightyears ahead of this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Death Metal favorites!","review":"Bloodbath is definitly a unique Death Metal band. They blend full on Death Metal brutality, with that Swedish Gothenburg melody sound, while not losing any of the anger and aggression in the vocals. The end result is a sound nothing like the rest. Maybe thats because Mikael Akerfeldt was involved on this album...and any fan of Metal knows that anything Mikael touches turns to a golden masterpiece. This is in my opinion their best album. If you're looking for something brutal, heavy, and unique while still remaining TRUE to the roots of Death Metal planted so long ago, then this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"when slayer met opeth","review":"All i can say is, this is by far the most brutal and perfectionist metal i have hears in ages.

I was always a huge Opeth fan, but now it's the only thing I can listen too, except for this new Bloodbath album. I bought it a week after I picked up deliverance and I must say... GET IT! if you like metal at all, you will love it. It's fast, heavy, and has some great groove. Mikael adds that perfect \\"Demon Voice\\" quality that we all know and love. It's One of the better Metal albums I've heard since Rust In Piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply brilliant and brilliantly simple","review":"I must admit that I find traditional death metal (Deicide, Cannibal Corpse, etc.) rather boring, and so-called 'melodic death metal' horrible. So I approached this cd with caution. But I was in for a very pleasant surprise, as this cd turned out to be amazingly good. Bloodbath manages to be both traditional/old school AND melodic while steering clear of the pitfalls associated with these concepts. This album really, really rocks, it's heavy, it's evil, and though not furiously fast, quite decently paced. Death metal with a rock'n'roll feel, a la early Entombed or The Crown (but of course very different!?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Side Project","review":"I'm not going to lie, this band is not ground breaking or bringing anything new to the table. This is a look back at classic 1990's Death Metal and taking all the best qualities of the brutal side of the music. But they do it so well, I can't stop listening to it. I find it unreal that this is coming from the guys of Opeth, among others. If your a listener who is looking to move on and wants progressive Death Metal, you will probably not be pleased. But if you like the old school sound, you may very well enjoy this. What impresses me is that they get the old school sound so well and yet they don't sound like they are copying anyone. Even though the sound is far from new, it still retains a refreshing originality, somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Twist on Death Metal","review":"If you think all death metal sounds the same, think again. Bloodbath really is a great new twist in the Death Metal market. I stumbled onto these guys by listening to a demo disk that I got when I purchased Napalm Death's \\"The code is Red, Long live the Code\\" Even though there are about 20 bands on the Demo Disk, only 6 or 7 really stood out, and Bloodbath was the best of the bunch. I decided to purchase the CD and I wasnt dissapointed. I am not going to say that they are the greatist thing in Death Metal, but in some odd way they are just different. Its almost like Thrash Metal then Death, yet it still delievers a powerful punch. Give it a try, I think you might like it.

But this is the first conservation biology film in action, and there has never been anything like it.Filmed in places like New Zealand, Brazil, Easter Island, Madagascar, Peru and southern California, it a glorious testament to what it takes to save endangered species and habitat, and the people who are truly making a difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"All it did is mess up my files.

Between his going and coming is a sequence of vignettes that become increasingly tiresome and meaningless. None of the characters gains anything in the way of wisdom, understanding, or wiles.Michel Simon is outstanding as the old man who gives the boy a temporary refuge, but Alain Cohen, as the youthful protagonist, appears to lack the ability to carry off the demands of his role. Or maybe the director intended his semi-autobiographical character to smile vapidly 90% of the time. Or maybe this English-speaking American reviewer just doesn't get it. Indeed, nearly every frame of this feature is full of subtitles, resulting in likely fatigue for a non-French-speaking viewer.

The other stories tend to meander through a series of events that smack of pretense and lack the power of these two tales. A collection like this will always be a risk for the reader; the short story is limited to accomplishing its goals in a limited time.

I have no problem with the provocative but this was just smut. I lost valuable brain cells reading this book. I am astounded by the fact that the reviews hailed this book as a Salingeresque masterpiece. I see no relationship whatsoever.

It has one of my favorite piano players, hank jones, and what was he thinking? The first tune sounds like a hawaiian dance and I felt is was prisoner of the elevator from hell. All the songs with the strings (1-5) are a waste of energy. The strings don't swing, don't mesh with the rest of the band, and the vibrato really is painful.The 2nd part (6-11) redeems the cd. It is a competent quartet with Sonny and Hampton Hawes leading the rythm section. But by the time I got there, I was ready to toss the cd out the window anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"One caveat","review":"First, I was sent the wrong product. The subvendor, Grand Slam Sports and Outdoors, was quick and responsive about the return. The Caveat: The front sight is not study, with the light collecting plasic held by three tiny metal clips to the front sight. It is not strong enough to withstand being hammered into the dovetail. If you buy these sights, use your trusty triangular file to remove metal from the front sight until it will go mostly into the dovetail with finger pressure. If you go too far, use epoxy glue or similar to retain the sight in the slot. Otherwise, you will put the brass front sight back in place if you want to go shooting, and you have to pound the heck out of that one too.Keep happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not able to use","review":"I was not able to use the product.

I was due for a dose of Clomid to do the same thing I achieved on my own. I recommend these books to anyone seeking knowledge about ther bodies, and help achieving pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info, some outdated info","review":"Let me begin by saying that the first book anyone should read if they are trying to conceive is Taking Charge of Your Fertility by Toni Wechsler. This book has some good information and recommendations. I tried to conceive for 2 years. I began taking evening primrose oil daily after reading this book. About 6 months later, I discovered the website tryingtoconceive.com and learned that evening primrose oil should only be taken prior to ovulation because it can cause uterine contractions and interfere with the implantation of an egg. After discontinuing the EPO from ovulation to menstruation, I conceived within 3 months. So, I guess you could say, had I NOT read this book, I may have been pregnant sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the proof?","review":"This book is for people who do not have infertility issues.

I had taken a NFP course before I was married to learn how to prevent conception, and this book took that knowledge and helped me learn how to apply it to trying to conceive.I would agree with other comments that it is not for those who are having great difficulty conceiving and are facing infertility issues.I was not looking for information about herbs or alternative therapies, so I cannot comment on those sections of the book.This is great for those wanting details about the physiology of conception."},{"rating":"1","title":"the big surprise","review":"I was reading along feeling that this might be an allright book and then whamo! the big surprise. We find out (and I'm not sure Connor ever did) that Sophie isn't a virgin. Had sex with a \\"friend\\" when she was younger. No big deal. Yes it was. She wouldn't have just done that in this time period. I felt like the author just couldn't have a virgin heroine, so she plunked down the friend story. It was so unbelieveable. It ruined the book for me right then. I just felt this book had no validity. I don't recall if she ever told Connor about this incident. This book just entered TSTL territory for me.

The author did a respectable job in that regard. With some improvement in future revisions, this book seems to be one of the best introductionary texts on stochastic calculus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucid and detailed introduction","review":"This is a really lucid and detailed introduction to derivative pricing theory from the pde way of doing things. The author is an applied mathematician, of the fluid mechanics variety, and this should tell you right away what the drift of the presentation is like.Some will argue that all of Wilmott's books are along exactly the same line, so why do we need another pde book? Given the amazing number of textbooks dedicated to the martingale approach, it is great to have yet another, fresh way of looking at the pde approach.The derivations come with all the necessary technical details, the style is very down to earth, and to my mind original. There are many details that I personally haven't seen in any other textbook before, and there are plenty of what seem like very useful exercises.I really like this book, and it was a pleasant surprise to see it in a local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mathematical Models of Financial Derivatives","review":"The book is only a undergraduate textbook with no surprise.

Great resources and ideas are in it from Bible to science, literature and history. Activities focus mainly on the theology behind the story and the renaissance and reformation. The CD with printable discussion questions is great! My only complaints are there are no printables on the renaissance and reformation only the story itself and its discussion questions. There are web links (a few of which have expired) which help. I wish it had included the second Pilgrims Progress book Bunyan wrote as well. If you have younger students (2nd-5th grade), I would recommend having them read Little Pilgrims Progress (which is more their age level and contains the 2nd book) but still using this book for more interactive ideas. I am very pleased overall with this book. It has lots of great ideas and activities mentioned. It works great for a Bible study, homeschool coop or homeschool study."},{"rating":"1","title":"A compilation that misses the good songs...?","review":"I read one of the reviews already posted suggesting that if you're looking at this album you would be better served to buy the originals. That reviewer is 100% correct. Beyond Belief, Unseen Power, and Wake-Up Call are my three favorite Petra albums and this CD looks to be poorly cobbled together from them. Don't get me wrong, there are still some great songs on here, but if you buy this CD you'll be missing out on the truly great songs those albums had. Don't settle for left-overs. Get the original albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Petra I knew---WAY BETTER!","review":"I was a big fan of Petra in the mid 80s then stopped listening. I picked up this CD the other day and have been spinning it over and over. It is fantastic! Hard Rocking Heavy Metal Sound. The band is tight. There is a rough edge that was missing before, and that makes the music a lot better. If the other reviewer is right, that these are not the best songs from the various CDs, then the best must be amazing. I am not even a heavy metal fan, but this CD really drives hard and keeps the listener interested. The singer's voice puzzled me for a while, never was that fond of higher pitched male vocals (like Journey), but this one was better, and when I found out it's the former singer from Head East, it all came together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek, unique design","review":"I have been looking for a minimalistic oil diffuser for the longest time and this was more than I was looking for.

Super cheap (msrp everywhere is 7-8 bucks), all widescreen with english subtitles. Only drawbacks are that it's 2 disks/2 movies per disk (single sided) and there's no dedicated movie menu. This means that there's no scene selection or special features (as far as I can tell); so a fairly bare bones package.

The graphics are wonderful, even on lower settings.I've found I get the most fun out of this game when I play it with a group of friends on a LAN. The game really lends itself to this sort of venue. The online community is also good, but a little tough to crack into if your a begginer.Another thing that made me like this game was the fact that, while gripping, it never pretends to be real. It is a game inside a game. This greatly increases my enjoyment.All in all, highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is so cool i love this it is awesome the weapon selection is amazing and so are the vehicles! it is better then Halo, The Lord of the Rings and Return to Castle Wolfinstein (my other action games) if your friends say you should get Halo or Star Wars Battlefront say NO!!!!!!! this is an awesome multiplayer game and they also made the single player nice, i recomend the multiplayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing","review":"As a HUGE ut2k zealot, I have always loved the games.

I was up and running in less than 30 minutes!! But over time, for some reason it stop writing cds..I have tried all kinds of cds to use...and the strangest part of it is that I will burn 2 cds and then when I go to burn the 3rd one for some reason it comes up with a troubleshoot message saying \\"cannot write to high speed disc\\" but yet it did minutes earlier!! It plays music just fine through my cd player on my computer, for I have an HP Pavilion 6623 with Windows 98. I don't know what happened to it, but I've even cleaned the player and tried burning another cd and it still doesn't work. The other thing I hate about it is that it won't burn from wav format like most cd burners do..so I have decided to buy another burner. I would give this a 2 star but its not something I would reccommend to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy to use","review":"This writer is so easy to use! Plug and burn on.

It worked fine for about six months, but now, despite my having followed all of HP's guidelines re. performance and maintenance, I'm lucky to be able to create a CD 20% of the time. The little green light on the unit flashes and flashes, then suddenly stops... the status bar reaches 98%... and just sits there. Time to reboot, throw out the CD and try again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!!!!!!!","review":"Whatever you do, DO NOT BUT THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! After only having this cd-burner for about six months, it just quit working. The software that comes with it is terrible. It constantly comes up with errors that make no sense.

Don't buy before HP sell it with a more reliable software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowest","review":"This device is like a piece of junk considering the speed and accuracy of its work. It never finishes a task correctly and it take about 30 minutes to write a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"An average product","review":"It's an average product. The software packages bundled with the burner are ok. I had to buy a better burning software. It's a usb product but doesn't work on macintosh. Though HP claims the burner dooesn't support Mac, it's still bit disappointing to know that it doesn't really work on mac. I'm saying this, because when ZipCD first came out, Iomega didn't have the driver and software for mac and yet it still worked on the platform. Even MS usb mouses without a driver works on mac. What really amazes me about HP is that customer representative never replies your email enquiries. BTW, HP delivers rebate checks really fast, and that's the only thing I like about HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed!","review":"I ordered this item for .50 shipped so I do not feel like I was too badly ripped off.

I wasn't sure that a collection of magazine articles was worth paying for, but this book is far more than that. It helps to put the Construction Phase of the RUP into context and actually goes beyond the vanilla version of the RUP to provide advice that I could actually use.There was a lot of articles about storing objects in relational databases, an idea that put me off at first, but being on an EJB project right now I discovered that these articles really helped me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Colorado","review":"Be forewarned. This book expresses very little original thought and is merely a collection of \\"other peoples\\" articles. This provides for very little logical flow for someone wanting to apply RUP.

Even though it is small, I really like it. The paper and printing are very nice. I bought it primarily for the Ebelskiver recipes and there are a bunch of them so I'm happy. The spiral binding allows you to go to the recipe you want and have the whole thing lie nicely on the counter - unlike a traditional book binding which would always be slamming shut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danish Recipes","review":"I bought this for myself and then another to give as a gift a week later.

Even though his actions may make you question his morals, Miss Lonelyhearts still triumphs in capturing our attention. Through his miserable life--which, in fact, could be any one of ours--we learn what the purpose of exisiting really is.Try this.

The floss is not attached well to the pick so one end comes out with the slightest pressure. Also in an attempt I suppose to make it 'soft' or 'silky' it ends up being too elastic, so one ends up either with a piece of floss too stretched out to be useful or a pick with only one end attached, which is useless.
