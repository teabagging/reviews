The marpac is so small and makes a relaxing \\"whoosing\\" sound of a fan. It is very well built and there are no repetitive sounds. The sound can be adjusted and there is a low and high setting. I do wish the sound could go a little higher but this is clearly on the of best machines on the market. It about the circumference of a dessert plate and can easily be taken when traveling. Dont' waste your money on cheap imitations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is much too loud & annoying to allow sleep","review":"I bought this as a more portable substitute to using a box fan to help me sleep. While the noise of a box fan is soothing, the noise of this device is annoying! Not only is it too loud, even on low, but there's a very unpleasant mixture of high fan sounds and low motor sounds, as noted in other 1-star reviews. I returned it right away. I'm really puzzled why so many reviewers seem to like it. I will try one of the electronic machines next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"I bought this for my son's nursery.

After at least an hour of research on the internet for \\"white noise machines\\" at the 11th hour, it was clear this was the winner hands down, and I ordered it (OVERNIGHT DELIVERY...cost me an extra $25.00!), but I can't tell you how well worth it it was!! Worth EVERY PENNY! We ALL slept like babies all 3 nights! Now I have to give mine to my daughter because my Granddaughters don't like the fan anymore! I just ordered one for her. BUY IT!

The first I stupidly left in London, but that's another story for another time. This product is great! You pull it out and turn it on and think that it's a little disappointing -- but trust me it works. I live next to a grocery store and the trucks show up at all hours of the night to deliver food. Since I re-purchased the Marpac I've been able to get a good night's sleep. If you're just looking for a white-noise machine that will block out all of the extraneous noise that prevents you from either falling asleep or staying asleep -- this the machine for you. It's not fancy. It's not aesthetically pleasing, but it works.Be aware that it will take you a night or two to get used to -- but it's so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't sleep without it","review":"I bought this for myself a few years ago and am now ordering it as a Christmas gift for a friend. This thing saved my sleep. I live in a big city with noisy neighbors and the Marpac gently washes away outside noise to allow me a deep sleep.It's quiet but has the right level of \\"white noise\\" to drown out neighbors and city traffic. I can't imagine sleeping without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies","review":"I bought it for my 5 month old, who tends to wake up a lot during her naps. I wanted to block out the daily noise. I was not planning to use it during the night since we have a quiet neighborhood/household, but I tried it out last night. My daughter has never slept through the night yet even though we tried many methods (she usually wakes up twice) and yesterday she slept through 12 hours straight! Her naps today were also longer. This is an awesome product and I recommend it for your babies if they wake up too often."},{"rating":"2","title":"First impression","review":"I just got this thing.

Assuming that this actually lasts for years as the product description said then Ill be really happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job.","review":"The Marpac 980A generates a steady white noise that successfully masks ambient noise. I am a light sleeper and am easily disturbed by noise from the street and from interior sounds generated by various appliances and electronic devices in my home. The Marpac help me get a good night's sleep. It is easy to operate and to adjust the intensity of the sound. My only complaint is in their product identification. It took me a lot of research, including going to their website to figure out that the same product has different names. Don't know why they do this. Use the model number."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aweomse Sound Screen","review":"We bought this on recommendation of our Acupunturist who uses one of these in each of her rooms (sometimes two in a room) to block noise from the waiting room or other rooms and it works! We bought it for my husbands office because his office is right next to his waiting room area and it gets a bit noisy at times. You can choose the level of sound screening you want, soft or louder. It isn't an annoying noise of disruptive in any way. It is the best background noise on the market. It's still relaxing and yet provides a screen between the cars going by outside and the people in the waiting room. Excellent and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Worth The Price!","review":"I used to use a fan in my room in order to sleep. With just sheer quiet, I absolutely had a hard time falling asleep. My doctor told me about \\"noise\\" machines and up until 4 mths. ago, I had never heard about them. I ordered this product to try, and it is fabulous!! It's small enough to sit on a dresser or night table, and doesn't blow air and/or dust throughout your bedroom at night. I even packed it when I took my spring vacation. For those of you that use fans in order to get that \\"humming\\" sound in order to sleep, try this. It is worth the money...absolutely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Our children (ages 2 and 1) are very light sleepers. While on a trip my friend had this in the guest bedroom. I was able to talk on the phone in the same room as my sleeping 1 year old! Crazy. That sold me on it. Once we got home, I ordered it right away. The night waking has diminished. :-) Worth the money for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice analog design, but could use more power","review":"This device won't drown out all noises, as a fan or an air-conditioner would. You'll probably still hear garbage trucks, birds, and other morning disturbances. A snoring sleeping partner? That depends.But it will filter out lighter house noises, such as doors closing, toilets flushing, and creaky heating and ventilation systems.It also has a soothing analog sound which I like, and a cool retro design. And its compact size makes it very easy to travel with. There is something to be said about a product still on the market that has basically been unchanged for almost 50 years.But it could use one more power setting that's a bit louder so it can filter out more noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this now.","review":"Others have said it, and I'll say it again. This is the one to buy. I've had fans, things that make wooshing noises, humidifiers, and more fans.I wasn't sure about it for the first two nights.

Don't buy the lesser cost versions of \\"white noise\\" machines - as I have gone through several digital ones that simply break, or go awry after a few months. I own 3 of these. This is the best thing you can buy for a baby's room. The constant noise soothes them, and also eliminates the tiny house noises that can wake up the little ones (footsteps in the hall, tv in the other room). This thing, while expensive, works...and works well."},{"rating":"2","title":"noise","review":"I was looking for something that provided white noise so that I did not hear the tv at night. This is great. I am sleeping very soundly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"We have been using this for about 4 months. A night doesn't go by that we don't use it to drown out our snoring dog.By turning the side and the top you can adjust the loudness and pitch and we have found a pitch that seems to match the frequency of the dog and makes it near impossible to hear.A suggestion is to place the unit between you and the noise. We started with the unit on my wife's night stand next to her head thinking getting it as loud and close to her would drown the noise the best but then it was like the two noises were competing from two directions. By placing the unit on a table outside the closet (which our dog has made into her bedroom) and matching the tones has made it very effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ends the silence!","review":"I bought this because my wife has had ringing in one of her ears. It's worked great for her and has been great for me as well as it creates a soothing background noise. Now, since we live in a relatively quite house, we only use the slow setting. I'm not sure how effective it would be at drowning out noises (other than better than nothing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good white-noise generator","review":"I like the constant low-level sound this produces while I'm sleeping, but it bothers my wife. To each their own, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"I did not love at first, but do now","review":"It seemed too loud. So, read the directions dummy. It has two settings and multiple adjustments.

I place it in the waiting room and it helps with keeping with conversations in my office private."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronic buzzing and rattling","review":"Useless. Sure it creates white noise but for those who are very sensitive to sound, it also creates a high pitch buzzing \\"electronic\\" sound. And every once it a while there is a sound as if there is a tiny rock being tossed around...almost like that sound old electric coil heaters make when they're warming up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too LOUD","review":"The machine makes a nice white noise sound which is adjustabel in \\"tone\\", but not volume. I found it much too loud for our bedroom. So loud that it kept us awake. If you are looking for a soft background noise machine do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough!!!","review":"I bought this machine after reading all the positive reviews here on amazon. My fiance uses a boxed fan to drown out the noise in our room, but I think it's ugly, so I wanted to get something more effective and compact. This \\"sound conditioner\\" doesn't even reach the sound level of his fan on its lowest level. It's not loud enough to block out sounds from outside the house, much less the louder ones from the inside. I also bought a lifesounds by marpac for my 9yo, and the volume on it is really really great. It gets extremely loud at the highest volume, and also has other sounds besides the white noise like surf, rain, brook, womb, heartbeat and lullaby (it actually doesn't have the straight white noise setting, but surf sounds quite like it). I will be returning the marpac sleepmate for the lifesounds for our room too (hopefully...haven't looked at return policy on amazon yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marpac 980 Sleepmate & Sound Screen Cond. White Noise Sleep Machine","review":"I found the sound on this machine irritating and actually prevented me from sleeping. It sounded more like a fan blowing than white noise. The volume control was also poor. Does not warrant the price. I would have liked to have known exactly what type of sound this product emitted before I purchased it. There was also a restocking fee of $10.99 which I felt was excessive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think it has actually helped sleep.","review":"I am a very light sleeper so have used a several different sound machines for many years. All previous machines have been the looped sounds. I have always preferred the white noise settings but would often be bothered by the repeating sounds. The Marpac 980A does not make the repeating sounds, just nice clean white noise. I bought the two speed machine after seriously considering the one speed...so glad I did because the lower setting is a bit too quite for my liking. Another great surprise is a cell phone can be placed on the same bedside table with it...no screeching or weird noises. Would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps me to sleep","review":"Only used this for a few weeks, but it seems t help me to sleep.

I live in a place with lots of disruptive background noise that makes sleeping through the night difficult. This product is wonderful because it completely fills the volume of the room with a blanket of soft sound that blocks out external noises. There is a flock of shrieking loud birds (house sparrows) that arrives daily outside my bedroom window at sunrise (often 5:30am). that makes it IMPOSSIBLE to sleep. This machine drowns them out, along with my irritating neighbors who forget there are other people in the world with ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"L-O-U-D","review":"Sleep machine? Sure, for everyone who's idea of relaxing is cuddling up to an aircraft engine. Yes, this thing blocks noise; but a relaxing, soporific breath of wind it is NOT. The \\"volume control\\" is a joke: it produces a barely-detectable modulation of the pitch, and almost no change in volume at all.Drama aside, the noise it makes it about what you'd hear if you stood up and pressed your ear close to one of those blowers above your head in an airplane. REALLY close. Like impaled on.I'm just amazed at the high ratings this device has gotten. If you put this in a far corner of a big room with a couch in front of it, you'd successfully blunt the sound of the folks in the apartment below discussing what to make for dinner--without being deafened in the process. Otherwise I don't see what it's good for.My search for a PEACEFUL white-noise generator continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good night's sleep","review":"I purchased this machine for my 14 year old son's bedroom. We've had it for a month now and know he gets a sounder sleep; he wakes up each morning without a fuss and is more alert in the mornings than I've ever seen him. We did not get the machine to drown out noise but rather make a consistent white noise, hoping that it would help him sleep. It works. I like the speed controls but he keeps it on high, the loudest, which he prefers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I'd anticipated","review":"I purchased this item to try and mask the sound of my neighbor coming down the stairs outside my apt. every morning at 6:30. Unfortunately, I can still hear the noise even with this thing turned on High.I also feel like it is priced too high as it does not feature a variety of sounds like other (less expensive) sound machines do. This machine creates a sound equivalent to having a fan blow all night. You can vary the air flow a bit by turning the top which is just repositioning the vents by a few inches.I wanted to return it but the seller states that they will charge a 15% restocking fee unless there is something wrong with it. Between that and the price of shipping it back, I figured that I might as well keep it or sell it on Craig's List. But it has done me no good for my present noise situation. I am back to wearing ear plugs at night and the sound machine stays off."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for people who need a fan to sleep","review":"I've always been awoken by little noises such as creaking and people walking above me. For years I slept with a fan, but it was getting too cold and the blowing air was starting to bother me. This noise machine is a good alternative to a fan. It's a smooth sound and there is no blowing air. I find it covers up noises pretty well (although not entirely) and it's very soothing. I can't sleep well without it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used every night for 6 years and still going!!!! Quality product!!","review":"My husband snores. I'm a light sleeper. A few years ago I was at my wits' end. Then this machine came into my life.We bought one of these (when they were known as the Sleepmate/Sound Screen 980A) back in 2006. We have used this amazing little machine every night since we received it and it's STILL GOING STRONG 6 years later! Now if that doesn't give you an idea of the quality of this product, I don't know what will. I can't live without this thing -- if I didn't have it, I would be a walking zombie and would probably lose my job due to lack of sleep. If your significant other has a snoring problem, please do not hesitate to purchase this sanity-saving device."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"We have had this for about six months now, received one that died on us the first night, Amazon took care of it promptly. The new one we received has been flawless. We used to use a fan for white noise, but now we have this and we won't go back to a fan. Love that we can change the tone of the sound by moving the top part of the device to make whatever tone works the best for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marpac 980A","review":"I was disappointed with this white noise generator and returned it. I was hoping for something that would mimic the static noise you get from a radio that is between stations, but this machine just sounded like a fan. For the price I had expected a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received a defective product","review":"The only reason I'm giving it a 1-star rating is because the machine broke down within minutes of use. I don't know if the higher setting is a problem, because it seemed fine with the lower one. With the former, there was a loud popping sound, then smoke started coming out of the unit and after that, it stopped functioning altogether.And I just found out that I can't get a replacement, only a refund, because the machine came from a seller, not Amazon itself. And since I have to ship it back to the USA from Singapore ( where I live ), I also have to foot the high shipping charges.Doesn't seem fair at all, and I don't know if I should even bother getting a new machine.Guess I may just have to use ear plugs and my iPod for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quiet","review":"This device is not worth the money. I have a box fan I paid $10 for that is louder. Your money would be better spent else where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Noise Maker","review":"This white noise maker is not actually a noise machine, but a small fan housed in a plastic tube. Since this is the case, it doesn't get any louder than a fan would. I was very disappointed with it, it didn't drown out any noise, but just sounded like a fan on top pf the noise. I would not reccommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY","review":"this product sucks..............just a noise I can't stand. My friend has one with with a choice of the ocean, rain, babbling brook etc. This one would drive you to drink. Tried to send it back but no printer. Would not suggest anyone to buy this product. Has a screatching sound that come on and wakes you up. Henceforth it sits in the drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT IDEA! but motor squeel too annoying","review":"I bought this product to replace a fan as white noise. I viewed an in store model that was broken and making aweful noises, but purchased anyway because the reviews were so positive! Tried for 3 nights, and didn't sleep good for any of them. The motor that runs the fan makes a noise that can be heard over the whooshing of air. It was not even a consistent noise, so it was very noticable. It almost sounded like the fan was just barely scraping the casing, and would make a rattling/high pitched noise. Went to exchange item, and was asked if I would like to test new one. YES, please! Unfortunately, it made the same noise, so I took a refund. I hate sleeping with a fan because I have pets and allergies and it dries up my sinuses, so it is sad that this product did not work as expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for.","review":"Product was exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is that it could be a little louder, and a deeper tone, but it does the trick the way it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive fan","review":"This product is totally useless. It sounds like a fan... no mask for any noise...I tried all I could do... Still a fan.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep without a fan!","review":"I have always needed the sound of a fan to fall asleep, but I married 3 years ago and the fan gives my husband a bad headache! I decided on this product because it is really a little fan without blowing air around. It is wonderful! Better than the real fan! If you are a fan sleeper, you won't be disappointed with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST...","review":"I'm two weeks in to sleeping (finally) with this very simple unit... I confess, I was skeptical when I ordered it. I'm a notoriously light sleeper and I live in an area where trains and planes go by regularly (international airport - 2 miles away; train station - 1/4 mile away) so when I moved in, I knew I needed help. The Dohm at its higher of two settings still doesn't entirely block out the intrusive sounds, but the surprise, surprise for me was that its consistent whirring sound doesn't need to completely block out the sounds. What they in effect seem to do is mix in those sounds with everything else so the net effect when I am sleeping is that it is indeed, a much more reduced net effect. Result - two weeks, since day one living with this Dohm, I have slept six plus hours a night and it is increasing. That from someone who lived for the past seven or eight years on four hours sleep a day. I have discovered a whole new way to live. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Within 6 Weeks of Using","review":"I really liked the sound of the DOHM and it is exactly what I was looking for. I have a two year old and a baby and it really helps blend out noises. I felt I was sleeping better myself. However, I purchased it in May and it started to have a rattle sound only a couple weeks later in June. I haven't contacted the manufacturer yet but I will do so and I am hoping I can get a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blocks the noise!","review":"Very pleased. Performed as expected based on all the reviews. Small enough to fit in most spaces. I have this in my bedroom to block out street noise such as honking and ambulances, as I live in downtown Chicago. I am considering buying a second one to put by my front door to drown out the noise coming from the hallway during the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for loud neighborhoods","review":"We have two of these, one for the babies room and one for our room. It doesn't drown out the parties next door completely, but at least levels out the sounds well enough to get some sleep. Shouting, screaming, barking etc..will still be heard, but general chatter seems to efficiently be removed. Remember to place it *between* you and the noise, not right next to your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Recently moved close to railroad tracks and this allows me to sleep through the night. The train horn used to wake me every 2 hours. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan Replaced!","review":"I always sleep with a fan for noise. This mimics the fan noise and has 2 speeds as well as an adjustable cap which changes the tone of the air. It is very small and can even be packed for travel. I'd highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"I couldn't sleep without a fan on, but the fan kept the room too cold for my wife. This was the perfect solution. The white noise is not coming out of a speaker, it is an actual motor spinning so it provides the noise I needed to get a good nights sleep. Drowns out the neighbors beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I absolutely love this product! I was sleeping with a fan for the noise but would freeze to death. Now I have this perfect product to drown outside noise. I am sleeping better and my two dogs are even sleeping better because they don't hear every little noise either. I will be cruising next month and plan to take it with me for noise control. It is small enough so that it will not take up much luggage room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Product","review":"I have used this specific machine for 15 years including in NOISY hotels, party houses, and next to the airport.

Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful item","review":"Over the years I have had to deal with a lot of different ways to sleep. When I worked night shift I used ear plugs, and when my children were babies I had noise machines for them. This is by far the best white noise machine I have encountered.

It's very soothing and really does hide all sorts of extraneous noise. Works great. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"too loud for me","review":"I was so excited to receive this. I have been using a fan for white noise for years and thought it would be nice to have something more compact that I could travel with. My problem with it was it was just too loud. For the cost, I feel it should have more range of settings, particularly a quieter mode. I felt like I was in an airplane cabin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"At first glance, the sound machine looks very outdated and old, but it really does a great job of masking noise. Our son had gotten used to sleeping with a humidifier, but I was tired of filling it, so thought I'd try this instead and it is awesome! They could work on updating the look, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a definite must for babies!","review":"We have a one year old light sleeper and this has done the trick! Her bedroom has a window that faces the street so children playing and noisy trucks were waking her up during nap times and late at night or early in the morning.

Since getting the Marpac 980 he has been sleeping soundly without us having to tiptoe around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Love this machine enough to have purchased a second just two years later. This is just loud enough to drown out the sound of my partner playing movies or video games in the other room while I am trying to sleep. Gave the first to my mom who was having trouble sleeping and purchased another for myself. This is great when it is too cold to run a fan for white noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"Works better than the fan I have used for 20 years. Also easy to take on a trip. My dogs even like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tinnitus Help","review":"I have suffered from severe tinnitus for decades and have always needed a large, noisy box fan in my bedroom to help mask the ringing in my ears. As the ringing has gotten worse, I have inadvertently turned my bedroom into the vortex of a hurricane by cranking up the box fan to higher and higher (noisier) speeds. This little machine saved the day. I get my white noise and the wife doesn't get blown out of bed anymore. Win win all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as loud as advertised","review":"I have a very variable work schedule and typically have to work nights and sleep when I can during the day in noisy environments. I have been using fans for white noise but it gets freezing in the winter time with the fan blowing around. I was hoping with all the good reviews that this machine would be the answer. Let me tell you its not nearly as loud as my fan even when set to the highest volume and placed near the bed. I am returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid white noise, but not a lot of settings","review":"This white noise machine is a true white noise/background noise machine. It is not too loud and you can make it go from high to low..but remember there are no other sounds on this machine such as crashing waves, birds chirping, etc..it's truly perfect for a therapists office to keep other patients from hearing conversations.It's small enough to fit on your nightstand too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love These Machines","review":"This is the 5th one we have bought over the last few years for all our bedrooms and as gifts.

I live in an apartment complex off a fairly busy street and ambient noise levels are so loud that I was willing to lay down some money to try and reduce the effects. I turn it on max power and it seems to wash out the other random noises from the street-level. Cars and buses can't be heard zooming by any longer and I only tend to hear fire trucks or police every once and a while now. I also have a roommate and the walls aren't that thick so it washes out the noise from the tv for the most part. It's basically like having a fan next to you but slightly louder. The sound it makes is not quite comforting but it's neutral if that makes sense. I turn mine on every night now and the loud ambient noise is not much of a problem anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"really helps with noise reduction","review":"as i live in street level apartment,noise sometime kept me awake. with the marpac sleepmate my sleep is much more restful. great product"},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"I was very pleased with the Marpac dual-speed sound machine #980A.

I will recommend it to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work for me","review":"I was very surprised that this item didnt work for me with all the glowing reviews this has.I'm a very light sleeper and I was very thrilled to find this product... until I got it. Sounds a bit louder than your regular fan, but it doesnt, by any means, reduce other noises.It took me a bit to get used to the its loud noise, but when I did, I also noticed, it didnt muffle other noises. I could still hear my upstairs neighbor opening a drawer and that was a tame one.In my opinion, this products just creates a distraction from other noises, but by no means reduces them or muffles them. All the noises are still there, but is as if you have to focus on the Sleepmate noise to tune out the others, and sorry, but thats not what I need.Just returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Long Sleeping Pills!

She said it helps her fall to sleep right away...its not noisy or annoying..its a perfect gentle noise that gives her goose bumps and sends her right to sleep. She said even when she's not wanting to fall asleep, she turns it on just to relax with the soothing sound, only to find herself taking a nice nap!! Coming from her means a million!!

This works great. After using this for a year we just bought a second one to put in our son's room. He is 2.5 and kept waking up in the middle of the night.

This is the best investment you could ever make for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessing","review":"We bought this for when the grandkids come. They are used to air purifiers in their room at home. While they were here, they slept well. The baby could cry and only wake those who needed to be awake.

Works great for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helps with city noises, night owl neighbors","review":"I love this thing. We live in the city, in an apartment complex with a lot of people. We got new neighbors recently who like to come home and play their stereo at 3 o'clock in the morning on weekdays. I was already wearing earplugs to bed, but could still hear them. Talking to them only sort of worked, so we got this. It's amazing. It's not super loud, but it helps create a sound environment in your bedroom or whatever so that extra noises don't wake you up. You can also use it if someone's playing music in the middle of the day, and you just don't really want to hear it. If you need something to mask noises in your environment, get it!The sound is a bit like a very fan, but also sounds a little like the ocean to me. Very pleasant whooshing sound, and the pitch and volume can be adjusted. I watched a few videos on Youtube before I bought it, so check those out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great White Noise Machine","review":"I ordered three of these machines from Amazon. Three came in good working condition and one did not. When I informed Amazon that one machine didn't work, Amazon immediately sent me a USPS mailing label for a refund. The other two machines work great. They can be set on a high and low setting. The low setting, though, is plenty loud for a kid's room.This machine is great for kids but I also would have liked to use it in my NYC apartment. It would have worked well at blocking out extraneous outside noises. The sound it makes is a constant rush of air and the machine appears to be very durable. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I was very disappointed in this product.

I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product if you need to block out snoring","review":"I purchased this product because the reviews stated by several purchasers that this machine did a good job blocking out obtrusive noise, even on the lower fan speed. One review specifically referred to blocking out snoring which was my reason for considering this machine. My husband snores and we currently use a fan in the room for the \\"white noise\\" but wanted something that wouldn't cool down the room in the winter. The \\"white noise\\" produced by this machine on the high setting wasn't loud enough. After several nights of trying different locations for the machine, the only way I could block out his snoring was to put the machine on the bed, right next to my head with the machine on high. Needless to say, I returned this product. If you want this machine to block out snoring, I don't think this is the product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clinical bought this product Psychologist","review":"I bought this product for my clinic since I heard noise coming from the other room of the clinic. It I worked nicely, but only for 1 day. After that it stopped working. An electric engineer who checked on it told me the engine was burnt down. Since I live in Isreal it is too much effort and time and money consuming, and I will have to find another solution. So I am very much disappointed for wasting my time and money.

Currently, we use my iPod w/ white noise downloaded and we have it turned up really loud. The problem is that the iPod has a slight pause b/w tracks that can be disruptive. I *thought* the Marpac Sleep Conditioner would solve this problem. I thought wrong. You could whisper outside my son's closed door and be heard over this pathetically low white noise. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as advertised","review":"first things first. This thing will not make a DENT in another person snoring in a room. If there is a sound in the same room as the marcpac you WILL hear it.It doesn't say it in the description but I have heard claims that this will mask construction noise. It WON'T. If they're building a house anywhere in your vicinity you will absolutely hear hammers and saws. This item also does not mask noise if something is pounding on the wall of the room that the marcpac is in. It also will not work for very large rooms. It will only really work for a small bedroom. Forget the living room.Don't get me wrong. It does kinda work. It will probably help you sleep you're neighbor is grinding coffee and that bothers you. You will still be able to hear children playing outside, dogs barking and helicopters.If you have a lot of noise around your house, I would suggest getting an electronic white noise machine so you can crank the volume up. This one only has two settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Nights Sleep","review":"This is the second Sleepmate we purchased. The first one is in my four month old Grandchild's bedroom at my daughter's home. It works well to let the parents get some sleep since the baby loves the constant sound.

The manner in which it operates was not what I expected...to me it's like a little, loud fan in cylinder where you can adjust how much noise escapes (via the holes and slits).

Guess I may need to buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep -- Yay!","review":"While I still am awakened at 4:30 am by a sudden rush of commuters with bad mufflers on their way to the factory down the street, this little sound machine makes it possible for me to fall back to sleep again as my ears get used to the two sounds merged. Yay. So what I'm saying is this: For me, sudden new loud sounds can make their way through the white noise, BUT, if that noise is sustained your mind will readily accept it as part of the white noise and go back to sleep. This means no worry about missing the alarm, or the baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud motor and was sent a used item.","review":"I just got this thing and there is a high pitched whinny sound that's coming from the motor.

We don't think we're dependent on it, but people in hotels can be loud, and B&B;'s have creaky floors when you get up to go to the bathroom.I used to have earplugs to help me sleep, but after those got lost I still found myself waking up at ever sound. I'm not even a light sleeper, it's just living in an apartment is loud.All in all, a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"White noise machine","review":"This product is dependable, well made and the noise is pleasant; much better than the synthetic noise machines.

I had the machine on \\"Hi\\" and it in no way blocked out any noise at all! I could hear the dogs barking outside, cars going by and noise from the other end of the house. This machine didn't even block out the noise of our very quiet ceiling fan. I have to still use our fan by our bed in the hope to get a good rest. For the price of this machine I assumed it would be phenomenal. It is not worth it. I am returning this machine and checking into a much less expensive model that works so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not relaxing at all","review":"I understand how this product would be useful for some people to drown out other noises, but it is not at all relaxing to listen to. It just sounds like a fan. I'm not sure what this \\"whooshing\\" sound is people are talking about? I bought it for my 8 month old son's room and when I had it turned on it was so distracting that he was looking around for where the sound was coming from, so I had to shut it off to put him down for the night. It's too industrial sounding. I understand how it would help some people but for a baby it is not at all soothing. I bought the Graco sound machine instead and it sounds beautiful! Great for a nursery."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad product do not buy this","review":"I have used white noise machines for years as I am a light sleeper. This is a bad product.

Enter the Marpac 980.It's organic sound of rushing air (to me, more pleasant and more effective than digitally synthesized white noise and \\"sounds of nature\\" coverups) effectively masks the audio \\"exhaust\\" of clueless neighbors. Follow the instructions for room placement, dial in the tone you prefer and hit the sack. It may not eliminate your resentments toward a populace deadset in expressing itself through noise, but it will let you shut them out when it's time to sleep. It's so worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, could be louder","review":"I received this machine in 3 days! Super quick shipping! I used the machine last night. The sound it emits is exactly what I was looking for. Similar to a fan and very consistent. There are two levels of noise. A lot of reviews say it could be a bit louder, and I'll have to agree. It does the job for me because I don't have any loud noises to cover in my household. I just need a consistent noise to be able to fall asleep and stay asleep. I was hoping it would drown out my husband's snoring but that is definitely not the case. Do not buy this product if you are trying to drown out noise that is in the same room as you because it will not work for that - it's not loud enough! However, it will block out most noises from other rooms and the street (given they aren't extremely loud). I am happy with this product for the kind of use I want to get out of it. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective against bass frequencies","review":"Works well for higher frequencies since it gives the sound of rushing air but I already had a fan for that. It's completely ineffective against what was and is keeping me awake, bass frequencies like helicopters flying over, large trucks from nearby construction, footsteps on the ceiling, etc. If there's a product that produces a constantly, low bass tone I'd love to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generates more than just white noise","review":"For the last 8 years, my wife and I have used a white noise generator to help us sleep. Unfortunately, a power surge destroyed it, so we started looking for another. This product looked promising because it didn't use a prerecorded white noise loop; it actually generates white noise.The problem with this product is that you can hear the high pitch whine of the fan inside the unit in addition to the white noise caused by the air whooshing out of the slots. This made the noise it generates sounds more like a low power hair dryer, than a true white noise generator. For the price, you think they could have used a quieter fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice machine","review":"Nice white noise machine. Like other reviewers, I prefer the \\"mechanical\\" nature of the sound over recorded white noise or radio station static. The softest sound, however, is a bit loud. It is louder than a box fan on its lowest setting. So, if you are using a fan and like it as white noise, know that this will be louder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound sleep","review":"I received this as a gift from my husband. I had nagged him for years about his snoring. We also live on a very busy and loud street, so this product has been the perfect solution! I can adjust the sound from the machine to what type of noise is irritating me that night (or day!) It took me two nights to get adjusted to the noise and to learn what worked for me, but after that I fell in love with it! I even take it with me when I travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but effective","review":"I was a bit concerned about previous reviewers wishing the Marpac were louder, but I decided to try the SleepMate 980A anyway just because I didn't want to run the a/c's fan all winter. Indeed, the Marpac SleepMate is not as loud as a wallunit a/c, but having tried it a couple times this autumn, it seems to work well enough, blocking out most city noise (including construction every morning across the street and loud trucks on a busy thoroughfare). I am very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sleep ever","review":"I was skeptical that this could be as good as my go-to box fan, but this product lulls me to sleep and keeps me asleep.

After reading all of the positive reviews I knew I couldn't go wrong with this. It does a perfct job of drowing out any noises in the house, and is actually a sound that puts me right to sleep. It's great for shift workers, like myself. After a long night of 11/7, you laying in bed in the morning trying to sleep while the kids are getting ready for school, you turn on the sound conditioner and peace and quiet begins. I've gotten used to hearing the sound of this to where everytime I go to bed this gets turned on. Basically now, I have trouble going to sleep if it's not on . I highly recommend this to anyone that looks forward to a better nights sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for helping me sleep","review":"Love it.

After many, many inquiries I was finally able to purchase this conditioner. At the end of the day, it was quite expensive for me to do so. I've had it about 2 years now.I was under the impression that it would last longer than this (being made in the US) even though the warranty was for only 12 months duration. Mine has developed another noise (outside the usual 'white-noise'). It sounds like a bearing is failing; as its rather a 'tapping' sound. Interestingly, this is a simple machine to produce. It's made up of a miniature fan mechanism (yes, with blades and all). I'm just wondering if I'd be better off replacing it with a miniature desk fan and sitting that beside my bed (directing the blades away from me when it's cold).Despite the above the conditioner has worked well in the past to assist me to fall and stay asleep by blocking out irregular noises. With this extra noise, it fails to improve my sleep now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noise Machine Sleep Mate 980-A","review":"Works wonderfully.

If you just want a soothing sound to lull you to sleep then this machine is WAY TOO LOUD. Even running inside a closet on low speed with cap and collar fully closed it can still be heard throughout the room. But at least that achieves an acceptable sound level.

Regular mail is all we ask, not UPS or anything fancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Loud!!!","review":"This machine is too loud for sleeping. The volume control isn't a normal volume control; you can adjust how much air flows through, but it doesn't really make it any quieter.

Still with all the noise he didn't wake up from everyone else in the house and he was able to have naps during the day with no disturbance.Pros: Good noise levelsCons: Price is a little high just for a noisemakerAll in all; I WOULD recommend this as THE noisemaker to get, going by experience and others that I know that use this too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good sound machine","review":"Great product, loud enough to cover all the noises coming from outside.

I was getting tired of the constant refilling and cleaning of the humidifier and was more interested in the noise it created anyway. I purchased the SleepMate Sound Conditioner after reading the reviews and my only fear was that it would not be as loud as the humidifer (I keep the fan on high). Well, with two speeds and the ability to make the tone of the Sound Conditioner higher or lower, it is just as loud, if not louder on its highest speed than the humidifier. It was WELL worth the money & I plan to buy another Sound Conditioner when our baby is born in May."},{"rating":"2","title":"works like a charm","review":"We got this when I was pregnant.

Unfortunately, an interstate highway crosses the valley where I live and the truck noise is very irritating at times and I need to close the windows in order to fall asleep. The Sleepmate covers the sounds completely with the sound of rushing air similar to an air conditioner and now I can leave the windows open. I use and need only the lowest setting on the Sleepmate and the pitch can be adjusted as well. The higher setting would probably mask much worse sound conditions than I have.I am pleased with the product and I recommend it.

I got this to drown out the ruckus of my upstairs neighbor's stripper shoes, slamming closet, etc... since one can only wear earplugs so many nights in a row. Basically there are 2 rotating sections you adjust to try to match the frequency of the offending noise. But in my case this actually varies quite a bit. Plus you are supposed to place this between you & the source of noise, but here it is all over my ceiling so not possible. I do like the soothing whoosh from this product, but bottom line is, it's just not loud enough even at the higher setting. The only way it works is if I place it on my pillow right next to my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"If you want to cover the sound of a baby breathing, this product won't work.

I do not know if it was the particular Marpac sound conditioner that I ended up with or what, but the white noise emitted was not uniform in that there was a regular clicking sound amongst the white noise. It was not a pronounced click, but very subtle. Unfortunately, my brain clasped onto that minor little click and would not let go of it resulting in \\"no sleep for me.\\" However, it may have just been the one I ended up with.

She didnt even want one because she said it would keep her awake but I made her try it anyway. Now she sleeps so much better and I cant sleep without it myself. From the way it looks I was pretty skeptical about it but it had such good reviews I bought it anyway. Dont let the looks fool you, it works great and actually has a fairly wide variety of sound and pitch just from turning the side or top to conver/uncover more air holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"I was skeptical of this product as I am of most noise machines. Typical white noise machines have no bass to them and that is the key to cancelling the noise and helping \\"hum\\" you to sleep. UNtil I found this product, nothing worked as well as our powerful fan, which has a solid bass tone to it.This product works just as good as our fan, and without the constant blowing on us in the winter time. I also like the fact we can take it on vacation with us and use it rather than turning on the a/c or heat, just to make noise.I would definately recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying another!","review":"We bought two of these 11 years ago. We have used them almost every night for the last 11 years. We take them on vacations, to our cabin, etc. and they are always in our children's rooms. Finally, my three-year old beat one up enough that it stopped. That is a pretty good investment after 11 years. The other one is still going strong. I'm just buying another to replace the one that broke. It should last me another decade!

I don't need the listen to the amazon rain forest or a thunderstorm... but I do need some noise at night to sleep well. I had been using a fan for years, but this is much more economical electricity wise... and it doesn't make the room cold or drafty in the winter like a fan does. AND... I can easily pop it into my travel bag when I go away... impossible with my fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this mechanical device over electronic competitors","review":"I purchased this unit as well as an Ecotones Duet to help cover up noise in my son's bedroom as well as in our master bedroom.This unit may have limited options and lacks \\"sex appeal,\\" but the quality of the white noise it produces is just right for our sleep needs. At first I thought it might be too loud, but moving away from it slightly and using in practice made me realize it was just right. We now travel with it pretty much wherever we go to make sure we can put our toddler to bed and not wake him as well as to mask traffic and neighbor noises in hotels and the like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best purchase ever.","review":"This is the by far the best $50 I have ever spent. I know it seems kind of pricey but compared to most others it's a bargain in price and quality. I work 3rd shift and my house is right on a busy road and it's difficult to fall asleep in the mornings when traffic is picking up. Also, my husband has a 5 year old kid with a whiney,high pitched, screechy voice who wakes up at the buttcrack of dawn and visits every other weekend. Once she is up and peeling paint off the walls with that voice I can't fall asleep to save my life and this machine drowns her out wonderfully. It's like having a fan running without the wind which is a nice bonus in the New England winter. I absolutely love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stopped working after 5 months for no reason","review":"This machine worked great, blocking out noise perfectly for about 5 months. Then one evening I turned it off so that I could watch TV and when I went to turn it back on to go to sleep, there was no sound. I tried different outlets, different volume settings, and nothing. I can tell it's on because there's a faint vibration that starts when I flip the switch, but no noise. I'm extremely upset about this because now I can't sleep at night and I received zero paperwork with the product that would allow me to take advantage of any warranty and it's way beyond the return policy deadline. It's a shame because absent the short, sudden death it was a really good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it - better for smaller rooms","review":"I bought two of these, one for my son's room and one for mine. We used to use box fans but it's cold and the air circulation from the fans made it too chilly in the rooms. So I decided to try this. I was hesitant because of the price but it's totally worth it! Blocks out sounds wonderfully for my sleeping toddler. He has a standard size bedroom not too big or too small and it works great! but in my 3rd floor master suite which is probably close to 1000 sq the sound isn't near as powerful even on the highest setting. It still does the trick though especially for my son's smaller room, my dogs can bark, I can walk on the hard wood floor outside his room, trash truck drives by, none of it wakes his slumber totally worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"white noise muffles unwanted noise","review":"I'm pleased with the Sound Screen White Noise Generator.

The volume is adjustable in both level and depth. We run ours continually in our daughter's nursery and she sleeps through anything. Now when we take her into her room and she hears the white noise sound, it's a cue to her to fall asleep. She is asleep within 1-2 minutes. And it's small enough to take on road trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat product","review":"We purchased this machine for our toddler's room after previously using a humidifier w/o water for noise in our non-sound proof home. The lowest setting is much louder than the humidifier we were using, but it seems to be working just fine for him. The only issue I can say is that the switch is a bit awkward - I consistently press it to the higher setting when trying to turn it off, but that is more of a user error on my part than anything defective with the product. Good product for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the dog sleeps soundly","review":"This wonderful little machine allows my dog to sleep. She isn't bothered by the dogs outside.

Parties and loud talking to all hours of the night both echoing through the floor and when they took their frequent smoke breaks to the landing below my bedroom.The very first night of using the Sleepmate I slept soundly with no disturbances. It was only in the morning did I discover their latest party was still going on. Thank you for a good nights sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"This little machine is a God's send. It does an incredible job of masking the TV noise which emanates from the next room with which it shares a wall. I can watch movies and actually hear the dialog as opposed to just looking in order not to disturb my husband who goes to bed early. I can sleep late if I want to and not hear anything going on around us - it is a blessing. My only complaint is - why did i wait so long to get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good bye ear plugs","review":"For the last 15 years or so, I've been using ear plugs to help me sleep, until I recently had surgery which required me to use a humidifier for a few weeks. During the recovery period, I noticed I would fall asleep without my ear plugs, and that the humidfier noise kept the outside noises... outside. Of course I came here to Amazon to see what they have in white noise machines and read the reviews on the MARPAC sound conditioners.I settled on the 980A, which is working much better than I anticipated. The unit has 2 different settings, a low and a high, of which I have only had to use the low setting. The unit has an outside shell that spins to open up additional holes, which puts out more white noise. I have not had to use my ear plugs since purchasing this and I highly recommend the 980A to anyone who would like some sort of aid trying to keep outside noises at bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was","review":"It does not have the volume that I need or perhaps it is too small for the room that I have it in.

It cost a lot of money for 10 minutes of use!We are very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"smooth, rattle-free, compact, and actually works","review":"The idea is quite simple, almost so simple that I felt slightly idiotic paying $45+ for it, but I must say that it is worth it. The concealed fan is steady, meaning I don't hear any rhythmic clicks or other noises being emitted. I've used window size fans for the same purpose for many years, even during winter months; they all eventually start rattling, unlike this compact machine. It's also nice to realize that the marpac creates comparable if not better 'white noise' than a window fan, but must consume only a fraction of the energy due to its size. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and under-performing","review":"I purchased this in the hopes of diminishing background noise in my office.

Their are several settings and the loudest on is not extremely loud; it is just loud enough to drown out the usual noises that people make in the house (doing dishes, the washing machine, ambulances that are far away but annoying, house guests talking at normal volume in their guest bedrooms right across the hall from you).

We liked it so much, we have since bought two more for our kids bedrooms and use them both at night and at naptime.The noise when turned on is present, but not overpowering.

It seemed to work alright initially but it wasn't until I threw this machine out that I realized that it was actually disturbing my sleep patterns. It was loud enough to cover outside noises but the fan spun too quickly so it didn't allow for a deep sleep. After I tossed it and went back to a regular indoor fan I realized how much better I slept with the fan. I point the fan away from me so as not to feel the wind, so that's not what's causing the longer and more restful sleep. It's the actual rotation speed of the fan. It spins more slowly and thus has a more pleasing and relaxed sound to it.These machines may work for some people but not for me, as I have now figured out."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't sleep without it now!","review":"Absolutely *love* this product.

This is quite loud, and does an amazing job of blocking out most outside noises. One of our cats (boy) likes to yowl and yowl at night... This has probably saved HIS life. (I'm grumpy when awoken late at night/early morning). I can even watch movies one room away on our 7.1 surround theater without bothering my girlfriend. Excellent investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound on second purchase is completely different and lower.","review":"I bought this a few months ago and needed a second one for my daughter where she stays during the day. This second is completely different (and they were both 980), it is not as loud at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly loud enough","review":"I was excited about the positive reviews on this item. We've been using a clean air machine at high speed to down out noises, so I was excited to get a REAL sound conditioner to block out sounds of dogs barking. However, when we plugged it in, we thought for sure it was not properly turned on. It barely made any noise at all.I can't imagine any use for it, plus the price is really inflated for what you get - a circle that you can hold with one hand. I'm returning it - the sound of air moving in my central air system is louder than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound sleep","review":"The former Sleepmate- now Dohm-DS Sound Conditioner is a lifesaver! We got one years ago to block out hubby's snoring. It also blocks out traffic noise, barkingdogs, tv's in other rooms of the house, etc. Now hubby sleeps with a CPAP so no more snoring and we both get peaceful sleep. Hopefully this one will last as long as the first one did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud White Noise","review":"I am happy with how loud this white noise machine is. It has two speeds to adjust the volume, and you can turn the top to make the pitch adjust. The pitch does not adjust much, but it does make a difference you can hear. We no longer wake up from the traffic noise at night that used to be a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep Mate? More like Checkmate.","review":"My roommate recently got one of these. The thing is like a tornado, but louder and more likely to inflict critical damage on your body. Take last night for example: it kept me up until nearly 4 AM as I lay awake in my bed since 11 PM. It has a calming effect until you realize that it won't allow you to get to sleep when you have class early the next morning. Then, it's more like an abject terror effect. Definitely drowns out noise, but I hope you're willing to put up with a relentless whooshing all night before you spend $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marpac Sleepmate 980-A","review":"I just bought this machine to drown out the sound of my neighbor's loud thumps/doors closing at 3:30 a.m. Unfortunately, I am hearing impaired and can barely hear this machine.

I might still take it on vacation with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective from the Get-go","review":"As soon as I received this product, it made nothing more than a weak whirring noise. I thought maybe it needed to warm up for first-time use, but after a few minutes it shut itself off. Then it would not power on at all. Obviously, I ended up returning it and I was very disappointed since I was looking forward to using this product daily. I would have purchased another, however I fear it will be defective as well; quite a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"great device","review":"I am a sleepwalking- sleep terror person and my husband was tired of the fan I wanted on to create \\"sound\\" and relax me. I got this machine and I seriously love it. I find the noise to be pure, rich, steady and comforting. I like the simplicity of it and how easy it is to use. I have been sleeping longer and deeper. I also LOVE that it has not light on it to create a distraction. I think my dog and husband also are fans.....!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a big difference!","review":"I bought this because my new neighbor starts his humongous truck at 5 AM and it sounds like he is in my house. His kid plays basketball for hours. The smack of the ball against the shared driveway and the back board echos between our houses. The Marpac unit helps to muffle these sounds. It doesn't completely eradicate them as I'd hoped, but it takes the edge off the sound enough, allowing me to at least partially retain my sanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us - not loud enough","review":"I got this item last week .

I used it a grand total of about 15 minutes.I've used these before in a counselling setting to keep people from hearing the counselling session through the door. This newer model has a terrible motor in it that makes a sort of high pitched whine, especially bad on the high setting but still bad on the low setting. I wish I had realized this before the return window expired. Not recommended. Go with an electronic white noise machine that uses less electricity and has no whiney electric motor.This is a fan inside a housing with adjustable vents to sort of change the sound. The idea is ok. The motor noise is not ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"The perfect answer for those easily disturbed by various noises at night. The sound of air moving fills the room without being annoying. Not much to look at but absolutely meets the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"This product is simple. Want white noise to block out external sounds? Get this, it works well. It's been a month or so and I've been happy with my decision to go with this rather than a \\"burbling creek\\" or \\"ocean\\" sleep machine. I got the two-speed model, but have yet to feel a need to bump it up to the higher speed. Although it could be priced a bit lower, I believe it's worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies and toddlers","review":"I bought one of these for my 1 year old daughter and she still uses it at the age of 2.5.

Most of the reviews of the Marpac were great, but I did read several that mentioned an unpleasant high pitched sound that was produced alongside the white noise. When I received the item and turned it on, I heard this high pitched noise immediately. I left the unit on for a bit to see if I would stop hearing it, but it continued to bother my ears. My partner, who has normal hearing, also found it annoying. I sent it back. I've continued to use my fan and air filter to produce masking sounds instead.Amazon provided quick and awesome service as per usual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"If you are trying to mask snoring with a machine, this will not work. Other noises maybe, but again, definitely not snoring. Use ear plugs or better yet, take a pill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I bought this to put in my baby's room.

When I'm nursing my little guy at nap time, this noisemaker often puts me to sleep as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If it blocks the sound of a 2 year old out then it works!","review":"I have tried many noise makers before and they were not loud enough. I really did want to spend 50 bucks on one but I thought I would give ti and try and I am sooooo happy i did. My sister and her two kids under 2 moved in with me and I was a bit worried they would keep me up. But seriously not anymore it blocks out pretty much every sound. Also you can control how loud the sound is by rotating the top and middle section. I would highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Went up in smoke!!!

Thank you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High-Pitched Fan Defeats Purpose","review":"The problem with this product is that you can hear the high pitch whine of the fan inside the unit in addition to the white noise caused by the air whooshing out of the slots. This made the noise it generates sounds more like a low power hair dryer, than a true white noise generator. For the price, you think they could have used a quieter fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent white noise machine","review":"My husband and I (and now the dog) have become accustomed to white noise from a floor fan. Only problem was in the winter I was freezing my behind off. We came upon this machine. It is the perfect solution! We all sleep well and none of us are popsicles in the morning. We put it on the lower sound control. The more elevated sound would be great if you're somewhere there is lots of noise. We're planning on taking it on our next trip as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product!","review":"I have one of these in every bedroom of my home. My guest love spending the night and sleeping well from the relaxation the Sleepmate provides. I also use the Sleepmate 980A in my granddaughter's room while she naps during the day.

A coworker recommended getting a white noise machine to drown out the neighbor's dogs that were waking my family up at 6am - he had lived in Manhatten and said they worked.We bought our first one of these and put it in our bedroom. Worked like charm. We now own 3 - one in each bedroom, and we always take one with us on trips. It really helps us all sleep better.The unit has two volume settings, and you can twist the top and side to adjust the noise. Works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"a complete waste of money","review":"After reading all the rave reviews we decided to try this product, because we live in an apartment complex with noisy neighbors who often make it hard for us to study and sleep, and we were tired of having to cover up the sounds with a big old fan that blows in cold air. This purchase was a mistake. I am returning the SleepMate because it's just awful: it's a tiny little fan (you can feel the cold air coming out of it) disguised as something fancy. The lower setting is a joke, you could hear a mouse fart through it; even the higher setting is not enough to even barely mask noises.If you use a fan to create white noise, stick to it. A regular fan will do a much better job for much less money - the SleepMate is a joke and a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinnitus Suferers Beware!","review":"I'm sure this does the job for a lot of people - it is loud, and oddly the same loudness next to the bed or across the room! and on low does hava an added high pitched noise, so if that bothers you - don't do it. But the far more serious problem is that yeah, I slept right through it and the a/c fan on....and when I woke up and turned it off, my ears are ringing louder than they have since I first got tinnitus 15 years ago. And it's been 12 hours. I really really wanted that perfect night's sleep others have had - but this is actually scary for me. I haven't had a noticable ringing in years...and this is loud. So if you do suffer with the same problem, I'd recommend an alternative - any alternative solution. Good luck to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Meets all expectations.

It produces a consistent white noise that surprisingly masks intrusive sounds better than I had anticipated when I first plugged it in. It can be adjusted to several levels of volume and sound pitches.

I want to take it on vacation and see how it works in motel rooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A homerun!!!!","review":"Living in the city, I can testify to the noise level outside one's home. Passerby s, cars, cars with loud music and even the noisy or inconsiderate neighbor upstairs or downstairs. This machine is the best. It has two levels of white noise it can create. Within one day I was used to it. The noise is very similar to the air conditioner. I turn it on every night and sleep comfortably. I even missed it when I went to the Poconos for vacation. Hearing dead silence was weird at first. LOL. I highly recommend it especially for people who work 4 x 12's or midnights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for babies","review":"Is pretty good but, could be slightly louder to be great.You get what you pay for.

I already owned a sleep machine featuring sounds--crickets, the ocean, a locomotive, etc.--but it never really worked for me because my ear could always pick up a pattern, and I'd get so focused on it that I couldn't fall asleep. Then I read reviews of the Marpac 980A white noise sleep machine and they were so positive that I decided to give it a try. Magic--steady and pattern-free.

Overall, this product works well and I highly recommend it.PROS:1) I like the fact that there are multiple settings to get the \\"white noise\\" that suits you best.2) No wind, as with a fan.3) It really blocks out other noises well. I live near a road with traffic, and it blocks out the traffic noise very well.CONS:None really.

I saw the fan as something that was also going to battle the furnace over the winter so I looked for a solution. These machines work great.

By turning the cover you increase or decrease the area through which the noise comes through and the volume of the white noise.I found the machine that costs several times more to be more worthwhile.

We started with a fan and a humidifier. And they worked OK. I looked at white noise machines before, but didn't know if they were worth the investment. When I started a new job, my boss had this machine in her office, so I decided to try it for personal use. And I/we couldn't be happier. We don't have a huge bedroom, so I put this in the corner of the room away from the bed and it works fabulous. It drowns out windy nights, barking dogs, and neighbors that have loud parties. We got the dual speed because of other reviews and I'm glad we did. We've used both settings and it's nice to have the option."},{"rating":"2","title":"My roommate snores...","review":"I got this after a couple of sleepless nights due to my roommates excessive snoring.

After research and reading reviews I purchased the Marpac Sleepmate. Although I feel it's overpriced for such a basic gadget, it works very well. On the low setting it cancels out nearly all peripheral noise...the high setting blocks it all out.I read a few reviews saying that it did not create enough white noise (in terms of volume) Unless you live next to a train station this will work perfect...by the way, I live 300 yards from a freeway and sleep with the window a little open...this does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed! This is way too quiet!","review":"Ordered this to drown out the loud neighbors surrounding our daughter's bedroom in our condo complex. For over 2 years we have used a white noise cd on repeat all night long and are tired of cd player's motor burning out. Like the design of this product, the smooth sound, the padding on the bottom and the simplicity to use it, BUT it is not nearly as loud as we need it to be.I am shocked at all the reviews saying that it was loud enough to drown out their neighborhood noise, especially those in a condo/apt situation. I dont think this would even drown out a dog barking or knock on the door. The sound even at its loudest is barely enough to fill our daughter's small bedroom. We will be returning this product right away. So bummed this wasn't as great as it was boasted :("},{"rating":"2","title":"White Noise Maker -- That Makes White Noise as Promised","review":"I figured I would take the time to write a review because I found the reviews of others very useful. This ugly little machine simply Does what it is designed to do. It makes white noise! Nothing more, nothing less. It has 2 different levels (each of which you can open and close to change the sound a bit). Its not full of features, night lights or no other crap. It simply makes white noise (which helps drown out other noises). I got it..to cut the sound between my room and my roomates room. We're both in our 20's and sometimes I need to get some rest when he is still up chilling. I have only had it for about a month now but I am VERY happy with it. No complaints whatsoever thus far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good, be wary of EMF!","review":"This device was pretty good, the kids loved sleeping with it running. Then I purchased a Gauss meter and discovered a whopping 400.0mG of EMF radiating from it.Considering that most countries recommend nothing higher than 1.0mG, and anything over 10.0mG is considered an extreme cancer risk this is completely unacceptable.The EMF declined rapidly as the range from the device increases, effectively dropping to 0 at 6 feet. However people that put this on their nightstand should immediately rectify that situation!

If it was quieter, I think it would be good for blocking out higher frequency sounds like a neighbor's TV, but it's pretty overwhelming. I have even placed it far away from where I have been situated and I don't find it to be comforting or relaxing, just annoying. I don't think it would block out banging and definitely not low frequency sounds like a subwoofer, someone's annoyingly low-pitched voice, or loud engines from outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Too Loud","review":"I was super excited to get a new sound machine as mine is on the fritz.

It was quite smaller than I expected and was not loud enough to drown out any noise. The a/c unit in the room he sleeps in was much louder than the Sound Conditioner so it was of no use to us. However, I have to commend the customer service. They are great! We had some problems tracking down the package and had to contact them. They replied quickly and even checked back with us to make sure we got our package.

She now says that I do not snore. The sound conditioner is a \\"white noise\\" that can be adjusted for volume and some limited range of frequencies. The noise is constant and masks any intermittent sounds. I was a skeptic but this product works better than I could have hoped.

I whole heartedly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Works!","review":"I purchased the Marpac White Noise machine for my son for Christmas. He had always used a fan to block out outside noise while trying to sleep. I could always hear the fan in my bedroom and it would annoy me.

This works well for outside noises like cars, birds in the morning and other annoyances. However, it doesn't block out the television sound from the next room. This is the one thing that he doesn't like about the machine.

I believe that due to the cheap construction quality it produces an intermittent whiny high pitched noise in addition to the constant middle and lower frequency noises it produces to create \\"white noise\\". In the end, the intermittent high pitches noise of the motor inside will come and go regardless of placing padding underneath or the settings you use.

I looked at expensive sound machines but was wary of being able to sleep with the sounds they had to offer. This machine is great! It sounds like wind rushing though, sort of like a vaporizer running.

I think they could have made it more attractive however, since you will have it sitting out in your bedroom. It sounds like you have a small to medium sized fan running in your room, which is what I was looking for. (i.e., did not want one of those silly machines with chirping crickets that actually KEEP you awake.) If you are looking to completely block out background noise, just buy a giant fan instead.

This noise machine has been a god send for two reasons; 1) I can adjust the sound levels and proximity to my person, and 2) it creates a natural sound because it moves air inside the canister and not artificially by way of a speaker.

If I ever move to a standalone home I will still use it. I even have it on the light switch circuit so it turns on automatically when I turn on the bedroom lights.Since it's pretty well built, so my only complaint is that it is too heavy to put in a suitcase. If I am driving to a travel destination, however, I pack it up just like my clothes.I think the biggest surprise was reading all the reviews from people who have the same problem with night sound that I have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for a small apartment on a busy street in a large city","review":"Fantastic for blocking out outside sounds:-small-easy to use-pleasant sounding-masks out car, pet, hallway, music and a multitude of other city sounds-cats aren't scared of it-draws very little power-looks good toohighly recommended for city dwellers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Product worth every penny","review":"I have been looking for an alternative to our floor fans that we have in our bedroom. I have the unfortunate \\"joy\\" of hearing my heartbeat in my right ear and we have very annoying dogs all around us that bark night and day. My husband and I have gotten VERY used to sleeping with fans on, but during the winter months, it's a little too cold. So when I saw this product online and after reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try. I have to say that I couldn't be any happier with this little machine. It has a high/low setting and the sound it makes sounds just like our fans. It helps to drown out the noise in my ear and we don't hear the barking dogs at all. I think most people would find this noise annoying, but for me it's helped me to get a good night sleep. I'll probably take this little guy with us when we travel..I just wish they had a battery operated version of this so when we go camping I can actually enjoy the outdoors...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!","review":"My husband snores and has woken me up several times a night for many years. Recently, when we were staying in a hotel, the AC kept waking him up during the night as it cycled on and off. The hotel provided a \\"pillow menu\\" that included these white noise machines. I got one for us to help him with the AC noise. What I learned was that it enabled me to sleep through his snoring! I couldn't believe it! I ordered one on the spot and found it waiting for me when I got home. What a wonderful invention! The outside noises no longer wake me on warm nights when the windows are open. I don't wake up to his snoring (and I don't have to wake him up to get him to stop).This machine is a miracle worker as far as I am concerned!One tip- if you are trying to drown out noise that is fairly loud, move the machine closer to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item through Amazon","review":"I purchased this itemMarpac SleepMate 980A Electro-Mechanical Sound Conditionerthrough Amazon in Oct last year.

A single mother with a newborn moved in upstairs and I have not been able to get adequate sleep for months now. The baby cries at all hours of the night and the woman is just as bad. She is up at 5am until 8am thumping around like Jurassic Park with her thunder thighs, then sleeps all day long and awakens at 4pm to the sound of her crying baby and is up again until midnight. She stomps around so badly that the walls shake and the popcorn ceiling falls from the sky. I purchased the sound machine in hopes that it would block out the elephant noise but unfortunately at full blast it is still too quiet to mask the Serengeti."},{"rating":"1","title":"SleepMate","review":"Makes a lot of noise but does not seem to block other noises per myself.

Lasted many many years, and in four different homes. More recently, have used a Brookstone digital unit that just died. So I ordered the Dohm-dual speed with a happy recollection of the Hammacher similar unit, but this Dohm unit is MUCH too loud, even on the \\"low\\" setting. Anywhere in the bedroom. So I returned it for inconsistency with the webpage description. Have moved on to theMarpac TSC 330 Travel Sound Conditioner, and it is great; excellent volume and sound adjustments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a strange mechanical noise","review":"When I received my Dohm and plugged it in, it definitely made the white noise sound. But if you are sensitive to noise or have exceptionally good hearing, you may notice this also makes a sort of mechanical \\"whirr\\" sound that is very unsettling. I returned the item and just bought a small clip fan instead - works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke Down the 1st Day","review":"In fact, this machine stopped working within a few hours. When it was working it provided a decent noise level but whithin a few hours it just went dead. I sent it back for a replacement hoping that the new one would actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud clanking noise...","review":"I bought this item for my infant sons nursery, he slept with us for 6 months and was quite used to our sound conditioner. My Mom purchased one for her house and it worked really well. We used ours for about a month before it started making an annoying clanking noise. The only way I can stop this noise is by turning the unit on its side or placing a towel under it so it is at an angle. When I have it on its side it is very slow to start up and sometimes will only work in the faster mode. I am sure it is not designed to work on its side but the clanking noise is horrible. The idea is to cancel out noise and create a calming white noise- so disappointed in this product. I would have returned it but it was already out of its return period by the time the problem occurred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"I never had one before.

Actually bought this to use in our vacation house because it was TOO QUIET there. Before, we heard every little click of the heat or air conditioner, creak of the floor...and this steady ambient noise lulled us into peaceful slumber. We found it also is a lifesaver when the house is full of cousins, babies, grandparents who get up at 5:00AM...with yippy dogs. Highly recommended...worth every penny.When it arrived, this was a lot smaller than what I imagined...which is nice because I hide it under the bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"It is a good product.

I would recommend this product to anyone who has problems falling asleep or staying asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced and unreliable","review":"The (somewhat adjustable) sound this thing makes is soothing... until the bearings go bad. Then you get irritating bearing noises. I had mine for less than two years before I had to start wearing earplugs to muffle the bearing noise. Admittedly, the thing has been knocked off my nightstand a couple times.I'd pay twenty five dollars for a replacement, but not the asking price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your Noise Issue - No Good for Cubicles","review":"I bought one to help deal with the folks at work. I sit in a cubicle all day and was about to loose it listening to all the loud, click-clack keyboards, mouse clicking and scrolling, phone conversations, bad eating manners and etc. It was suggested that I get a white noise machine. Well.....it didn't help. You can still hear everything that you wish you didn't have to listen to all day. It sounds like a loud fan running and I agree with the woman that said that the design/color is just awful. I had to hide the machine on my desk to prevent the starring as people walked by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for","review":"I purchased this item hoping it was similar in sound to a vaccum or hair dryer to help my 1 month old daughter sleep.

It just wasn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubles as a de-humidifier!!!","review":"If you don't mind the room being robbed of all humidity, then this machine will work well for you.

I found the volume almost useless for my purposes of wishing a \\"White Noise\\" - tuning out the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Sound","review":"I think you will either love this, or hate this item depending on your sound preference. I classify the sound made by this item as \\"noise\\", it is not relaxing at all like wind blowing through trees or waves crashing. Some compare the sound to a fan, but it isn't this either, a fan has a whooshing sound as the blades slowly spin, this is just a constant \\"noise\\". As for masking sounds, it kind of does this at its highest setting, but then it is super annoying. Side slider adjusts for intensity of sound, top adjusts for pitch of sound. If too quiet then the motor is heard. Buy it and see what you think - it interrupted my sleep instead of aiding it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godsend","review":"I bought this for my daughter's apartment. She can now sleep through her roommate's multiple alarm clocks and all the other distracting noises. She says it has made a huge difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I purchased this item when it was the \\"Deal of the Day\\" on Amazon. I was excited to try it as I'm one of the people who sleeps well during summer when the AC is humming at night. I was excited when it arrived, only to find that it makes a noisy motor sound which even the white noise of the air rush cannot hide. I've tried it at various air rush vent positions, but the noise of operation still comes through. It's loud enough to make the machiine useless for sleep. I sent an email to the company asking if this was normal, and even though they state on their web page that they will get back to your email within 48 hours, I still have had no response. That was several weeks ago and I have still had no response from them, either by phone or email. I was very disappointed with this item and at almost $50., it was not worth the money since it does not function as described. I doubt, the noise coming from this machine, would not help anyone sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good music by a promising contemporary composer","review":"I was very impressed with much of the music on this disc. Ms. Bouchard is certainly a very gifted composer whose propensity for creating strange, almost alien structures is amazing. She doesn't use what could be called true melodies as much as pulses of notes strangely independent from each other. There's a kind fluidity to her music as if every note is a drop in a ethereal sea--quite facinating. The title work as well as \\"Eternity\\" are real gems; it's worth buying the CD just for them. Unfortunately, \\"Songs for an Acrobat\\" left me somewhat unsatisfied. Not to say that it's a bad work, but I'm just not able to get excited about it. Yet this CD is still definitely worth the price, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ukrainians read it too!!!","review":"I'm a teacher of English in Ukraine.

So if you liked Smoke Signals, certain themes are carried over and one of the actors, Evan (Thomas Builds-A-Fire) come to Business of Fancydancing. However, don't expect obvious and repitious themes. Alexie has chosen to mimic the episodic format of his poetry to the film and the themes are centered around more of a cyclical than linear format. Overall, an excellent film. The DVD edition is particularly wonderful for its deleted scenes and the option to have commentary by Sherman Alexie and Evan running throughout the film--I would suggest watching it after you've seen the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoid, scantily documented screed","review":"My title says it all. Douglass's frequent use of the passive voice allows him to present such an innocent and wide-eyed yet wildly paranoid account of the cause of the drug epidemic in the West. His \\"documentation\\" largely consists of cobbled-together newspaper articles and dubious material from various sources. The main thrust of the book is \\"evidenced\\" by an account by General Sejna, which of course requires no real documentation. I wonder if Mr. Douglass has heard of Pablo Escobar or any other prominent drug kingpins who actually facilitated the drug epidemic. By Douglass's account, the commies nearly shoved drugs down the throats of the innocent, wide-eyed American youth. Yet even more laughable is his argument that the second wave of feminism was fueled by similar communist machinations. Oh, and I love that Douglass provided a rating for his OWN BOOK here, very objectively giving it a 5 star rating. Pass on this one folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Shocking","review":"I'm just quite shocked at how history could be rewritten so quickly in blaming the CIA for drug smuggling while defectors from the KGB have come out of the wood words to state that the KGB has been doing this along with China, Egypt and Communist Czech Republic's involvement with the \\"anti-Soviet insurgency\\" in Afghanistan during the late 70's and early to mid-80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem, cancelled too soon","review":"Fleeing from life on Earth and its space stations for various reasons, crash landing by sabotage on the destined planet, hidden agendas, secrets and plans, and scifi as a road movie, as a wild west trek across the planes.

Perhaps this is good family entertainment, but overall I found it to be boring, especially after series like Firefly or FarScape, both of which were geared toward an older audience. The storyline had a lot of potential, but as they included children among the cast I found it to be mundane. Probably great for family viewing, but more like \\"Buck Rogers in the 21st Century\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Awful!

The episodes are way out of order on the discs, which will leave you even more confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy is, as Cheesy does","review":"The pilot is a good effort with a nice budget and an okay story. But it becomes clear that this is going to take place on a desolate world with no flashy space scenes or sets that make up part of the imaginary experience of sci-fi.Yes, in the desert traveling with the occassional masked alien. Sci-fi junkies should immediately know what I'm talking about. But okay, so how's the story? Eh, so so. It was given a decent effort though remains pretty cheesy. It is now over 11 years old as well. A bit dated and corny.Sorry fans, spend your money on Stargate and Deep Space instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near Miss Ruined by the Suits","review":"I watched it for awhile but couldn't get into it. Never did understand why, if the government didn't want their colony to succeed, it didn't simply set off the bomb aboard the ship halfway there instead of waiting for them to land. The \\"Wagon Train\\" storyline with thinly-disguised Indians and \\"Guest Starring this Episode\\" humans popping up out of nowhere threw me off. Tim Curry's character's fascination with that early-teenage girl creeped me out so I dropped it.In the end it was just a group of very good actors making the best of very poor scripts until the checks stopped coming. Not much actual \\"science fiction\\", a whole lot of improbable coincidences cobbled together to make up shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth2 preserved!","review":"I saw this series when it first aired and absolutely loved it. I've watched the reruns on SciFi and had managed to put together a home video collection, but it was not as polished or compact as this awesome DVD set. I was really disappointed the show was cancelled, and still have hope that at some point in the future there will be future stories about the Eden Project and their life on Earth2. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys SciFi because they did a great job of creating future gizmos and VR. But even more so, I think I recommend it to those who enjoy seeing both the good and bad aspects of people and how they deal with adversity and challenges."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Disc","review":"I received the DVDs in a very timely fashion. The discs are two-sided, which is fine, but side A on disc two simply will not register on any DVD player, so I have missed 3 of the 6 shows on that disc.

I had weirdly thought it was two seasons, but oddly the amount of storyline was only one season. The only thing that sucks is that when they put the DVDs together they put it in the order it ended up being shown in b/c of football and various sports shows that interrupted the show order, so in the DVD set there are two eps that should be at the beginning of the show that are on the DVD at the end AFTER the finale...odd...but still a great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Episodes out of order","review":"While I was happy to get the series on CD, I was less than thrilled to realize that the episodes were out of order on the disks.

Frankly, its easy to understand if you ever watched the Series or are not a paid member of the producers. The fault lies with extreme In Your Face Political Correctness, near pathological Hetro-white male hatred, and a general \\"blame us humans because we are always at fault just like our ancestors\\" attitude, with the alien species playing the role of \\"the noble savage\\". Any show of strength is reserved for the white woman lead, while the white males are either portrayed as foul human beings or drop their eyes with guilt.

The first episode had promise. However, as I have viewed the remaining episodes on DVD I find the series to have mundane writing, uninteresting characters and slow moving, uninteresting plots. There are several points in the show where the characters talk, but make no sense (too numerous to list). Don't feel like enough was revealed about the backstory. Have no clue how long the days were. Boring!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It stinks!","review":"This was perhaps the most embarrassing piece of crap to be labeled \\"sci-fi\\" since \\"Space Rangers\\" or perhaps \\"Battlestar Galitica 1980\\". This stinker relies on a sickly mixture of the tired old \\"evil gov't conspiracy\\" and \\"scary aliens\\" plot devices that just don't work beside the \\"Wagon Train in shiney metal\\" look and feel.This series fell into the Hollywood sci-fi crap-trap in near record time (the use of a cute kid, smart dog or stupid robot). The writing was completely shot by the end of the first season.If you must waste many hours of your consciousness, you can find many, many more rewarding ways to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, Stupid Network Idiots Kill Another Show--Again!","review":"I enjoyed this series when it first aired, and I am enjoying the DVDs so far.

It covered not only things such as troup placement and tactics, but also much baser aspects of military life, such as the logistics of training, what or how to feed large numbers of troops, and how to deal with troop morale.For the historian (and members of re-enactment groups similar to the SCA) this is an excellent book for research if you're willing to ignore the fact that the text is only the English translation and not a side-by-side comparison of the original and the modern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality on one side.

Reginald Owen just about gets by as Holmes, but he's an insufferable know-all in the script who makes pronouncements of guilt without ever once being required to explain the deductions that led to them: people just blindly accept his word because, well, he's Sherlock Holmes. Anna May Wong at her worst makes for a poor femme fatale, Warburton Gamble makes an anonymous Watson and even Alan Mowbray, playing sober for a change, isn't able to liven up Lestrade. Eminently missable, especially in this ropey public domain DVD transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"West Coast Jazz Receives Long Overdue Recognition","review":"Modern jazz in California evolved in two metropolitan areas, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Film maker Ken Koenig has focused on the LA area, or more specifically, Hermosa Beach, where bassist Howard Rumsey nurtured his Lighthouse All Stars group who would become internationally known through their recordings on the Contemporary label.Koenig has interviewed dozens of musicians, jazz scholars, fans, and employees who knew the Lighthouse intimately during its heyday and has assembled the Lighthouse story in an engaging film that chronicles the emergence of modern jazz in California. Rare photographs and archival live footage complement this authoritative documentary.Hopefully this is the first installment of Koenig's examination of jazz on the west coast with many more to come in the future.James A. Harrod"},{"rating":"1","title":"TALK TRUMPS PERFORMANCE","review":"If you are expecting video clips of the essential performers of the Lighthouse All Stars era then I would suggest you look elsewhere. Perhaps five of the eighty minutes could be considered performance video. Most doesn't include the Lighthouse All Star key players in any significant way and mostly only pieces of tunes. I believe this was a missed opportunity to present a major video representation of West Coast Jazz performance. However, if your interest is in an abundance of talk about something you can neither see nor hear this may be the DVD for you. However you will see some snapshots, a few excellent Bill Claxton photographs, but a lot more album covers of the variety you can see in used LP venues.

Just take my advice and listen to it as if you're hearing Tricky for the first time. If there is a comparison to be made, it incorporates sounds and beats from all previous albums.Tricky brings a surprise to the table with every release.

He used so many influences, from the Red hot Chili Peppers, to the singer from Live, and mixed it all together for unfortunately half baked results. But this album is almost like a return to his roots, using only one vocalist throughout the whole album- but the album sounds very repetitive. EVeryones asking for another maxinquaye and he still's not givin it to us. But im sure its hard to repeat that. The beats on this album sound very repetitive and doesnt even really sound too much like an album where the beats are supposed to be everything. Its just like background beats- nothing special. His beats are supposed to make up for his voice which he can't do much with. If youre an avid fan, buy it, because you all are probably the only ones that are actually buying the album.

It has a very good cast, and is comprehensible inthe plot and substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Melodrama.","review":"There are times when movie directors take a good plot line and try to make it overly dramatic by slowing down the pace between events to the extreme and by highlighting things that are best left emphasized naturally. This film is a prime example of such a case. The story itself of Evelyn Nesbit is a compelling one, but this film bores one to tears. The only reason we finished it is to see how it all worked out in the end. The young Joan Collins is charming. And the aging Ray Milland is a sympathetic character, which actually works to the detriment of the film. As one could be more involved with the story line if the character of Frank White were not so likeable in the form of Ray Milland. If one isn't familiar with the story of Evelyn Nesbit, who was the inspiration for the face of Anne in Anne of Green Gables as per Lucy Maud Montgomery's diary, this movie serves as a good introduction. But as far as the movie itself is concerned, it isn't worth neither the time nor the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow","review":"The story depicted in the movie is fairly accurate, except for the trial at the end, but it never goes beneath the surface, never even tries to tell who the three main characters were or why they acted as they did. All we are told is that Harry Thaw was crazy, Stanford White was sort of an innocent victim, and Evelyn Nesbit was pretty. It wasn't enough.The murder of White is, in my view, the most interesting crime of the 20th century, and this movie turns it into just another killing. The true story had everything: a gorgeous girl, raw sex, lechery, madness, wealth, and jealousy. There are several good books on the subject, and at least one other movie does a better job of telling the story.As for acting, Joan Collins couldn't and the others didn't. The sets and Cinemascope photography are lush, but they don't make up for the acting and directing flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed.","review":"The pictures in the movie are ok but no sound track (original).It isn't even close to the original.

Now that I have it on DVD, I can watch it and be amazed at its stunning animation and powerful plot. As for the music, I'd say that Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and Tim Rice have done a fantastic job. Zimmer gives his usual robust flavor to the score while adding traditional African instruments. It's one of my favorites from Zimmer, along with The Thin Red Line and Crimson Tide. Meanwhile, John and Rice have created some truly memorable songs that can be very hard to forget. From \\"Circle of Life\\" to \\"Can You Feel The Love Tonight,\\" it's hard not to love the music that you grew up on. While I do have some minor quarrels (\\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\\" can get quite annoying at times), this is still a brilliant soundtrack for one of the greatest animated films of all time. Kudos to Disney for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like this soundtrack, you will absolutely LOVE...","review":"Any discs from Karl Jenkins' \\"ADIEMUS\\" project.

He won an Academy Award for this music yet they only give him 4 tracks worth of space?!?The only one worth listening to is 'To Die For' which sounds pretty cool but is without theme or control. Nothing much on this CD interests at all I'm afraid to say.

It is one of the reasons this movie is NOT only a child's movie. \\"The Lion King\\" continues Disney's streak of recent movies that appeal to both children and adults alike.The soundtrack is full of catchy songs for the kids and a movie instrumental score which adults should more appreciate. I personally could live without Elton John's own renditions of some songs but they weren't really bad themselves. Not only will your children enjoy singing along with the songs but adults will remember exactly which part of the movie corresponds to each instrumental piece.Folks who believe that music plays a minor role in setting the tone of movies are sadly mistaken.

We dont all actually say the word 'X-treme' in every single sentence. Skateboarding is not about getting sponsored and making money. Skating is really about having fun and meeting friends. I didnt start skating on my little toys'r'us board hoping for fame and fortune. I just wanted fun. Please dont see this movie, because skateboarding should have nothing to do with Hollywood."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is so bad, go watch Out Cold!","review":"Honestly, I cannot even dignify this movie with more than a few sentences of review. I was hoping for another Out Cold type experience with this flick, but the closest it came was Jason London's random cameo at the end. This movie is unfunny, unenjoyable, and has amazingly some pretty bad skating. Don't watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get out of the pool.","review":"This movie is hard to stomach. The best part of the movie comes from the sporadic insertion of skating sequences. The skaters are skilled and a pleasure to watch, but this does not make a good movie. The humor in the movie is sophomoric at best and never really produces a good laugh. I felt that my time was wasted by sitting in front of this drivel for 104 minutes. Avoid this loser of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time watching this movie","review":"About a half year ago, i saw this movie. All that i remember is one character who is just a complete retard. It had a few good skate scenes, but other than that, it sucked.If that one guy wasn't in the movie, it might have been worth watching. I can't remember anything about this guy. But that's all that I remember from this movie is that guy that i just can't stand. It was a complete waste of time watching this movie, just because of the one person that is in there. That's all i really remember from that movie, so it really wasn't good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cameos","review":"This is a skating/teen movie that has a lot of camoes.

It's a complete embarrassment to skateboarding in general. The whole premise to this movie is ridiculous and totally predictable. Some kid wants to get sponsored, become professinal, and become a celebrity. Big Surprise. I'm sorry but every skater in this movie has totally turned their back on what skateboardings about. Even if it seems like they would never do so, i'm sorry but they have. Skateboarding is not mtv, movies, espn , skaterade or anything that has been throw at the masses to make a buck. Even the non-skateboarding stuff, like the humor, is lame. Hey kiddies don't be fooled by this, you're better than that. These people are humans just like you and I. No better. Remember, skateboarding is just you and your board, nothing more. Not a t-shirt, magazine, label, video game, any pro-skater, tv show or movie. Think about it and have a fun time skating with your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I got the movie in pretty decent timing and it was in perfect condition.

(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst skateboarding movie ever, one of the worst movies of any genre","review":"When even appearances by some of the hottest skaters out there and excellent skating footage can't redeem a movie, you know it's something awful. The thin plot is a pointless retread of the tired \\"underdog makes good\\" format; its protagonists are shallow cliches portrayed by actors who know they have a bad job and therefore don't feel compelled to put in much effort. The toilet humor and the sexism might be terribly offensive if one could work up the energy to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Skater Movie","review":"This movie is such a great comedy and has some awesome skate boarding moves in it.

It is not a good movie. It is simply a cash-in on the skateboarding sport, trying desperately to be cool by chucking in random outbursts of skating and celebs.There are so many negative things to say about this movie. The acting is ok, i like Adam Brody, but is far from stellar. The transitions between the actors skating and their professional skater stunt-doubles could not be clearer. I could have sworn one stunt double was 2 foot taller than his matched actor, with different coloured hair, trying his best not to look directly at the camera.If you want to see a proper skateboarding film with real fire, watch Dogtown and Z-Boys. Forget this."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect seller!!!! great movie","review":"this is one of my favorite movies however i lost it a long time ago!!!! i seen it on amazon and had to order it!!! came before estimated date!!! perfect condition and sealed and wrapped in plastic!!!!! love this movie and recommend this seller!!!!! 10 out of 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great skater movie","review":"Bought the movie for my son.

It was pretty funny. There was alot of skateboarding in it of course, but you can probably guess that just from looking at the cover. I would definetely compare it to \\"out cold\\" only instead of snowboarding obviously, the main action comes from skateboarding.

So many of my favorite recipes call for zest, and this item makes that am easy task."},{"rating":"1","title":"a brief history of the periodic table","review":"It is a very good idea to explain to teens how the periodic table was made and the book reads well. Some mistakes are irritating. For instance, the scientific community has not replaced azote (proposed by Lavoisier)by nitrogen: Nitrogen is the English term, effectively proposed by another Frenchman, Chaptal, but the French still use azote to name the substance.The historical part is fair, the part showing that the periodic table explains some rules of chemistry in nature is weak and comes too late and the part showing that the table can be used to guess the properties of elements is sorely understated.It seems to me that to be excited by the history of the periodic table, one should know first that it is useful. The author made a mistake by diving into history without making the aim attractive.I hope there will be a second better edition, because it would be nice to have a great book for teens on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good seller","review":"In addition to the routine issues (arrived promptly in good condition), the seller was flexible enough to change the shipping destination after 1-click purchasing had defaulted to my home address. I was sending this to my grandson in another city, and the seller had no problem changing the shipping address."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to two very tricky subjects","review":"This is an interesting and non-mathematical introduction to quantum theory (\\"atoms and their constituents\\") and the general theory of relativity (\\"our picture of space, time and gravity\\"). These subjects are fiendishly difficult to understand, but Chown's use of many fresh explanations and analogies should help you get to grips with them. Chown has put in a great deal of effort to try and make these subjects as accessible as possible. As a result, this book has given me a much better understanding of these subjects; and far fewer headaches than the many other books, articles and documentaries I've encountered before.At the moment, there's no free preview chapter on this site for the Quantum Zoo; but if you visit Chown's website at [...] you can sample a free chapter before making a decision.Also, the review by Keith A.Nelson is not accurate. This book has ten chapters, the first six of which deal with quantum theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best popular science books I've read to date","review":"It's very difficult to explain a topic like quantum physics to a non-physicist or to the mathematically challenged. I'm very grateful that there are scientists like this who takes the time and effort to translate these fascinating subjects for us laymen. The best thing is that the subject matter, although factual, is more captivating and bizarre than any sci-fi book you will ever read. Excellent book...5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantum is a Word He Likes To Use - But Only in the Title","review":"I was disappointed with this book. As a student of quantum mechanics and quantum theory I am anxious to read anything new or original about this expanding and fascinating topic. This book is primarily a rehash of Einstein's old theories of special and general relatively, and only vaguely and briefly mentions quantum theory. Chown (or more likely his publisher) probably named this book \\"The Quantum Zoo\\" in order to attract more buyers, but the name is deceptive. It should hve been named; \\"Einstein Revisited.\\" It like buying a book supposedly about modern aircraft that deals only with biplanes.

Stay safe & buy the better built Disney shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful , powerful, moving story.","review":"This book is a classic. Right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird, Grapes of Wrath etc. The story of Brian O'Connal growing up on the wilds of the Canadian prairie is beautifully woven against a powerful, sometimes sinister, backdrop of small town Canadiana. This book captures life in a small town like few can. It is hilarious in spots, and sometimes very moving. Mitchell captures the heart of a young boy's spiritual, and intellectual growth with wonderful detail. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"the classic","review":"I've read this about three times now, maybe more. What keeps taking me back is something like rain to the earth. These are indeed stories that are 'close to the earth' -- the human spirit, in all its simplicity, yet all its complexity. I read to a group of senior citizens and they often ask for more of this book. The stories read great aloud and I recommend it for anyone who enjoys an author who writes about the everyday, with a very deep insight into the human condition. Don't pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not Boring!!","review":"The person who rated this book as boring must not have read the same book I did. This is an elegaic portrait of life on the Canadian Prairies in the early 20th century. It captures something significant about the Prairie psyche and the Canadian psyche as a whole. It is, in the final analysis, a sweet, beautifully written story by a master story teller. It is not full of car chases or other amusements for tiny minds, but is a treat for anyone who appreciates a great tale well told."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book on the second read","review":"I had to read this book for my english class, and I must admit, the first time around it was very boring, which is the only reason i gave it a 4/5.

I tried to look into every word and find its own hidden meaning, and when you do that, the book becomes very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book i have ever read in my life","review":"THis book had no point at all to it and was very boring. it sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring boring boring","review":"This is one of the most boring books i have ever read.

The TurboTax State product had no difficulty quickly and accurately completing tax returns for my state (Minnesota) after finishing my federal return.As some other reviewers have correctly noted, the name of the product (\\"Multi-State\\") is somewhat deceptive, in that you get to choose one state return to file; if you have to file for more than one state you have to pay for additional state downloads. This is the primary reason I gave the product four stars: functionally it was easy to use and intuitive, and I had no problems of any sort with it (I have Windows XP running on a 2003 vintage computer).This product isn't perfect, but it does a good job, and is enormously superior to TaxCut in every way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turbotax Failed","review":"Don't believe the rating of one. A minus 5 would have been more appropriate. After six years of being a faithful Turbotax user, the changes they have made in 2004 are convincing me never to use their product again - even if I could. After purchasing the downloadable version it failed to unzip. Three hours on the phone with representatives in India did not solve the problem. Finally I got them to send me a CD, which seemed to install but hung up on the question \\"Select a tax return type\\" that offered zero choices and no pull-down.

Normally the adjectives 'painstricken and harsh' would be viewed as negative but the boys pull it off terrifically. Deja shows a bit more of a break away from fellow Long Islanders Taking Back Sunday, unlike Weapon, which sounds nearly identical to TBS's Tell All Your Friends.

I first heard the song on Fuse) and \\"I Will Play My Game Beneath The Spin Light\\" (great lyrics: \\"Tell them that I realize that everyone who lives must someday die and die alone\\").

The album starts off with the subdued \\"Taoutou\\" but then jumps straight into the blazing \\"Sic Transit Gloria\\" (the 2nd single). The first half of the album is simply impeccable, with among others \\"The Quiet Things\\" (1st single, and big MTV video hit), but also \\"Okay I Believe You\\" and \\"Jaws Theme Swimming\\", both smartly intermixing the \\"soft\\" and the all-out rock sound.The album falters a bit towards the end, but no matter, because contrary to so many \\"one song\\" bands today, Brand New have delivered a cohesive album that actually delivers more than just the one MTV hit.

You NEED to buy this CD, I love all the songs, and also you should buy 'Your Favorite Weapon'. Brand New has matured further in music since YFW, and Jesse's and Vinnie's lyrics ARE AWSOME, I haven't heard any lyrics that can beat them, and if someone does then hats off to them. My favorite song on this CD has to be either Play Crack The Sky or Its Good To Know That If I Ever Need Attention All I Have To Do Is Die, very long title! So get this CD NOW! GO BRAND NEW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite album","review":"I had this cd for a couple months before I listened to it in it's entirety, and that was a mistake. This is a cd that, to fully appreciate, you need to sit and listen to every single song. My personal favorite is \\"Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't\\". The lyrics on this cd absolutely chilled my spine. And the lead singer's voice is really nice. Some of the songs are very sarcastic, and that really lightened up the pretty heavy mood. These guys are just awesome. Get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I cannot picture this album being any better. Every single song is beautiful, you could write whole volumes on the meaning of each one and they're absolutely perfect. I cry listening to the sad ones and want to dance around the room with the fast ones. Just buy it, you won't be disappointed! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going to be without a doubt one of the alltime best","review":"This cd is amazing. They've matured so much since YFW, and that's a good thing, because if this cd was going to be another pop/punk/emo experience, I would've been hesitant to buy it. So many great songs, such good musicianship. My personal favorite tracks are #3, #4, #5, well, you know what, all of them are my favorite. Get this cd if you like ANYTHING, and if you don't like it, then you need serious help. Incredible cd, good job Brand New; however, there is one thing I want to discuss. Try not to show anyone mainstream Brand New, becuase they'll watch it on MTV2 or Fuse, and they'll show their friends...and Brand New will turn into...no...don't...AN MTV CORPORATE PIGGIE BAND!!! and none of us want that, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand New,...........something new","review":"I thought was a very good cd but there were some duller songs. i dont have your your favorite weapon but i like jude law and seventy times seven. my favorite songs on deja extendu are sic transit gloria...glory fades, the quiet things no one ever knows, jaws theme swimming, and guernica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second to one","review":"After being pretty much blown away by their first outting, I was a bit skeptical as most bands tend to make lackluster follow-ups. I think I can honestly say this isn't the case with Deja Entendu. While the style is almost a 180 from their first album as far as sonics are concerned, it's still the same deep and clever/witty lyrics that make you wish you'd thought of that line first. While the musical side is a bit of a departure from Your Favorite Weapon, it retains it's own charm in it's own rite. While I loved the album, the first one was just a bit more suited to my own personal tastes. That doesn't, however, detract from how great the album really is. No throw-away tracks or songs that sound like they were in a hurry to bang a few out to meet their release deadline. it just takes a little getting used to like everything truely good."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cd this year....cd of the year so far?","review":"This has to be my favorite cd to come out since hotrod circuits \\"sorry about tomorrow\\" last feb. It's not quite as fast paced as \\"your favorite weapon\\" but the way the songs are delivered are absolutely amazing. Jesse Laceys lyrics are quite possibly the best of any emo band out now. The sad thing is is that they are now currently shopping the rights to their next record to different labels so this is quite possibly their last triple crown release before a mainstream label gets their hooks into them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what your going to expect.","review":"If you expect this CD to sound ANYTHING like the single, then your going to be dissapointed. There single is one sick song, and these guys defenitely have talent, but the rest the CD is so different from that song. If you really like weird almost \\"weezerlike\\" emo, then you'll like this CD, but if your looking for anything like the single it's probably not worth it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual","review":"Brand New is a band that I just do not understand. Lately, I have found myself listening to Deja Entendu frequently on someones itunes playlist on my local network, and I am puzzled. This cd has absolutly no flow at all. Some of the tracks do not even sound like the same band, especially \\"Play Crack The Sky,\\" which sounds exactly like a Counting Crows song. The good thing about this album is that they aren't doing the exact same thing as every other band in this oversaturated genre. However, much of this seems forced, and that they are trying to hard to be different. I cannot stand the track titles either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember the older stuff","review":"I've been reading the reviews and I have to say that I disagree. This cd was a big let down for me, being a big fan of the Your Favorite Weapon album. The songs are not very catchy and it seems they have changed themselves. The vocals aren't up to par with what they used to have. The album before this had all good songs, give or take a few. I'd love to see Brand New come out with something closer to Your Favorite Weapon, it would be a big help to everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sincerely Dissappointed","review":"I eagerly awaited this cd and bought it very very soon after it came out, hoping to get a hold of a cd that held all the same catchy and rockin music that was on their previous cd, but i was very dissappointed when i popped this cd into the player... they changed, and not in a good way. Every song is a slow song, its like chill music... by brand new! I love their old cd, its so rad, but this one just isnt them and just doesnt seem like it was something that they would have wanted to put out. I mean if you can give it anything, it is kinda new, and it has a fresh soft sound... but if you want another cd like their old one, dont get this one. If you can somehow, just listen to the first song, youll get a good grip of what the whole cd is like and how dissappointing it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"went completely over my head","review":"every year someone releases a CD that is dubbed a masterpiece by a masses and i just can't comrehend it. Coldplay's A Rush of Blood to the Head was the last one i can think of. I just listened to it over and over again and I couldn't see what everyone was talking about. It's the same thing with Deja Entendu, all these rave reviews from fans and critics alike and I just don't get it. so i guess in closing what i'm saying is that you really need to buy this cd and hear it for yourself, but keep the receipt because it is definitley not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this?","review":"Brand New frist caught me on the radio with their first single \\"Quiet Things that No One ever knows\\" I thought it was a fairly good song. Then I saw them at the Almost Acoustic Christmas 2003, and I thought they were really good. So,I bought this album and I nearly fell asleep. At the most there is three good songs. The rest are all boring. The lyrics feel uninspired and the vocals just are flat-out boring. Most of the songs sound the same. Everyone seems to praise this band. I am a hardcore Thrice, Thursday, Taking Back Sunday and AFI kind of guy. And these guys don't even come close to the same talent they have. Stay Away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ahahaha","review":"Ok first off .. i dont think brand new should be considered emo... if anything they should have the title of angry post brake up.. i mean you listen to some of the songs and you get pissed at your ex..plus the cd's really good to just drive around and sing with your friends.. espescilly on long car drives.. kills time."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened....","review":"to be honest, i was incredibly disappointed when i bought this album. I loved Your Favorite Weapon and i wuz expectin something like that but i soon realized i wuz wrong. I new it was different so i thought it might take a while for me to like it but ive listened to it and the only songs i like are the quiet things.... and I Will Play... all the other songs just bore me. I know this is a great cd but its just not my kind of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an incredible album","review":"I've had this album for a year now it blows Your Favorite Weapon out of the water I think. Their lyrics are much deeper. They've toned down on the pop sounding feel of their first EP and it definitely works out for the better. Their singles, \\"The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows\\" and \\"Sic Transit Gloria Fades\\" are honestly the worst songs on this album. That's how good the other songs are. A definite must buy if you are into this kind of music or just interested in learning more about Brand New."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent progression","review":"I'm a big fan from their last album, and with this new album I'm now a dedicated fan that really appreciates their progression from a \\"pop\\" feel to a very sophisticated emotional album. Brand New is definitely stepping in the right direction with deja entendu, however I fully realize the potential of this band and hope for a more explosive album next time, which is the only reason why I only rated deja entendu a four, from a critical standpoint, but in my opinion it is a definite five compared to other current bands. I am very pleased with this new one and I feel it is a great album and have been listening to it non stop. They will also be touring on this year's Van's Warped Tour which is an excellent opportunity for Brand New, and I am looking forward to seeing them live."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright","review":"I wasn't terribly into Brand New before Deja Entendu came out, although I did like Taking Back Sunday, and I always saw them grouped in the same category. However, listening to their first album, all I heard was a mediocre band who played your typical emo-punk music. It's nice that they've tried something new with Deja Entendu, but yet again, all I hear is a mediocre band, this time \\"maturing.\\" Even though the album has some decent tracks and an experimental edge, the way in which they've \\"matured\\" is far too predictible (a young punk band going artsy), and they appear to be trying all too hard to change their style. I do however enjoy their unique vocal approach and I like the fact that they put some thought into the album, although trying a bit too hard. Overall, it's a mediocre album, but not entirely worthless or unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand New","review":"Let me first start off by saying that i used to really like punk and emo music, but i strayed off the path and stopped listening to that type of music as much. But this cd i think has brought me back. Upon first listen one is temped to turn it off and dissmiss it as a wierd change from the original cd; an abnormal growth. But rest assured this is a great thing. I almost thought it was a different band. BUt its not and upon continued listens it grows on you and the sounds of early brand new begin to shine through even though its still a little eclipsed by a new and darker sound. Brand New have grown older and changed in a short number of months. THis is the cd for jaded emo kids, who want to find themselves again. Go out and buy both cd's soon because deja Entandu is a continuation of the first cd, your favorite weapon."},{"rating":"2","title":"and now for something completly different...","review":"wow. thats about all there is to it. i dont think ive ever seen a band evolve as well in so little time as Brand New has on this record. Aside from the voices (which at times, themselves, are different) you can hardly tell this new Brand New from the band that recorded Your Favorite Weapon. The songs have so much more range than YFW. the first \\"real\\" song on the album, Glory Fades, is a dark song driven by an astounding yet simple bass riff that sounds reminiscent of Cursive or similar \\"art emo\\" bands. then it goes right into a range of songs that sound like the melancholy acoustic pop of Bright Eyes to my favorite track on the record \\"Yeah I Believe you but my Tommy Gun Don't\\". the lyrics to this song are simply spectacular. I cant reccomend this album enough. Go Buy it. stop reading. just buy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST CDS EVER","review":"At first, this CD was far from being my favorite. After about a week, I couldn't live without it. I've had it since August of last year and I still love it. It's one of those CDs that never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Though this band has recieved some bad reviews, those were all by single-minded idiots who don't listen to any kind of rock, nor like it in any way. So don't listen to them because the band is amazing. The lyrics are the best I've ever heard in my life, the harmonizing is great. I LOVE this CD and this band!! Though I'll admit it took me a few listens to get attached, now absolutely nothing can compare. GET THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This album may seem bad at first. But listen to the whole thing and you start to like it. It seems that the songs are songs that would be on trl or other shows like that. This is a kickass album so buy it. It is one of the best albums i have bought. Also if you like this album look at the cd atticus which is a mixtape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD","review":"All that you need to do to get addicted to this CD is to listen to it once. Whether you like it at first or not,it grows on you.This is a CD that is worth listening to at least once daily.It is one of the best albums I have ever spent money one. If you buy it you won't regret it, and, if you do, remember this is just my opinion...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgustingly Good","review":"Only one cd I have tops this and that's Your Favorite Weapon. My favorite Brand New song may be \\"Okay, I believe you but my tommy gun don't\\" but I am partial to Your Favorite Weapon. As you can see I've given it 5 Stars, that's because I could be the second best cd of all time, but then again I'm not really into the Beatles..."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this cd is great. it is way better than Your Favorite Weapon. on Deja Entendu, it's more mellow, but the lyrics are incredible...It'd kinda got a modest mouse sound to it...if you don't have this cd, get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"brand new fan","review":"brand new is my favorite band, and i had been waiting for this release for a long time. i have been listening to BN since around before they released your favorite weapon. this cd made my jaw drop. while more mellow than your favorite weapon, still an amazing buy. the emotion in the lyrics can be sensed from any of the songs. buy this CD, it will be well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is really boring. Buy SOTY or THE USED instead!","review":"If you like rock you won't like this album. The songs are almost all acoustic. Really Bad!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is very bad!","review":"A person from my school recomended this to me so he let me borrow his copy for a little awhile. He was dead wrong. These songs can be boring and pointless.These guys are a terrible excuse of a band. This goes in my collection of a \\"poison to the ears\\" band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say garbage-core?","review":"this review will probably be followed by a review entitled \\"dont listen to the review below\\" by some angry \\"indie rocker\\". but i hate brand new and since i have a right to voice my opinion here we go....i cant stand brand new. there is nothing original about them and they just suck. thats all i got because i dont wanna waste anymore time on reviewing such garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"So overrated.","review":"This band is not that good. They are pretty crap and this CD is generic run of the mill pop punk with no flavor or substance. I'm sure I speak for the rest of the real punk rockers, check out something good like Staring Back, Strung Out, Rufio, etc. I wouldn't even give this a 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is what maturity looks like","review":"IN YOUR FACE NON-MATURE MUSIC. here is my review:Me and my home-boys love listening to this album. Even though I'm not black, I don't listen to music, and I'm an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could brand new forsake us?","review":"now just so u know if u never listened to brand new don't read this, if you cry when a flower gets stepped on ull love this emo junk. the first cd was intellegent punk, with the lead singer having loads of energy and all the songs (almost) being loud and catchy. so i immediatley bought this cd when it came out. let me tell you, the songs are from some empty shell of brand new. the main vochalist sounds like he's on ritalin or valuim or something, and the songs are all depressing, not revitalizing or infectious. stay away if ur a fan, leave them with good memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emo sucks!","review":"To that person who called this 'the best CD of 2003', go buy 'Dance of Death' by Iron Maiden and tell me what's the best album of 2003!!! As for this album, it sucks. Listen to Iron Maiden, they kick ass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAND NEW!!!!!","review":"THIS ALBUM IS SOOOOOO GOOD. It has a different sound which is really good. i think they almost sound a little like nine inch nails in some songs. This is there best work yet. i love that they can mature as an artist. Rock on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply wonderful.","review":"it's great to hear some new material from the angst-ridden boys of brand new. more mature sound, more mature lyrics. they have a sort of bright eyes sound to them on this album. once i picked up this cd, i couldn't stop listening to it. it's still a mainstay in my cd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece.","review":"When I bought this CD, I expected something great. Your Favorite Weapon was one of my favorites, and I knew that Brand New could only improve. But the words \\"great\\" and \\"improve\\" are understatements. I was blown away that Brand New had come from the upbeat, loud, \\"I hope she dies\\" sort of attitude of YFW into this; this amazing, quiet, wonderful music. You can't even describe this album, it is so great. Haunting, emotional, poetic, amazing... this album is as good as it gets from start to finish. I would reccomend this to anyone who wants to hear beautiful music and the raw emotion put into every verse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deja Entendu","review":"Brand new has shown they can still make a great album while still making great concert songs. Although the songs on Deja are slower they still rock hard. Just go to a show and you'll see how the crowd responds to the band's music. This album has more advanced riffs has better lyrics and all the songs have their own unique sound. Although this album is less pop than weapon, it is a higher quality of music and Brand New fans should respect that and realize that this band is about more than jude law and a semester abroad and seventy times seven."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch","review":"i heard this was a good cd but i heard wrong. everyone said that they were awesome when they toured with taking back sunday and i absolutely LOVE taking back sunday so i bought brand new's cd. big mistake. i thought it was horrible, i liked about two songs on the whole cd. advice-download about 5 random songs from the cd before you buy it to see if you like it. it was the biggest waste of 12 dollars in my whole life."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"ALL THE SONGS ARE SLOW WHAT A WASTE OF 15 bucks honestly I advise everyone not to come close to this CD however THE FIRST WAS A TRUE MASTER PEICE IT WAS AMAZING I ADVISE EVERYONE TO BUY THE PREVIOUS CD"},{"rating":"1","title":"....um....very bad at first but....","review":"When my friend first lended me his CD to listen to, i was like, ugh, how can people listen to this. And it still left a bad flavor in my mouth to this day. I got used to it later after the 10th listen! Seriously this is not for everyone. extremely overrated. the only good song was Sic Transit Gloria, and the opening song Tautou, if you can really call that a (full) song. The rest has a large amount of almost country music style to it. bleh! Sure I like punk to general rock, but this is so....bad! This is punk and country. maybe that's what emo is, i don't know. Don't buy this CD, buy it only if you are a huge emo and punk fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did you do guys....","review":"Hey, look this CD is a bunch of crud. Your Favorite Weapon is one of the best CD's there is out there, and you know how every song on there is about some girl they know? Well something big happened between Deja Entendu and the last album. Something real bad. The album is so terrible, they never rock out. Number 9 is really the only good song, 4 5 and 10 are ok however. But this CD really [is bad]. Brand New changed EVERYTHING about themselves, and its for the worse. Big let down you guys..."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is brand new?","review":"I am SO dissapointed with this album. If you're looking for an upbeat feel like in Your Favorite Weapon, forget it. This album sounds like a bad Dashboard Confessional rip-off. I didn't even think I had the right cd when I first listened to it. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for bands growing in new directions. But they have done a total 180 and sound nothing like they did before. I'm selling this cd back to the store before they realize how bad it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"If you liked the first Brand New album, then you will most likely hate this album. It doesn't sound anything like the first album at all. It sounds like a different band. It's no longer punk music. It's this slow music, lots of acoustic. And the guy's voice doesn't even sound the same. And he talks so softly it sounds like his mouth is practically touching the mic. There are a few punk sounding parts in a couple of the songs. But that does not justify the other 40 minutes. I feel ripped off because you buy a band's album because you like their sound. This doesn't even come close to their original sound. Imagine Metallica's Load compared to their older stuff only ten times worse. I wish I didn't buy this album and I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesse Lacey and his Multiple Personalities","review":"I think this album sucks. How many songs can you write that sound like another band or another lead singer.this album contains songs like:1. the one that sounds like coldplay2. the one that sounds like bright eyes3. the one that sounds like Taking Back Sunday4. the one that sounds like Lucero..........and so on.....get a clue make yourself a mix cd of all of the following bands and basically youll have this album...and youll save yourself some money... or go ahead and buy the album...maybe jesse will eventually make enough money to buy himself a new ego...or a better attitude..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja Entendu? exactly","review":"Deja Entendu translates to 'already heard'. Which is pretty much a two word summary of the entire album. This band, made all the worse by using ridiculous foreign language translations in their titles, is pretty much a gigantic peice of lame. They weren't good on their last album, and because they have infiltrated the commercial world (actually, the entire world is one big commercial) they are all the more worse. That one song is on MTV2, which means when you watch it, you are a loser. I don't know how that logic works, it just does. If you like this music you might also consider suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"i don't really understand all of the five-star reviews for this album. at most, there are three, MAYBE four good songs on the entire cd. \\"sic transit gloria...\\" and \\"okay i believe you..\\" are both really, really good songs, but other than that, the cd is lacking severely, especially to be receiving so much praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who died?","review":"The quick witty lyrics, the almost original Lifetime-inspired vocals, and pretty much everything that makes this band good is missing in this album. Most of these songs are so depressing it makes you wonder who died. Way too much emphasis on Jesse's monotonous vocals which get old around the middle tracks and the other guy has obviously been taking singing lessons from Linkin Park.All in all, pretty disappointed considering \\"your favorite weapon\\" rocked so much and people built this one up way too much. If you don't have their older album listed above..by all means get it before you even allow yourself to listen to this one. Deja Entendu is really depressing...not good for rocking out in the summer...maybe for crying in the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"the steezer","review":"This album is amazing. The intro song is like the most amazing intro ever. Perfect CD for anybody that even remotley likes any emo/punk. Their first cd was as close to flawless as possible, and they made a great 2nd album I can't wait for the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing F-ing CD","review":"As soon as I heard it's first single \\"The Quiet things that no one ever knows\\" I knew it was going to be an amazing album... and I was right. I already had thier first album \\"Your Favorite Weapon\\" and I didn't think they could get better but they did. Every single song on this album is beautifully written and not one song sounds like the other. Jesse Lacey, I think is one of the most underated song writers right now. You may think I'm crazy but I stand by that statement.Some of the standout tracks are \\"Sic Transit Gloria\\" which speaks of a not so comfortable [physical] experience ...(also the next single), \\"Ok I believe you but my Tommy Gun DOn't\\", \\"The Boy that Blocked his Own Shot\\", \\"Jaws Theme Swimming\\", Guernica and \\"Good to know that if I ever need attention all i have to do is die\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"YFW Fans Beware!","review":"Every once in awhile, you WANT the bratty, brash, pop-punk band to whine about heartache and lousy childhoods, and when they do it well, you can't help but embrace them for it. So you can imagine my surprise when I anxiously popped Deja Entendu into my car stereo, only to find a pretentious, over-baked mess, living under the guise of maturity. If this is what maturity breeds, I don't ever want to grow up. And I don't want my favorite bands to grow up, either. If I wanted to hear mopey emo done well, with a beat I can't dance to, I would have popped the new Dashboard Confessional in instead. So to make a long story short, if you're looking for another YFW, look someplace else, because Deja Entendu won't be be giving you YFW deja vu anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"good job","review":"your favorite weapon-eh-cool cd-catchy...whatever..deja entendu really impressed me and showed me these are real musicians with real talent who if they keep up with their changing musical styles they will be around in five ten years-no doubt...i love this cd by the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brand New is AMAZING","review":"Wow. On the release day of this CD I ran out to the store and bought it. When I got home, I put it in to listen...and I thought to myself, is this Brand New? I was shocked at my first listen how different they sounded. Not bad, but different. I really enjoyed \\"Your Favorite Weapon\\" but this certainly isn't \\"Your Favorite Weapon 2\\" After a few listens I have become completly addicted to this CD. The lyrics are amazing. There is nothing more to say about this CD besides WOW, and what are you waiting for, GET THIS CD RIGHT NOW! My Fav Tracks are 2,3,4,5, and 9, but the entire cd is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"good listen","review":"Much better and more grown up then the previous record.

I suppose tht I could have measured how much they actually held, but I didn't have time to do that at the time.One cost a great deal more than the other; Iwould have been better off to have just ordered two of the cheaper ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quickly resolved a problem","review":"First 13 qt. stainless steel bowl arrived damaged.

It is fine for mixing large quantities, e.g, our Thanksgiving or Christmas family stuffing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool bag, watch out it can get heavy fast.","review":"I'm a Field Service Engineer and I've been using this bag for almost a year now. I occasionally fly with my tools and this bag has been checked probably a dozen or more times now. It frequently comes off the baggage claim upside down but this thing has held up great and it only has one small scuff on the top lid. I find that I've had to load it down with so many parts and tools that it has become too heavy for me to carry around so I purchased a magnacart folding hand truck to dolly it around. The four slimmer pockets on the outside work great for quick access to your go to tools. I use 4 caribeeners on the outside to keep the zippers up when I check it, so far knock on wood I haven't lost any tools yet. The only knock I can give it is I wish it had a handle and wheels. Great BAG! and Stanley has really stepped it up a knotch with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tool bag","review":"I use this bag for my drill, impact, batteries, and charger.

I bought this bag as a Christmas gift and it's being well used. It is no longer neat and clean...it's covered in plaster and saw dust but holds up well storing his tools. It's a heavy duty bag with a hard top and plenty of compartments for extra blades, screws, and whatever else a construction guy wants to put in there. I'm sure it would be great for any normal \\"Mr. fix it\\" as well. The base is better than plastic as it won't scratch wood floors and the shoulder stap makes it eaiser to carry aound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deeply Literary Book","review":"Susan Wheeler writes intelligent and playful poems. Former poet laureate Robert Haas, who selected this book for publication, says that \\"Smokes\\" is a \\"deeply literary book.\\" I agree. It's like Wheeler is having a conversation with the whole history of poetry: Pound, Mallarmé, Hesiod, John Berryman. And yet there are poems called \\"Beavis' Day Off\\" and \\"Fractured Fairy Tale,\\" so Wheeler is also in tune with our present culture. A unique mind engaged with many worlds. And take a look at the rhymefest \\"Shanked on the Red Bed\\"--a classic! Wheeler's poems delight and haunt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get a matching Sharpie too!","review":"This growth chart is just like the one we got for our daughter.

They have good marketing and packaging to make you think it is high quality when it is actually the exact opposite. The same can be said for IAMs. Eukanuba gave my perfectly healthy boston terrier skin problems which although weren't his cause of death, it was the first domino that led to his death. If I had not fed him this junk, he would still be alive today. Im not a random case. The problem is byproducts, fillers and the use of corn. You mind as well feed your dog alpo and save yourself the money. No dog food should contain byproducts,soybean or corn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homage at its best!!!","review":"The friendship between Sarah and Carmen is stuff of legend. So is this album. Not only is it a tribute to Sass but it is a swan song for Carmen as this was her last recording. From beginning to end the songs are chosen and arranged wonderfully by Carmen and Shirley Horn and her trio. The acapella intro of Poor Butterfly is superb and Carmen begins her tricks from the start bending phrase and playing with intonation something she shared in common with Sarah. Black Coffee, Send in the Clowns, and especially I Will Say Goodbye and It's Magic are wonderful interpretations from a mind that values pharsing and giving lyrics character. There is nothing transparent about this album it is all depth as was Carmen. A personal favorite and a jewel in Carmen's crown as one of the queens of Jazz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boredom and controversy","review":"If you missed following the 2002 Formula One season, you didn't miss very much, and it is definitely not worth revisiting one of the most appaling seasons of the sport with a review video. If you must or if you are a die-hard fan, this video makes the best of reporting on a season that is better quickly forgotten. It remains noteworthy that this is the year in which Schumacher equalled Fangio's five world championships, but it is also a year of processional racing, no wheel-to-wheel battles and on top of that Ferrari executing team orders and extremely poor judgement in two cases, in Austria and the US. This season did nothing for the popularity of the sport, on the contrary. The video quality of this tape is solid as usual, the commentary neutral to boring, and all in all it is a pretty sad affair"},{"rating":"1","title":"No excuse for this distortion of Tarot history","review":"This is a book that should not have been written.

Now, after watching this 40 minute show 8 times and repeating the words as they say them (and he repeats all of them as they're said), they've stuck. I'm amazed by this program. I received the first disk through an Influenster program, and I plan on saving up to purchase the the rest of the program for my home childcare.I knocked a star off as the graphics aren't amazing, and I really don't want to listen to my son repeat the words that the TV says, but it's still an awesome educational show to put in while I'm making dinner/doing the dishes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinos make learning a new language fun","review":"I think that it is a lot easier for children to learn a new language at a younger age because it doesn't come across as a chore to them, but rather a new and fun way to communicate.

In the past 24 hours he has asked me to watch the dinosaur movie five more times. He loved the dinosaurs (esp. the baby dinosaurs in the counting section) and the animals. He was completely captivated by it and seemed to understand and retain a lot more than I thought he would from just watching it once.

She seemed VERY excited to try out Spanish (I blame Dora! Hehe) From the moment the video started, she was HOOKED. Half way through she was chanting \\"Rawrrrrr estes es un leon!\\" LOL This video was great! So easy to understand and lots of fun, vibrate pictures and cartoons. After it was all said and done, (and a few minutes of begging for a replay) her mother was so impressed by her interest we decided to go to the website and check it out.

The phone also has a problem with the password and security section because even when i first got it it would not let me set a password or make it password protected.

During the first month, it started interrupting songs because it was waiting for voice commands - I never pushed any buttons so I don't know why it did this.3. Last month it stopped recognizing the headphones when they were plugged in. Now it will only play music through the speakers.4. Today it started working only through the speakerphone. I couldn't turn speakerphone off to have a private conversation.

I sing unbelievably well in the shower as I'm sure Boyde does, but I wouldn't attempt to disseminate my shower talent to the masses. Anyone who has ever seen Boyde jam on stage knows that he brings something special to the world of violin virtuosity. Boyde is a great showman and plays boss violin, but sadly not on this CD. Please Boyde, jazz violin, blues violin, bebop violin, or bluegrass fiddle. Whatever violin, I don't care, I'd buy it in a minute. Be happy with the God given talent you've nurtured, because at least you have one. I don't. And please share more of it with your fans. Great CD cover though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice start, but Boyd needs to showcase his playing","review":"I picked up this album on a whim, since I'm a big DMB fan. I was disappointed by Boyd's lack of violin showmanship in \\"True Reflections\\", the less-than-stellar lyrics, and the rough-ish singing. With all the guest talent here, this album could have been fantastic. C'mon Boyd, you can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the fiddle?","review":"If you're expecting to hear Boyd playing some blazing voilin leads, look elsewhere, he only plays violin on 4 tracks out of 11, and even in those, he doesn't blaze. The songs would be enjoyable had he picked up the violin for something other than the photos in the jacket but instead they mostly just plod on. A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"So So - Fifty Fifty","review":"I have been a long time follower of Dave Matthews and the gang. I have enjoyed their music immensely over the years. Upon purchasing Boyd's True Reflections album I honestly did not know what to expect. I assumed it would be an instrumental album. Although this is a much different album than I expected it is pretty good. I am usually more the rocker type... but... hey, music is music and I enjoy all genres. My only suggestion to Boyd is to take a few singing lessons. ;) Heis voice is all right, but he's no Dave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cd that should have never been made.","review":"Now, don't think I'm just some angry dave matthews band fan or anything. That's not the case. The point is this CD is not very good in terms of musicianship, lyrics, replayment value, engineering and production value, pretty much everything.The song are all a sort of country/pop mixture. The real problem is the production of the cd. It sounds like it was recorded in the early 80's in a junky nashville studio.No disrepct to Boyd, he's a good fiddle player, but I'm afraid that's where the talent ends. The lyrics are all cliche'd, kitzchy type of stuff, with a lot of women \\"oohing\\" and \\"ahhing\\" in the background.All in all, I give it a 1 out of 10. Maybe Boyd was feeling stifled from just playing the fiddle in DMB, but this songs would be best sung in his living room by himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck...","review":"Not at all what I expected...wimpy vocals, very little of what Tinsley does best (play the damned violin, Boyd!)...I didn't prescreen any of the songs so really didn't know what to expect...I gambled and lost. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a DMB member - Gotta have it....","review":"The music isn't all that great, but you still gotta get the CD because Boyd is a DMB member."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting aside the DMB connection...An Honest review","review":"OK...we all Know Boyd is a member of the Dave Matthews Band...thats great....now, PUT THAT ASIDE....hows he sound???..Truth be told..not that great! The songs don't really grab you..the musicianship is (for lack of a better term) stale...and the vocals????...well..a American Idol reject sounds better (I'm talkin try outs kids not the semi-final type). All and all adisapointing effort from a very musician...With that said...bringing in the DMB connection...the version of True Reflections that appears on Listener Supported is superior to the version on True Reflections. Also, if Tinsleywere not a member of DMB he would probably not been afforded the oppertunity to release this type of album..ie with him singing. Anyone who has seen them live knows the man cannot sing...maybe backup and even thats not always good."},{"rating":"1","title":"emil41","review":"I can't believe that I devoted ninety something minutes of my life to watch this garbage. I kept watching it, to see if something, anything, would happen. When it ended, I was relieved. I know of no special features on this disc as I couldn't get it out of my DVD player fast enough. I see absolutely no reason for this movie to be made. I thought that Tomb Raider II was a bad choice for a movie this weekend, it actually turned out to be the better (?) of the two.

This books could be used more as a reference to someone who has BEEN learning BJJ for sometime. This book is definitely not for the beginner. The explainations are very vague. A beginner would most likely execute the techniques improperly if not supplementing this book with an actual BJJ course. I would not recommend this for a beginner nor an advanced student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cover. Lousy inside.","review":"Unfortunately someone beat me to writing my thoughts of how lousy this book really is. Too bad considering the talent of the subject. The black and white pictures have little contrast to decipher what the combatants are doing. Many times the camera angles miss the important hand hold or actual technique required to be seen. The descriptions are almost non-existent and occasionally placed with the wrong picture. Unique Publications, Inc. sure blew this one. Let's hope Rigan is more successful with a second book. Don't waste your money on this book. Instead get Gracie's JiuJitsu. High quality in a its details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as the Royler/Renzo book.","review":"This is, overall, a pretty good look at the basics of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. The techniques are good, but the descriptions aren't nearly as detailed as the Renzo/Royler book. If you're just a beginner, this is a good book to have. If you're mid level or advanced, you've seen all of this already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Like other reviews have stated, this book was a HUGE disappointment. The pictures are of poor quality and the descriptions are worthless. The way this book is setup it's impossible to capture any of the details of the moves.

The complete emphasis of this book is on submissions from various positions. There is a tremendous amount on leg and foot locks that you won't find anywhere else. The \\"no gi\\" section is also valuable and unique. This book is not meant for a BJJ beginner since it does not cover positions, sweeps, escapes, or anything else except submissions. There is also not a lot of detail in the photography or the written explanation of the moves and a prior knowledge of BJJ would be required to fully understand everything. Despite the shortcomings, this is a very good and inexpensive book that will definitely add to your knowledge of submissions with and without a gi."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money...","review":"Rigan has produced the worst book I have ever encountered. It has many photos but it is very difficult to decipher whats he is doing from step to step. That along with the rediculously short explanations to accompany them makes studying the techniques almost impossible unless you already have a good grasp on grappling techniques in which case you wouldnt need this book anyway. I myself have written to Rigan expressing how dissapointed I was. Pick up the Gracies book if you want a jiujitsu refrence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware of this seller","review":"Beware of this person's overinflated selling price.

While shopping for cookware, we went to the county fair and watched a presentation on health craft cookware. This cookware seem to be the best for waterless cookware until they revealed the price at the end of the demonstration. Who in the hell has 3500.00 to spend on a set of cookware, I sure don't.

But this book was the first that actually believed he was human and not a god and took great pains to put a human face to the man. Given that he guarded his legacy and shaped it during his lifetime, we will never know the real man. But at least someone is trying to show us that he was human and had all the strengths and weakness of a man. For that, and only that, this book is invaluable. For those who only take interest in him because of the Hemmings controversy, you are missing out on so much. The political intrigue alone is worth reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure garbage; historical fiction","review":"How Ms. Brodie could be regarded as a serious historian is beyond me. Her version of Thomas Jefferson's life is nothing more than a poor work of fiction and should be categorized as such. Too many other real historians have actually done their research before setting pen to paper; scholars such as Henry Stephens Randall's The Life of Thomas Jefferson (fantastic biography), Dumas Malone's Thomas Jefferson (the six vol. set, not the one vol. abridged), and Merrill D. Peterson's Thomas Jefferson and The New Nation.Ms. Brodie's feeble account smacks of deep-rooted hatred. Don't waste your time with this trash. I am loathe to throw any book away, but I could not live with myself if I gave this copy to anyone.Brodie is not worthy of the one star rating I am forced to select if I wish to publish this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful Revisionist Misrepresentation","review":"My title for this review says it in a nutshell. One star for being reasonably well written/edited. But, why are some of these authors so intent on trying to defame Jefferson by twisting history the way Jefferson's original slanderer, Callender, did? It is certainly not good objective history. I would not want to lead any young reader down the wrong path with this revisionist history based on weak, weak opinion and speculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy, lurid psychobabble, twisted imagination but no history","review":"The book's title: Thomas Jefferson, An Intimate History has no relation to the book's text. The author weaves a lurid and unflattering view of our third president by simply exerting unrestrained imagination. The tale told simply cannot be called history just tabloid stuff.

Would not buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Brodie","review":"This book has all of the usual Brodie strengths and weaknesses. She wrote very well, and the biography is extremely readable. She almost always made unsustainable claims to know the inner mind of her subject. She seems to have been somewhat fixated on sex -- or on Freudianism, which may be worse -- and downplays other aspects of her subjects' lives that are very arguably more important (or, at least, are the aspects that make the subjects interesting in the first place).I can't recommend this book as a dependable biography of Jefferson. But it's a good read, and a great deal can be learned about Jefferson from it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A genuine waste of time","review":"I read this book only because a friend gave it to me as a present.

Thankfully, she is dead and can no longer encumber history with her swill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Pseudo-History","review":"This is by far the worst Jefferson biography on the market. It is a piece of what is called \\"psycho-history\\" in which the author makes a wide range of unbacked assertions which are rooted in absurd and often comical renderings of both Jefferson's words and actions.

Ms. Brodie, though having done some in-depth research (thus receiving a star from me), seems to have thrown most of it out in favor of psyco-analysis based on conjecture.

She integrated with her writings Freudian speculations about Jefferson's writings, whoever they were written to. In my opinion, Brodie did a poor job to mix these with her factual biography, and it did much to detract from it. I don't believe this book gives an accurate account of Jefferson and his relationships.It gave a fantastic account of how Jefferson was politically, as Revolutionary, American Politicion, and later, Republican, but her personal portrayal of Jefferson, and her speculations of his psyche ultimately left me feeling she was grasping for straws."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Relational History of Thomas Jefferson","review":"I am currently reading biographies for the Presidents of the United States in order. I selected this book due to its length, being a moderate read for only my third biography into this adventure. I did not wish to become overwhelmed too quickly by too long or tedious a book. I was truly disappointed in this biographjy as it did not cover any any serious depth his political decisions. This was an insightful biography strictly of his relationship throughout his life - with lovers, friends, enemies, etc. It detailed these relationships and gave insight into the reason these relationships were as they were. However, for someone interested in politics in general, and especially American revolutionary politics, this book was a real disappointment.

This novel is the sensitive, first-person account of the events during and after the end of World War II. At a time when Germany had been ravaged by war and the effects of its own over-ambition, Boll gives us the story a man, apolitical and barely alive. He shows us how love can blossom in and around the rubble left by the bombings and the shortages of the war. This love of his is strong, yet odd and difficult to imagine. Boll's setting of post-war Germany is seemingly the only context it could have I recommend this work to anyone looking for a novella that is deep in its emotion and broad in its observations of a culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the rubbles of Nazi-Germany","review":"This is an unfinished novel from Heinrich Böll, as usual he is writing about social differences, religion and love. The thing I liked most about the novel is that it takes place in a totally destructed German city in May 1945. There is something very interesting when a war ends and, an otherwise civilized country and people, return to civilization. (In undeveloped countries this is not so interesting because the culture that exisited before and after the war is so barbaric anyway. (like Somalia or Iraq)). But the scene in Germany and Japan just after WW2 was kind of interesting because it was highly developed countries, especially nazi Germany. Anyway the book is unfinished so the plot is a little confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Earth Day -- here's the perfect book to celebrate it!","review":"This book came out one year ago today, and it couldn't be more appropriate.

But, as you would expect, this book is not really just for kids. Anyone fan of the \\"Far Side\\" is sure to get a kick out of this book too. The story starts with father, mother and son earthworm sitting (?) down for a dinner of dirt, when the son complains about life as a worm. Father tells him the rambling story of Harriet, who loves nature even though she misunderstands just about all of it. This somehow leads to the dreaded moral of the story and the truth behind the hair in the dirt.

Humor is predominent in this \\"educational fairy tale.\\" But the younger crowd can opt to throw away the educational part for the time being and jump into a barrel of laughs with Larson's drawings and his depiction of Worm Family Life. As the years go by, the growing reader may find more humor (irony, sarcasm, etc.) in the \\"educational, pontificating\\" parts. But, chances are, they will not be disappointed!I'm certainly looking forward to reading the next Larson Picture Book.

Not at all what I expected.","review":"I'm a big Gary Larson fan, but I thought this book was a bit much, even for him. I understand the point he was trying to make (that is, 'tug at one thing in nature and you'll find it is connected to everything else'), but he was waaay too severe with driving it home, particularly that ending. This is not a bedtime story!On the other hand, if his goal was to set readers thinking about what we are doing to the environment, even with the best intentions, and how it may come back to haunt us, then touche'!Nevertheless, it gave me the willies, and I'm no hothouse flower."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR KIDS!","review":"Bought this book to add to my classroom library, but it is NOT appropriate for a school setting!!!

After being married, it is easy to forget how to keep the romance secondary. The principles are sound and though it can be adapted, I don't think a person can go wrong by adhering to the principles.It is also nice how it gives concrete examples of how to implement the concept.

My three kids (5, 2, and 1) absolutely love it! They listen to it on their CD/Clock Radio as they get dressed for school every morning.What I really appreciate is that it is conveying the Jazz form to the kids at an early age. All of the other music CDs that we have are either classical, traditional (e.g., Veggie Tales), or more \\"popular.\\" The music on this CD introduces my kids to \\"swing\\" and the syncopated rhythms that are key to jazz. I love to hear them try to sing along and play their toy drums to the rhythm. It also introduces them to some of the jazz greats such as Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and Louis Prima (well, sort of a Jazz great).I believe this is a must-have for any child's music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Never Gets Old","review":"A great CD!When it comes to music for kids, I can only handle so much. Luckily, there are a few creative CDs like this one and world music from Putumayo (the blessing there being that I don't understand foreign languages other than Spanish so I can listen to them for hours without going nuts with the repetition and sillyness).

My husband loves jazz, so bought this for our 17-month-old daughter. She will listen to the CD at least 3 times a day. It starts with a rousing rendition of \\"Old McDonald\\" by Ella Fitzgerald, a truly great singer. I love \\"Ain't Nobody Here But Us Chickens\\".

My 2-year-old son loves Ella's \\"Old MacDonald\\" and \\"Muffin Man\\", our 1-year-old loves it all, and my husband, who is a professional musician leans towards \\"Mumbles\\". I dare you to listen to this and not smile from ear to ear the whole way through - impossible - so fun!!! Great CD!!!!We are Dan Zanes fans and this is of the same caliber and just as classic - you don't get sick of it so fast - important for a kids CD.

Using the phrase, \\"to heck with it\\" I don't think is appropriate for them to repeat.

For a while it is saved by the low expectations the title engenders: the dialog isn't stupid, the cast all turn in reasonable performances (though only old pro Lin Shaye and Jack Black impersonator Tyler Labine really register), and nothing is as juvenile as it could have been. \\"A Good Old Fashioned Orgy\\" is aimable, but it doesn't make you laugh, so what's the point? Still, there is something heartening about what is nominally a romantic comedy not punishing its characters for wanting sex. The orgy of the title leads to complications and hurt feelings (otherwise there'd be no movie) but not to a stock conclusion in which everyone learns that sex with anyone other than a True Love who is The One is a character flaw that must result in comeuppance and heartbreak. In this way, this mediocre trifle becomes accidentally subversive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set !!!","review":"Loved it, loved it, loved it!

Don't let that light skin and centerfold sex kitten image of Blu fool you. She not only can sing, she has a powerful voice. More R & B (a little less hip hop) and a few more tightly written songs and you would have to put her next to Kelly Price in your collection. Some would still say she belongs there now.

She's gotten permission to stay away from home every afternoon for a month, doing research on her current project. In the library she overhears Julio and two friends discussing various sites where they can pursue their interests without disturbing anyone or being interrupted. They decide on the local haunted house and Susan is invited to join them. But this House really is haunted. Nathan was about their age when he hung himself in 1918, and when Susan listens to this House, it talks to her.

The strings provide a breathing-like sonic carpet (rug?) to the piano's dense (almost chunky) clusters. Those clusters might verge on claustrophobic but there is an incredible beauty to them.

I find multiple sources on the web that contradict this. They say the minor of a matrix is the _determinant_ of a matrix value.

He offers very little illustrations and explanations to demonstrate the problem. When he does offer it, he tends to skip a number steps before arriving at the answer.

I have 2 Yorkshire mini terriers and they can hardly pull the connection along let alone walk properly.Not a faulty product, but should be a much clearer advertisement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product!!","review":"We are very happy with this coupler and walking our 2 large dogs is a breeze as I only have to use one retractable leash. I'm able to adjust the length of the leash but not the coupler. I agree with another reviewer that an adjustment to the coupler would be helpful. I'd personally like to adjust the coupler so that my dogs are walking closer together but that's personal preference and based upon my dogs' behavior.

Could have been very dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"This is a good quality product it just didn't work for us. Our dogs just both like to sniff different areas of the grass and when they would do this the bigger dog would pull the other one even when he was going potty. The only real complaint would be that it doesn't adjust real good for different sized dogs. When you do adjust it the bigger dog can't really go side to side cause the tether is to short, or he drags the smaller one even more.But we gave it 2 stars cause the quality is good :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sporn Double Dog Coupler","review":"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!

When the latch worked, it was great; it comes in handy when you need to walk through a tight or populated area. But once the latch is broken, there is nothing from stopping the coupler leash from sliding back and forth through the attachment to the extendable leash, making walking two dogs very difficult. You'll wind up with one dog with a much longer leash than the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book","review":"I had one of these at one time and lost it.

If you love German Lieder, do not hesitate, get this CD, you will be most impressed. Both Bostridge and Drake are superb, world class artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must CD for lovers of lieder (and your friends)","review":"Ian Bostridge is already a sensation, and this is the CD that probably started it. Like many others, I have multiple versions of these songs, notably by the great Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. But Bostridge's CD is so well done that I have bought multiple copies of it, to send to friends, family members, anyone who I think deserves to disover these songs. Bostridge's is a light and lyrical voice; he is already being compared to the late Peter Pears. He is ideal for many of these songs; he really puts meaning into every one--not like those singers who just sing the notes and display a beautiful voice. And his accompanist is equally fine--Drake's playing in \\"Auf dem Wasser zu Singen\\" is just marvelous in evoking the setting of this wonderful song. This is one of the best CDs of any kind in years. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erlkonig note","review":"I'd like to mention that the reason I bought this CD was because the Erlkonig that is contained on it in sang and played in G minor. This is the original key for the piece. Most (I'd say at least 9 out of 10) recordings of the song (including Fischer-Deskau) are in F minor. A good amount are sung by women. However, it is a VERY rare find indeed to hear Erlkonig in G minor. Also, Liszt transcribed this work for piano solo, and that's in G minor. Of course, most people don't care about the right key of the piece, but for those who do, like myself, this CD is the one you want. It's also a very good recording, as his voice is less harsh than most male singers, and thus more enjoyable to those not already into classical vocal works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refined singing, but the voice is an acquired taste","review":"Ian Bostridge is a phenomenon, the darling of British critics and one of the few lieder recitalists today who can fill arnegie Hall. I've heard him there and on CD, and I don't get his enormous appeal. Usually when you dislike an artist revered by almost everyone else, it's best to keep quiet, but I must say this hooty, small voice with its limited range, along with Bostridge's precious underlining of every word, is so off the mark that I have to register a complaint. There is much refinement in his singing, and an admirable dramatic commitment, but none of that seems like adequate compensation. Now everyone can go on enjoying themselves, apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really essential","review":"Now I love the Clash as much as anyone else, but this DVD isn't really needed.

However, it lacks serious military or historical analysis, and I only recommend it to someone seeking a general overview of these wars events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable Reference","review":"Modern Warfare is a must have for anyone interested in 20th Century conflict. The series, produced by the British news agency ITN, covers all the major wars after WWII including Korea, Vietnam, the Arab-Israeli Wars of 1967, 1973, and 1982, the Russian war in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War, the Falklands War, and the Persian Gulf War of 1991. Special Forces and Terrorism are also covered. The episodes about Korea and Vietnam were lackluster, not nearly as detailed as other documentaries I've seen, but the episodes about the Arab-Israeli Wars featured some etraordinary rare footage. The episode about the Iran-Iraq War is the crown jewel, featuring extremely rare footage and an in-depth account of that conflict you won't find in any other documentary ever made. If for any other reason, this DVD set should be bought for its uniqueness. Modern Warfare is a unique historical archive to be viewed by anyone who wants to see what war is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great REAL footage of battle","review":"My favourite war documentary it is packed with real life footage from wars explaining the events from a neutral standpoint.

If you are interested in the study of fiction, try this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's out of print for good reason!","review":"This thing received enormous hype when it was released several years back. As with so many hyped items, there's not much there there when you get to the actual work. It's essentially a soap opera with some extra-juicy lines thrown in.

It is definetely not worth reading. His characters are shallow incoherent blurbs, vignettes, and when the narrative as a whole is viewed after stepping back, it becomes clear what waste the book truly is.

You can be caught unawares with insipid portrayal of events that led to the bloodbath. A comparative analysis was remarkably absent making it a hackneyed attempt to divide a wedge among the intellectual community.It could be rather gratifying if the author could treat this subject in academiocal point of view after miserably failing in portraying the narration.Albeit all this lacunae, remarkable tendency to sensationalize the events to throw the reader into shocks, which only end up the reader jittery and wary of the intent of neo-communist diaspora.My half a cent to this -regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"The key text for the contemporary study of middle powers","review":"The role of middle powers in international politics has come under increasing scruntiny in the post-Cold War period. Holbraad's text stands as a core analysis of the role that middle powers have played in various historical systems and presents an interesting and inciteful argument about the structural determinants of middle power behaviour. For those wishing to gain a deeper appreciation of the role of middle powers in international politics, this book should be the first point of reference. Holbraad's conclusion, that middle powers enjoy the greatest opportunity to influence outcomes when the international system is not governed by strict bipolarity, has important implications for the contemporary understanding of international relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not especially good, but not horrendous either","review":"I was actually looking for a book about Sawney Beane, and thought that this was one.

It does not adequately cover any of these areas. It tries to teach by showing the reader a conversation, but it goes no further. It has no discussion of common phrases or grammar, and the conversations are too situation specific. It does have a list of colors, months, numbers, etc. in the back of the book. The software portion is more of the same. I have limited knowledge of Spanish, and bought this book for a medical trip to Peru and found it to be practically useless. I would recommend spending your money on a good dictionary or phrasebook, or looking into some of the Spanish language software that is available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice, early eighties, electronic music from Netherlands.","review":"Nova was a Dutch electronic music band, the \\"commercial\\" branch of Peru group. By 1982 they reached the number 1 position in the Dutch Hitparades with a song called Aurora. Later then, they scored another hit called Sol. The group consisted of keyboard players and programmers Ruud Van Es, Rob Papen and Peter Kommers. All songs are composed by them, some together with producer Chris Pilgram, and performed using almost all kinds of Roland and Korg devices: synthesizers, sequencers, rhythmcomposers, vocoders etc.Their music, although not very complex, have, indeed, a high level of sophistication, demonstrating their skills on performing all these instruments and devices.A carefull listening will reveal some good influence coming from Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis.The first five songs are from their 1983 album called \\"Quo Vadis\\".

The plot-line, about an unhappy city guy, his unhappy wife, and their hapless children, seems to be dashing to its end, but is constantly running into marginal plot lines getting there. Perhaps the author needed to take advantage of the critical and financial success of his first book and just didn't take enough time with this.

However, the main character and his motives are so underdeveloped that I didn't only not know who he really was, but I didn't care.

Most tracks are in true stereo, only track 1 and 9 are in mono. A stereo note on the back of the CD jewel box states the following:\\"Tracks 1 & 9 are mono from full track master tapes, tracks 10, 13-14 from 2 track stereo sources, tracks 2-8 are stereo from 3 track session master tapes; tracks 11-12 are stereo from 8 track session master tapes.\\"The CD is produced by Taragon. They have established a well deserved reputation for obtaining the highest level master tapes in existence. This CD is no exception. However, \\"Tonight I Fell In Love\\" was recorded and released in true stereo and has been available in stereo in the past.

I'm taking the test tomorrow, and I fear for my grade. Having worked with Oracle8i since its release, I was just looking for a quick read to brush up on the breadth of topics in the exam, and get reaquainted with the exam style for the Oracle tests. Boy I sure started with the wrong book. The amount of technical errors are astounding, particularly in the exam questions! In addition, the exam questions are poorly written and do not appear to have any relation to the style I will expect on the test.

There arejust too many technical mistakes. For example, the book alwaysseems to mix up DBMS_OLAP and DBMS_SUMMARY. These are technical mistakes, not just typos. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of typos also. This would not be so bad if errata were available. None was found at the designated web page specified in the book. It is nice to know that Oracle Press has not changed its way. Similar comments are being made about the book that is used to upgrade from Oracle8i to Oracle9i. My recommendation is to use the exams provided by the \\"Self Test Software\\" company. Not only are the test questions good but they will also respond to issuesthat you may have with the question or answer. Oh, I don't have any financial interest in the \\"Self Test Software\\" company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I am really surprised with such a low overall rating for this book. It definitely has errata, but overall presentation, fluid style makes it very easy to read even for difficult topics (such as composite partitioning, dimensioning - especially if you are not using it). I found it very helpful, and there was nothing in the exam that was not covered in the book. The examcram book along with Oracle Documentation (and, of course, hands on experience) you will definitely be able to pass exam, and your Oracle8i knowledge will improve. It is really amazing to find all the new features which exist in Oracle8i (and lot more in Oracle9i), which makes database administration so much more simpler.

Normally I know \\"who done it\\" fairly early on in books but Michael keeps me guessing for more than 3/4s of the book. The characters are real and people you can relate to.

Unfortunately, the story is flat and actually leaves the reader with an odd view of transsexualism.Populated with one-dimensional characters and dominated by mind-numbing chunks of summary, the story never comes alive, never seems real. The use of third person throughout the book almost suggests multiple personalities, rather than different aspects/experiences of one person...perpetuating the myth that transsexuals have Multiple Personality Disorder, which is a different issue, entirely. In fact, there is little background on transsexualism...no historical or medical perspective.\\"Crossing\\" will give you a sense of Dr. McCloskey, but not a good understanding of the transsexul experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Days","review":"Broken days is on of the best and most compelling books I have ever read.

The other two, her Twelve Preludes for piano (1953) and the \\"Grand Duet\\" (1959), are important productions of her youth.

I also like the way in which Pagels, in this work, weaves in just enough of her own story and background to let you know the particular ground on which she stands - and rich ground it is! If you have ever found yourself questioning how specific theological points of view came to be \\"canonized\\" over others, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough information about Thomas","review":"Disappointing....The book is only 1/5th about the Gospel of Thomas, 3/5ths about the history of the early church; and, 1/5 was about the life events which led her to look at Church history differently.If you want a short introduction of the history of the early church and its evolution then this may be a book for that.The cover was beautiful, the book was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another highly accessible and inspirational outing.","review":"Elaine Pagels has done it again, turning out another highly readable and eloquent exposition of religious truth. Although she focuses on the Gospel of Thomas rather less than her title would suggest, she nevertheless gets to the heart of the matter: the rich diversity of Christian origins and modes of belief. I found the description of her attempt to find meaning in religious faith during and after her son's death revealing and compelling. Elaine Pagels remains an inspiration to those of us who reject the dogma and bigotry of \\"comic-book Christianity\\" (my phrase), but still seek to rely on our religious tradition for guidance, solace, and strength. She is for me a leading member of a group of writers including John Dominic Crossan, Marcus Borg, and Kathleen Norris who make it possible for thinking people to reclaim their religious heritage. Like Borg and Norris in particular, her books are highly accessible and aimed at the general reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pagel's Pays the Mortgage.","review":"This work By Dr Pagels contains no new information and should be called Pagel's repeats. I have read Adam,Eve and the Serpant, the Origin of Sin and the Gnostic Gospels and enjoyed them all but this latest book is just a tiresome rehashing of what she has written before. There is very little in the book about the gospel of Thomas and no new insights into gnosticism that she has not written before.This book reminds me of a greatest hits albumn released because the band needs to pay the mortgage. Nothing new or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"So, Thomas said what you are seeking, Christ, is in you, all of you. John said to look not into yourself. So what? Lots of Christian thought says that you need to look for Christ within you. Read Meister Eckhart. Is that now OK when it was previously Gnostic? John may not be Gnostic, but it is filled with gnosticisms, dualities, light, veils, etc. Sufism is filled with gnosticisms; Kaballah is filled with gnosticisms, esp. that of 16th C Sefat and Isaac Luria. Being gnostic in thought does not make one a Gnostic. The Gospel of John is just as gnostic as is the Gospel of Thomas."},{"rating":"1","title":"The secret Gospel of Thomas","review":"Very disappointing. It ends with Jesus saying a woman must become male to enter the kingdom of heaven. Pleeeeese. This is one secret that never should have never been let out of the bag. Reads like a doctoral dissertation.Robertroberg.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Religion of the heart; Religion of the head","review":"Elaine Pagels' book is a touching look at how a relgious scholar through personal tragedy came to get in touch with the experience of faith. It seems to me that she started with a religion of the head (understanding through intellect, history, language and cultural background) and then came to experience something outside and greater than herself. This book is less a work of scholarship and more a personal revelation. Along with other books about the early church, there seems to be a developing school of thought that the early church was more diverse and less well defined than reading the gospels might imply. I found her description of how the gospels became THE GOSPELS to be informative without being unnesccesarily critical of those involved. This is not the most research-based and empirical book available on the topic; it an interesting personal statement with an introduction to contmeporary religious scholarship and well worth reading on its own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ENTRE INTO THE WORLD OF EARLY CHRISTIANITY","review":"If you have read Gary Wills' Why I Am A Catholic, you will see how from the early middle ages on, the communities of believers who already possessed the creed became the modern Catholic Church. This book on the other hand brings us to the first 2 centuries of christianity, and shows us the debate between those who were building a creed by editing, and those charismatic christians who were full of the spirit.She also gives some room for those who while no longer believers, long for Christ's message"},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is very accurate, it's beyond belief.","review":"This is just another attempt of man falling,(again), for the same original lie that Satan promised to Eve in the garden of Eden. (That promise being that man can become a god. See Genesis 3: 4,5) My advice is avoid this book and read the Gospel of John in the Authorized (King James) Version in order to receive eternal life through the Lord Jesus Christ.The Gospel of John does not contradict the other 65 books of the Bible, but \\"Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas\\" surely does contradict all 66 books of the Bible, and that is why it never was a part of the canon of Scripture and never will be.If you need a Bible, Amazon has a good selection of Authorized (King James) Bibles published by Cambridge University Press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to beyond,,,","review":"I have always enjoyed Pagels, I have found all of her books enlightening. I found something in this book I hadn't realized in any of her others. The motivation for writing beyond belief. I base what I have found on her autobiography here, her experiences and the sweetened analysis of the Gospel according to St John. Pagels is searching like the rest of us. There is this uncanny critisism of the faith yet the undertones of reliance on Christainity, we are all human aren't we. I suggest reading SB 1 or God by Maddox, he has done what Pagels is desperately searching for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Pop Religion","review":"Its quite simple really. If you compare John and Thomas, you get differences. John is the \\"Philosopher's Gospel\\", Thomas, the magicians.Before you start accepting this, read about the Gnostics, Manicheans and Marcions in a historical light, see all the things they didn't understand about Christianity, then read this and realize where it all went wrong.You might as well read the Apocryphal Acts of Paul and Peter while you're at it, they're sorta similar... the part where Peter starts flying is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to read the Gospel Of Thomas. What I got was Elaine Pagels recollections of the Catholic Church and a short history. All of which would have been fine if I was not looking to read the Gospel of Thomas. Other wise it is not a horrible book, just not what I was in the market for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad scholarship","review":"Though this book was popular in certain circles in the early church, the author ignores the fact the Church Fathers (mentored by the original disciples)were unanimous in rejecting it. While it does have some authentic quotations from Jesus (found in the other authentic gospels), it is also mixed in with massive doses of bizarre teachings. An example: \\"When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female female; and when you fashion eyes in place of an eye, and a hand in the place of a hand and a foot in place of a foot and a likeness in place of a likeness; then you will enter [the kingdom].\\" Yeah, Elaine, you strapped yourself to a real winner. You found a gospel that reflects your bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pagels Drops the Ball","review":"Elaine Pagels is known within the Gnostic Christian community as an author whose scholarship is impecable. Her first book \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" is used to introduce interested persons to the Nag Hammadi library of texts, and for one reason, because it does the job with an emphasis upon an analysis of the texts. Beyond Belief: The Secret Gospel of Thomas would appear to be an exegesis of the Gospel of Thomas(hereafter called \\"Thomas\\"), however it appears to be more of an autobiography combined with personal insights.Thomas is rarely mentioned in any substantial fashion throughout the course of her writing. There are more thorough exegesis of this phenomonal gospel available in print. If you're looking for an auto-biography and personal experience, buy this book. If not, I would highly advise keeping away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Where is the Gospel of Thomas?\\"","review":"I want to begin by observing that this book has been grossly mis-titled. I purchased this book in the hopes of finding the text of the Gospel of Thomas with scholarly commentary. I found neither. Instead, I found a meandering writing which began with the authors own personal experience of rediscovering church followed by random pieces of gnostic text, church history, commentary and personal reflection. I found this book to be neither scholarly nor spiritual. I would not recommend this to anyone seeking either. This book was a disappointment, and if it were possible to get a refund for \\"false advertising\\", I would pursue it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither flesh nor fowl","review":"Although it is clear that Elaine Pagels is an admirable person whose views are interesting (when focused), this book is really a collection of fuzzy discussions loosely surrounding the development of the Christian canon. The subtitle would seem to indicate that it is about the \\"Secret Gospel of Thomas,\\" but the author quickly abandons that gospel, fastening on her subjects only long enough to satisfy the most uninformed interest.Pagels' personal religious perspective seems interesting, but even that is not well developed. Parts of the first section, where she is dealing specifically with her own struggles over belief in the face of losing a child are very promising. I began to look forward to a continuing discussion of her spiritual development set against scholarship about the Gnostic gospels and how they might affect Christian belief in the modern world.But this vein, like others in this very short book, fades out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing!","review":"A good, if one-sided, overview of Christian Gnosticism. Elaine gives us a \\"good parts\\" version of the Gnostic scriptures, focusing on what she has found useful in her own spiritual life. Because of this, the wacky, sci-fi side of Gnostic belief is non-existent in her pages. No Aeons, Powers, or Demiurges, no \\"elect few\\" or negative views of physical existence.Because of this, you get Gnosticism minus a lot of the heresy. This leaves us with something much akin to the writings of orthodox Christian mystics. But nevertheless, this is an enjoyable read, and will no doubt be helpful to those (like myself) who grew up in a constrictive version of the Christian faith. Beyond Belief can be a breath of fresh air, and can enhance one's understanding early Christianity's development. Just don't think your getting the \\"whole story\\" regarding the Gnostics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book","review":"I have to say that I found this to be an amazing book, though not quite what it is advertised to be. Pagels does discuss the gospel of Thomas somewhat here and there and she includes Thomas's book at the end of her book, but this book is more about the Gospel of John and early Christian history and the formation of the church and biblical canon. I didn't quite get what I was expecting, but I still got a great book that taught me a lot. This is a great book for anyone who has questions about Christianity. It might answer some questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it to be informative, as all of Ms. Pagels' books are, but I am completely mystified by the subtitle \\"... the Secret Gospel of Thomas.\\" In fact, the book contains almost nothing about that particular Gospel. Most of the analysis was about the cannonical Gospel of John, how and why it was written, how it played against the early Gnostic sects of Christianity (though she has chosen not to use that term in this book). The book should have been titled more forthrightly; I was very disappointed that it was, in fact, NOT about the Gospel of Thomas, other than a very few brief mentions. The book was really more an exposition of how the early orthodox church became established, why it did what it did to supplant the 'heretics.' Which was interesting, but not \\"the Secret Gospel of Thomas.\\" Why the deception?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal, not Systematic Exegesis","review":"Pagels' book is an almost-too-good representation of syncretist gnostic thought. The fact is, though, to understand the Idea or Essence in any system of thought, we must go to the doctors or epitomes of that creed. The proper study of this dualism, and its relation (anti-relation) to Christianity is to be found in, e.g., Manichaeism, Buddhism, Catharism. Dried-up popular and superficial creeds don't have the life in them that these more excellent (and demanding faiths) do. The proof is plain; each of these aforementioned movements has its Saints. Where, I might (unfairly) ask, are the martyrs, the living perfections of the New Age movement? One actually has to stifle his laughter; it (Gnosticism) will fade again, and return again; no matter. Pagels is no saint."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine study of censorship in canonization","review":"The key to this work is in the comparison of the Gospel ofThomas with John. In looking at the comparison, I found the text extremely helpful in outlining how the early Church Fathers were trying to shape and control the beliefs of the followers of that faith. It is insightful, I believe, that \\"imagination\\" and personal interpretation was what those early Fathers held in suspicion. You see, if we can come to a faith with courage, using our own resources, then who needs the church. As a matter of fact, I think Pagel's work liberates us from the years of dependency and calls us to ourselves to find a faith. I loved this book! Thank you Dr. Pagels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Book title is misleading. I expected a book that provided insight into Thomas. Other than a listing of the Gospel of Thomas, there is very little about Thomas other than his disagreement with the \\"author of the Book of John\\". Ms. Pagels provides considerable discussion about \\"John\\" and about Irenaeus but nothing substantial about the Disciple Thomas."},{"rating":"1","title":"billie","review":"This product took a few days longer to ship, and arrived, just shy of the 14 day promise.

Someone recommended this book to me because it's more \\"unbiased and convincing\\". As a person who is growing in faith, I decided to check this little book out. After 50 pages, I had to put it down because there is no way I can follow the author's arguement. In fact, I only saw a compile of passages in the 4 orthodox gospels and the gospel of Thomas, under a bunch of loosely constructed themes. It's not \\"convincing\\" in anyway, because I can't see her points! Might as well read all these gospels and reach your own conclusion.If you want to read this book, I suggest you sit down for a whole day and finish it in one shot, because that is the only way to understand what the author is trying to get at. I only have a couple of hours for reading every day at the most, so I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Christian","review":"If you are looking to buy this book for an in depth view of The Gospel of Thomas keep searching. This book is no more than someones personal views toward Christianity. I read the complete book and learned nothing but a woman who is angry with God for personal tragedies in her life. She filled the book with referrances to scholars that back her bitterness to Christianity. I can only say that I hope the Lord brings peace and true understanding to her but I will not waste my time and money on anymore books by Elaine pagels."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"ordered the dvd got the cd instead is the reason for a poor rating.But the cd is great Byron Cage is a awesome songwriter and director"},{"rating":"1","title":"All business, no technology.

That said, the coverage of the cultural aspects of DEC is reasonably good, but the authors miss the point entirely that DEC was merely a culture.

A virtual voice lesson. De Los Angeles is exquisite as Nedda and her \\"Qual Fiamma Avea Nel Guardo...Hui! Stridono Lassu (Song of the Birds)\\" will melt your heart. Another luxury this recording holds is the magificently rich baritone voice of Robert Merrill as Silvio, Nedda's village lover, who sings the treacherously high tessitura of this role magnificently.

I read several books and found this one to be the best. I used it with my own children (ages 5 & 7) when my father died and have since given it to several other families in the same circumstance. Explaining death to a child is difficult, especially as you're grieving yourself. This book explains it in terms that a child understands - see other reviews for more details on that. I HIGHLY recommend this book for any follower of Christ who needs to explain death to a child. It should be a constant on the shelf of every Children's Pastor, Children's Minister, Children's Sunday School Teacher or Senior Pastor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about death from a Biblical perspective","review":"My Grandma recently passed away, and my two young daughters are having a very hard time with it.

I am a religious person too, but I don't agree with this narrow view point...I don't care if others do but I don't want to spend my money to read about it either!!

Hello?! I thought I was buying a book based on psychology and how to change, not a book about how some of us are fated to be bad (game over!). This book is mislabeled. \\"Self-help/relationships\\" is the category printed on the back cover--those books are supposed to be able to teach us how to change, not preach the author's religious beliefs.

The author tells of a life filled with dramatic reversals yet he says it all with a touch of poetic irony and humor that lifts the reader's spirits. I guess it's fiction but it seems so truthful and real you think it has to be autobiographical. You can lose yourself in his dreamy prose and will be eager for the next line. You can't wait to see what will happen next and how he will cope with it all. It's a book that you don't want to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and mysterious","review":"This is a strange little book. I bought it without knowing anything about the author or his work, and enjoyed it very much on a superficial level. But I also know that I missed out on a lot in the book- nuances and references which I will probably never understand given that I am not Czech. This is a book I want to re-read soon, and I will do so thoroughly.The narrator is a fascinating creation. He breezes through a strange life without being unduly affected by whatever fortunes or misfortunes life tosses at him, playing the hand that he is dealt. His adventures make for a good read, and unlike some other Czech novels I have read the book is quite simple, not a hard slog from cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another War, Another Picaresque Czech Novel","review":"I guess this falls in that category of picaresque comic novels that is somewhat interesting and sometimes amusing, but somewhat oblique in its tone. This ironic tone taken toward those who just tried to get along with their conquerors strikes me as somehow distinctly Czech (at least I've not run across it elsewhere). The book follows the exploits of a ambitious small busboy with modern Czech history as the setting, concentrated on WWII. His apparent naivete and good humor invites comparisons to The Good Soldier Svejk--especially in the section where he obtains a Nazi girlfriend during the occupation--but there's a fair amount of bawdiness and tragedy as well. It's a novel much more likely to appeal to students of Czech history or Eastern European literature than a general reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Survived the King of Overrated Books","review":"I know I'm pretty much alone down here in two star land, but I was really disappointed by this novel. The style was irritatingly coy, cute and cliched. The narrator is insufferable. He brags about making whores fall in love with him and making absurd amounts of money selling hot dogs. Money always seems to equal happiness in this book, and there's much wasting of money too, gaily throwing it in the street and so on, to show off. Many cliches about rich people and their lovers. Is it all a spoof, a satire? Still tiresome, whatever it is. Creepy scene where he's \\"blessed\\" by Haile Selassie. Precious vignettes. Bursting at the seams with cliched phrases: \\"tears of joy\\", \\"a heavenly expression on his face\\", etc, etc (you can't blame them all on the translator).

But I should know by now to check measurements, pictures can be deceiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd","review":"I ordered this book as a means of sharpening flagging Spanish language skills. I sent it back immediately, it was that bad. First of all the book is tiny (which is an insult considering the price); secondly the biographies of the authors (written in English) are longer than many of the stories themselves, which isn't saying much.

Once I got past the misleading synopsis on back of the novel and accepted the novel for what it really was, I became intensely involved. Roger Williams and Vivian Twostar are stereotypes, which is the point. They are cariactures; Dorris and Erdrich having a little fun with the stereotypes people have placed on them. The depth of character found in Erdrich's other novels is clearing missing; however, _The Crown of Columbus_ is a different kind of novel. It is a modern romance, detective, adventure, and historical novel at the same time. I recommend this book to someone looking for an entertaining read; anyone seeking high literature should read Erdrich's _Tracks_"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"Anti-climactic is the best single phrase to describe this book. I guess it depends on what you want in a novel. It starts out with the air of mystery surrounding the \\"Crown of Columbus\\" and what it actually is; sort of a historical mystery, although fictional. The book then becomes a story about the two main characters and their on-again/off-again romance of opposites. Most of the book is about this romance and the action and resolution of the mystery don't really get going until the very end. By the time you find out what the \\"Crown\\" is, it is sort of \\"so what?\\" In other words, not very satisfying. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly awful!","review":"I never bothered learning the names of the characters because everyone was a stereotype. . . we have \\"Honorable Native American woman trying to make it in the white man's world\\"; fifth generation male WASP with obsessive compulsive tendancies; ever wise and quirky Grandmother; rebellious teen age male, miracluous infant daughter; and greedy immoral industrialist.I did enjoy the description of the early research in the Dartmouth library . . . .but none of what was hinted at materialized and the \\"Indiana Jones\\" ending made me throw my copy of the book against the wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh....tedious","review":"After just finishing Dorris' book Yellow Raft on Blue Water, which was the first of his books I have read, I couldn't wait to get my hands on ANYthing else he had written. Unfortunately, the Crown of Columbus was the only one of his books my library had, so I grabbed it. I have to admit I only got in to it one chapter, but I knew immediately it just wasn't working for me. It didn't grab me like Yellow Raft did right from the very first paragraph! Sorry!

It was made sometime in the 1970's and the screen quality (even on DVD) is horrible. What's worse is the awful overdub. At the beginning of the movie an announcer explains that there is not a lot of information on the childhood of Leonardo DaVinci, but this is what could have happened...and they create little childhood for DaVinci. I thought this would have had biographers and mini dramatizations on DaVinci's life...not a full movie recreating his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth seeing... heed the reviews here.","review":"I'm so glad I read the reviews before purchasing!

It is very comprehensive and will give you great detail about his life. I really recommend this DVD to any Renaissance fan or anybody that want to witness our true potential as human beings. Da Vinci invented the parachute before people could fly or even thought about it...I was in particular fascinated about the extra material in this two DVD package, offered a more artistic information about his masterpieces.Any Da Vinci fan will love this DVD although I think it still does not truly reflect the maestro's legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Damaged Goods","review":"If you check the Amazon reviews for the previous version of this DVD, you will see a number of disgruntled reviewers remarking how Questar released a grossly edited version of this excellent series, cutting out great chunks of on-screeen narration that were part of the great appeal and informative character of the original. With the chance to correct that failure with this new DVD release and restore the lost value, Questar has once again cheated viewers and disrespected the artists who created this series, adding supplementary shorts, but leaving the main documentary in its still badly mangled form.By all means, get the VHS version and view it first, which I thankfully already own, if you want to see what these filmmakers really did, rather than settling for the this hatchet job Questar has shamelessly, repeatedly marketed to DVD shoppers. A disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Compilation","review":"Although I purchased this CD for one song, Uneasy Rider, I found that there were several on here that I had forgotten about. Charlie Daniels really lets loose on his songs and gets into them. The energy of band comes flowing through with each and every song on the compilation. The CDB puts a bit of comedy in their songs such as The Devil Went Down To Georgia and Uneasy Rider.

Falta agilidade para Norina e Ninetta e muita dramaticidade para Violetta, porém suas Lauretta e Nedda so deliciosas. Quanto a Domingo, prefiro-o como tenor (nos áureos tempos, é claro) à regente; embora seja seguro, fica muito longe de um Solti, um Abbado ou um Mutti. Mesmo assim esse CD é um ótimo retrato da artista, em suas muitas qualidades e poucas insuficincias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screechy, generic soprano","review":"I bought this because Madame Vaduva had escaped my attention. Before the first track was over, I realized how this (apparently unlikely) event had taken place.

That's the only time Scooby Doo was ever interesting to me, when the monsters turn out to be real and they get creative with how the characters have to react to it. The 'guy in a mask' routine was old back in the seventies. It bored me. I wish they would do it with the monsters being real again. It was popular in the eighties with The Thirteen ghosts of Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo and the Boo Brothers, Scooby Doo and the Ghoul School, and Scooby Doo and the Reluctant werewolf. And it was popular again in the nineties with the slightly darker Witch's Ghost, Space Invaders, and Zombie Island.

However, nobody in our household likes this flick. Two bucks at Walmart was way too much. Neither of my kids (3 & 6) will watch it. It freaks them out. About every 5 minutes some hideous being shrieks its head off. It sounds like a horror flick. Way too intense for children's entertainment. This movie definitely doesn't have the same feel as other Scooby movies. Why change a good thing? Now my kids are wondering if maybe Scooby is too scary for them to watch. I'm not going to be buying anymore Scooby Doo DVD's if this is the best they can do anymore. Maybe I'll just consider our Scooby library complete and pass up newer releases. Progress.

I could go on.I'm a huge Scooby fan. And despite all the parents freaking out about the \\"real monster\\" ones, frankly I think they've been some of the best.

Then came the first album, S.F.P.C., which included songs from the original EP but rerecorded with higher production values + some new material. The first album seemed to lack the hypnotic chaos of their live shows. This new album has them back on track: spooky, tense atmosphere & tight lurking rhythms. It's great to hear them move away from anything radio friendly to really capture more of the hypnotic tension of their live sets - with all the rough edges.

There are many superb Gospel Choirs in the UK,but this is certainly not one of them. The leads were uninspiring with the exception of the superb Jeffrey Osborne who sadly could not redeem a very poor Show.

When I saw MIckey Jones(World Tour 1966 see reviews) being interviewed any credibility this dvd had went right out the window. I don't recommend this to anyone.

Acting was fine but plot dragged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Forgettable Movie","review":"I must have seen this film about 2 or 3 times, the problem is it's not because I like the film. It's because it's there's nothing remarkable about this film that makes you remember it. It starts off interesting and promisingly enough which is why everytime I run across it I start watching it with interest... and then a little more in the movie I realize I've probably seen this movie before, but why don't I remember anything? How odd.. well let me plod through it and see if something comes to mind. Well after this viewing it should be indelibly stamped in my brain that I've seen this before and should never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is one of those movies that sound like a very good idea but don't really work.

This is the worst, most frustrating case I have ever worked with."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality and very comfy","review":"I was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on Amazon for less than $30, retail price, even on sale, was $60. The jacket arrived in about a week. Its nice and warm, very good quality. The upper torso/shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear. It fits great and looks good. Only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little. But all in all I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable stuff!","review":"If your thing is fairly normal guitar scales over 2 or 3 note chord vaiations then this is for you.

If I want to hear a record like this, I'll put on Pat Martino's \\"Interchange\\". One other thing, there are guys who are much more adventurous with a clean tone than this. Don't believe me?

I have read many reviews about Maxtor's quality \\"issues\\" and now I've experienced one. Forget Maxtor, go with Western Digital. No drive will live forever but a failure at 18 months of very light usage is not acceptable. They should have AT LEAST a 2 year warranty on their drives.

Our main character, Sammy, goes through a lot in the fifty years from when he was born, including dealing with both man made and natural obstacles- but through it all he keeps his head up and his thoughts on his lady turtle friend from birth, Shelly.

I plugged it in and tried to use it. The mouse would move up and down faily well, but the movement for right and left was very erratic. the owners manual instructs you to remove the ball cap and clean the rollers and the track ball. After the cap was removed, I cleaned the ball and rollers, but looking closer at the drive gears for the rollers, one still has chunks of molding riser left on the gear surface which causes the gear to hang up as it rotates. The roller retaining springs do a very poor job of keeping the roller axles in alignment which causes them to hang up. no amount of cleaning will keep this procduct operational.

It works great and I love it. I cannot use the finger-ball type as it makes my finger hurt.I got this for travel and so far, I find it works very well. The trigger for left mouse is easy to use and the thumb ball is reasonably smooth. Trigger and ball works easily for drag. The upper left button switches the ball to scrolling and that seems like a good solution (I use the the scrollwheel a lot on my my trackman).The two negatives I see with this:1. The long wire is a bit annoying. It is not that it is long, but that there is a wire at all.2. You have to set it down to type with both hands.

All this pointer will do is move up and down, no other control. I was going to return it for credit, then realized that the shipper did not include any paperwork for a return.

Movement is poor due to bad quality of the sensor-wheels in contact with the ball, with cheap or even loosen friction band.

Since the last batch, the quality has plummeted. The wire is a much thinner gauge, easily breakable. The rubber rollers inside are tiny. The ball and faceplate do not fit properly.

I attempted to open the unit to clean it out, but it was so shoddy and poorly made, it was almost impossible to put back together properly. I was appalled at how cheaply made this thing was. It looked like a kid's science fair project.

This one probably would have been, but I plugged it in as soon as I got it, and it will not scroll the mouse left or right more than an inch on my screen. My first reaction was to look for drivers, but there are none, which is fine, since it is a simple plug-and-play mouse. So the next step was to twist the collar piece around the ball off to take a look at the rollers inside. Sure enough, spinning the rollers with my finger works fine, but the ball won't spin the lateral roller for some reason. I tried adjusting the rubber wheel on the lateral roller, but nothing I do will make the ball move the mouse cursor.Verdict? Probably crap.

The wire is long enough to give you plenty of freedom, even if I would be sitting at my desk at the office if I were using it. The 'gun-trigger' click and especially the thumb trac-ball (I am a big trac-ball fan) make it soooo easy to navigate... And compared to the price of regular trac-ball devices, this was a bargain.Really nice job with the idea and the design. I would HIGHLY recommend it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finger roller mouse","review":"I love this mouse and the ease that it gives a person to use instead of the touch pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be better","review":"The ball cover construction is very low.

It is made of cheap plastic, the USB connector is not the correct size and thus doesnt fit into the USB slot as it should; this results in a sporadic connection to the computer.I wish Amazon would sell a better version of this, I would gladly pay double.Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I was looking forward to receiving this one finger mouse, but when it arrived, it did not work properly. It is plug-and-play and every computer I tried it with easily and quickly recognized the device, but the ball tracker would only move the cursor up and down. No amount of trying would get this to move the cursor any other direction. Had to return it. It was also a little bigger than the picture makes it appear.I am waiting for a mouse like this with a joystick similar to a Wii nunchuk and that is wireless so I can use the mouse while jogging on the treadmill. Air and glove mice would be fine while holding still, but difficult to use while jogging, walking, hiking, or otherwise moving about with wearable computers. I think a nunchuk would be a great alternative to mouse input, wireless or not. If anyone knows of one, please let me know. I was hoping this one finger mouse would be able to fill the gap until then, but I will keep waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept - poor quality","review":"I bought this for my laptop because the touchpad can sometimes be problematic. I really like the concept, but the construction quality is poor. The main problem is the roller pins that contact the track ball. If you are not holding the unit in a specific tilted position, the pins won't make proper contact and you can spin the track ball forever and the mouse pointer will go nowhere. I would gladly pay more if the constuction quality wasn't so bad. As it is this item is not worth more than a few dollars. This is essentially a dollar store item."},{"rating":"2","title":"problem fix","review":"The pointer constantly didn't work right in that it would not move. This happened all the time.

I may as well have flushed my money down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a hunk of junk","review":"Ball is to small. it takes a lot of work to get cursor from one end of screen to the other.

I liked the price and bought two of them. I was only able to use either one of them for about two weeks when the track ball would skip and freeze, The track ball on both units are now totally none functional. As usual you get what you pay for, in this case very cheap junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design, poor quality = can't recommend","review":"I stumbled across these generic one-handed trackballs when I discovered that the Fellowes Micro Trac had been discontinued. I loved the design and the Fellowes Micro Trac lasted a long time, but eventually needed to be replaced.I purchased one of these awhile ago, it was relatively well constructed and lasted about a year. That wasn't bad at all considering the price, so I bought two more the next time.I'm not sure what changed, but both of the trackballs were very poorly made. One lasted two weeks, the other about one week before becoming unusable. Basically, the rubber that contacts the trackball was low grade and the mechanism that holds the rubber was imprecisely put together.Unless the quality improves, I cannot recommend purchasing these generic versions, which is unfortunate because the design is great. Even if you've never used this type of device before, it feels completely natural right from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be easier to throw your cash away","review":"This is the first time I have ever purchased garbage. I took it apart to find out why it wasn't functioning (horizontal right was not operational). Looking at it, I was unable to figure out how it could ever work. Cheap? No, not just cheap, more like floor sweepings. I have tossed this piece of trash with the rest of the garbage! I am concerned however. What kind of online merchant would sell this junk? Think about it before you use this merchant."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Finger Mouse","review":"This has the potential to be useful but I found the trackball to be loose and therefore hard to get the control I want from a device like this.I found the left-click trigger, inside the lower ring, to be convenient but it added to the problem because if your thumb was on the ball, it sometimes shifted when clicking.On the positive side, it is inexpensive and, for someone looking for a device to use with a laptop when there is no desk space, it could be just what they need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trackball doesn't work","review":"The item arrived in time. However, the trackball does not work properly even after I applied sandpaper to increase the sensitivity of the trackball. The trackball did work better after that but it still is hit or miss.Great idea for comfort but lousy execution. Too bad, I find the product comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot recommend this product","review":"The mouse is not responsive. Sometimes a large movement of the ball moves the cursor half way across the screen, the next time it moves less than an inch. Often when I try a slow even movement the cursor starts to move where I want it then the right/left part of the motions stops responding while the up/down part of the movement continues to respond. I had more control over my cursor when I was using a cheep mouse with my pants as a mouse pad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finger Mouse","review":"This product was very easy to use, it is left or right handed. You can lean back from hunching over the computer/laptop and do all you need to do. I use keyboard shortcuts also to cut down on straining muscles, tendons, ligaments...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay while it lasted","review":"Yes, it relieved wrist fatigue, didn't require much real estate and was cute. However, cursor control didn't allow fine adjustments (it was a pain to use with graphics programs), repeated thumb use (for right clicking) made my thumb hurt, and the trigger button broke after a few months of use. The first time it broke down, I figured it was just dirt. I opened it up, cleaned it out, and it recovered for a while. The next time no amount of jiggering fixed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"I originally bought this mouse to use for playing poker online.

Not musically, but just as a matter of taste. It is much slower and more trebly than the black metal I usually prefer. however, it is really evil sounding and displays a lot of musical talent. So my review serves to inform, not to critique. Honestly, everybody has different tastes in music and metal, so I'm just trying to help people potentially avoid my mistake. The other reviews on here didn't really paint a good picture of the sound and I bought it thinking it would be fast and viking-esque. Anyway, it's mostly really slow and heavy, with a lot of echo and haunting vocals. So, if you can imagine a slow version of Mayhem's \\"Wolf's Lair Abyss\\" CD (really, really, slow, that is), that is KIND OF a good idea what this sounds like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Point for Enslaved","review":"After immensely enjoying the Enslaved releases Frost, Maradraum, and Eld, this album is a disappointment. It is a step towards hard edged rock music and a step away from their traditional viking metal. With forgettable riffs and an overall less dark and sinister atmosphere, this album let me down again and again. When they toured through the USA last year and they played half the set from this album, I found myself shouting \\"play something older!\\". Do yourself a favor and get into Enslaved as they are most fondly remembered. Buy Frost, or for truly black sound pick up Maradraum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Make Your Top Ten Books of All Times","review":"This is slavery practice after 1915 in S.Carolina.

It would make an excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man's Inhumanity to Man Overcome","review":"Great book. The part that blew me away was not God's redemption of Robert from hatred and abuse (that is amazing and there are millions of people who can attest to God's saving power). The really big story for me was that there was still institutionalized slavery in the early 1900's. There are people alive now (very old people mind you) who were slaves or owned slaves. This is one man's story of his enslavement and emancipation, physically, emotionally, and spiritually."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book ever","review":"I picked up this book to read while on a road trip to Thunder Bay, ON. What a read! This is a \\"Christian\\" book, but not obnoxiously so. His story is incredible. I couldn't put it down. I never realized plantation slavery of African Americans existed in this country into the 20th century. I always believed the myth that it was replaced by tenant farming. It was an eye opener.John Sadler was such an amazing person. His story has greatly affected my life. I was brought up Christian, Episcopal, but have always had an ambivalent attitude about Christianity. He almost has me believing again. This book is truly inspirational. Someone who could survive all the horror and hardship he did and still have a forgiving heart.This would make a wonderful movie. Folks need to know the true history of our country. This book shows how easy it is for people to be terrorized and institutionalized into cruel submission.

The house is all plastic and snaps together. It is flimsy and the space is very cramped. It's not easy for my daughter to move the furniture or kittens around. It's dark inside and the largest room downstairs, the kitchen, is too long, so that it's hard to reach in to \\"play\\" in the room.My daughter has barely played with this. I keep it out, hoping that she'll like it better as she gets older. She does lots of pretend play with other toys, but not this one. I am planning on saving for one of the Ryan's Room dollhouses which are built to last and are more open for better accessibility. These are available at Learning Express. Also, the Playmobile dollhouses are a nice option.One other thing to consider is that the furniture sets that you buy to go with this house are expensive and filled with so many tiny pieces, they are sure to be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable, fun, creative play!","review":"I have purchased this for my neice and have since been asked by mothers of all her friends where I could get one.

Influences range from mid-eastern folk to prog metal in the vein of Tool and Isis. The riffs are typically heavy yet not quite crushing with an occasional Mid-eastern picking pattern thrown in. The drums and bass are often at the forefront of the music and usually center upon a certain groove. Vocals are done courtesty of Michelle Loose, who is one of the better female vocalists I've heard. Her style is more of a modern type of singing than the operaic and more classically influenced female-fronted bands such as Nightwish, Alas, After Forever, Within Temptation...etc. There's better bands out there but Brave is definitly one to watch in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"We Package Only When You Order\\" - NOT SO","review":"Your product description says \\"We Package Only When You Order\\" yet the Garam Masala I received today is stamped \\"MFG Date - OCT 2010\\"...

He also wrote *N Sync with J.C. and *N Sync Backstage Pass. Even if you don't plan on buying this book, go to a book store ( a real one) and check out the center bit, the pictures. Ok now for the books I recommend, *N Sync : Offical Book , Tearin' Up the Charts, and pretty much anything about, *N Sync."},{"rating":"2","title":"da bomb!","review":"This book is the best book I've ever read!

But too self centered!","review":"Okay I have to admit he is hot, and this book is good. But only if you are CRAZY over him. I mean u know everythin in this book already if you are a big fan so why buy it? And don't you think it isn't fair that Justin gets all these books and I havn't even seen one for the other guys. So girlz, move on! He is way too self centered! His fav song is 'God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On Me!' But I do agree, he is the hottest guy on earth. And the book is pretty good, except I know all the info in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Overview of everything we know","review":"Okay, I bought this book and I honesty thought it was pretty good. The only problem is that the author takes everything from Teen magazines so if you really like N sync and you read those magazines all the time you'll hear a lot of the same stuff! But I mean I read those things all the time and I still found the book interesting plus it talks about what Justin sees in a girl which I didn't really know that much about!! It's a cool book so I would definately get it if you really want it!!! Just don't get your hopes up too high!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay *yawn* that's enough of Justin","review":"Yeah he's cute but he's gettin kinda repetitive. Let's move on people!

It was a jumbling read though... The observations were interesting, if only they would not have been presented by each sister. I found it exhausting to stay with each of the sister's recurring views and the view of the youngest girl was written in an improbably format. Wish the writer would stick with her own view, without trying to represent the other sisters.I have no idea why Oprah was promoting this one; was it only because it was about what happened to 'her' people in Africa? No wonder I don't hear about her book club anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an opportunity","review":"I got the opportunity, as a senior in high school, to read the Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver and I wish I hadn't taken the opportunity because I completely disliked this book. The book is told through Nathan Price's four daughters eyes and although they all have different personalities and explain their views in different ways it still is a very slow read and hard to understand at times. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't get into it. This novel does give great detail and gives a perfect visual of how life was in the Congo in 1959, but this doesn't cover up for the slow read. I don't recommend this book for anyone who just wants to pass the time but I would recommend it to someone who wanted to learn about Africa and its' culture because Barbara Kingsolver describes it perfectly. Overall I give this book two out of the five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"locking key case","review":"The key case is made of plastic,to easy to bust and take your key,if some one would find where you hide it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars","review":"Like many others, my experience with this product is that it worked 3 times and then I was no longer able to close it.

Every other small combination lock I know requires that it be OPEN before you can change the combination. This make design sense as if it were closed (or locked) to change the combination anyone can change the combination and get the contents. Yep that is what this unit does. It requires that the unit be CLOSED to change the combination. This means that anyone can come to this \\"lock box\\" and while it is closed change the combination and get to the contents inside. It boggles the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is useless","review":"dun throw ur money on thisi can easily break open this lockthis is made of cheap plastic all around"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't fit newer keys","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, this product is a nice idea but poorly executed. I understand this is not a high security product, but it offers extremely minimal security because it is made out of plastic, thin metal would be better.A more critical design flaw is it doesn't fit many modern car keys. My Honda Element (not a high dollar car) key will not fit in it, even if you remove the foam insert. The key is too long.Nice try GE.

I think it seems like a good deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for low security key storage","review":"First off I want to say that this is not ideal for someone wanting \\"high security\\" key storage. This is great for what I use it for though...I have a room mate who I don't know very well so I lock the door to my room and keep a spare key inside the storage case and have the storage case hidden inside the apt. If someone were to use it for their house then I would hide it well because it has a plastic casing that looks like it could be destroyed without a ton of effort. I was tempted to buy 2 so that I could see how easy it would be to destroy it. There's enough room to store at least 2 keys (unless one of the keys is a big car key that requires a computer chip)."},{"rating":"1","title":"They keep breaking","review":"I've bought 3 of these boxes and they are a great idea.

It was a great idea! I set my combination (a number which I cannot forget) and all was well. So I thought. I locked myself out of my van again today and I thought GREAT! I'M SAVED!! I have my key safe...not so fast! I retrieved the keysafe, dialed in my combination...and the dumb thing wouldn't open. As I said this is a number I can't forget...it wasn't an error on my part. I eventually had to break the silly thing to get my key out and get into the car...so it isn't as secure as you might think, it was quite easy to break as it is plastic, I was able to get the one side open enough and just gave a twist and was able to get my key out.

Well first the package came with no instructions whatsoever, but I don't worry as I am usually quite good with that sort of items. Well... not with the GE apparently. I rotated the \\"reset\\" wheel once and put it back to its original position, WITHOUT changing the code: I just wanted to see how the reset would work. Now I can't open the stupid box. Again I did not even change the numbers. So I have no idea what happened, and now it's locked! Absolutely stupid!!!Also, now that I got the item in hand, I can tell that the quality isn't great anyway: it's plastic, and would be really easy to break and get whatever's inside.Don't waste your money with that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother","review":"Tried and sent back several of these.

Much better quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that secure","review":"I bought the AccessPoint Stor-A-Key to hide an apartment key out of sight. The magnetic strip is useful.Last month I went to change the key and while the door was open, the combo reset lever moved without me knowing it and reset the lock to who knows what combination. Now I can't get it all the way closed or open. I am about 1/2 way going through all 1000 combinations to get it open again. I will probably just break off the top by hand and pull out the key.This item is a false sense of security at best. Look at the Master 5400D or 5401D as a better option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hiding place","review":"I use this item for storing and hiding house keys outside in a toolshed. The magnet is pretty to ensure that the device stays securely in place and the combination lock just adds that one extra step of inconvenience if the wrong person should somehow find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased the GE lock for my house key but after using it twice it's now \\"locked' & even tho I've tried several ways to use the code... still doesn't open ...so I bought a second one , same type but now this one is open but won't CLOSE! I give up! Too bad, it's a great idea even if not used for car keys."},{"rating":"1","title":"No security","review":"I bought this elsewhere not realizing it was plastic. When I received it, I was dumbfounded at the thought of why the manufacturer would put a combination lock on a plastic case. If you're lucky enough to have one of America's Dumbest Criminals trying to break into your house, car, or whatever, then maybe he'll sit there long enough trying to guess at the combination that'll he'll eventually give up and put the key back. But more likely, he'll figure out that all he has to do is throw it once onto the concrete sidewalk and the key is his. This is as fine as any other key case for hiding keys, but the security offered by this is akin to a plastic padlock. Pointless.It would probably be more effective to just put a 'PLEASE DO NOT STEAL' sticker on your prized possession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for House-key. TOO SMALL for Car Key.","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO USE IT FOR CAR KEY. Vehicle keys will Not fit inside this little box.

This thing is junk!","review":"A neighbor had one of these and I thought it was kinda cool. But after I took his key out of it, it stopped working - the combination just didn't open the lock any more. So, thinking maybe it was something I had done, I bought him another one, and bought one for myself as well. Bad idea. When the new ones arrived, they worked a couple of times while we were testing them. But the first time we wanted to actually retrieve our keys, they were both no longer working. The combination which had worked several times, just stopped working to release the lock. But no problem - as other reviewers have pointed out, they're pretty flimsy, so we just broke them open. End of story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frankly, Don't Waste Your Money","review":"As other reviewers have noted, for an item intended for a security application, this keybox isn't just flimsy, but borders on fragile. I was able to break it open in less than a second with my bare hands. As thieves tend to look for easy targets, this box won't even slow them down.I take that back -- a potential thief will waste several seconds, laughing. Then your car or your things in the car are history.If the manufacturer made it in metal, with close tolerances and a weather seal, I'd buy it. But although it looks tough and capable in the photographs, this is nothing more that a novelty item for a gumball machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"OK, so I've locked myself out of the last two houses I've owned at least once per. Fake rocks aren't a bad solution, but I feel too many people know to look for fake rocks, so I wanted a key safe that was more secure that I could hide in a shed or garage.This thing works like a charm.

A better choice would be an all metal keysafe. But my friend taught me a better way to store a spare key in the car for free. Wrap the key up in bubble wrap or something so it doesn't feel like a key, then put a few layers of duct tape over that, and put a misleading label on it like \\"spare fuses\\" or \\"mini first aid kit\\". Then put it somewhere out of the way in the car, like behind the tailight access covers in the trunk. The tape and duct tape mean it won't rattle around in your car on bumpy roads, and will deter people who come across it (e.g. car repair people) from opening it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lock for the price","review":"A friend of mine has had this lock for years.

In his stories, it was still possible to drive in and through LA without arriving exhausted from the journey. The sordid side of human nature is still the same, but the framework it hung on seemed to go at a gentler pace than today. Violence?

It did have a few new things that I did not know and the pictures in the book are great, but I wish it wouldn't have bashed her on one page and then prasied her on another. I give it four stars just because I love Shania and I really would read anything about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Shania Twain!!","review":"I have to agree with many of the reviews I have read about this book, there is nothing new, nothing different and nothing nice. The author repeats himself way too much and contradicts himself. At one time he is bashing her and the next saying that its easy to see why she is adored. I love Shania Twain and I felt like reading this book was just as bad as reading all the articles of people that love to bash her. Also, I agree that the author should have done a little more research instead of creating more rumors. Next time, try talking to Shania herself, thats the only book I want to read. I have read all the other books about Shania and they are so much more worthy. I will say one good thing, the info that is true in this book is written well, but I dont recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"An \\"Intimate\\" portrait? Pfft! All this book has is the rags-to-riches story that has been retold so many times that any Shania fan can recite it in their sleep and a collection of quotes that, again, are nothing new. Mix it in with a couple of rumours, and you've got a disaster. Since when did Shania and Mutt run away to get married? Obviously the author hasn't seen the wedding picture of Shania with her siblings. And the red dress in the Whose Bed video is belly-bearing? It's very obvious that the author is not a fan, just an author doing his job. As I recall, Whose Bed and Any Man of Mine were definitely not rejected by radio and TV - they were being played just as much as any other new hit. There's no real proof to back most of his comments or retelling of rumours. The least he could've done is speak with a few people who know Shania, if not Shania herself, or at least do more research. Overall this is a big disappointment for Shania fans looking for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book slams Shania!","review":"This book is very hipocritical. At points it complements and agress with Shania and then at times it turns her into a cold and calculating person! Don't buy this book it lies especially about the part with her firing Mary Bailey. I also have the book \\"Shania Twain\\" by Dallas Williams which is a very good book and it dosen't say anything about Shania being so harsh and cold towards Mary Bailey. If Shania was really this cold and calculating person why is she loved so much by her hometown and the rest of the world? this book does not display the true Shania. It is just another Nashville person trying to downplay who Shania really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"Don't buy this book. I can't put it any simpler than that. Readers who want to get a little more insight into Shania Twain's life will be sorely disappointed. The title of this book shamelessly touts that it offers an intimate portrait of the popular singer. What it is is nothing more than a compilation of quotes from interviews of Shania from her magazine articles and TV and radio appearances. Any Shania fan who can put a sentence together could have written this book. This book does not enlighten nor entertain the reader. Thus, the only reason I can think of for the author writing this book is to exploit yet another famous celebrity for his own financial gain. The worst crime of all is that he's done so in the most unoriginal way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting There","review":"This book points out how Shania got to where she is and the difficultly that she had. All the book has is quotes from newspapers and articles. I feel the author could have dug deeper to find out Shania information. The author should have tried to talk to those who where behind the scences with Shania or anyone who was involved with her. This would have given the reader NEW facts! Even though, I feel anything that tells you about Shania is GREAT. I love everything on Shania so I cant' say that it is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor publishing quality hinders good reading experience","review":"This is not a review of the content of the book, rather I'd like to comment on the publishing quality. This book is an \\"instabook\\", which I assume to mean that it is printed after it is ordered. There doesn't seem to be any mention of this on the book description page on Amazon. The results of this \\"instabook\\" printing are as follows: low quality paper cover and pages; sloppy cut on the exposed edges of the book; numerous typos - averaging 1 per 1.5 pages; misalignment of paragraphs sometimes cutting words in half.

This book creates the character of Alfred Bester who Babylon 5 fans know of as the evil PSI-Corpse agent but who readers will learn is so much more complicated. While the story of Alfred becoming Mr. Bester is extremely intriguing there are a few moments where I feel as though they rushed some other known characters in and out of the story too fast.

However, many were \\"apples of gold\\" (a Biblical expression for well timed, encouraging words) and practical advice that I had just learned on my own through the \\"School of Hard Knox\\" (i.e., on the job).

This book was in the School Nursing section so I \\"assumed\\" it was a book for new school nurses. That aside, overall the book was a series of short cute antecdotals that really could not help a new nurse except to maybe make him/her realize that being overwhelmed is expected. I think a new nurse needs real how-to get organized clues, like how to make a patient report list (e.g., patient name, age, sex, dx, meds, tx and times to be given). This was the thing that kept me from losing my mind when I was new.

The book describes the history of the mural in the context of its time of diverse social, cultural and religious matters. After viewing the actual mural at the Boston Public Library, where it is, unfortunately, covered with dirt but is being restored and cleaned, one will be overwhelmed with this painting and find the book extremely interesting and full of important historical information, as well as understand why this mural is considered one of the most important pieces of public art."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there were decent plates...","review":"Anyone purchasing this book sight unseen will be profoundly disappointed with the overwhelming lack of clear color plates. Imagine a book about a basically unpublished subject of great interest and having it deny the reader a full experiential exploration of the works described.

It does keep good time and looks good with the right outfits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"If you have not read a book by Isabel Allende, you probably should not start with this one. It reads like a work of fiction (and an excellently crafted one, at that). Allende herself admits that she remembers things that cannot possibly have happened, and she includes these memories in her memoirs. She also uses the same texture and meandering style that she uses in her novels. She alludes to many of her works of fiction, so it is better to have read at least a few of her books before you start with this one. This is Allende's second memoir. The first deals with her life as a mother and is infinitely more emotional and intimate. This one is about her life as an immigrant and exile. It is less heartbreaking but still poignant, especially considering the discussions about immigration in the news now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Curve","review":"My wife and I lived in Santiago, Chile 1971-1975 and revisited the country in 1993. We are impressed by the author's ability to see its people with different, more discerning perspectives of her native land than she had earlier in her writing career. Here she describes why she now prefers to live in California with an American husband willing to assume his share of household duties rather than in a democratic, relatively prosperous nation with its freedoms restored. She knows her country, the foibles of its people and its history well. Would that we had such an acute observer of our own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't bother. It's nothing like Paula","review":"I absolutely loved Allende's memoirs about her daughter - Paula - so I was expecting a lot from this book. It was nothing like Paula and hugely disappointing. It wandered with no point at all. It was hardly funny and seemed to be just a lot of thinking out loud and navel-gazing. In this way I found the book slightly arrogant - she presumed that everyone should want to hear about the slightest details. I found some of the information about Chile interesting but generally I got the feeling that Allende wrote this book more for herself than her reader. I stopped reading 3/4 of the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this","review":"When I first purchased this I didn't realize that it was a small lego set.

With the heiroglyphics included in the transliteration, one is also able to study heiroglyphic translation as one reads the various chapters. Because the heiroglyphics are placed in the book as uniform graphics, the continuity of the pictures, helps the reader more efficiently follow the transliteration, thereby helping the reader deduce what symbols mean what, and thereby adding another facet to this wonderfull volume. The only drawback to this book, is the lack of photographs of the actual papyri. This problem is significant in some respects, but overall this volume is able to clearly define all of those items that the ancients felt were vital to get one (a deceased one) into the afterlife"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference.","review":"A good reference for the non-Egyptian reader who wants firsthand knowledge about life on the Nile.

What is helpul is that this early Church pastor shows loads of wisdom in addressing those who disagree.

The beginning of the book starts to sound interesting apart from the authors attempt to use big words conversationally which really sets off a bad tone. After the first chapter you wait and wait for a storyline with no reprieve, a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Our book club hated it","review":"Our book club (all white women, in ages ranging from mid-20s to 60) read this book and we all thought it was a total dud, not even interesting enough to provoke a good discussion as some not-great books do. A good editor should have made the novelist turn this social studies into a real novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book to read.","review":"The book starts out slow, and it weaves its way through the past and present, which gets a little annoying. While it does have some feeling to it, and it does give a good insight to what life for african americans was like back then, I was for the most part dreadfully bored with the book. Not something I'd really recommend to people to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Better Books that I've Read","review":"This was a beautiful piece of literature that seems to have been woven by the threads of the purest parts of the mind. The author uses words beautifully and in exactly the right context. I love the storyline and the themes. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has enough time to read and not put it down until you've finished! This is wonderful and I am hoping and praying that she writes another book soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"River Cross My Heart","review":"A poorly written book. The plot takes the reader no where. No substance to the book at all. This is the second book that I am disappointed with as reviewed by the Oprah Winfrey Book Club. \\"A Lesson In Dying\\" was the other poorly written book that I did not find rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a downer--totally depressing","review":"one of the saddest, dreariest books I've ever read. A chore to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"River Cross My Heart Failed To Cross Mine","review":"Though River Cross My Heart was an enlightning read in learning the ways of black society in Georgetown during the early 20's , I found little else enlightning about the book as far as it being considered fiction . I wasn't clear on whether I was reading a history book or a fictional story , also there was no substance to the story's plot , no real character development , and no feel of what the author was trying to say in writing this book . The first couple of pages started off with a bang and had me thinking that I was about to read an engrossing book , boy was I wrong , I felt like I was reading nothing but blank pages afterwards . I wish Breena Clarke better luck next time in her next writing endeavor ."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I hadn't bothered","review":"Nobody's perfect, Oprah. This book had absoloutly no plot. Clara dies within the first pages, and then for awhile, nothing happens. Actually, nothing else happens during the whole novel. It returns more to the life of the family, and this is good and all-but what ever happened to Clara's memory? The end of the short novel isn't really an ending, either-the book just kind of stops. Maybe next time she can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now what?","review":"I was captivated by the story, but there was no conclusion, no ending, no real wrap-up. I put this down and thought \\"Okay, now what?\\"It was short and sweet, but nothing really came of the story. I was really drawn in by the characters and by what COULD have happened, but let down by the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"River Cross My Heart","review":"I assumed that because this was an Oprah Book Club selection the book would be good. Not! It was a painfully slow read and I kept waiting for the good part. It never came. I agree with the other reviewers who said there was no discernable plot. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book lacks direction","review":"I have been reading this short novel every night for the past week and I am only half way through it. I am very close to placing it on the booshelf unfinished. I find the book to be a jumble of words with no direction or focus. I think Oprah struck out with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"An undeveloped story","review":"This story had such potential, but the author went nowhere with it. The story was supposed to be about how the accidental drowning of a child affected the rest of her family, especially Johnnie Mae, who was responsible for the child when the accident happened. After the first chapters, it was like Clara's death didn't affect the family at all. It was just life as usual until much later in the book when Johnnie Mae returns to the scene of the drowning. This is the first hint that she even thought about the accident. I was disappointed in the progression of the book, but I understood it a little better after I learned some of the history of the author, whose own child died. I can understand wanting to write about an event without writing about it directly, but this book needed a little more direction and a lot more plot development. It's not a book that will stick in your memory for very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah, what were you thinking!","review":"A no-go, girl. It isn't that the book is bad, it just is undeserving of the attention you have given it. The prose is sloppy, the characters undeveloped, and the imagery is just not there. The idea is great, it just needs a few more edits. The only character I felt anything for was the poor kitten. I'm disappointed, I expected more from your book club. Hope you do better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lack of development","review":"As I read the back cover for the synopsis of the book, I took interest in prospect of learning about the black side of Georgetown. What looks like a great book never truly goes anywhere. Many of the characters are underdevloped, so the reader is left feeling detached and unmoved by the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pleasant read, if not a little too saccharine","review":"I liked this novel. However at times I thought it glossed overmany of the serious racial issues of the day. Breena Clarke has a niceeasy relaxed style which lends itself well to the subject matter. River Cross My Heart paints a graceful and profound portrait of life in an entire community in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington DC, 1925. I liked the portrayal of the closeness of the Afican-American family during this time and the sense of community which is efffectively described. The initial tragedy at the beginning of the novel does not diminish the affectionate eye that Clarke has for small town life. River Cross my Heart is a pleasant if not mediocre read. I feel though that it is certainly not one of the best Oprah Book Club books."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give only a half star I would","review":"After reading almost the entire Oprah collection, I couldn't understand why she would choose this. A good description of this work would be a jumble of words with no direction. I couldn't put myself in the life of the character, or feel any emotion at all. There is only one good use for this book and that would be as a substitute for sleeping pills."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the whole, an engaging novel.","review":"A quick read about racism and growing up. The book moves at a good pace throughout and then abruptly ends. I wanted more of a finish than what I got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"My library runs the gamut and this has to be the most stupid book I've ever read. No plot, no conclusion, no real insight to racism. Guess the first clue should have been Oprah's approval."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gifted storyteller who hasn't quite honed her craft...","review":"The author paints wonderful pictures with her words, but I feel she was let down by less-than-skillful editors at her publishing house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"\\"River, Cross my Heart\\" has good intentions, but in the end the author becomes so filled up with self-righteousness that the text dwindles down into a mushy puddle. This is an ok book-just ok, and the reaon for that lies in the author's inadept execution. This book has HEAVY undertones of both Eudora Welty and Toni Morrison, but those inspirations are short and sporadically disbursed. For a long time NOTHING- absolutely NOTHING- happens in this book, and the reader is not able to derive any significance from the characters or what they do therein. Perhaps the author thought her prose too significant to be taken for nothing, but in the end this book is just a mass of dead ends and characterless characters, scenes that stop in mid-action and lessons lurking underneath the surface. If you like this book, I suppose an afternoon of watching paint dry is a favorite hobby. Oprah, you done wrong chile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but...","review":"River, Cross My Heart never goes anywhere. It does an OK job of being a slice of life book. Unfortunately, it doesn't have a plot. The story wanders through the life of a young girl named Johnnie Mae whose younger sister drowns in the Potomac River. After a moderately interesting beginning, the book falls flat. We never really get to know Johnnie Mae. The author teases us with small insights into the characters and then leaves us in the dark."},{"rating":"1","title":"River, Cross My Heart","review":"The short description of this book sounded great; however, one could read the book jacket and get the same level of satisfaction as from the entire book. Was there a plot here? Did I miss something? I, too, kept waiting for something to happen and then the story ended. Also there were loose ends that were never resolved. What happened to the kitten? Did it live? What happened to Pearl? Why did Willie have a change of heart and decide to support Johnnie Mae in her swimming? Help!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time....","review":"This story started out somewhat interesting but it never really went anywhere. I found myself struggling to get through the book.

Nearly all of the original background music in the cartoons themselves have been replaced with unauthentic, unspectacular & intrusive canned music. Worse, some short scenes have had music added where none existed before.I cannot understand why they would have done this, except maybe the producers couldn't guarantee that they had all of the proper clearances to avoid a possible lawsuit with some music writer. That would be understandable, except for when they tampered with scenes that called for trumpets or bugles, which lasted 2 or 3 seconds. Do they really think someone will file a lawsuit over a 3-second bugle call?!If they do a volume 4 and they have to remove the music, please don't bother finding replacement music. Just leave the vocals and I'll understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"R & B season 1","review":"It's really a shame that Classic Media didn't use the original season 1 opening/closing credits. Not only that, but they didn't use the original music either, because Jay Ward didn't own the rights to the theme and they didn't want to pay royalties to have it included. A real shame! Other than that, it's great set and wonderful to be able to see the shows again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not the same anymore :-(","review":"As one that was around during the orignal airings of Rocky & Bullwinkle, I can still vividly remember coming home from school, and plonking down in front of the tele, in time to hear the blasts of trumpet fanfare announcing the start of the Rocky & Bullwinkle show.So, I was over the top with excitement at the release of this series, but alas, my enthusiasm was short lived after realising they changed the original music score. I'm aware of the reasons behind this change, but I'm sorry, it's totally ruined the show for me to the point that I simply can't watch it in fear of losing the little memory I still have of the original series music.In view of the offered reasons in the booklet, I dunno what they were thinking when the powers that be, decided to change history.Otherwise, I would've given it 5 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"boyfriend purchase","review":"I purchased all three for my boyfriend because he LOVES rocky & bullwinkle.

The titles of the show's opening have been altered slightly and someone other than William Conrad's voice is used for a few seconds. Also the beginning of each cartoon has a little \\"R&B\\" logo on screen for a few seconds, which I find annoying! in addition you can see copywrite dates on the titles that are from 1989. oooh I hate that! when I watch my vintage TV i want it authentic!

This means they take a while to heat up, but once the pan is hot, we can sear and cook quite nicely for the first time on our cooktop. We've never had a problem with sticking or warping. If you are a serious cook and gas is not an option, these pans really make a difference.NOTE: These pans can be warped if you plunge them into cold water while they are still hot.

I take meticulous care of all my pots, including this fry pan. I wash them thoroughly after each use and use only silicon and wooden utensils with my non-stick pans, including this one. That's why I've come to the conclusion that Swiss Diamond non-stick just isn't that good, especially for the price point. At the current rate, it will be useless as a non-stick by the time I've had it for a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud alert on Swiss Diamond products.","review":"I was looking for a pan that does not have Teflon coating and my mother-in-law recommended this.

Just in case, I repeated the procedure, again to no avail. So, now I coat the pan with PAM whenever I use it, which, of course, negates it's value.

It holds a ton, distributes heat evenly with nice browning properties, and goes in an out of the oven. After loving it for a year, I bought one for my son last year and he loves it too. The only downsides to this pan are that it's heavy and bit unweildy and that it takes a while to heat up. Once it's heated, it maintains a steady, even temperature.

Completed the exercises in the book -- particularly the life timeline -- led me to an epiphany about how I wanted to spend my life at work. Nick Lore is a master career coach, even in book form. The Pathfinder is a must read for anyone who wants to have it all at work and in life, but may be stuck in their current career."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insulting, Creepy Book","review":"If you are one of those radical airhead humanists who are looking for \\"a life that sings\\"; or if you are eight years old, this is a great book. If you are a grownup, you will find this book insulting and disturbing -- especially the occasional illustrations that appear to have been drawn by someone you really don't want to have wandering around in your house.It is probably necessary, given the subject matter, that books about self-fulfillment are a little hippie-wacky, but this one is intolerable. It is written at a very low grade level and that's not even considering the ooey-gooey tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very wordy and not many new ideas","review":"I was really put off by the author's rambling style. He keeps promising that his methods will be earth shattering for the reader but I found that making lists of questions and then doing research to answer them, along with listing my inner protests for reasons not to try a career, was not very helpful for me. The later chapters mainly cover assessments such as the Myers-Briggs that one can find addressed more thoroughly in other sources. I agree with another reviewer on the point that I keep returning to this book thinking it will help me, but for me it is really a wordy recommendation on how to organize one's career research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on with it","review":"I read nearly 100 pages before deciding that it is more likely that my next career will come to me in a dream than through this book. At the point I stopped reading the author was still telling me about how The Pathfinder was going to help me define my next career. Most of what I read sounded like a commercial for how great The Pathfinder is. I kept thinking to myself, \\"Geez, I've already bought the book! Quit selling me!\\" If you're looking for a book that will help you decide what you want to be when you grow up when you're already grown up (like me) this isn't it. Unless it's after the 100 page commercial, and I just didn't have the patience to get to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little help to identify the purpose driven life","review":"I found this book so useful, I bought it twice. The first time to examine my overall interest and possible fit for career. Then, I lent the book out. I just repurchased to complete the values exercise. This book has a mini Myers-Briggs Type assessment (useful to understand how you make decisions, where you get your energy, how you take in information and how you organize your life) and its potential impact on career and other life choices.If you like to read and aren't into doing 'self work', this book is not for you. Hope it does for you what it did for me, clarity around things I'm passionate about and creating a plan to align my work with the things I'm most passionate about.I found the quotes and drawings inspirational and relevant, pushing me to keep digging and searching for my right path."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacks direction","review":"I picked up this book at least 30 times, and put it down in frustration.

It put me right to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innate Ability battery","review":"I did the innate ability battery recommended by this book and I feel a lot clearer on what I am good at, not good, at and different ways to think about myself and what might make me happy. This one clued me in in a very comprehensive way. If you are confused about what would make you happy, fulfilled, goal-oriented etc, then take this test. The other tests other than myers-briggs are not too useful. (I also did the whole workbook of what color is my parachute a couple years ago but this test feels more like knowledge I can build upon.) The cost to do the test is high but the value I feel I will get is equal plus the discussion I had with the counselor made me feel like I was talking to someone who understood where I was coming from. I would like to do more personal counseling but the book will have to do and I look forward to answering the questions to figure it out.

As a coach for Renaissance Souls (people with too many interests to pick just one)I was especially pleased Nicholas Lore was the author and creator of the exercises.

I bought this book when it first came out and worked diligently through it for several weeks at which point I realized it was a monumental waste of time. Some of this stuff may be OK for a high school or college student looking for a little direction, but for a mid-career person, it is way too idealistic....very little practical application. This book is filled with time wasting fluff. If you are a big reader, OK, buy this book for fun and/or entertainment. I was however seeking a tangible tool for making career decisions. This book was not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready to Meet Yourself......Finally!","review":"This book is not meant to be read overnight, but rather a guide to wake-up to everyday as you step yourself closer to the who, what, and when you really are. This book provides the \\"How\\" of getting there. Ranging from recalling your childhood dreams, discovering where you are at on your life's timeline, meeting the different parts of yourself all the way to ultimately waking up one day (for me, two years later) and realizing a vocation that fits you like your own fingerprints. This is a labor of love of discovering yourself with Nick (the author)along side you as you reflect and laugh along the way. I recommend this book highly....provided you value yourself enough to dig in and do the self-work involved in this type of journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great library addition!","review":"This book is a handy reference to have in any tech's library. It teaches you about not only the history of Windows, but focuses on the later versions of the operating system without totally neglecting the older versions.It's coverage of command-line tips and tricks is excellent; however I found it lacking in that it didn't cover two areas: (1) It did not cover why the System Restore feature sometimes fails and how to prevent that occurrence; and (2) it only mentioned the SFC utility in the appendix of programs that come with Windows, and that is one program that needs to be gone into depth a bit more.Some of the sections on scripting could have been written to be easier to follow for those new to the subject, but overall I still have to give this book an excellent rating!It definitely was worth the money, and I am overall pleased with the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Windows is covered very well in this book.

The stories range from the mysterious (\\"The Marfa Lights\\") to the chilling (\\"Chisos Ghosts\\") to the amusing (\\"Bobcat Carter\\"). There's an excellent chapter devoted to the infamous Indian hunter John Glanton (who features prominently in Cormac McCarthy's \\"Blood Meridian\\"), and many others detailing the historical and religious folklore of the area.

Soft and gentle, even when underscoring moments of terror, this score is almost relaxing to listen to. Those fans more interested in Carpenter's hardcore scare music will be happy with the tracks Burning Desire and The Brick Wall.

Seeing this attractive packaging and noticing a couple of familiar songs, I bought this disc cold!I figured Bobby's distinctitive voice would help set a romantic mood.I notice that though tropical in feel the song selection rather than using elements of raggae or steel drums, is pretty standard stuff, but in a good way. Caldwell's voice comes through distinct and earnest, always just the right emotion. All is not always perfect, a couple of songs subject deal with being dumped or love lost. \\"In the Afterlife\\" speaks joy after death! I guess this album can help lovers keep the flame alive and show them the sorrow of break up. Bobby's arrangements are varied, using strings, horns or small groups just right in each song.I love his duet with Deniece Williams on \\"Where is the Love\\".All in all a pleasant dreamy album expertly produced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Caldwell can do no wrong. Great album.","review":"Bobby Caldwell is probably the most underrated male singer in music. He practically created his own genre of smooth jazz/pop vocals, and has grown into a singer whose interpretations of the classics can make you forget Sinatra or Mel Torme. This guy is just wonderful, and it's true that if you've never heard him, you may think he's African American. Far from it, he's a skinny white dude. Check him out on YouTube. This album is a great addition to any Caldwell collection, I'm surprised that I didn't already have it. Great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic timeless instruction","review":"Wally Armstrong joined the PGA tour in 1973 and played for 12 years.

At the price, I was a little hesitant about getting an instructional video that comprised approximately 7 hours for this price.Many aspects of golf are covered, from fundamentals, driver's education, long game and short game drills, the mental game, putting, chipping, sand play, golf myths and misconceptions. He even uses items that are in your home and practical imagery in helping you get a feel for the swing and technique. His teaching is practical and less technical.This is a no nonsense approach to learning many aspects of this complex game.

They wander into a strange village populated by devil worshippers, and although they first become guests of the sheik, they soon become condemned hostages in retaliation for the execution of the sheik's brothers, Nazi spies, by the Allies. This is a quick programmer from Warner Brothers, and it's not very good. Ford shows some potential as an actress, but Loder and especially Douglas give incompetent performances. Paul Cavanagh, as the sheik, displays some skill, while the rest of the cast is negligible. The dialogue is stilted and the story sometimes ridiculous, with the last fifteen minutes being particularly hard to swallow. It's hard to believe Warner Brothers produced this film the same year as Casablanca!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too basic","review":"I was disappointed in this video.

It also has training built into it. More money but you get to practice a lot more ....at home. I practice while I have the TV on. Results were almost immediate. Plus you save money on all the rotor blades you didn't break in real flight. One of the RC gurus on the internet suggested putting in 30 to 50 hours on a simulator.

During the dramatic parts, I couldn't keep from laughing. It was hard to believe some people actually wanted us to be quiet - were they actually enjoying the film? The acting done by the man who plays Terry Glass is comical, not a reflection on him though - just the silly character. They try to keep you guessing, but I knew what was going on the moment I sat down (and I arrived late!)Bottom line: Don't waste your money, like I did.

The plot seemed great, but the story's twists and turns could have been thought of by a 3rd grade classroom...and they frankly make our heroine look as dumb as a brick. How did this girl not figure out that the lawyer was giving up information to the adoptive family? Hello...earth to Leelee.

And little by little things are going down but all is well that ends well and I can't reveal the details, except that the uncle will get the kids he should have gotten from the very start since he was the only family.

The cast was promising. The Glass House seemed like a fairly interesting little film.It was interesting in a disappointing sort of way. While the DVD quality was good, the actual quality of the story leaves much to be desired. The performances are OK, but the story waivers and is inconsistent, and doesn't adequately set you up for a lot of the plot points. In terms of a thriller, there are definitely WAY better choices out there. And a lot of questions aren't really answered effectively, so the plot can't chug along in the manner intended. That being said...you see the outcome a MILE away. But The Glass House just doesn't delivery in terms of a strong, well-constructed story that hums along and packs a punch in the thrills department.Really...watch this if you are forced to only.

Unfortunately, the best part of the film WAS the trailer. My problem with the movie was the convenient moments of incredibly nonsensical behavior. Just when a bit of tension was building, our heroine fails us. I watched the movie with a group of 12 friends, and we all were shouting at the film at the same times. \\"Duh... call the police!\\" \\"Um, could you be any more obvious?\\" By the latter part of the film, we were all cheering the bad guys on. Our reason? \\"Anyone doing things that stupid deserves to get whacked.\\"Bottom line - Revved the engines but failed to engage the gears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and predictable","review":"THE GLASS HOUSE is about a girl and her brother and they get adopted by their neighbours because their parents died in a car accident. Leelee Sobieski plays Ruby (that girl) and she's your typical high school student. After Ruby and her brother move in with their new guardians (the Glasses) they start to notice some weird things about them. That's all i'm saying about the plot. THE GLASS HOUSE is suprisingly bland. It offers no suspense, a mediocre storyline, predictable plot -- shall I go on? It was boring OK! It could've been a \\"made for TV movie\\" or one that goes straight to video. It should be collecting dust on the shelves soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly poor","review":"At a glance, this film would appear to have a nice Hitchcockian plot, filled with suspense and doubt. However, even the intial setup winds up being clunky and nonsensical, while the rest of the film see-saws between laughably ridiculous and painfully dull. Though Leelee Sobieski, Stellan Skaarsgard, and Diane Lane all have given wonderful performances in other films, each of them falls flat in this one, which is to be expected, given how little they had to work with by way of plot and direction. Seek out their other works, and avoid \\"The Glass House\\" like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of 2001","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said it was the worst movie of the year because it was.

There aren't many trannsexual memoirs as honest and riveting as McCloskey's whirlwind tour, from married heterosexual to avowed transsexual.My main complaint is straightforward. This memoir does not elaborate on contemporary scientific theories on the origins of transseuxality. Odd for a book that purports to be part memoir, part social science. I was hoping to find more information on autogynephilia--either an affirmation or denunciation of the concept. Where does McCloskey stand on this subject? He writes about gender as if it were disconnected from sex. How true is this in real life?Despite the book's inherent limitations, it's a great read and suitable for a general readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel sorry for this person's family.","review":"I started this book with great interest and ended it nauseated.

She voices over the workout, yelling really cheesy, rhyming, \\"cheerleader\\" type chants...very annoying! The music is not only 80s, like the other reviewer suggests, but reminds me of a really bad porn movie soundtrack. It got to the point where I had turn the DVD off after the first 10 minutes, I couldn't take any more! The other side was just as corny, the music being so horrible that I couldn't focus on the routine; it just wasn't enjoyable. I do not recommend this for anyone, advanced or not...there are too many bouncy, choppy movements that could injure anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"turns on and off by itself","review":"I purchased two of these clocks for my office staff.

I normally wake up to a CD, but I don't hear the music first, I hear the CD player setting itself up. Not the desired effect.Oh, and couple other things: The CD player has been known to sometimes be very choppy and disturbing.The radio station is fine, but the fact that the volume and setting are on the sides does not help. AT ALL. I have big fingers so that's very hard to deal with. That's even how you change radio stations.And it does the flashing \\"12:00\\" thing during a power outage.

The next \\"Technical Details\\" statement:\\"Audio line-in for MP3 players with included cable\\"...completely describes the MP3 playback capability of this device.

After that, you could not choose to be awakened by music on a CD. When a product fails like that, it just isn't worth your trouble to send it off for repairs. These products need to work the first time and last for at least a few years. Six months is too short a time for a major feature to go out. Definitely not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to waking up to a buzzer","review":"This clock radio is a great way to wake to your favorite tunes. Operation is straight forward and fairly simple. Sound quality is about what you would expect from a clock radio, I expected a little better since it's a Sony. The display has three settings. The dimmest works great at night but is not legible during the day. The brightest is great in the day but way to bright at night. The middle is good for day but still just a little too bright at night. I like a really dark room while sleeping but am only bothered by the middle setting if am sleeping restlessly. It does not work with WMA files and could use a battery backup to keep the time settings during power outages but these are minor issues. Over all it is a very good way to wake up and has many features to like."},{"rating":"1","title":"A seemingly great product with a glaring omission...","review":"I'm so bummed. I just got home with this clock radio, and I now realize that I have to take it back to the store (not Amazon). I'd researched this product a while back, and I was aware that it didn't have a battery backup at that time, but I saw it in a local retailer here in Dallas, and their shelf tag listed \\"battery backup\\" as one of the features. I thought, \\"Oh, I guess Sony realized the goof and upgraded this model to include the obviously-necessary battery backup.\\" No such luck, and shame on me for not reading the product box itself to confirm that the feature was present - I didn't, and it ain't. It boggles my mind that a company like Sony has not wised up to such a blatant design flaw in an otherwise excellent product.Oh, well, maybe I'll buy another Emerson Research clock radio - I've had good luck with them, and I don't have to worry if the power fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"80's flashback with CD player","review":"Not worth the price I paid.

It's a little quirky in its operation, but my biggest issue with it is that the tuner for the radio is TERRIBLE! We always wake up to the local public radio station, but another station several points further down the dial will leak into the public station's frequency unless the radio is placed just so.

That's my one \\"pro\\". Cons, however, are more numerous. Poor controls placement. This is a clock radio, things need to be simple to use by touch. One shouldn't have to turn on the bed-side light to find buttons, etc.... The tuner knob/controller thingy is exactly the same as the volume control and both are hidden around the side of the unit. Again, a real PAIN to access when lights are off...and even when they're on. Then there's the CD player. Won't play a thing now at all. Started doing weird things a few months ago, and now it's dead.

The Alarm, Radio, and CD features are common features for Clock Radios, but I also wanted to connect an MP3 player. Everything works as advertised, except that the audio-in level is about 2x lower than the Radio and CD. So, if you want to fall asleep listening to MP3 music, you have to max-out your MP3 player's volume and turn-up the Sony volume. Then when you wake-up to the radio or a CD, it's too loud! I experimented with 2 different cables, an MP3 player, and my cell phone, and the line-in level is just too low. Very disappointing...

After reading dozens, and I do mean dozens of reviews, I decided to narrow it down to price-functions-brand-and the number of stars given by previous buyers. I finally decided on this Sony model. For the price, it has everything I was looking for, and more! I didn't even notice it had dual alarm modes when I reviewed it. The only fault we found is the position of the volume control, which is located on the facing right side far in the back.

I basically wanted something compact that will play a cd at night when they go to bed. Well I did not think through this bc I assumed that the cd player would have options to repeat automatically. This one does not so for my 9 month old I will have to go in to the room and press the play button again if she is not yet asleep and if she wakes up in the middle of the night there will be no miles davis to get her back to sleep.

The controls to fall asleep to your favorite station or CD are easy to use and accessible on the top of the unit.

I bought it because I thought the CD and mp3 functions would be pretty neat. Never in a million years did I think that it would not have a battery backup. It is an alarm clock, after all.I would return it if it wasn't such a hassle. Plus, I did give it 2 stars instead of 1 because everything else works good. It is a nice little radio, just a poor alarm clock. Maybe I will plug it into my computer's battery backup if there is a spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No battery backup ... HUGE flaw","review":"There is no battery backup which is unbelievable. Every other alarm clock I have used has battery backup. I really can't understand how Sony could miss this. It doesn't even matter if this is the best alarm clock in the world ... if it does not tell the right time when the power goes out or wake me up on time if there was a power outage throughout the night, it is useless.

The display is great. I prefer a traditional display like this, and the dimmer is perfect. The sound quality is not bad for under $40. I was a little surprised that it still had a manual tuner, but once again, it is not their best radio. It receives fine, even where I'm at, which is pretty much the middle of nowhere.The one disappointment I have with this radio is the lack of a battery backup for the clock. What were they thinking? Most clock radios today have at least a battery to hold the time, and many today have an auto-set feature. Aside from this oversight, though, it is a great unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed with the radio functions,","review":"This radio has no radio presets and only a small unlit combination AM-FM dial hidden on the side.

We went ahead and found the much smaller (and even cheaper) RCA one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"I readily paid more for this item over some of its competition on the basis of the Sony name alone. Over the years, I've come to trust Sony implicitly. Boy, was I fooled this time.I purchased this as an upgrade for my son's room so he could utilize his mp3 player as well as play CDs. From the get-go, he had trouble figuring it out--and this is one high tech kid. The controls are awkwardly placed, awkward to use, etc., as others have pointed out. But it got the job done, if not elegantly. And the sound quality was decent--not great, but not horrible, and certainly loud enough (unlike another reviewer stated).But a month or so ago, less than a year after we purchased the unit, the CD player stopped working. I went online looking for answers, only to find that others had the same problem. Wow. Forty bucks down the drain.This will definitely have me thinking twice about Sony in the future. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling sound quality","review":"Not much better than an old cheap transistor radio in sound quality.

All was well until the other night (6 months after purchase) when my son said it wouldn't play CDs any more. Checked out CD's - were OK, cleaned the CD player lens - seemed fine before cleaning, still would not play. CD player makes sounds like the heads are searching and not finding music tracks. CD lamp probably died.3 month warrantee, CD player dead at 6 months.Not what I'd call a high quality unit. From what I read of reviews, this is not an unusual experience.

Cosmetically it's not very attractive; the black-and-white look is clunky without being retro or even ironic. Controls for brightness and volume are in the far back of the chassis, making these adjustments inconvenient when I'm in bed struggling to set things up properly. The radio is a weak, crude analog setup that does not pick up most of the (large, powerful) stations I listen to. But the variable snooze is a nice feature, the numbers are easy to read, and I like having two alarms. No battery backup; an input for mp3 players is strangely placed in the front of the chassis (where volume control by rights ought to be). Far from a perfect product but perfection is rarely purchased for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This Alarm clock does everything I need it to.

The sound was terrible, the tuner would get a grand total of four FM stations (two of them only with distortion), the tuning knob and dial are around the side so you must pick up the unit to tune it. The alarm choice (buzzer/radio/etc.), the tuning band selector, the tuning knob, and the volume control are all analog and are on the side. You can see only the time from the front panel.

It travels with me wherever I go. I have Tinnitus (severe head/ear noise due to brain surgery & radiation 15 yrs ago) The CD can on only play for 30 min - 45 min and stop. Otherwise, the Tinnitus condition gets worse. I recently purchased another \\"Craig Disc Digital Audio\\" player. Many people with Tinnitus use this method to help them go to sleep. It could be set up with a choice of use time; like an alarm clock and go off when completed. The Craig unit doesn't last as long as I think it should. We just purchased my third one. We were looking for something better. Please let me know if you ever create an electric unit that includes this option.Shirley & Bob Perry"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"We got this for my sons' room so they could wake up to a CD instead of an obnoxious alarm on school days. Frankly, it just isn't that great. It does work, most of the time. But then, once in a while, the CD won't play. It acts like there's no CD in the player, and it defaults to the buzzer alarm. Then, next time, it will probably work again.In general, the look and feel is super cheap. It sort of gives the impression of having been hastily slapped together by a depressed laborer in a prison factory."},{"rating":"1","title":"No battery backup!","review":"Oh, no! Add one more thing to the negative reviews: no battery backup! I thought every alarm clock had a battery backup so I didn't think twice when I didn't see that listed on the features.

(Sony uses the power cable as an antenna.)Saddest part is the sound quality is below what you would expect from a unit of this size and price.Looks like Sony did a nice outside package and stuffed in some 1970's era components inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Sony","review":"As a owner of an earlier Sony Dream Machine, this falls a little short. There is no battery back-up for the time. Also the radio does not really support MP3, you can play mp3 files through the aux input, but the CD player does NOT play MP3 CDs. I tried recording the MP3 files in a number of formats and dircetory structures, nothing worked. The only good news is that Amazon has an excellent return policy. Bottom line I still have faith in Amazon as a vendor, but this radio is not much more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty happy with Sony Stereo CD Clock Radio","review":"I bought this clock radio for my desk at work and was pleased with it's sleek sophisticated appearance in snappy black and white with large green numbers on it's clock face... However, like others I too was misled by the tech details stating that it has a digital AM/FM Stereo tuner... and was a bit dismayed to see the analog dial after pulling it out of the box. I'm not sure who wrote the tech specs but they need to be redefined... but it wasn't a deal breaker for me... as the building I work in doesn't have good reception for radio or cellphones...

It does have an input for an mp3 player, which is either what they meant in regard to playing mp3 files, or they just lied. I'm really disappointed that it doesn't do the one thing that I was buying it to do.It has a \\"digital tuner\\", ummm this doesn't mean what most people would think it means. You don't tune the radio digitally, you have a scroll wheel on the side that is almost as oddly placed as the volume button which is even further back near the bottom.It does tell time, it seems pretty good on that account. Had it verbally abused me I would feel worse about this product, but since it didn't I'll give it an extra star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"It seems like a very nice alarm clock with all the features I was looking for, however, I am a very heavy sleeper (usually takes 2 clock alarms and one cell alarm to wake me). As soon as I tried out the buzzer alarm I knew this one wouldnt work for me. The buzzer is actually a beep which does increase its frequency as time passes but not the volume (which i wouldve found more helpful). The beep wouldnt wake me up but might for a person who doesnt sleep so freakishly deep :P I thought it would be nice to have a CD feature to fall asleep to some ambient music. When I tried to play and stop a CD it made this horrible buzzing sound, it seemed like it was one of the wheels inside the player. It would be ok if it happened only when play was pressed but it did it also when the CD stopped which would wake me up. I returned it to the store and bought an Emerson instead.

On this disc, when I first heard their offering of Zep's \\"Battle of Evermore\\". I was throwing my fist in the air and yelling \\"YYYEEEAAAH!!!\\" towards the end of the song.

After a crime committed in the elitist Spire, she turns to the Underhive where the only law is that which rests on your hip. Things are bearable and Mad Donna is at least feared enough to be left alone until a summons from her past makes her realize that her past crime has never been forgotten.She's not all tough as nails and I would have loved to have seen a bit more depth to the characters but as with the other Necromunda novels take them for what they are, a fast read adventure in a dark grim bloody future where wits and a quick draw keep you alive.Definitely better than I expected and worth checking out the rest of the series if they stay this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly as described.","review":"what can i say? the item was exactly as represented, and the transaction was painless."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DISC","review":"LOTS OF ENERGY ON THIS DISC.

They have small imperfections in finish that do not effect function in any way but for near $60 should be show quality. I also do not like how the rings split below center.

John Lithgow and Sherrie Rene Scott had moved on but Jonathan Price and Rachel York were doing wonderfully as their replacements. All the major characters were very well done but Norbert Leo Butz as Freddy Benson stole the show. He really earned his Tony award for this part and continues to earn it with every show.

Wonderful performances, (especially by Sheree Renee Scott and Joanna Gleason in terms of vocals, but the men are really funny), hilarious lyrics (the song about brother Ruprecht is a scream), and even one song that - in an added track at the very end - Scott proves could become a cabaret or jazz standard. I have heard repeatedly that the CD cannot do full justice to the live performance, and I am sure that this is true. However, as one reviewer put it, the \\"relistenability factor\\" is proof of this CD's success. How rarely one comes across that in a musical comedy CD anymore.

The namesake of the book is addressed once early on in the book, and again towards the middle. Sixty pages to the end finally is the subject attended to in any serious fashion. Although Silverberg does eventually bring you to what he has promised it seems rushed, and forced. When the book was over I was left feeling hollow, and my time wasted.

You can hear very quickly that the band is very tight - this CD was recorded mid-tour. \\"Taking Sides\\" is a highlight with some great improv. \\"The Gig\\" is a Herbie Nichols song that's been delightfully dismantled and reassembled on the fly. I've seen a few jazz writers say this is one of the best CD's of the 90's. Unfortunately for me, I don't like the next three songs as much, taking this out of the running. \\"Vanitatus Vanitatum\\" closes the CD out in humorous fashion.If you like Dave Douglas, the Tiny Bell Trio, or modern jazz, I recommend this.

An incomplete toy..disappoinment","review":"My two year old got this for Christmas. It is a decent toy if you have all the trains or at least two.. the toy comes with one train. They are magnetized so that they connect together. Now I feel that I am forced to go buy more trains to make this a toy worth even having. My son sure isn't too enthralled with it as it is but I think he might like it with more trains. I'm not sure if they are available individually but online you have to buy a set of five and they are priced at $29.99 which is outrageous for five small toy trains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buying","review":"This toy looks really neat. I like the fact that the track stores in the roof and there is a place to store the trains. However, during play the trains get stuck inside the roundhouse very easily. The door openings are so tiny that it takes adult help to remove them. I have to use the magnet from another train to get the stuck one out (something a child cannot do by themselves.) I bought this toy so my child could play with it while I am working. Since I have to constantly help to remove the trains, it is not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrived quickly","review":"I ordered this item for my son.

This had led to more tears at our house than the toy is worth. The pull out part that the track is attached to comes detached from the building fairly easily. I like how the roof opens to hold all the tracks that come with this set (although if you were to buy additional tracks there is no additional space to store them in this particular building)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomas the Train","review":"I got this for my 4 year old grandson and he loves it.

There is never any streaking. The dark color might scare you at first but it rubs and blends in gorgeously. It doesn't smell like a traditional self tanner, but it does have a slight \\"lotion-y\\" smell to it hence why the four stars instead of five.

Of course, Mr. Lesko knows that the kind of person looking for a free handout is pretty easy to trick, and I have no sympathy for such people.

Frankly, I have often found it time-consuming and difficult to determine where to call for the desired information or services. It is extremely helpful to have a source that gives one a starting point. Because the book is large and very heavy, it is very cumbersome and somewhat difficult to carry around. I like to carry the book that I am reading with me because, by reading on lunches and breaks, I can finish the book sooner. Due to the size of this book, I did not carry it with me.

Highly insightful","review":"Allan Johnson writes with rare clarity about gender issues.Here at last is a book about gender relations that both men and women can feel connected to. Johnson validates women's feminist work, holding it up as an example of both moral and intellectual achievement. In fact, he takes feminism absolutely seriously, which made me realize just how rare that is. And yet, he's not a guilt-ridden \\"sensitive 90's guy\\" who is merely kow-towing to anything female because of the long history of our mistreatment at the hands of his gender. Instead, Johnson takes a far more responsible role than passive guilt. He is actively working to understand patriarchy from a male perspective in order that he can be part of a large-scale, *societal* (not individual-level) solution to the gender problems we are mired in. Men will not feel personally attacked by his stance on patriarchy, and yet, women will feel validated.This is a very important book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enlightening book","review":"As a male who's first real look into this topic has been with this book, I've found it be a shining light, and sometimes a rather confronting one at that. It's certainly opened my eyes to society and my own deep seated ideas about gender roles. There were certainly parts of the book that caused inner turmoil, but anything that challenges preconceived notions of reality can cause this and by (not so simply) looking past these I was able to view this with an open mind (unlike some of the other reviewers). I feel after reading this and being open to what's put forward it all seems so obvious and correct and would recommend it to anyone who wants to understand patriarchy and the problems it causes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distorted beyond validity","review":"This book is most certainly among the most distorted works that purport to be an unbiased discourse on gender issues. Allan Johnson has contrived page after page of anti-men rhetoric that renders the book a pure work of fiction. How can someone be so self-hating? It is beyond me. Johnson needs to take a huge step back and realize that not everything male is horrible and that not everything female if benevolent and good. How about a BALANCED work on gender issues? I suspect that won't be coming anytime soon from Allan Johnson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much too biased","review":"I read this book and found it to be a most slanted discourse on gender issues. The author clearly has issues of self-loathing. To place all the ills of non-white, non-males on the backs of white males is very simplistic and disingenuous. The author's reasonings give everyone an easy out for their lot in life. If you're not as successful as you feel you're entitled to be, just blame it on men. To be so anti-men is to render the author's points little more than ad hominem attacks on the male species. The use of statistics in such a flippant way is a textbook case of how statistics can be abused. At some point, a balanced account of gender issues will arrive. Obviously that time is not now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Breath...the book or the cure","review":"Not recommended.A rambling review of causes of bad breath with few helpful suggestions.

This lady states that she relies on herself and that's all she needs: quote \\"I no longer need the salvation offered by gods\\". She truly has an agenda against Christian religion as shown by her chapter titles and the themes running throughout the book. There is a place for those who deny God, and I will not be there because I do believe in him, I know that I am a sinner, and I have asked Jesus to forgive me of my sins (washed by the blood of the lamb), and he has. Does that mean that I am now perfect? NO. It still means that I struggle with the sinful ways of this world, but that I do have God to rely on. He does give us choices to make, and yes, he gives us our own instints to rely on also. I hoped that this book would help me to re-awaken those instinct that I buried so long ago - it doesn't.

Well, little did we know at the time, this slightly odd album marked the first step of the Beatles' journey from pop stars into their expanded role, via their expanded consciousness... With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that from here, it's a straight line to Revolver, and Sargeant Pepper's. And where they went, the kids followed and brought the world along.This album is the first step on that journey we all took, from the world of the 50s to the world of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Inkling","review":"I remember thinking when this album first came out that it was something very different and I really liked it.

Now: one of the peaks of rock music. There's never a dull moment--even the throwaway tongue-in-cheek ballad \\"Michelle\\" amuses. The high points go beyond the classics, into pieces like Lennon's irresistibly groovy \\"The Word\\" (his first foray into abstract politics) or McCartney's sharp \\"I'm Looking Through You.\\" The boys had matured, and their ambitions were rising to aim for levels no one could imagine; today, after the likes of \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" or the White Album, one still feels the frenetically-exciting anticipation for what was to come. And after that, \\"Rubber Soul\\" is just as exhilarating as it was before."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favirote Beatle album","review":"Rubbersoul is in my opinion the best Beatle album of all 12 albums they made in a span of 8 years.

The Beatles were under the influence while making this album and it shows as it has a distinct hazy aura about it perfectly captured by the slightly off kilter cover photo(my favorite Beatles cover with Abbey Road)The songs themselves are almost uniformly beautiful but the best are Johns sublime In My Life & the wonderful Norwegian Wood,these two alone are worth the price.But you also get Harrisons Byrd-esque guitar classics Think For Yourself & If I Needed Someone,Nowhere Man and the pre-psychadelic The Word.A folk rock/pop classic from beginning to end and one of the most beautiful albums ever made.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overrated Beatles Album...","review":"This album was a rushed recording project and it shows. During 1965 at the height of Beatlemania, the guys were rushed into the studio at the end of the year after a successful tour and hit film. They had absolutely no time to do any recording so basically everything was pulled from where the sun doesn't shine. There are a few tracks that stand out such as \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" but all in all these songs might as well have been put on the Please Please Me album (which the song \\"Wait\\" was a song written during that time).

The same 12 tracks in the same order. It was perfection at the time, so why mess with it?????? Why can't the company simply re-release the original without, \\"bonus\\" tracks, especially without replacing original tracks like putting \\"Drive My Car\\" where \\"I've Just Seen a Face\\" should be and without \\"What Goes On\\" where \\"It's Only Love\\" should be. I can live with \\"Nowhere Man\\" being inserted out of nowhere and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" is a grea song, but why ut them in the middle of the old line-up? Put them at them end. The Beatles were one of the first bands to make albums that were unified wholes and Rubber Soul was one of the first albums that began to show this quality. Please, please, someone release the CD the way it was meant to be. Actually, never mind. My 1965 LP is in great shape ...

John wrote 3, George wrote one and the other is a Lennon/McCartney collaboration. The rest of the CD is only adequate, as songs like Run for Your Life and What Goes On are just below par, and Michelle and You Won't See Me are easy listening songs.I prefer the albums pre-Rubber Soul.5 songs out of 14 is worth 1.8 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles First Art Album is Right","review":"With all the great music released in the 60s, 70s and 80s, I feel sorry for anyone who still has Rubber Soul in a prominant place in their listening queue. While many bands have written songs with great riffs along the lines of Taxman, Day Tripper, and Paperback Writer, the fact is that the vast majority of Beatle tracks from '65-'67 were light pop. Amazing how little some people actually know about this band.Rubber Soul has a few redeeming tracks like Norwegian Wood and In My Life (also acoustic pop) that can be had on greatest hits compilations, with which you can hear these songs without suffering through the likes of Michelle. 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.... but very dissapointed!","review":"It's the Beatles so it is GREAT! But...I guess I missed in the description or it wasn't there that this is NOT the same as the album I loved as a pre-teen. It must be the world or british release as it is missing songs and has songs that my lp does not.This is fine but to evoke the memories of long ago the order of songs and familiarity from hundreds on listenings as a youngster is missing.I actuall prefer to play the old lp and I am not someone who prefers crackles and pops in my music.I guess I'm not really happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles best, before the mannerist period","review":"\\"Drive Your Car\\" does not belong on this album, it was not on the original US release, it is out of tune with the other songs on this serious adult album.My favorite song of all-time is \\"It's Only Love\\", which apparently was originally released in 60's-style on various album without concern about later-day consistency, but it belongs on \\"Rubber Soul\\" because of the music and lyrics, it is adult and is revelant to my own marriage, so I love it, \\"Rubber Soul\\" as a whole is an adult document on the relationships of men and women (well I suppose politically correctly I should say people and people).Afterwards in the Sgt Pepper/White Album/Abbey Road days The Beatles talked about cosmic stuff, not so much about marital relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Remaster","review":"Obviously Rubber Soul is an extremely good album. Unfortunately, this 2009 remastering is not. The remastering took all of the soul out of it. This is not even close to the original LP in terms of sound quality.

A disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its the Beatles for gods sake","review":"It doesn't get any better than this. You can't not give them 5 stars.

They had achieved that with flying colors. My personal favorite Beatles album because of songs such as \\"Norwegian Wood\\", \\"You Won't See Me\\", \\"Nowhere Man\\", \\"Girl\\" \\"In My Life\\" and of coarse \\"I'm Looking Through You\\". This also was a great album for George Harrison. It has two Harrison originals, \\"Think For Yourself\\" and \\"You Won't See Me\\" which stand among Georges finest achievements throughout his career. So in a nutshell, \\"Rubber Soul\\" by the Beatles is the greatest album of all time and probably forever. There will never be an album more influential as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"their first masterpiece???","review":"My love for this CD is second to none, yet I have a problem with those reviewers who contend that this is the group's first masterpiece and that those CDs released before it were examples of \\"bubble gum pop\\". I would argue that \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is a towering piece of art which makes no concessions to anyone or anything. Far from being \\"bubble gum\\" it boasts an astonishing number of styles and of great, memorable tracks: the only weak cut may be \\"When I Get Home,\\" the remainder are works of genius which must not be subsumed as unimportant or as trivial beneath the weight of the later, more experimental CDs. Like \\"Rubber Soul\\" there are no singles on this CD (\\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" was not released as a single in England) and like \\"Rubber Soul\\" the album resists compromises - the myth of \\"RS\\" being their first great CD is simply that, a myth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight improvement","review":"First. . .5 stars for the original album, and 5 stars for the Beatles, of course. I bought the remasters of \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul.\\" Great albums, but the lopsided stereo is annoying. The liner notes say, in very small print, they worked from the 1987 remaster.

Anybody got a mono copy?Unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure British soul music","review":"I never really fell for what the Beatles did from Sgt. Pepper on. To me this album and Revolver was the groups high water mark. But its this album i think that produced the best synthesis, especially for ballads. It was produced when the group was still very much a 'group' and before the disillusionment and disintegration started to set in with the White Album. It shows a distinct maturation in complexity but without the orchestral affectations of some subsequent work. The album is reflective and personal in theme, and built around an integrated and lyrical structure which gives a distinct coloration and mood. I find it has the is the most cohesive and atmospheric album of the lads, even a touch mystical, but then these were the 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beatles must-have","review":"The song 'In My Life', which many people consider the best beatles song, and possibly one of the best pop songs ever, is by itself worth the price of this album. Add to that beatles classics like Norwegian Wood (a song that John wrote about an affair he had), Nowhere Man (which addresses the feelings of uselessness that most of us sometimes feel), Girl, If I Needed Someone and Michelle, and you have an album that's worth it's weight in gold. The only song I do not really care for on this album is the country-ish \\"What Goes On\\", sung by Ringo. All in all, one of their best, and that's saying a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional stuff - The Beatles best album","review":"Kicking off with the funky Drive My Car, this album never lets up. With all songwriters firing on all cylinders, this is one of the most complete band performances of The Beatles' career. Lennon in particular shines here, the standout being In My Life, which is his musically and lyrically peak - although I didn't realise that George Martin speed up the solo until recently, which drive me crazy trying to play normally! Norwegian Wood, Nowhere Man, Girl and Run For Your Life are other great Lennon tracks. George puts in two great songs with If I Needed SOmeone and Think For yourself, while Paul's Drive My Car and I'm Looking Through You are fast and fun affairs.

This Beatles album is not as good as Sgt. Pepper or even Abbey Road, but it does feature some of the best songs of all the Beatles'. The CD starts with \\"Drive My Car\\" which you won't like at first, but two or three weeks later your singing it to yourself. After that comes Norwegian Wood, a great beat but not so innocent lyrics. You'll also love Wait and In My Life, which are amazing songs. Like Drive My Car, you won't fall in love with Wait right away. You have to wait :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I Give This Six Stars? lol","review":"The album is AMAZING! Ohhh man, it is hard to beat that guitar in the song \\"The Word\\". The Beatles are definitely showing how much they have grown in Rubber Soul. This record is just something completely different and just fantastic. Words are hard to express this album, which is definitely another masterpiece from the greatest Rock band ever. Ringo brought back his country side with \\"What Goes On\\" and it just feels like it could be a Beatles song and is. It is all just really great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recording","review":"I hadn't listened to Rubber Soul since I owned the album back in 9th grade. It was wonderful revisiting Rubber Soul.

As a result, we had to stand the release of albums like Revolver (Eleanor Rigby), Sgt. Pepper (When I'm 64), and Mystery Tour (Penny Lane)before the group even began to return to rock with the White Album. These weren't exactly rock songs.Rubber Soul is O.K., but not great.

These were the original British album releases -- the way the Beatles intended them to be -- before money-grubbing Capitol butchered their albums for the U.S. market. You subsequently had to buy twice as many U.S. albums to get the same songs as the British albums. The Beatles didn't like this, and this was the inspiration for their infamous \\"butcher\\" cover on the front of Capitol's \\"Yesterday and Today\\" album.This is Rubber Soul the way the Beatles intended it to be. All 14 songs of it (the Capitol version had less songs, and threw in leftovers from Help!, since they butchered the Help soundtrack album and used orchestra music from the movie as filler.)The result is, of course, a masterpiece.

Every song on this album is written by a Beatle and consequently is the first to show what the Beatles were capable of. Some people even to consider this their favorite album. I don't consider it my favorite album but I do recognize it as a peak in their career, a peak from which they never really came down. They retired while still at this peak.

This is definitely a innovative album that set the future of the Beattles and the whole late 60's music scene. A must for Beattles fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning point for the Beatles","review":"The Beatles were on the verge of quitting touring when this album came out, and were also starting to experiment with mind-altering drugs, and behaviors such as meditation. They were beginning to stretch out their creative muscles as composers, and were starting to use the studio to a greater degree. This album marks the end of the Beatles as a great Pop group and the beginning of their journey into becoming the greatest Rock band that ever was. The cool thing about this album is that it still predates the studio experimentation and relies on truly great songwriting. Rubber Soul is definitely one of the essential Beatles albums because it, along with Revolver, is so transitional."},{"rating":"2","title":"This version is the version released worldwide.......","review":"except in America,where capitol records saw fit to come up with there own albums and song listings.This version of Rubber Soul has been available since 1987,replacing the old version.This is the version that the Beatles and George Martin easily preferred!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I thought this album was better than \\"Revolver\\".

Unfortunately, they wouldn't re-emerge as rock artists until 1968 with the White Album and then released Abbey Road as a farewell. Comprising the slump were Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper, and Rubber Soul was among the least impressive.

It really hasn't stood the test of time.Focus on the early albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Cover Art","review":"The cover art sucks.

Musically, too, it was a substantial leap forward, with intricate folk-rock arrangements that reflected the increasing influence of Dylan and the Byrds. The group and George Martin were also beginning to expand the conventional instrumental parameters of the rock group, using a sitar on \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown),\\" Greek-like guitar lines on \\"Michelle\\" and \\"Girl,\\" fuzz bass on \\"Think for Yourself,\\" and a piano made to sound like a harpsichord on the instrumental break of \\"In My Life.\\" While John and Paul were beginning to carve separate songwriting identities at this point, the album is full of great tunes, from \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" and \\"Michelle\\" to \\"Girl,\\" \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" \\"You Won't See Me,\\" \\"Drive My Car,\\" and \\"Nowhere Man\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first incredible beatle cd","review":"I think this cd is the first way experimentalish recording from the beatles, with DRIVE MY CAR (what a great bass line) and michelle and If I needed someone... great G R E A T songs. the beatles were getting LEGS on this cd and carried it on to their next recordings.

Each song paints a character and his story, unique and totally unrelated to any other song.\\" And he replied, \\"Well, that's why they called it 'Rubber Soul'.\\" In retrospect, this was the very opposite of a \\"concept\\" pop album, which would be invented by the lads three years later.Many years later I would learn that Felice and Boudleaux Bryant and Robert Browning worked that way, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"transition album","review":"weak! what goes on sounds terrible, if you re listening to in my life, norwegian wood, run for your life are okay.this is not the best album but one of the worst in the 60.White album, blue and red albums one, or abbey road are okay.

Nevertheless, tracks like Michelle and In My Life are now most often heard in their orchestral, non-lyrical form, as background music; and songs like You Won't See Me are more likely to be heard in the Anne Murray cover version.The fact is that Rubber Soul was a departure from the great beat and hooks of Beatlemania, as the band evolved to light pop. Eventually they would return to their rock roots with the release of the White Album.Drive My Car and Harrison's If I Needed Someone Are Good. But it's a 2-star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"a transitional album","review":"This album clearly marks the transition between the Beatles' childish music (everything before this album), and their slightly-less childish music (Revolver onwards).

It is the 3 minute mindless pop songs that ruled the charts (and hearts) in the 60s (beatles, monkees), as in the 90s (spice girls, back street boys).If songs such as \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"Think For Yourself\\" were released by Britney Spears (some of hers are actually more profound than these two), you would see them for what they truly are: drivel.

This album is a decent early 60s sort of thing but theres really not a memorable song on it and I just bet if it wasn't the Beatles then no one would be playing it today.By the way, if you want a version of the song Money that isn't quite so slick sounding then get the Stones Fazed Cookies album."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINAL ANALYSIS II/With the Beatles","review":"\\"how the music would become\\" Better than the number one , but not yet a strong album .

This one is a lightweight album. We all know that the group had years of club playing in Hamburg to develop their early stuff. You should know that Lennon & co were big fans of Elvis Presley, they wanted to do like him. And then they were doing the cover versions of American Rock and Roll they could play in their sleep. My humble opinion, this album is absolutely tame!PS: Hey the beatles was not alone in the music world.

There are a lot of covers on this album, but I love them all. The Beatles version of \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\" is absolutely fantastic and probably my favorite cover they do, but obviously not their most famous cover. I just really love that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Steve Vrana","review":"Steve appreciate your fine review of Meet the Beatles. Agree with you that as an aging Beatle fan I wish we had the orginal US printing of this and other Beatle album. What I did was take the CD's and create a mix of the songs as they orginally appeared in 1963/64/65. I like you have listened to these albums so many times as a kid they are imprinted in my brain to be heard in a specific order. Nor to hear \\"This Boy\\" as the third song on Meet the Beatles puts me off. I would doubt if there are many of us out there that would make this a good finanical project for a record company to rerelease these albums in their US format. Just thought to write.

It's a great album but With The Beatles is slightly better. It has a better production and it has a more professional sound than their first. The covers are great too but that's one thing that puts it down a small step, if it had more original Beatles songs I'd give it 5 stars. Please Mr. Postman is a cover but it's also one of my favorites though, the best original Beatles songs would have to be All My Loving, It won't Be Long, All I've Got To Do and Hold Me Tight. The entire albums solid and it's nothing too different from their albums up to Beatles For Sale, just mainstream rock and roll/pop which isn't a bad thing and it's somewhat underrated compared to their later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"With the Beatles","review":"This music is a treasure of songs that don't receive a lot of attention. I still remember hearing these for the first time, though my mind still expects the tracking from the original US \\"Meet the Beatles\\" release.

The lads originally wrote \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" for the Rolling Stones who recorded and released it first. Long Live Paul McCartney, Richard Starkey, and Pete Best! Speaking of Pete, a thought dawned on me for the first time ever yesterday: Why didn't Paul, George, and Ringo include Pete Best in the Video Anthology. What I mean is, he should have been interviewed too. He was there in the beginning. He's still alive. Why not include his thoughts on the experience.

It's funny, to me because it is hard to pick (for me) your favorite Beatles song or album. You almost have to look at the track listing on each and go down the line saying \\"Yes, yes, no, yes...\\" and then add up the Yes's and No's. It's not being critical, or even getting deep about it. It's simply, do you like the song?There's a couple here I don't which keeps it from getting 5 stars.

In fact, I rate it second only to \\"Revolver\\" (with the White album a close third!). I first heard this album when I got it as a 10th birthday present back in 1964. Then \\"All my loving\\" was my favourite track. Now I think it's \\"It won't be long\\". The one drawback about the CD release is that it's in mono. Okay, the stereo version is largely vocals out of the right speaker, backing on the left, but it does lose a little (although it's still worth 5 stars). Here in the U.K. E.M.I. have released CD versions of albums by the Hollies, Manfred Mann etc with the stereo version followed by the mono mix.

This makes it impossible for me to believe a man like the hero would want to be with her. The book was supposed to be about their different social classes, which is a premise that I love in my romance stories. The reality is, no man with a reasonably high intellect would want to be tied to someone this dim.After I had read 3/4 of the book I seriously considered not continuing. I hated it that much. However, I also hate purchasing a book and not finishing it.Would highly recommend others steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not that good","review":"I agree with the reviewer who asked why this book got such high reviews from others.

This album does bear some light on good songs as well as well lets just say CRAP, which is why it only got 4 stars. Cirrus Minor is a good little acoustic number with a tint of previous album title track clinging to it. The Nile Song is probally my favorite on this album, David Gilmore is just screaming this one out like a heavy metal band would. And then of course Cymbaline, I thought it kind of reminded me as voices goes David Bowie during the chorus part of the song, also good Ibiza Bar, almost a reprise of The Nile Song.

It ebbs, flows, occaisionally bends your ear, comes to you from another place.It has that reverb-drenched sound on a lot of it, beautiful arrangements.It may have been recorded in a haze of pot smoke, I don't know, but that ethereal sound puts the listener into that frame of mind, and you can just drift away with it...As long as you keep in mind that it's a movie soundtrack, and not necessarily meant to be a mainstream recording, it becomes easier to appreciate this. Further, remember that it's an obscure film, and this material becomes even easier to appreciate.

But come on already, because within this album is the genesis of what is to become pink floyd. Their direction starts to become, well, at least, somewhat clear here. More so, anyway, then it does on their first two albums. Plus, this album is worth owning, just for Cymbeline and Green is the Color, two of Roger Waters early and often forgotten masterpieces. Why Cymbeline didn't make the cut for their greatest hits album, is beyond me. It would have given some much deserved attention to their post syd early catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsequential meanderings","review":"More is a soundtrack LP that sounds like a movie soundtrack rather than a collection of 13 songs. There is no consistency of style or sound. An atmospheric doodling like Main Theme is followed by Ibiza Bar, a more \\"conventional\\" Floyd creation. I bought the LP in 1969. As I didn't particularly care for it then the record has sat in a rack for about 40 years. I won't be reaching for it again soon. Now, if I had seen the movie and could relate the Floyd's tracks to scenes in the movie perhaps I'd feel differently. I really enjoy Tangerine Dream's soundtrack to the movie Thief. The music is meandering at times but suits the tone and content of the movie perfectly. I doubt that I'd appreciate that music if I wasn't so familiar with the movie.

It was a soundtrack for a Barbet Schroeder film, and in its original vinyl configuration, Side Two consisted mostly of forgettable instrumentals. Side One was better, with three tracks written by bassist Roger Waters that were rather engaging -- \\"Cirrus Minor,\\" \\"Green is the Colour\\" and \\"Cymbaline.\\" Overall, though, this album rarely rises above mediocre, and suffers the same fault many movie soundtrack albums suffer -- the work comes off as \\"incidental music\\" that, when separated from the film, simply does not stand up on its own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really not that bad...","review":"This is probably Pink Floyd's most obscure album (really a soundtrack). Despite being Pink Floyd's least known album, it has a few of Pink Floyd's best songs, including \\"Cymbaline\\", Green is the Colour\\", and some all around great musical pieces such as \\"Cirrus Minor\\", \\"Main Theme\\", and \\"Dramatic Theme\\".

It wallows quite a bit, and at times, can get quite dull.Still, Pink Floyd are growing their roots with this record and their experimentation with ambiance, mood and tone produce interesting results. The album clearly influences their later work and allowed Pink Floyd to broaden their scope and move forward to produce their masterpieces later.This is Pink Floyd growing their roots. Not every direction they indulge in with this record works, but it is, in my opinion, a vital component to the collection of anyone who enjoys Pink Floyd. It's a glimpse of the band, when they were still a little incomplete.This album is a bold experiment that pays off later in their career.

The rest of the album, however, is relatively forgettable; some pleasant instrumentals and enjoyable enough acoustic numbers, but nothing that rises to the level of the band's better work.

Others seem happy with this bit kit, so maybe I got an infrequent duller set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight bit broke off during first pass","review":"The 1/4 straight bit broke off about 3 inches into a 1/4 deep rabbet in very soft pine THE FIRST TIME I USED IT. I haven't used the others yet, but I am not impressed so far. I used a dull Porter Cable bit I've had for years to complete my project, which included 1/4 depth rabbets in walnut. I was told by a saw blade guy that the bits sold in this kind of moderately-priced sets tend to be inferior quality, and he'd never heard of MLCS anyway. I thought he was just saying that because he didn't carry them. I'd have been really annoyed if I'd been using a bit from this set I didn't already have a backup for. I'm going to stick to Whiteside or Porter Cable bits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starter set for 1/2\\" dia. router chucks.","review":"This kit contains most of the common bits used in a full size router. I have had the kit about 3 years now and find it quite useful. The bits perform satisfactorily for most work, giving a reasonably good finish. Some sanding may be required for fancy work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Really Miss!","review":"Recently purchased a Bosch 1617EVSPK at a big box store and needed a couple bits with 1/2\\" shanks. So far, I've used the 3/4\\" straight to make about 40' of dadoes, the roundover bit for around 20', and the cove bit for 10'. These would have cost me more than this entire set and the bits look like they still have plenty of life left in them. As other reviewers mentioned, they're difficult to get out of the box and it would be very easy to slice your fingers - use a rag to take them out and clean the protective coating before inserting them in your collet. I used alcohol. I don't see how you can miss by buying these bits. The cost is minimal for what you get and I believe they will last quite awhile and they have a great storage case. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bit set for the price.","review":"This is a nice router bit set for a starter set if you don't have the cash to drop $30 on single bits. I've used it several times and these bits create a nice smooth cut on hard and soft woods. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting set.","review":"After cleaning them up, I put them to work. They cut great and smooth. The only issue I had was the larger bits didnt fit through the router base plate. So I had to go to the local tool store to pick up a wide open base plate. After the quick fix I went back to work and was able to finish up the work I was doing.I would recomend them to any one. What a great starter bit set."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sharp","review":"These so called \\"carbide tipped\\" router bits are no sharper than my old used steel bits. I tested the 3/4 \\" straight bit and it left an unclean ragged channel. I tested the rabbeting bit and it had the same problem (unclean , and for some reason pulled itself downward out of my routers collet making a downward drifting channel in the edge of the wood, and not a true rabbet. I tried a Diablo 3/4 \\" straight bit and it cut a clean slot in the wood,Don't buy this set unless you enjoy a lot of sanding or other clean up work later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only used a couple bits but they worked great.","review":"No concerns so far. Do clean the bits first, shipped with some sticky coating that I think you would rather not have in your router."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Bits","review":"So far these bits are holding up well.

I've already completed 3 projects using them and with a little care expect them to last a good long time. If I had to complain about anything it would be the little tab latch on the box. It fell off right away but nothing hit the floor. The secure bit holders kept everything in place. I'm now looking to expand my collection and will shop MLCS again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for hard woods","review":"I was given this set as a gift. I do quite a bit of work with red oak. I ran a piece of scrap stock with the 1/4\\" bit just to test it out. 2 inches into the piece, the bit literally shattered. Now I have had that happen once in a blue moon with name brand, worn down bits after several passes, but not on the first pass. I tried the 1/2\\" bit next and it made it through a 16\\" length of oak. OK, so the 1/4\\" bit was defective. I ran the same board through the same groove raising the bit 1/16\\". Midway through, the bit broke in half sending it ricocheting around the router table. I tested 2 or 3 more bits and none of them worked even somewhat satisfactorily. The blades are dull to begin with and burned up running them through some pine boards. Needless to say I tossed the entire set in the trash. I have been doing woodworking for nearly twenty years and have never had bits behave like these. Just for safety sake, these things should be taken off Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and they work fine","review":"As a remodel contractor I've used older MLCS bits for years and have had them re-sharpened. This set is a great value. Not as durable as Whiteside or Amana, but for occasional use they work just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Router Bit Set","review":"This is an excellent set. I have never had a router before so I wanted a good collection of bits. I've tried all of them and used the Flush Trim and Roman Ogee quite a bit. All have worked great. Get the 1/2 inch over the 1/4 inch if your router has a 1/2 inch chuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Router bit","review":"These router bits are not for the serious woodworker. They are cheap, but are not high quality. I just broke one of the bits on first use. You get what you pay for and in this case you don't pay much but you don't get much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with the set but.....","review":"I'm new to woodworking and routing and have tested these out on various types of wood. It would have been nice if they'd included something that actually says what the bit it rather than just a single piece of paper with sizes. I ended up buying a roundover bit from Bosch because I didn't realize there was already on in this kit. Aside from that they've worked well and are quite sharp. A good buy! Would have given it 5 stars but really would be helpful with some type of information. I'm also not sure what to do with the bearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What happened to the one I wrote?","review":"Actually, I already did some reviewing and correcting. You didn't like my review?

Excellent item to rave about."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Natural as Naturalness Could be","review":"If one is looking for the Glenn Gould or Tureck kind of touch, or the frenetic approach of Richter, one might find Horszowski sloppy. Perhaps one should pay more attention to the spiritual essense of Bach and in particular that very piece, trying to see if there is any justification for such an interpretation before passing judgment to say it is slow or whatever.

As a makeup artist, I have tried several of their products but after buying this I will never buy Laura Mercier again.Honestly, you will get more value for your money with a drugstore brand.

We streamed most of the movie via the PS3. We started around 4:30 PS EST. By the time we got to the last 30 minutes of the movie we hit the dreaded buffering problem that seems to be very prevalent, and limited to, streaming on the PS 3. The last part of the movie was delivered in 15-20 second bits with 15-20 seconds of buffering in between. BE VERY WARY OF STREAMING VIA A PS3.As far as the movie itself, this movie goes well off the map and by the end I don't really care who lives, dies or whatever. I just wanted it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third try isn't always the charm","review":"Being a fan of the Pirates movies I couldn't wait to see the third, until about 5 minutes into it. I was confused for most of the movie because, like in all the movies, the plot-line is constantly shifting and you never know who's on whose side, but in this one it's taken a bit to the extreme. Unlike most movies that you find yourself wanting to shout out to the main character, you instead are hoping he will shout out to you and let you know what the heck is going on, the whole thing seemed like a big gag being played on the viewer. Suspense is fine and dandy, but keeping the viewer in the dark through most of the movie isn't something that lures me towards a flick. If you're a fan of Pirates do not see this movie, just come up with your own ending and I assure you it will be better. The one thing that saved this flick from a one star is the cast, which cannot be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony Effort","review":"This movie was made for money. It is bad in almost every way ... acting, plot, CGI ... and a confusing mess that deserves to be thrown at 100 KM per hour straight into faces of the producers, the director, and its stars.

I'm soooo sorry to all those people who didn't like it, but this is a movie worth watching. Orlando Bloom's character, Will Turner, has changed greatly during the three movies, and although his character is nigh-on unlikeable at some points, it's still a good character. Elizabeth Swann (TURNER!!) has changed from lady to lady pirate, which is a better role for her than her original 'helpless' status. Jack is wierd, Barbossa is back, and Lord Beckett has a score to settle. The BEST MOVIE of the year!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pirates life for me.","review":"Captain Jack is the Man.

Episode 2 was OK (the fight scenes were good and there were a few laughs). This is definitely the worst of the 3. The plot is so disjointed it's hard to keep track of what is going on. The creators seem to assume that the viewers are familiar w/ the Davey Jones pirate legend and they are just retelling it with a few twists.

With Jack saved they face another problem. The Royal Navy has taken the Flying Dutchman's Captain hostage and now intends to destroy the pirate presence in the Caribbean for good. The Pirate Lords must band together and fight the massive Royal Navy and The Flying Dutchman.Pirates of the Caribbean is an incredible movie series. It has it all; action, comedy, adventure, drama, suspense, and fantasy. It's a very unique and legendary series featuring Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush, Keira Knightly, and Orlando Bloom. They make a great team, and Jerry Bruckheimer does a flawless job directing. This series also has awesome special effects, and costume designs. It's a movie that everyone should see. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a huge blockbuster with no clear story","review":"The third film of the pirates series is probably the most epic in terms of visual effects and scale but storywise it was very difficult with too much going on. Had it been released in say 2008 or 2009 I think it would have been easy for me to follow the story. The fact that it was released in 2007 a year after Dead Man's Chest made it difficult and possible for me to comprehend what was happening in the third movie. I could understand the story a little bit but the fact that there was too much going on in the third film made the story difficult for me to understand what was happening in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect Region Code","review":"This review relates to the incorrect information contained on the packaging, and does not reflect on the movie itself.

I must say the BluRay transfer is a work of art and everything looks and sounds amazing.The movie was enjoyable and as the previous pirates movies, does run about 2 hours long.

But what was this? So long and dark. New characters that were not in the first two. I wanted to see Captain Jack not second officer Jack.

I wanted to see more from them. Nothing.If Elizabeth wanted boring, she chose it. Just about everything that has ever happened between her and Will, she had to start. Compared to Jack, he is still in the boy department.Elizabeth, they soooo short changed your character. Would you ever have been satisfied with what the ending of this movie gave you (stay through the credits). Now I picture you working out a deal of spending one day with Will every ten years, and nine years + three hundred and sixty four days with Jack sailing the high seas. Now that would be fulfilling.

And as promised, it delivers an exciting, mostly-satisfying yarn. The major weakness of the film is that, even at 168 minutes, too much is crammed into the story. There are too many twists and betrayals, which makes it hard to follow at times. But the film is still very exciting, and Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow, as well as the rest of the cast, do a great job of keeping things moving. And even though this is the end of the story for some of the characters, the ending gives you a hint of further adventures to come. Fans of the films will find much to enjoy in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.\\"Movie/DVD Grade: B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SFX that look wonderful in High Def, story was ok.","review":"I give this four stars because I love the Jack Sparrow character as portrayed by Johnny Depp, but this movie was by far the weakest of the three stories. In fact, it is really POTC 2b as it continues right from where Dead Mans Chest left off.Much if not all of the charm and wit from the first movie has gone away, and in fact this movie is much more adult focused that the first or second where the second was really comical. POTC1 had a perfect balance. In a way I feel sorry for the folks behind the franchise as they made a great first film and just couldn't keep it going.If I sound disappointed it is because I am. The sfx were great, but some of the scenes were far too long and actually got boring. In all it is a 3 star movie that gets a bounce from its history.I was a little annoyed that the story ended with a nod towards a forth movie. Like Spider Man I think this series needs to lie fallow for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie--I'm definitely buying this DVD","review":"I loved the first Pirates movie, wasn't so thrilled with the second, but the third made me cheer.

The picture is the best I have seen yet on Bluray but the movie itself was not very good. There were millions(seemingly) of subplots that were only provided with about 5 minutes of explanation and then the cannonball fight scene in the end was over 48 minutes. This made for an overly confusing storyline that could have been portrayed much better. The movie was too long as well, nearly three hours.

I kept waiting for Jack to confront Elizabeth with her betrayal in the second movie, wondering how they would resolve their troubled relationship, but he just avoids her. And it was difficult to believe Will and Elizabeth traveled all the way to the other side of the world and never worked out the strain in their relationship after Will saw her kiss Jack. The depth of the potential love triangle was never explored. As for the ending, the final scene after the closing credits shows the end of the movie. I felt sorry for everyone who left the theater too soon and missed what happened ten years later when Will's time aboard the Flying Dutchman came to an end.

To overcome the inherent problems with sequels (i.e., whatever cohesion the original story had in #1 is over in #1, and sequels have to overlay other stories that attempt to relate to the original story). Most sequels fail, and P3 fails. The intolerable length of the film is a direct result of the story problem -- the creators simply added layers and layers of subplots, some with marginal relationships to the original story, but most with no relationship. They relate only to themselves, and build on themselves, and the movie becomes interminable while all these story lines are sorted out. However, they are simply make work, they do not really make any sense, either by themselves or in relation to the others. P1 was entertaining and mindless -- or entertaining because it was mindless. P3 requires the cinematic equivalent of counting cards to understand the various stories, which ultimately add up to nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely atrocious film.","review":"I loved the first \\"Pirates,\\" but this third installment is truly one of the worst movies ever made.

POTC3 was different, It takes a story and evolves it into a realm completely otherworldly. I have read some reviews of the plot being not very beilievable, but Pirates being cursed and running around a ship with nothing but their bones showing is pretty hard to consume as the truth as well. Acting (except for Kiera knightley who is the worst in the whole series) is great. Depp, Rush, Fat, they all do a great job. the story is a little confusing and yes the movie is very long, but a \\"unique\\" addition to the series. Not the best and not the worst...

There is no commentary on the movie at all. On the deleted scenes, which amounts to two, there is the option of commentary but it sounds like the director is reading something off a cue card. There are some behind the scenes stuff as to how the film was made, but overall, not as robust as what was on the first two film's bonus DVDs. Frankly, had I known, I'd have just bought the plain single disc DVD and saved some money. I do wish Amazon would make it a policy to list all the content on the second disc of any DVD set.

To prevent disappointment in future I will simply not purchase from manufacturers who region lock their titles. Have too often seen the wrong region shipped even when you take the trouble to order correctly.If you are unfortunate enough to have this problem, then at least it is nice to know that there are already ripping tools available to overcome the problem. Unfortunate decision by Disney - but if enough people decline to purchase region locked product it may speed resolution.It is ironic that - as in the VHS vs Betamax debacle the market has again chosen the inferior technology.

It was pure torture to get through.I wouldn't even accept this movie as a gift,and I would have to wonder what I ever did to anyone if they tried to foist this off on me! On top of the ridiculous,and continuous swinging about on ropes,as though they can get anywhere they choose by doing so,even in raging storms out at sea,you can only make out about every fourth or fifth word the character Calypso says,and she is a main character who has a lot to say!If you are desperate to throw away over 2 hours of your life,do yourself a favor and spend it sanding some drywall with an emery board,it would be less tortuous,and probably much more interesting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wasted My Time","review":"This is one of those movies where at the end of the film, they should have apologized for making us feel like we needed to see it for some sort of closure. I almost wish they had the nerve to just say \\"This was awful\\" and actually go back, change the script and make it worthy of what it should have been. Now with the fourth in the series coming out, it is hard to skip this film and jump to the fourth movie. I do have to say that some of the sets and special affects were pretty spectacular, but the awesomeness of that was clouded by such a horrible story-line.

Not this one. The romance was pushed too much. Having a female pirate captain was also pushed too hard as if they were trying to make a point. Getting married during a sword fight! WTF. That was both unbelievable and stupid (or unbelievably stupid) and not funny at all.

I wished I had waited for the DVD to rent because my experience in the theater was not worth $9.50The Singapore scene was about 20 minutes that could've been shortened to 5 minutes and there was nothing of great significance besides the navigational maps.Jack's scene in the Doldrums was completely overlong. Again, the scene could've been shortened to about 5 minutes. And what's the point of Jack licking the rock? It's a dumb shock factor.Seriously, this movie would've been great if there was more willpower by the crew to cut scenes down and out because there's no reason for a movie to be 2 hrs and 45 minutes long. I was so disappointed (save for the battle scene in the end!). I'd just stick with the first two movies and pretend I never watched the third"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirates 3=Worst Movie of ALL TIME!","review":"After being truly engrossed by the first two Pirates movies I was all set for the third movie but I could never have anticipated the letdown. I was stunned at the utter lack of a story in this truly awful movie. The Pirate Lords???? Hallucinatory Jack seeing multple Jack Sparrows??? Swann as Pirate King???? Keith Richards never looked so uncool and silly. What trash. Don't listen to the people who start their reviews of this movie with \\"I don't care what people say, I loved this movie\\" It's a lie. Nobody could love this movie and I was a HUGE fan of the first 2. I have never got up and walked out of a movie but I never came closer than this garbage. I couldn't wait for it to be over it was so stupid. Not only will I not buy this DVD to complete the trilogy, but At World's End was so horrid it actually lowered my opinion of the first two. Stay away and hope Depp & Co. actually try with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The B Movie That Thought It Was an Epic","review":"Wow that was bad. The writers did just about all the no-no's of movie-making possible. I don't want to give parts of the story away for the those who have never seen the movie; but nothing in the story made sense and everything was incredibly random.Also, Johnny Depp seemed really like he wasn't into his role (and if you're reading this, Johnny, you know you have to agree.) And who can blame him; the character of Jack Sparrow was butchered into a crazy one-dimensional person.So, if you have to watch it, just close your eyes (except during Orlando Bloom's close-ups) and listen to the awesome score that Hans Zimmer wasted (wasted I tell you!) on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing plot ***","review":"confusing plot *** make at worlds end the weakest and most confusing of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Three","review":"Of the three Pirates movies this one is the Worst!

If you're a 'Pirates' fan, you won't be disappointed. The quest to rescue Jack, redeem Bill Turner and end the romantic tension between Will, Elizabeth and Norrington continues. Except that Barbossa and a few other interested parties all want their share of whatever treasure is to be had. There are a few scenes that can only be described as weirdly surreal, yet fully in character with Jack Sparrow. Of course, there is a good measure of cannon fire and sword fighting. Most of all there is intrigue that just keeps you guessing. Honestly, I still haven't understood the exact mechanics of pacts between humans, spirits and the afterworld, mostly because I didn't get enough time between laughing and biting my nails. All in all it's a good laugh with a film that delivers excellence without taking itself too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"At World's End","review":"Great fun.

While it is big and bulky, knowing that it will last longer because of it's size, I'm glad we went with it. We have a GMC Yukon with bucket seats (not a bench seat) - the passenger seat must be moved up for it to fit comfortably. This was true with any of the infant seats that we tried out though.While I do wonder if I'd have been better off with the SnugRide (after the Consumer Reports study), my husband reminds me about when we went to look at them. If you go to the store and get 'hands on' with the seats, you'll see that the SafeSeat feels a lot sturdier than any other seat on the market.

It's true that it is bigger than many infant seat and heavier, but it is well worth the trade. I had the seat installed by a safety technition and the officer was very impressed with the seat. It was a little hard to install at first, but it fit so snuggly that it didn't budge at all. Now that I know how to install it, it's not hard. I just have to use my body weight to push down on the base while I secure it (we don't have tether for a rear facing seat).If we had not chosen this seat, we would have had to buy another carseat by the time our daughter was 6 months because she was already 22lbs!

The heroes are intercepted by the enemies of a race they just met in deep space, only to find themselves engaged in an adventure in dark-age Europe, with none other than the historical Arthur.... This novel is one of the best I have read on the subject (and I have read many!), better than so-called great novelists such as Marion Bradley. The book is historically accurate (and that is rare), the style engaging, the plot surprising even if you WOULD know the history!

My fave songs on this album are I saw her standing there, Anna (go to him), Ask me why, please please me, do you want to know a secret and there's a place. To people who enjoy late beatles or classic rock from the 70's, this might be hard to adjust to... But I love early beatles so naturally I enjoy the corniness and cuteness of the vocals and lyrics in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album which sparked Beatlemania!","review":"It had to start somewhere and after the success of the \\"Please Please Me\\" single in the UK, producer George Martin knew he had to get a Beatle album out pretty quickly. So this album was recorded pretty quickly. Imagine a Beatles gig at The Cavern. It was magically reproduced within the friendly and controllable confines of Abbey Road Studio #2. Any study of The Beatles' music has to start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Please Me","review":"You must appreciate this album for what it is. It is basically live tracks (recorded in 12 hours) of songs played at Liverpool night clubs in early 1963. The Beatles were one of the first British rock groups to be a given a record, so they were obviously surperior to any of their competetors. No rock 'n' roll music in 1963 was any more complicated; that would only happen over the next couple of years when the Beatles took rock to its greatest heights. These were four kids (George Harrison was only 19)! For a band just starting out, this is a fine album. (And it keeps on getting better from here!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"Keep in mind that The Beatles only had a limited time to complete the album. If they were given enough time, it could have turned to be as good as ABBEY ROAD or HARD DAY'S NIGHT. My favorite Beatles song until 1968 is on this album, I Saw Her Standing There, an Elvis-type rocker. Then there's Twist And Shout, which will get all the extra energy out of you. And of course, the title track, Please Please Me, is undergoing speculation if it reached No. 1 on the British charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Clean Fun","review":"Early early stuff here... \\"Please Please Me\\" is no experimental album. It's just plain old John, Paul, George, and Ringo rocking out to classic covers such as \\"Twist and Shout\\" and \\"Anna\\", and to now Beatle favorites like \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"Love Me Do\\". You won't find any heavy, meaning-ladden lyrics in these songs... just good old fashioned classic rock and roll. This collection of songs provides fun, easy-listening with catchy lyrics and fantastic guitar work. A little rough around the edges (which I find makes the album all that much more appealing), the boys were just starting out down the road to fame. This is a classic, must-have album for any Beatlemaniac, as it was their \\"hello to the world\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"even if this was the only album they ever recorded...","review":"It's a mistake to compare this album to any other in their catalog. Of course it's not Seargent Pepper, thank God. Nothing against that album, but I bet Lennon listened to this one a whole lot more than Pepper. And for good reason. I disagree that this album sounds primitive. The Beatles had plenty opportunity to polish thier act in Hamburg and the Cavern. Their youthful, exuburent vocals shine all the way through this disc. Lennon's vocals, particularly, amaze. I don't know if he ever sang better. I've always thought that this album \\"sounded\\" great, probably because it was mastered directly from the 2-track session tapes. It kicks much harder than their next three studio albums. Anyway, forget all the rubish that begins \\"not as good as.\\" If you love pop/rock/vocal, you'll love this album. And don't feel guilty when you reach for this one instead of 'The White Album.' There's good reason"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Beatles; Still Good","review":"The covers are average to above average(except for \\"Twist and Shout\\", which is a great Lennon vocal). What makes Please Please Me work is the early Beatles classics that are on display. \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" is one of the best album openers out there. It works extremely well. Even though Lennon/McCartney had yet to really show their songwriting chaps, they penned some fun, energetic songs. \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\" really stand out on the album. Just a sample of what was to come on later albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic cd","review":"this has to be one of the best beatles cd that there is. The songs just bring out the best in you.

Some people like this. Some people don't.The covers on this album are particularly good and include \\"Anna (Go To Him),\\" \\"Baby It's You,\\" and \\"Twist And Shout.\\"In addition, Lennon/McCartney wrote some classics with \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"Please Please Me,\\" \\"Love Me Do,\\" \\"P.S.

Depending on who you believe, it's either the greatest album of all time or a crappy slab of vinyl which in no way suggests the later genius of the band. While I agree with neither, I certainly lean closer to the former. That's right, shout all you want about \\"Chains\\" (which is infectious if you let it take you over), \\"Boys\\" (which is a lot of fun, really) and \\"A Taste of Honey\\" (alright...that's just crap), but truly, there is some great material here. \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" and \\"There's a Place\\" are some of the best songs John and Paul would ever write together and, when it comes to covers, \\"Anna\\" and \\"Twist and Shout\\" contain some of John's most passionate singing. Ringo's on key here but George hasn't really flourished into the great guitarist he later became. But Please Please Me was a breath of fresh air in 1963 and still has the power to please today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic Album!","review":"Many people say this wasn't one of the best beatles albums, to that i say , right ok, whatever you say. This is a great album. The recording budget may have been cheaper than what the label would later spend and the recordings somewhat rushed to get an album out \\"while the beatles were still hot\\", but i listen a lot to this album, infact i listen to it more than Revolver and Sgt.

Yes there are 2 tunes that were on previous albums, but the 4 new cuts make up for that as 3 of them are very psychedelic, and all together now is just a fun tune that fits the film perfectly.the orchestral score sounds great in remastered form, as do the other tunes but hey bulldog still suffers from separation in the verses in john's vocals. everything is so much richer and more clarity in the percussion and bass makes this album even better.this is a must own as is all of the beatles studio albums. just get both boxes : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny CD....","review":"This CD was made as a soundtrack.

If you're thinking about moving to a twin engine boat, this might be a good introduction but is best rented or bought on sale. Really, books and videos about boat handling are mostly an illusion; there really is no substitute for direct instruction from an experienced captain and practice, practice, practice. A book or a video is at most helpful for learning the vocabulary and getting some sense of the issues; it won't teach you to handle a boat with a lot of windage, with a crosswind, in a narrow slip, with an engine out or sputtering, and with a wife or SO freaking out.

The band shows some maturity in their songwriting but musically it's still very energetic like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\". You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, Yesterday, I Need You, It's Only Love and You Like Me Too Much are my highlights of the albums and some of The Beatles best songs.

Yesterday is instantly forgettable, Dizzy Miss Lizzy sounds like it could have been written in the 50's and Ticket to Ride is an insult to my ears quite frankly. As usual, I did enjoy Ringo's excellent drumming and I liked the song Act Naturally. For shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"There are Only TWO Great song on This piece of Garbage. The TITLE Track and YESTERDAY. The rest of the album is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"help! the beatles suck","review":"this album just has ONE good song on it the rest are just rambling crap about running thought a field with a gay lover. this album sucks get something else.IN FACT SKIP THE BEATLES ALL TOGETHER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oldie, not so goodie","review":"As to the pompous white album, people must have like this music at one time, many years ago.This is oldies music, nostalgic perhaps, but second rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"I find this album a masterpiece of its time. It is the last pop album by the beatles, before they developed into a talent to be reckoned with. But the songs on here are for the most part really strong. My faves are 'yesterday' (surprise) and 'i've just seen a face' by Macca. Lennon is still the superior songwriter at this stage, though things were to change soon. His songs are all excellent.Harrison is lagging behind the other two, but his two songs are enjoyable ditties.Criticism from me on the two covers. I never really liked 'act naturally' and I can't stand 'dizzie miss lizzie'. I think these two tracks should have been replaced by three others: 'Yes it is', 'I'm Down' (this would have been an excellent album closer.) and why the excellent 'That means a lot' could not be included is a mystery. This epic Macca tune has a soaring melody and nice harmonies which would have become a standout track.Still, a worthwhile album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music By The Greatest Band","review":"Obviously the previous reviewer is too young to know the Beatles' music, they prefer the garbage that is played on the radio & mtv today. This is what music sounded like when guys with something called \\"talent\\" wrote the songs & sang them. Instead of meaningless screeching, whining & playing the same guitar chord over & over, these songs meant something & were easily understood. A must-have for any Beatles collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longing for the original movie soundtrack","review":"As for the music it is great music like all of the Beatles songs but back in the time when this music was released Help was a soundtrack to the movie without the added additional tracks which replaced all the George Martin Orchestra and other orchestra tracks. It was a true movie soundtrack. This is what I want to hear. I can't believe after 45 years of putting out Remastered music this wasn't on anyones minds. I guess they may be waiting for us old timers, who be the only ones to recognize it to die off and sell it for some new lost music to a new group of listeners.Disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"There are some great songs on here. The first side is the best. The second side has some great songs, but some are rather anemic. YESTERDAY, while a great composition, for my money is not a great recording. I figured out why when I saw a video of the Beatles doing YESTERDAY at Shea Stadium. And I really liked their live rendition of it better than the studio version, which surprised me, because I don't consider the Beatles a great LIVE band. But it dawned on me that the reason I liked the Beates doing YESTERDAY live was that it was the BEATLES doing the song. The studio version is just Paul McCartney without the Beatles. And so the chemistry isn't there to make it a great recording, even though it is a great composition. So YESTERDAY, DIZZIE MISS LIZZIE, TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE, and I'VE JUST SEEN A FACE keep side two from being a great side. But the other songs on this album make it an album well worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing here??","review":"I have looked at two pages here side by side and I can't for the life of me figure out why this version of 'Help' put out by Toshiba EMI in 2004 is priced at $41.49, while what looks to be the exact same CD put out by Capitol in 1990 is priced at a much more reasonable $13.49.Unless you can find something I am missing, I'd suggest you head over tohttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000002UAL/ref=m_art_li_59/102-3455281-6122531?v=glance&s;=musicand buy that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Great Beatles Album","review":"After A Hard Day's Night and Help, the sound of the Beatles gave way to the easy listening and pop fare of Rubber Soul and Revolver. Occasionally there were flashbacks to the greatness of the early days (Revolver: And Your Bird Can Sing, White Album: Back in the USSR), but it was pretty sparse after Help.Get this one though - 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight improvement","review":"I bought the remasters of \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul.\\" Great albums, but the lopsided stereo is annoying. The liner notes say, in very small print, they worked from the 1987 remaster. No wonder the sound improvement is only slight."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE FAB FOUR DO IT AGAIN...","review":"If you are a fan of The Beatles, then you will love this CD. This is their fifth release, and it is filled with quite a number of excellent songs composed by that dynamic songwriting duo, Lennon/McCartney. There is even a nice little tune by George Harrison, \\"I Need You\\". There are only two non-Beatle compositions on this fourteen track CD.This CD showcases the versatility of the Fab Four. It also shows the musical evolvement of The Beatles. From the wonderful and offbeat \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away\\" to the lover's warning found in \\"You're Going To Lose that Girl\\", the listener is hooked. Follow it up with the rollicking \\"I've Just Seen A Face\\" and the beautiful ballad, \\"Yesterday\\", and you have a CD well worth having.While this CD still reflects some of the innocence and youthful exuberance of the early Beatles, it also has an overlay of newly acquired musical sophistication and maturity. It is a portent of things to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Return to Form...","review":"This album was a return to form after \\"Beatles for Sale.\\" It would be the last album by the band that contained a cover, although it only contained one, 'Dizzy Miss Lizzie.'Like \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" the album follows the Soundtrack and Non-Soundtrack Side formula. The first half of the album shines with some introspective songwriting from Lennon. 'Help' and 'You've Got To Hide Your Love Away' took him into a new stage of songwriting. This would be more completely manifested on \\"Rubber Soul.\\"The second half of the album also features first rate material such as 'Yesterday' and 'It's Only Love.' This would be their last album of somewhat innocent material though. Their drug period was now kicking into gear, and the songs would soon take on new meanings as they branched out into unprecednted subject matter. This is, in short, the last album of their early years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Brilliant Beatles Album!","review":"Help is another great album recorded by the Beatles. Few other artists had their rate of consistency. Songs like Help, The Night Before, Ticket To Ride, and Tell Me What You See are true true Rock songs. Act Naturally is almost country. You've Got To Hide Your Love Away, It's Only Love and I've Just Seen A Face are very much like folk songs. Yesterday and I Need You are classic ballads. No less essential than any of the other Beatles albums. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! The Beatles best to date as of the first 5 records.","review":"Truly a classic. This is were The Beatles started giving us those masterpieces. You can hardly call \\"Yesterday\\" not one. I love ever song here this album is flawless. This also begins their 2nd era. My favorites are \\"Another Girl\\",\\"The Night Before\\",and \\"Ticket to Ride\\". This is a must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cd!!","review":"The Beatles are by far the greatest group in the history of music. They never cease to amaze with their timeless music and their wonderful writing. Also, George Martin should be recognized for his great skills in directing them. If there's a band for the millennium, this is the one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of THE BEATLES","review":"In my opinion, this album, and not \\"Rubber Soul\\" was where the Beatles began to become more musicaly artistic. It still ends up being \\"pop\\", but with the lyrics of \\"Help!\\", and the simply exquisite \\"Hide Your Love Away\\" and \\"Yesterday\\", how could it be anything less than a milestone? \\"Ticket To Ride\\" took the \\"pop\\\\rock\\" sound in a slightly different turn, and even the really pop numbers like \\"Another Girl\\" are performed better than on previous albums, in my opinion. It's more than a soundtrack... believe me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell me what you see","review":"\\"Help!\\" is their best since \\"With the Beatles.\\" Like \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" it's pointed; also like that album, it's a little too thin. But this is more exciting than \\"A Hard Day's Night,\\" thanks to a couple good Harrison compositions, \\"Ticket to Ride,\\" and the most covered song in history, \\"Yesterday,\\" which is the best of these fourteen tracks. And then there's \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\\" an explosive finish which promises great things to come. It's even better now that we know they kept their promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Was My FIRST!","review":"They say you always remember your first, and I have to agree it's true. The Beatles album \\"HELP\\" was the first LP album I ever purchased. After seeing the Beatles live in 1964 Germany, even though I was only 10 years old, I loved them without question. My older sister took me to see the Beatles in 64 and she went with me when I bought my first Beatles albums \\"Meet The Beatles\\" and \\"Help\\" which I still cherish to this day. Although I don't play them anymore, and they're collectables now, These remastered CD's bring the old scratchy and poppy music tracks back to life in a way I can hardly believe. It's wonderful to hear these Beatles songs I love so much brought back to life in the crystal clear digital age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beatles don't need any help.","review":"Obviously, The Beatles need no help producing great album after great album.

This was their finale to the mop top world. if you listen to the music right you know its the start of THE REAL BEATLES. But this is great. It really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great early Beatles album","review":"The Beatles' music had been increasingly getting more interesting in 1965. Help is filled with catchy songs but is far different from any other early Beatles album. The last two tracks, \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\\" exhibit the band's full virtuosity. With \\"Yesterday,\\" they prove they can make music beautiful and use sorrowful lyrics. (They'd tried before, but never had made a song like \\"Yesterday\\"). On \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzy,\\" the Beatles stay true to their Chuck Berry/Little Richard-like roots and play a riff that will be stuck in your head for hours.As a whole, Help isn't that much different from A Hard Day's Night or Beatles for Sale, but it's the best example of the Beatles early pop stuff and a perfect album for Rubber Soul to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly great","review":"Only ONE George Harrison composition was released on any Beatles release prior to this album. Here he contributes two songs, \\"I need you\\" and \\"you like me too much\\", and they are arguably the weakest cuts on the record. George's songwriting talent would bloom starting with the next album, \\"Rubber Soul\\". Elsewhere on the album-- depending on your taste, the countryish \\"Act Naturally\\" may not be your cup of tea (it's almost a novelty recording) and the cover of \\"Dizzy Miss Lizzie\\" is one of their most listless 'rave ups' (despite it being the albums closer). That said, the remaining tracks contain some of the all-time gems in their body of recorded work-- particularly the title track, Paul's immortal \\"Yesterday\\", and the pounding single \\"Ticket to Ride\\". While not their most consistent release, this was another step forward in the evolution of rock music's greatest band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remixed, the original Parlophone LP is better","review":"I am only giving it 2 stars because this is the CD version I am reviewing. As an album it is 4 stars. The CD version is remixed, it sounds different than the LP. The LP is what the Beatles intended and several songs have variations, for example \\"The Night Before\\" has a louder keyboard on the LP and mixed down on the CD, and kind of muffled. Also \\"Help!\\" is different on the mono 45, the vocals are different. Until they rerelease the LP mix on CD, that remains the definitive version. The CD version is inferior. Try to get the LP if you can and notice the difference!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EVEN BETTER","review":"THIS IS STILL GREAT MUSIC. RE-MASTERED ENHANCES WHAT WAS ALREADY GREAT.

I've listened to all of their albums from Piper to the Division Bell and liked most of every one.That being said, this is the last album of theirs I decided to check out. Mostly because of Gilmour himself saying it is a horrible album(although he did say the same about Atom Heart Mother which is one of my favorites).A lot of it is mostly psychedelic noise. While I am a fan of psychedelic music it's just not done really well here. I'd say the only tracks on it worth listening to are Gilmour's part of it(The Narrow Way). I enjoyed that part but that's about it. I really do not understand why it is reviewed so highly here, it is not well done at all. It sounds as if they attempted an epic sound but failed miserably.Unless you're a big Pink Floyd fan I don't recommend getting this album. It has it's good parts, but it is just overall a poorly put together album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble","review":"Before you banish me to the ninth gate of hell for not liking this I can honestly say that PF is one of my favorite bands and I never thought I would be able to say a bad thing about them, yet when I heard Ummagumma I laughed out loud.

Don't buy it it is a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Screwed up packaging...","review":"I've had the LP of Ummagumma since its inception and, as others have stated, it is a psychedelic masterpiece. Being my album is worn out, I tried to purchase the CD from Amazon recently. However, upon receipt, I found that it contained two copies of the \\"studio\\" disk and no copy of the \\"live\\" disk. I reported it to Amazon and they rushed out a replacement promptly. Unfortunately, the replacement also had two studio disks. Since they felt that all their copies contained the same packaging snafu, they cancelled my order. Nuts. The best part of the album is the \\"live\\" side. Maybe someday they'll get it together and I can get what I ordered. Four and a half stars for the recording, one star for what I was sent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umma gunna be sick!","review":"This is an album in which its own creators admitted that they b***s***ed their way through recording.

You know how when you go into a modern art museum and look at something and think \\"my 3 year old could have done that\\"....except for Granchester Meadows most of the second disc falls in this category...random noise.

No offense to anyone who might enjoy it but it just doesn't measure up to Floyd's previous psychadelic works like PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN and A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS. Even David Gilmour himself described UMMAGUMMA as an experiment and he's right. Despite the poor studio album, the live album is OK. It adds to already goos works like ASTROMOMY DOMINE although there are only four songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most fascinating albums ever!","review":"Ummagumma is one of the most enchanting albums I have ever heard! It is indeed not a conventional album, it is not mainstream (which is why it will not appeal to many) - it is a unique artistic experiment whose ultimate end result is an unparalleled magical atmosphere. I find Ummagumma is an expression of the deeper, darker, more primitive areas of the human soul. It is an album enshrouded in darkness and mystery, in which chaos and confusion, anguish and fear, are occasionally quelled by glimpses of harmony, serenity, light, and hope (Sysyphus being a great example here). To me, it is an album that expresses a deep, indefinable, secret, ancient longing of the soul to break free from the bonds of oppressive darkness and confusion that surrounds it. It is an album best perceived with the soul and not simply heard with the ears; it is an album in which I feel one should look for states of the mind rather than for conventional music as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"OOOOPS!","review":"I meant to say, the live version of Saucerful of Secrets.

While the \\"Live\\" half features GREAT live performances of 3 classics from their first 2 albums and one really interesting b-side, \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene\\", the \\"Studio\\" half is extremely bizarre and is barely listenable at best. It contains instrumental pieces from Waters, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason. Some Lyrical content, but not much. Mostly a lot of really wierd noise making that makes me wonder if it's really even music.

Toland believes that Japan would have never started WWII if the U.S had made some concessions to it. Hoyt states that the Japanese Army, which controlled the Japaneses Government, wanted war unless all of Japan's demands were met by the U.S., which the U.S. never would have done.Hoyt's book, written in 1986 (after Toland's) and based upon his research into Official Japanese records is probably the more accurate of the two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a 100% japanese POV","review":"It's a wonderful book, nevertheless it bothered me that it didn't presented the japanese POV in some battles.

I know it's a secondary theater, but not even a few lines?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"In some respects Toland's \\"The Rising Sun\\" mirrors Shirer's \\"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.\\" The difference is Shirer's ability to weave history and storytelling in a seamless work of real brilliance. The Rising Sun is fascinating and comprehensive, but didn't pull me in like Rise and Fall. Some may not care if a writer of history is a good storyteller. But for myself, that ability brings history to life. It removes the written words from the blank page and creates powerful images focused on some of the most historically relevant events of the past. As good as Rising Sun is, the writing didn't grab me. It was well written and interesting, but not a work I would peg 5 stars on. But still an excellent work for anyone interested in the war in the Pacific."},{"rating":"2","title":"reveals new stuff","review":"Withholding one star because the book is so darn long.

A previous reviewer complained about the lack of primary sources in Japanese, but his complaints are--to put it bluntly--a load of bunk. One of the fascinating things about this book is that Toland sent his maunscript to many Japanese participants in WWII, and they checked it for accuracy and gave him their own comments. This allows for Toland to include actual dialog between Japanese participants in the war, which adds a lot of texture to his narrative. Most books available in English on WWII are told almost exclusively from the Allied point of view. This book gives the English-speaking reader a rare insight into how the Japanese particpants viewed the war, and the events leading up to it. This is a momentous achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat Disappointing. Not the Best Book on the Pacific War","review":"Another book is the much better book on the Pacific War and that better book isEagle Against the Sun: The American War With Japan, which has more recent information and a more balanced view.

A closer look when I received the item showed that on the bigger knife section, the edge of the knife is sitting on metal rods that are covered in rubber. In the one that I received the rubber did not completely covered some of the metal rods which left the blades of some of the bigger knifes exposed to the metal rods. I will still be concerned if the metal rods were completely covered with the rubber since with some use the rubber will wear out and the edge of the knife will be in contact with the metal rods which will deteriorate the edge of the knife.I will have to look for another tray to store my knifes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wusthof Knife Tray","review":"Although my Wusthof set of knives came with a knife-block, I wanted the ability to keep this fine set of cutlery in a drawer instead of on the counter top taking up my space. This tray fits the purpose to a \\"T\\". It easily holds my entire 11 piece set of knives plus the sharpening tool. The only piece it won't hold are the poltry scissors, which I just place in a tray next to it. It is not a big deal to me that the scissors won't fit. I was a little afraid that children could get ahold of the knives if left in the block. Being concealed in a drawer is \\"Out of sight, out of mind\\". The tray fit in a basic drawer and the knife blades are protected and secure. It was well worth getting.

The discription says \\"Oak\\", but the selection choice for ordering is either \\"Beechwood\\" or \\"Walnut\\" (higer priced) and the attached picture appears it is made of Beechwood. This unit is made in China and not sure what the species of wood is, but it is laminated with a lot (8) of knot defects in the wood. The indiivdual blocks that make up this organizer were out of alignment/crooked so that one of the large knife slots is unusable. Only 1 of the large knive slots was aligened with the end block.

It is informative, and offers the average person a real understanding of the phenomenon of suicide-- who's most likely to attempt and who to succeed, what their motivations are, how to prevent them, etc.The book is not without flaws, however: she repeats herself in a few places, and the organization isn't really good. In one or two places she actually contradicts herself, or fails to resolve conflicts between advocacy for the bereaved and the prevention waves of suicide.Overall, a reasonably good book that could have used a better editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me understand myself better when felling suicidal","review":"This is an excellent look at the despair and hopelessness one feels when suicide seems like the only option. I first read this at a time when I was feeling suicidal, and this is one of the few books of this type that can't be used as a \\"how-to\\" book. It helped me feel less alone; the more I read, the more I realized that Kay Jamison really understood what I was feeling (I, too, am manic-depressive). It also helped me look at my suicidal feelings in a more objective way.My only disappointment with the book is that it is not as long as it appears; nearly a third of the book is taken up by references and the index."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"I am currently a student of psychology.

Perhaps most of all she has helped to break down the division between knowing and caring. This book is a landmark in medical publishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get The Book Before It Is Too Late","review":"Unfortunately I was not made aware of this book until after my wife had committed suicide. This book should be read by everyone who has a loved one suffering from depression or manic-depressive illness. Ignore the statistics and concentrate on how you can help your loved one. If the statistics tell you anything, it is that not 100% of ill people commit suicide. I believe there can be positive results if you are aware of the danger signs and understand the deep, dark shadow that engulfs someone suffering from the mental illnesses.

While this book is not as fun to read as \\"An Unquiet Mind,\\" this book contains lots of data. It took me a while to slog through the book, but I put in lots of post-it notes marking information upon which I wanted to follow-up. I recommend this book for psychology students studying psychopathology and specific illnesses' links to suicide -- she references everything, and her research can help you get jump-started on document location."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved Me.","review":"I thought the author did a fantastic job writing this book. Feeling suicidal is the darkest feeling of pain that can invade your mind. I personally have experienced living with depression and suicidal thoughts from the time I was in elementary school up until my failed suicide attempt at 22. I purchased this book a couple months later, after I had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, because I wanted to have a better understanding of what and why this happens. It really did help me have a better understanding and help explain it to my family who at that time were still trying to heal from the attempt as well.I recommend this book to anyone to better understand suicide. It shouldn't be a subject that is just brushed aside because it's scary to think or talk about.This book has really impacted my life and I'm grateful that I found it.

Rarely have I read a book about experiences in India that combine such intelligence with such deep openness to the truth of spirituality in traditions not one's own.

Yet, this CD was my introduction to Kate Bush and I fell in love with her brilliance and originality. Particularly moving for me is CLOUDBUSTING, a song based on Wilhelm Reich sung from the perspective of his son...incredible stuff. If you have never heard Kate Bush please get one of her albums, especially HOUNDS OF LOVE. You'll fall in love with her too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant And Wonderful","review":"The womans voice is incredible and her songs are very different and mystical. My personal favourite is the completely haunting song 'Wuthering Heights' as it is delicate, the vocals are ethereal and the song stays in your head for a long time, its is a very beautiful song. Other highlights include 'Babooshka', 'The Dreaming', The Man With The Child In His Eyes', 'Wow' and 'Hounds Of Love'. Every song is enjoyable, a wonderful album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best they could do?","review":"A compilation album should be more than just the music, it should be a package that really represents the artist, like Kate's box set. This looks like it was assembled by one of those TV mail-order companies. Only two photos, bad typography, and it's hardly the whole story when several singles and moments from her career (pre-1986, when this was issued) aren't on this. No \\"Hammer Horror,\\" nothing from the Hammersmith concert or the \\"Stage\\" EP, no Christmas single, no \\"There Goes a Tenner,\\" and so on. This is product with profit as the sole motive."},{"rating":"2","title":"soprano or falsetto?","review":"The attractive strangeness of 'wuthering heights' is the reason for this purchase.

Kate Bush is a rarity in so many aspects of her art. If you can only afford one Kate Bush CD, I would recommend this one...although I think that THE KICK INSIDE is essential as well. She exudes talent, brilliance and her entire body moves with the same unique quality of her voice.BTW, I am often asked why Kate Bush fans dislike Tori Amos. We don't dislike Tori Amos, we're just tired of hearing her compared to Kate Bush---there is NO comparison---Kate is the \\"real thing\\". Buy this CD and \\"exchange the experience\\"--KBIn a Good Space,ari, Queen of Fatigue"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Story Here","review":"To begin with, a remix of 'Wuthering Heights' is put on this compilation instead of the original. The reason for that is clear as day - to mislead consumers into believing they are getting a better version of a song that simply put, doesn't need remixing! This compilation was quickly rushed out for the Xmas season as record companies did in the 80's. I doubt Kate had any input into it. Aside from that, the main hits are here, but I strongly suggest readers getting hold of 'The Kick Inside' which is her best album to date. It is like a greatest hits in itself. Magic, magic, magic !"},{"rating":"2","title":"There is only one KATE BUSH","review":"THE WHOLE STORY is a great introduction to the world of Kate Bush.

The album was received in good time and in excellent condition. A good way to buy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arty rock and pop","review":"The Whole Story covers all of Kate bush's most memorable songs from the 1970s and early 1980s although it is by no means the whole story of her career. It opens with the re-recorded version of her spooky and atmospheric 1978 hit Wuthering Heights. This version has greater depth than the original single and still remains a most remarkable song based as it is on the novel of the same name.Bush is a unique singer-songwriter with a gift for striking romantic imagery, although her work is not always immediately accessible. The Man With The Child In His Eyes is a complex and moving ballad, whilst Wow is a powerful atmospheric pop song.Her music can be quite idiosyncratic and full of oneiric imagery, like Breathing and The Dreaming. On the other hand, Babooshka is a buoyant pop song with a catchy tune. This compilation is charming and very enjoyable. Overall, Kate's music can be described as a form of art rock, not always appealing on first listen, but very rewarding if you persist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna see an Elf???","review":"Kate Bush is one of those that you only hear about in fairy tales, or imagine. She \\"can't be real\\", with her low profile in the commercial world of music, once you open Kate's door to another side, it's like Alice's double mirror. You will be mesmorized by intense almost painful beauty of KB's art, her real,yet well cushioned with wonder land imagination sound and lyrics, you can only fall in love and \\"never get out again.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the \\"Whole\\" Bush. It's been trimmed.","review":"Kate Bush is in desperate need of a newer collection. Since this was released in the vinyl era, it now should have more than 12 songs, and it's 25 years old! It really needs remastering, as I have to crank the stereo to hear it across the room. And of course it should include songs from her last couple albums.

I am totally upset and feel that my parents got ripped off big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a-ha deserves better","review":"This is a wonderful song marred by the inexplicable failures of the record company to be consistent with the admirable job they did on the full length release. The special version of the album, with the DVD, is an example of a record company fulfilling its obligation to the customers to give them lots of value for their money. This keeps people buying the physical product, as opposed to simply downloading everything.Why release a two song disc and charge thirteen bucks for it?Is it to capitalize on the craving for the song at the expense of the customer getting real value. A-ha deserves much better than this.Stick with the album (which is an amazing accomplishment of creativity) and only buy those \\"single discs\\" that give us plenty of music for our money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Gem! Celice Rocks old school. Alternative A-ha","review":"I would have given the review a 5, but The Paul Van Dyk remix IMO adds nothing to this song. When I listen to it, it seems like a very uninterested Paul Van Dyk forced a remix out. The version is a sub par with the original. Also its great that they added Celice Live to the Single, but Morten is just struggling to hit those notes live. Sounds like a mouse a bit tonewise and sounds like he is trying to remember the next word of the song.That being said the music sounds great!That doesn't diminish how great the recorded version of Celice is. In my mind one of their best songs ever! Love the feel of the song, reminiscent of Scoundrel Days without the synths. The Bonus song\\" Summers of our Youth\\" is a solid song. It is a duet between Magne and Morten. Typical great A-ha song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Music.....Wrong Product !","review":"I was so happy to FINALY get my CD from amazon when to my horror it was the wrong disc....

I played it once and then came back and played it about half an hour later. CELICE (radio cut) is a very good song. It rocks and retains a-ha's familiar melodious delivery. It sounds great and I indeed like it. a-ha is back! However, the Thomas Schumacher Remix is not a good fit with a-ha's sound. Also and somewhat more important I should note that this is NOT an Enhanced CD as advertised. I should give this 5 stars for CELICE (radio cut) but this is not the product I purchased as advertised. I am a little disappointed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish","review":"First lets start by saying I hate political correctness and everything it stands for. One part of PC is the gender war. Basically you can say anything derogatory about men. However, if you even say you don't agree with all this feminist propaganda you are branded a sexist and could lose your job. I bought this book hoping it would contain some insight into methods to combat such inequalities. What utter rubbish it was. Nothing about PC. It was written by some old bible bashing codger. It was nothing to do with male-female inequality, but rather if you were a good christian how this would save America. Sorry I don't like PC but this guy stepped out of the 1850s. He believes if women lived as the bible tells them to, then the whole place will be fine and dandy. Don't waste your money on this antiquated load of rubbish. I suggest you buy \\"The rantings of a single male\\" much more informative and relevant for today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Melodramatic","review":"Despite the prominence of Bette Davis and Shelley Winters on the video cover, Gary Merrill is actually the star of \\"Phone Call from a Stranger.\\" He plays a lawyer who visits the families of several people he met on a doomed flight. During these visits, he solves many of their problems and has an epiphany of his own. The movie has a terrific cast, including three Oscar winners (Davis, Winters, and Beatrice Straight). Unfortunately, the film is overly melodramatic, replete with swelling music and over-the-top breakdowns. Fans of Bette Davis also will likely be disappointed, as she has a small part (that really doesn't fit her well) and doesn't appear until near the end. She likely appeared in this film as a favor for her then-husband - Merrill. Overall, this film is a typical 50s melodrama: not terrible but entirely forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This One!","review":"This was a very BORING film. Bette Davis's picture shouldn't even be on the cover because she's in the film for about a minute in a half! Okay, maybe alittle longer than that but not by much! Don't waste precious time on this one when there are so many really good ones to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film, but beware!","review":"As the sole survivor of a plane crash, Gary Merrill becomes dedicated to tying up all of the loose ends of his friends who died in the crash. While mending the lives of others, he discovers a way to mend his own.The problem I had with this film is that I really expected it to be a Bette Davis picture. I was very disappointed to find that after waiting for over half the movie, Bette's part was only a cameo. She gives a great performance in the film, and her sad saga could break your heart, but it wasn't what I had expected.However, when I reevaluated this film, I actually quite enjoyed it. Shelley Winters is quite comical, and Gary Merrill is all man. The plot is original, and the stories of the passengers aboard the doomed flight range from hilarious to tear-jerking. It's at least worth a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cast","review":"I know Bette Davis was only in a small part of this movie but she was in it and that was all I needed to like the movie. And it is a good movie with a good cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Lalande, De La lande,","review":"This recording would have got another star if it was more complete instead of short dance pieces.

Another great companion album would be his Music for the royal super performed by Hugo Rene."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"Please, do not waste your money on this DVD!

Sometimes it was nearly impossible to discern the difference between the two brightest settings, neither bright enough to read from. Would only consider again if I needed a low wattage bulb for a timer, but since it only lasted a few weeks, I consider it to be unreliable even for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money on this poorly engineered product","review":"I invested in this bulb to reduce our home energy usage, but we had the same experience as other reviewers - *very* short life. We did not try to use a dimmer with this bulb and the lamp this bulb was installed in does not restrict air flow, but the bulb only lasted a few months. It was a complete waste of money.Don't be fooled into thinking this bulb will save you money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"50% failure rate","review":"I purchased two of them, and have experienced the same problems as other reviewers - the base is too wide to fix into existing 3-way fixtures that accept std. 3-way bulbs in many cases (check your lamp before purchasing; if there is not plenty of clearance, don't purchase), and second, and more important, one of the bulbs lasted only a week (a 50% failure rate). The filament would glow, but not light, the bulb; then finally the filament would not glow either.The bulbs are WAY too expensive for such short life, but too inexpensive to really justify sending back for warranty (esp. if I have to cover postage) - keep your receipt and be ready for warranty problems. Because of the wide base (who designed this thing? Won't fit in a std 3-way lamp), and the hit or miss product reliability and quality, I'd recommend trying another manufacturer first (not Sylvania). I don't have problems with Sylvania's other products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short lifespan","review":"All the CFLs I've tried have had a lifespan no longer than, and sometimes shorter than, an equivalent incandescant bulb. That's particularly true of this Sylvania 3-way bulb which had a lifespan of about a year. I'm definitely not buying any more 3-way CFLs, and am considering going back to standard light bulbs across the board. They are just not living up to the promise of longer life, which is particularly a problem since they have to be recycled as hazardous waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% failure (two out of two)","review":"I really liked these bulbs--while they lasted. We probably owned them for about a year before both bulbs failed. And they were in bedside lamps, so we only used them an hour or two per day.The first one has been flickering for months at the highest setting. And recently, the second one just quit: We turned it off at night, and the next morning it wouldn't turn on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a GREEN light bulb.","review":"Don't buy this one. It'll cost you over $10 and last you a few months. Not a GREEN solution if you ask me. Buy a standard 3-way bulb - it'll save you money and you'll have less impact on the environment by not throwing as many away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short life","review":"Like most of my experience so far with florescent lamp bulbs, the life span is too short to make up the extra cost compared to an incandescent bulb. This one lasted a few months, but but more importantly, I received a small fraction of its' advertised hours of life (6000) -- I got about 400 before it died. I read somewhere that you get better life out of fluorescent lamp bulbs if they are not cycled frequently, and let run longer (e.g. not good for a quick bathroom break), but this particular lamp was cycle maybe 2 times per day, and usually left on for 1 hour minumum.I'll continue to buy these types of bulbs, mainly for the reduced heat, but I won't be buying this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Way compact lights don't fit inside standard harps","review":"I bought a Sylvania 3-way 30-70-100 bulb, and the light is great. However it will not fit into a single table or floor lamp in my house - the base is too wide to close the harp. In the case of one of the table lamps the harp is too low - but that's fixable by getting a taller harp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razorback Jersey set","review":"The quality of the set is very good.

Remember, this album was released right in the middle of the hysteria that was Beatlemania, when the press already wrote them off as the latest bubble gum pop sensation whose bubble was ready to burst at any given second.The movie itself was a spoof of what they went through in those days complete with their characteristic charm and witty asides.

The result is more pointed than \\"With the Beatles,\\" which is good, but less exciting than that album or its predecessor. Most exciting are the hits: the title track and \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Rock Album","review":"This album by the Beatles represents a pinnacle of success of that period of rock and roll. It may not have the creativity and innovative style of some of the later albums, but as plain old rock and roll it's hard to beat this album. It kicks from the very beginning and is just filled with great chords and rock songs. \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" is of course a favorite among many, myself included, but that is one of many great songs on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good progression from the last 2 albums.","review":"This album, instead of having 8 songs and 6 covers, has all originals. There is a definite progression on Hard Day's Night than on the other 2 albums. John's singing is a lot better. And George's 12 string sounds great. I recently saw a picture of his 12 string that he used on \\"Hard Day's Night,\\" and it's still in great condition. The best tunes are the title track, \\"And I Love Her,\\" \\"I'll Cry Instead,\\" and \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\" No bad songs on this album, so im giving it a 5 out of 5. Brilliant songs with brilliant hooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the tight box?","review":"Music is (as always) great!

Released as a soundtrack to their first movie at the height of Beatlemania, it was also the first Beatles album to feature *only* Lennon/McCartney originals and no covers. (How many other rock musicians released albums of only original material in 1964? Bob Dylan is the only other one I can think of.) None of the 13 originals are filler. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"And I Love Her\\" are the best known, but many of these songs are among their strongest. \\"I Should Have Known Better\\", \\"If I Fell\\" (beautiful three-part harmonies), \\"Any Time at All\\" and \\"You Can't Do That\\" are personal favorites. Like other early Beatles songs, love is the main theme of the lyrics -- but there's a growing sophistication and emotional depth on songs like \\"I'll Be Back\\". If you're a Beatles fan, A Hard Day's Night is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the original soundtrack!","review":"this is not the original soundtrack from the movie a hard day's night. there are 4 instrumental songs that george martin conducted on the soundtrack. #1, i should have known better #2, and i love her #3, ringo's theme (this boy) #4, a hard day's night. why weren't they on the soundtrack beats me. he did a awsome job on these 4 songs. how i know is that i have 2 vinyl soundtracks from the movie when it came out & the cd soundtrack by united artists (cd cost me over $40.00 dollars - import from japan). so double check your purchases and see if these 4 songs are on the soundtrack. take care!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Yeah Yeah becomes Yes Yes Yes","review":"For all the cynics that swore they were flukes here they give the world the Beatlemania Bible.

My only regret as a kid was that we were stuck with the United Artists album with 7 songs and soundtrack filler.

It caused quite a stir at the time because they were just reaching the height of Beatlemania and the albums was packed with great tunes. I love the moody Things We Said Today best, but the Title Track is followed by I Should Have Know Better, If I Fell, I'm Happy Just to Dance With You, Can't Buy Me Love, Any Time At All, I'LL Cry Instead, When I Get Home, You Can't Do That and I'll Be Back. Enough said? WOW!This was the Beatles when the \\"fun\\" was still in the fav four, when the business was still all play and happiness and the songs reflect that.

The Beatles catalog is abundant with songs that achieve a good feeling on many diferent levels. From the cerebral to the insane. However, A hard days night leaves little to think about. Just enjoy ! This is probably the happiest album i have ever heard ! The boys seem really in sync and enjoying things. \\"If I fell\\" is brilliant, a supreme sing-a-long song. In fact the whole album is one big sing-a-along. The closing track \\"I'll be back\\" shows signs of the accoustic Rubber Soul days to come. \\"Things we said today\\" has always been the sleeper hit of the album for me. It shows stunning songwriting maturity for the time. I love \\"Tell me why\\" not to mention the masterpieces \\"Can't buy me love\\" \\"I should of known better\\" and the tittle track. If you do not feel good after a run through this joyous piece, then sign up for extra therapy sessions !"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"This is such a great album. The releases in the states covered at least 3 lps so it's wonderful to have them here all together as they should be. The songs sound so effortless that it is astounding. These aren't simple ditties, either. If you listen to the chord structuring you soon realize that these guys were so far ahead of the pack of pop songwriters at that time it was ridiculous. One thing really struck me, though. Their extensive use of acoustic guitar on almost half of the songs was the beginning of a trend that would soon lead them to \\"Rubber Soul\\" and beyond. This cd is a joy to listen to any time anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best early Beatles recording","review":"Beatlemania was in full throttle when this was released and the Beatles had never sounded better. The tunes are wonderfully memorable and give a hint at the even greater things on the horizon for Lennon and McCartney as composers.

Deservedly a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT ALBUM!!","review":"I can't believe some people have given this album a bad review!

A Hard Days Night is a fun song to listen to. As usual, its nothing really great but its fun. I Should Have Known Better gets on my nerves tremendously, but then, so does the majority of their music. Actually, theres really not much to say about this album. I agree with the reviews that said it sounds the same so theres really no use for me to talk about each song. All in all, its a pretty dull album and if you want to hear good music from the early sixties then listen to the Stones instead.At least their early stuff was always Interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie, worse music","review":"This is bad.

Otherwise, its a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time.","review":"This is an incredible album. Listen to it in your CD player right between Beck's Mutations and Olivia Tremor Control's Dusk At Cubist Castle. \\"Piper\\" fits right in. Syd Barrett and his bandmates created a certified masterpiece, decades before its time. In my opinion, you really can't compare this album to Dark Side, Wish You Were Here and The Wall. This record is goofy, hilariously trippy. Yet a real childish innocence flows throughout the whole record.But what makes the listening experience really disturbing and freaky is the knowledge that \\"Piper\\" is truly a portrait of the artist slowly going insane. It was a theme that haunted Pink Floyd's work throughout the rest of its career."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different","review":"In this album Pink fFloyd broke down some of the barriers of music. The album is so very different than probably anything you've heard before. They weren't afraid to take chances and use instraments to create sounds unlike anything that had been heard before. Under the guidance of Syd Barret, this album gives you a glimpse into the mind of someone with a very different mind than most. songs like flaming and bike give a sort of playful yet insane feeling. But the bottom line is if you've never heard this album before it won't be anything like what you expected to hear. almost nothing like the Pink floyd we know now. but that's not a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SUPREME FLOYDIAN DEBUT","review":"THIS WAS VERY MUCHAN UNDERRATED DEBUT FROM FLOYD WITH SYD BARRET AND WATERS CONTAINING GREAT SONGS LIKE ASTRONOMY DOMINE,INTERSTELLAR OVERDRIVE.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ALONG WITH THEIR ENTIRE CATALOG."},{"rating":"2","title":"Syd was great","review":"Sloppy psychedelic jams meld with Syd Barret's innocent songs to create an interesting brew. \\"Bike\\" is the best Pink Floyd song of all time, old or new. I love the way it is edited together. Syd was a tragic genius, after whom Pink Floyd went in a different, watered-down, more commercial - yes, commercial - direction. Shadowy apprentice Waters contributes the song with the worst title I've ever seen, \\"Pow.R.To.C.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An inscrutable masterpiece","review":"An inscrutable masterpiece of sound, images, and texture. Its wit and scope makes later Pink Floyd albums (as good as some of them are) seem labored and contrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floyd's Greatest Moment","review":"Piper at the Gates of Dawn is the greatest album of all time (along with Zeppelin I, which is of a very different flavor). What makes Piper so unique is the way the music actually is a story in itself, supported by Syd's imaginative lyrics. One good example is in \\"Flaming\\", when Syd says \\"Ever so high....\\", the music actually ascends, the vocals signaling the rising action of the instruments. Another singularly brilliant aspect of the album are the dreamy psychedelic codas at the end of many of the songs. For those of you who don't know, Syd named this album after a chapter in Kenneth Grahame's story, The Wind in the Willows. It is a brilliant chapter, and offers some insight into the feelings that may have inspired Syd's music. Listen to the album a few times, read the chapter, and listen to it again. If you don't have the book, just search for the chapter on google. It's there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dammit, I love Pink Floyd, but...","review":"I found this album very dissapointing. It pains me terribly deeply, but the whimsical tunes in this album just dont seem floydian. The floyd I love has a sound that just runs through you. I'm not even really conscious of the songs on other albums, they just fit and become the natural noise. I like Syd Barrets guitar ok, but I hate to say (No, I don't), Gilmour puts something in to Pink Floyd thats just not there I'm sorry, Stone me if you like, I just don't dig on the Monkies all too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syd isn't Pink Floyd","review":"This album, although it has some nice songs, like Astronomy Domine, is an experiment. A failed one. I really love Floyd, but you cannot compare creations like Cymbaline, Wish you were here, Echoes, or Shine on, with this album, now really ridiculous. If you want predarkside Floyd, just buy Meddle or AHM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quite Pink","review":"I am a huge fan of the Floyd, they're my favorite band, but I had trouble dealing with Syd. I found his lyrics to be odd and tedious and lacking meaning. The album had no flow, the songs didn't blend, it had no direction. I actually found myself waiting for the album to end. Syd's singing lacks melody and his guitar playing is no match for Gilmours. This album was a valuable stepping stone, but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Pink Floyd you're used to...","review":"Warning!Just because you like \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall\\", there's no guarantee that you'll find this album listenable, let alone enjoy it.This is an \\"Amazon Essential\\" album, and, although it's important in the Pink Floyd scheme of things, for many people (myself included), it's more of a historical note than a favorite work.If you're looking to expand your Floyd collection, make sure you've picked up Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall before going any further.If you're looking for an undiscovered Floyd classic, pick up \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay debut album","review":"This is not the album that made Pink Floyd famous 4 making a history of rock & art. This is good 4 a debut album 2 a new group, but what came from Obscured by Clouds and Meddle is important! I am the fan of their Meddle-The Wall period, and don't really like their work before and after, but this is me. This album is different from Animals, it is nothing 2 do with Wish U were here, this album is not similar 2 Dark Side or The Wall. This album is like Relics, A saucerful of secrets and Ummagumma. If U like these, buy it. If U R a fan of the Wish U were-era, beware of it, U will never like it as much as some people do.

After him it was a different band. This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite albums. Yes, it's very psychedelic, but I think it is totally unique and defies any attempt to categorize. There simply isn't another album like it.Check this out, then seek out the other Syd-era Floyd on albums like \\"Relics\\", plus a couple of songs - \\"Scream thy Last Scream\\", \\"Vegetable Man\\" - never officially released, but which are great. Then check out his solo albums. Unfortunately there simply isn't a lot of material out there. Beware of endless attempts to repackage the same stuff over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink floyds sydsational debut","review":"Piper at the gates of dawn is a good debut disc.

Toc H.\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which doesn't have lyrics) are lyrically weird. I like the lyrics so much! This album has best lyrics than any other PF album has. Of course there's melodies and riffs I cannot stand: Scarecrow is the worst. It is just clapping and lousy singing...it shouldn't be here. And just when you thought that you have passed the strangest moments...there's bike...a \\"romantic\\" song...\\"You're the kinda girl...I'll give you...everything...if you want things...\\".

This CD pulls the borders of reality to lengths unknown unless one experiences the sound of \\"interstallar overdrive.\\" Unfortunately, the CD's creator, Syd Barrett, never returned back to earth to make a follow-up. In this sense, don't expect typical Floyd here. May be too much to experience for some people, but it does rock out a bit.

If you seek this out expecting a more trippy version of Dark Side of the Moon, you'll be disappointed. Listen to it while you're as high as Syd Barrett no doubt was when he wrote much of it and you'll have nightmares. Listen to it expecting a linear musical theme and you'll shut it off after 4 minutes, wishing you could get that time back. Whatever you think of it upon first listen will be different than the next. Piper asks much of its listener and probably wasn't intended to be taken in all in one sitting. All in all it doesn't feel unified enough to qualify as a great album, as much as it is a forgotten musical phenomenon. It does serve as a precursor to early Bowie, Lou Reed (whose own Velvet Underground simultaneously touched on similar themes) and Sonic Youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd, \\"The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn\\", 1967","review":"Relesed in August of 1967 this would be the first and last album feautring Syd Barrett before he got too crazed on LSD.

Something about the long periods of free form jamming. Something about the fairytale psychadelic lyrics. JUST BUY IT!!!

All the songs are written by Syd Barret accept Take up Thy Stethescope and Walk, which was written by Roger Waters.

After this, Barrett left, whether or not he then descended into mental illness, or simply wanted nothing to do with the rawk lifestyle, is now questioned. Anyway, it left the Floyd another ho-hum, boring stadium band like a couple of dozen other boring stadium bands.In fact, post-Barrett Floyd have a lot to answer for, they provided the template for the stultifying, living death of U2, and the band now having their Warholian 15 minutes, Coldplay. Long guitar solos which sound difficult to non-musicians, tedious and ponderous faux profundity, and of course , subsequent massive commercial success, because their albums are bought in huge numbers by the culturally challenged.Barrett WAS their creative talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to say that I don't get it","review":"I respect everyone's opinion in here, and I've tried so hard to love this album because I love Pink Floyd and I see how everyone calls it a classic.

I see 2 very different Pink Floyds and I have to say I never got into Syd's style. Matilda this, Lucifer that. The Gnome? come on. Astromony Domine was a classic but the rest of the album is a tough listen I'm sorry to say. I'm sure you'll say a true Floyd fan would love this album, well maybe that's true. But for me, when Waters and Gilmour were together, that is the true Floyd IMO. And their reign started with Meddle and ended with the Wall. A brilliant 6 album run (Meddle, OBC, DSOTM, WYWH, Animals, The Wall). For serious collectors, this is a must have and I'll give it 2 stars, but stay away if you expect another 'Wish you were here' purchase, pre-Gilmour can be a tough listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is horrible.

Better than almost any other over ground music from that era or culture or whatever you want to call it. Really captures the essence of the aesthetic. A way under rated disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the biggest piece of trash I have ever heard","review":"I realize people have to start somewhere, but this is definitely a bad way to start. Just because it has the name \\"Pink Floyd\\" on it does not mean it is any good. They use sound effects, not instruments. The effect is one that resembles a kid getting a hold of some noisemakers and his fathers tape recorder. The music that is featured on the album sounds like early Who.

So yeah, pass the granola and don your fruit stripe sarong, but I just gotta tell ya, if you're smoking anything through a pipe as morning is about to break like a rotten egg all over the sky, it's probably crack. What is this otherwise? Gut instinct tells me it's a concept album about a satanic astrophysician who collects wind-up chimes while journeying to the land at the bottom of the Sun with a wild pack of gnomes strapped to his back.

But one listen to this album and you'll realize that 'THE EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES' We've been told so many times that the Syd Barret Pink Floyd period is 'pure genius' that we almost start to believe it without ever listening to a single note of the music made with him. I'm sorry Floydians, but I don't get it. Just because is hasn't been done before does'nt make it good. These songs would have drove me nuts too if I had to rehearse them over and over.

An amazing Accomplishment by Pink Floyd, with the original cast: Syd Barret, Roger Waters, Rick Wright, and Nick Mason. These are almost as good as Dark Side Of The Moon, except No Dave Gilmour, No Hammond Organ but a Farfisa Organ, No Synthesizer, and Nick Mason doesn't sound mellow. Featuring 11 songs:some with themes from 'The Wind In The Willows': The Gnome, Chapter 24, Scarecrowsome with lengthy instumental passages: Astronomy Domine, Take Up Thy Stethescope and Walk, Interstellar Overdrive, Pow R.

Yes, it is very influenced by Syd Barrett, but without Barrett, Pink Floyd never would have become as great as they did. Of course, Pink Floyd couldn't have continued beyond 1968 with Syd either. All the songs are pretty catchy. The standouts are Astronomy Domine, Flaming, and Interstellar Overdrive. I personally like all the songs on this album though. One thing about Pink Floyd that is interesting, is the evolution of the band, from the Syd Barrett era (66-67), to the more experimental period (68-72), then to the Roger Waters controlled era (72-83), to the David Gilmour controlled era. I'm one of many who also prove you don't have to be on drugs to enjoy early Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Sid's Something I Can't Explain!","review":"Originally released in 1967, this is far and away my favorite Floyd CD... bar none!! \\"Take another if you wish, they're on the dish\\"! It's unfortunate that we can't, because Syd Barrett, The Crazy Diamond, unraveled mentally after the making of this disc... \\"He's getting rather old, but he's a good Sid\\"!! Who knows how many other musical gems he may have gone on to create? I always wondered who could possibly be \\"the kind of girl who fits into [Sid's] world\\"???!!! Yikes!! He's also a very polite fellow! (\\"Pass the butter please\\"). It's also too bad that \\"Arnold Layne\\" was not included as a bonus track here, but regardless, \\"Piper\\" is still the premiere great musical experiment of all-time, and still as eccentric as ever... even after 30+ years! Forget \\"Dark Side\\", forget \\"Wish You Were Here\\", forget \\"Meddle\\", forget everything! There is absolutely NOTHING like this CD, so \\"Re-al-ize!

Bo-ring!\\"Lucifer Sam,\\" \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope And Walk,\\" \\"Flaming,\\" and \\"Scarecrow\\" are the best songs. Rick and Syd sing good. (Roger is credited as singing on it, but I don't hear him!)Pity S. B. went nuts thanks to LSD. Heard he got it back together. Hope so. God bless ya Syd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mono Mix Superior in Nearly Every Way","review":"Here's the minor bit of bad news, first:A bar was cut out of the upbeat \\"Flaming\\" -- you know, that very nice key twist over the ending -- but the overall song still works.Also, a clumsy bit of organ is bumping around the intro to \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\". And that's all the complaints I have!Otherwise, I suspect you'll find this mix a bit \\"jucier\\", a bit more guitar-ish, overall more pleasing! By all means, one should own the standard stereo release, but this import is definitely worth obtaining, even in used condition at a significant price. If I'm not mistaken, it's also the only mix Syd, Rog, Rick and Nick participated in. And, admit it, you always felt those ham-fisted panning effects in the stereo version were a bit silly, didn't you?The whole point is to pretend it's an acid-glistening, London-swinging 1967, isn't it? Well, it was all mono back then, so let's get with the program!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"If only Syd Barrett hadn't left Pink Floyd! Imho, their later, highly-acclaimed stuff like Dark Side and The Wall is mediocre at best, and doesn't have the tension that keeps this album alive. Although I wish the CD still had \\"See Emily Play\\" and placed \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" at the end like the American-release record, the addition of \\"Flaming\\", \\"Bike\\", and \\"Astronomy Domine\\" certainly makes up for the loss. True, some of the music here is flawed, but it's always interesting. The album will grow on you, and it's a must for anyone interested in experimental British psychedelia--but don't buy it if you're a fan of 70's Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my God!","review":"The first time i heard this album, i was blown away.

I guess you have to be on acid to love it. Listening to Sgt. Pepper's or Blonde on Blonde or A Love Supreme and then putting this on is painful.

Roger Wins Again!","review":"\\"Piper\\" is neither a Floyd of Syd masterpiece (as he never made any of those.) There is precious little of the stunning aural bravaura that would their sound (until \\"dark Side,\\" anyway)Instead what we get here is all the \\"British whimsy\\" that Syd Barrett is famous for. The first four tunes are pretty good (except for \\"Astronomy\\" which is mostly instrumental and not the best example of a \\"great\\" songwriter) But then, after the lumbering \\"Powr Toch\\" (chilling evidence that Syd and Roger could've been the \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" of swinging London) something bizarre happens; Waters weighs in with \\"Take Up Thy Stehescope and Walk,\\" which has a cool, jaunty melody, complete with profound lyrics such as \\"Gold is led/ Jesus bled etc...\\" and topped off with a booty shaking goove that would do any late sixties spy proud. The Floyd's aggressive bassman wins again; easily the best tune on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Waters-era Floyd, \\"Piper\\" is poorly-aged psychedelia","review":"What else can I add to the title? Don't buy this expecting a taste of Floyd's later visionary works. Piper strangely reminds me of The Kinks' \\"Village Green Preservation Society,\\" another album that probably sounded fine in its time, but now leaves kitsch dripping from your speakers. Some of the songs wouldn't sound out of place on a late 60's parody record. (See: \\"The Gnome.)For clarity's sake, I think we should stop referring to Pink Floyd as a single band, and instead refer to them as Synk Flarrett, & Royd Pinkers.

I know Sid Barret is a talented artist and has all the allure of the tragic rock star but the music presented here is just not all that great. I don't know, maybe its just because I really don't have much tolerance for quirky pyschedelia, but I just find this album to be trite and unexciting. I honestly would give this album only one star if it wasn't for the two instrumental pieces, \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\" These tunes are the only ones that seem to hint at what the Floyd was truly capable of, spacey soundscapes and jazz like interplay.As for the rest of the album it is severly dated. The songs are cheesy and silly much like the low points on classic Beatles or Cream albums. i.e. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" from Abbey Road or \\"Blue Condition\\" from Disarelli Gears.

Obscured by the Clouds, Meddle, I'd even try Atom Heart Mother for early Floyd. (Or before Darkside of the Moon Floyd). My problen with Pink Floyd is that a great number of their fans call their music \\"amazingly psychedelic\\" or \\"trippy\\" but cannot experience the music without tripping themselves. These are the fans that go to concerts to get wasted instead of going for the music. These are also the fans who would call Piper a musical masterpiece. Have any of you ever listened to that album or songs like \\"Paint Box\\" and \\"Bike\\" without being wasted? Funny how they really sound with a sober ear. And as far as guitar playing is concerned, Syd Barret is no David Gilmour.

That's a pity.LYRICS: good, but when I say I listen to music, that means that I listen to music. I don't care very much to the lyrics. Psychedelic, crappy. Abstract does not mean quality.VOCALS: Gilmour's voice sounds much better. Mr. Barrett is not a competent vocalist. That's doubtless.Honestly, I never liked this album.

The instrumentals on here (\\"Pow R. Toc H.\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\") are the best I've ever heard. And the rest, particularly \\"Astronomy Domine\\" are incredible. There is truly not a weak song on here--not even a weak moment. Syd Barrett (and Roger Waters for \\"Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk\\") write probably the best collection of songs ever compiled. It has a drive and energy unparalleled, yet knows how to be quite amusing when it needs to be. I'd tend to say that this is better than my previous favorite \\"Sgt.

The larger purpose of why the curator goes into the Underhive doesn't appear until the very end -- and is absolutely at odds with why HE thinks he's going...which smacks of the author not being able to wrap things up neatly. I can appreciate plots that come to a halt abruptly - this is best done in the Mad Donna book 'survival instinct' - but spending all those pages on subplots that are little more than atmospherics detracts from the main storyline. The book is not served by lengthy descriptions of life as an Escher or Goliath ganger...these just muddy the waters.

I think I have never seen so much misinformation in a book before. This book doesn't really get into too much technical aspects of the RX-7, and yet it is able to get many things wrong. I got so disgusted reading it that I returned the book.I was hoping for an updated version of another really good book: How to Modify Your Mazda RX-7, by Dave Emanual and Jim Downing, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The Emanual book was from the 1980s, and is unfortunately out of print. Try to track one down if you are really interested in the rotary engines and the RX-7s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"Just received my copy of the book, and it was well worth the wait.

Frankincense was used for centuries as incense in a variety of sacred settings. Both were gifted to baby Jesus, both were worth a year's wages in their time of glory, and both still produce a fragrance fit for royalty. All Zum has done is place those oils together with a lovely carrier oil (Jojoba, also known for it's incredible beneficial properties for human skin), a touch of phtalate free fragrance oil, and put them in a convenient roller bottle.

Certainly, this album is a swindle, and its sales must make Malcolm (their manager) laugh all the way to the bank. A few unreleased Sex Pistols songs, a few weak tunes by other members, and some Malcom produced crap make this a forgettable CD. Sure there are some funny songs here. So what? There are lots of funny songs around. These aren't particularly witty by any means. Seriously, the Sex Pistols were a good band, then and now, highly overrated. Pick up their first CD and that's all you need. Or better yet, by something by the Clash, Ramones, Buzzcocks, Dead Kennedys, or The Damned. Hear real punk music that wasn't \\"Svengalied\\" into existence.

The song's humour get old fast but so does any humour really. There are still a few good solid songs though like \\"Belson was a gas\\" and \\"I'm not your stepping stone\\". I really enjoyed \\"my way\\" sung by Sid Vicious, when I hear the line I lived a full life, I get coked up inside. I would have like more rotten though. All in all a great album but for anyone who doesn't already love the sex pistols but for anyone else get never mind the bollocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cash from chaos? Perhaps... but the music's good!","review":"Just one question: how could any self-respecting Pistols fan NOT enjoy this album? After hearing their awesome version of \\"(I'm Not Your) Stepping Stone\\", along with songs such as \\"Don't Give Me No Lip Child\\" and \\"Substitute\\", this album went down as one of my favorites. Sure, \\"Friggin' In The Riggin'\\" and Sid's infamous rendition of \\"My Way\\" (which, may I add, can't be fully appreciated until you see the movie) are a bit on the silly side, but hey, music isn't always about being serious. My only complaint? Tenpole Tudor should've never been handed a microphone! Yikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title defines the album: It's a swindle!","review":"The film was not more than \\"interesting\\", and the album worths for 2 or 3 classic songs + some jokes like \\"Who killed Bambi?\\" and the french/disco versions of \\"Anarchy in the UK\\", which certainly won't make you laugh when you hear for the 20th time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all","review":"The Sex Pistols should only be remembered for their excellent debut album 'Never Mind the Bollocks'. This follow up album is quite simply dire and shows clearly the limitations of the band. 'Friggin in the riggin' was worth making and 'Silly thing' would have been good if they could have found some one better than Paul Cook to sing it. The French version of 'Anarchy' is quite amusing. But overall this is just a commercial rip-off from a band that had entirely run out of ideas. Even at their height the Sex Pistols were never as good as the Clash, Stiff Little Fingers or the Stranglers but this second album should never have been recorded. If you like punk don't bother with this pile of garbage..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swindle indeed","review":"The cover of \\"(I'm not your) Stepping Stone\\" is one of my favorite cover songs by anyone. I haven't listened to anything else on the album for several years.If you like Sid singing \\"My Way\\", then, fine, buy it for that, too. I don't care for it. The addition of Sid to the band wasn't a good thing as far as I'm concerned.The cover of \\"Roadrunner\\" is the second best song on the album, but you are better served by getting the Modern Lovers original."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Books Out There","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

Sadly, that's not the case here. This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining, guaranteed. Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices, water, etc) is just not a sensible approach.Also, the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money, and they use a LOT of it. With the same sweetness as country time lemonade, Similac Organic's sucrose-based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes.

If at all possible, you should be breastfeeding. (I know it's not always easy or convenient.) If you can't then in my opinion the best formula is Earth's Best and even that is disappointing. Basically, they dry cow's milk and remove all the natural nutrients then \\"fortify\\" with synthetic vitamins/minerals. Pathetic. Just buy whole organic milk, raw if possible. There are recipes online to make it closer to human breast milk. Sorry to be so matter of fact. I'm losing patience for all these evil corporations capitalizing on the \\"green\\" movement.

However, by alternating every other feeding with regular (non-organic) formula the problem was resolved. I'm a believer that some organic is better than no organic.

Didn't like her at all & Cosmo lost his \\"Seal-ness\\" somewhere along the way. Not a re-read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't pay hardcover price","review":"I LOVE Suzanne Brockmann's writing. If she were any other author, I'd give it 1 star. This one just didn't do it for me. I didn't like the heroine Jane (who seemed irritating & immature) and I didn't care about Cosmo (i guess the character development was lacking). I couldn't identify with the gay FBI agent and the intern chasing the in-the-closet actor storyline was a flat out bore. I read romance for escape - one of the last things I want to do is escape into a homosexual love story. I never finished her last book (an extremely disappointing read - the one abt the CIA agents). I don't know if i'm going to finish this one. I certainly hope Max & Gina's story doesn't follow this pattern of poorly developed characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"After being obsessed with the other Brockmann books, this was such a letdown. None of the main characters were likable, let alone sexy. Cosmo went from a big, tough mystery in previous books to a show tune singing, big ball of insecurities. Jane's trash talk during what should have been sexy scenes, made the scenes unbearable. I liked Jules as a support character in the previous books, but I don't want to read about homosexual relationships. If I did, I would pick a different genre of books to read. I anxiously await the stories about Max and Gina and Decker and Sofia. Get to the good stuff Suzanne!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted","review":"If I wanted a book about gay lovers I would have picked a book about them. I was into the series and enjoyed reading Suzanne Brockmanns books but did not appreciate the introduction of gay relationship aspect of the story. I loved Jane and Cosmo and the story that involved their relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.......Again","review":"Ms. Brockmann's last two books don't begin to compare with her earlier works. This was supposed to be Cosmo's book, but the lack of character development and the fluff plot revolving around Cosmo and Jane Chadwick made the book easy to put down. Cosmo, always mysterious in prior books, is just too perfect to be believable and Jane falls back on the old cliche of using her sex appeal to obtain success.Jules, a favorite character of mine, steals the book, but I fail to believe an intelligent, experienced FBI agent would put up with the behavior of either of his potential love interests, Adam or Robin.Sad to say, Ms. Brockmann is no longer an automatic buy for me. I'll be happy to wait for the local library to stock her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"She does it again!","review":"Suzanne Brockmann writes another wonderful novel. I throughly enjoyed this novel and the storyline between the main characters Cosmo and Jane, as well as Robin and Jules. Ms. Brockmann does a wonderful job tugging at your heart!The only reason why I gave her four stars was because there were way too many character stories. There was simply too much to full grasp one or two of the stories. There were parts of the book where I would have to skim because I was getting frustrated with the amount of characters.I think, however, she did a great job introducing a gay couple into the romance genre and everyone should read this book!I do wish that her next book is about Murph...I cried for him in the story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I usually love SB's books but I was really disappointed in this book. There were so many characters and plots in this book I kept getting lost and having to go back and check out the story. The gay plot was no problem, but I think Jules got short changed. I liked Decker and Sophia and hope they have a book in the future. I also enjoyed Jack's character. Cosmo and Jane were short changed in this story. I hope her next one will be better(...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Target","review":"After waiting for this latest Navy SEAL book to come out I was very very disappointed with this latest story from Suzanne Brockmann who has always previously delivered exciting adventures complete with every woman's ideal hero. However, after reading all her other books I felt Cosmo Richter was not given the strong character image he deserved and felt extremly annoyed on his behalf. Jules Cassidy was the only saving grace to be found to lift the story. I did enjoy the way he was written even if he did'nt have a happy conclusion this time around - hopefully the next story will see him finding someone worthy of him and also bring back the magic to the rest of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Brockmann's best . . .","review":"Kudos to Brockmann for her sensitivity to Jules, Robin and Adam. Her character development of Jules was terrific. He's a character you'd love to hug and have for a friend.I was very disappointed in the remainder of the book. Cosmo's character development was way below Brockmann's usual treatment given to her main character(s). I found the entire story line and lack of emotional depth to Cosmo's \\"dangerous\\" past unbelievable and, quite frankly, distracting to the story line surrounding Jules.With over forty books to her credit, Brockmann is \\"allowed\\" to have one or two that miss the mark and it seems to me that the last two, Flashpoint, and now, Hot Target, fall into a substandard category. I hope she gets back \\"on target\\" with Max and Gina's book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Brockmann Read","review":"As usual, Suzanne Brockmann has created true-to-life characters and situations. As usual, I could not put it down until I finished it. She has a way of engrossing you in the story and character problems so that you can't wait to see how it all turns out. Her SEALs are all men to die for, yet have human flaws that make them real rather than plastic. Her heroines have the deep seated fears that many of us share. I would recommend any of her books highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good Brockmann","review":"This is one of those rare books that I put down sometimes, not because I was tired of reading, but because I didn't want the book to end. It's way better than Flashpoint. I loved all the characters. The gay story line that I wasn't sure I'd like was good, insiteful. The dialog between characters was really fun.Highly recommended to any Brockmann fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suzanne B. does it again!","review":"I put off reading this book for a time and wish I hadn't done so - it was excellently written and dealt with some sensitive subjects tastefully and you ended up caring so much about each character in the web she wove. Truly a treat, again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air...","review":"Although this book still deals with Brockmann's Navy SEALs, it is a refreshing tangent to go on. Most of her books deal with international intrigue and terrorism so this plot about a SEAL becoming a temporary bodyguard is a good change. Another highlight of this fiction is the relationship between Jules Cassidy, his ex, Adam, and Robin Chadwick. Although some people dislike homosexuality mixed in a heterosexual romance book, I thought it was a breath of fresh air. Most romance books are lacking in focus on more than one relationship, not to mention a homosexual one.Not only did Cosmo/Jane pairing grab my attention but I also found myself looking forward to hear more from Jules side of the story. ^^"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected from Ms. Brockmann","review":"I have read every book written by Suzanne Brockmann, but this book just does not meet my expectations. I thought this was supposed to be Navy Seal Cosmo's story, but because of the weak plot, Cosmo got lost ... too many characters ... too confusing. Also, hard to believe that Jules, smart FBI agent, would be interested in someone like disgusting Robin. This book's focus is too strong on homosexual relationships thereby overshadowing Cosmo's story. I read Ms. Brockmann's books because I enjoy the powerful romance between an alpha male and a female. I hope her next book is about Navy Seals, action and has a great plot development, which is lacking in Hot Target. I think she needs to get back to writing about the Tall, Dark and Dangerous Navy Seal series that works so well for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable with realistic relationships","review":"As a woman with a gay family member, it was so refreshing to read a book where the gay characters were treated no differently than the straight characters, rather than as asexual sidekicks or evil sexual predators! In addition, the story was a good mystery and a pretty hot romance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be a fan","review":"I used to be a big SB fan and I've read everything that she's ever written. Her last book was sub-par, but this one was really bad. This has absolutely nothing to do with the gay storyline. It was simply poorly written. The characters are not believable, nor are they well-developed. They almost seem like cardboard cut-outs. Jules has always been one of my favorite characters - witty, cute, supportive - now suddenly every second line is about how people will react to his being gay. It was overdone. We didn't know a lot about Cosmo before this book, and we still don't (other than the fact that everyone that he meets thinks that he has weird eyes). The storyline was really thin, and quite frankly, I was bored! I would gladly wait another 6 months in between novels for an exciting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coz suprises","review":"So far, I have really enjoyed all of the Troubleshooters books. This one was different in a few ways that ended up working for me. First, I absolutely loved Jules. It was odd to have Jules without Alyssa, but it was interesting to see he character develop. I was very compelled by his romance with Robin and found that I both wanted them to get together and wanted Jules to be strong. I was a little dissappointed at first at the Coz turned out to be so different from what the mystery man was thought to be. In the end though, I really liked it. He is evolved, interesting, sensitive and kickass. I actually ended up liking him a lot after I got over my own preconceptions. The stalking plot was a little thin in a few places and somewhat difficult to follow, but everything else flowed together so interestingly that I enjoyed the book in total."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],x={key:0},O={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(C,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-aed101ea"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/49.md","filePath":"library/49.md"}'),L={name:"library/49.md"},P=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,P as default};
