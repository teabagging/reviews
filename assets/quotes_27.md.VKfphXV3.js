I couldn't believe all the great reviews for this piece of crap!First of all, there actually was a misunderstanding, a big one that went throughout the book about Sara being a \\"whore.\\" What pissed me off to no extent was the fact that she not only didn't deny this, but she encouraged this accusation. She was possibly one of the stupidest heroines I've ever read about. She never even gave a reason for this when Max asked her why she didn't tell him the truth about her virginity.The entire book was just constant mood swings from both characters, along with an incredibly boring mystery which I figured out within the first few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"ON YOUR MARK, GET SET. . .GO!!!!!","review":"WOW!

In this case, lacking in almost every story).Most of these stories just end, often when things just seem like they're about to happen. Most of the characters blend together. I didn't care about them, and the stories didn't feel finished. A bunch of kids in trouble, broken homes, drugs, sex, violence and incest doesn't make good writing unless the story is complete and compelling. To me it just felt like an angsty laundry list."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of Laurel & Hardy...","review":"...is, sadly, not \\"worth seeing anyway\\", as some folks claim. These are sad, dull, humorless films with two dull, humorless characters who don't look or act like Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy, all the more sad because they ARE Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy. Fox crushed all of the humor out of them and put them in weak Abbott & Costello ripoffs (GREAT GUNS) or gave them scripts that the Bowery Boys would've rejected. In 1938, they made one of their best pictures, the hilarious BLOCK-HEADS, for Hal Roach, and within 3 years they were washed up in films, thanks to horrible movies like these. As another reviewer mentioned, a week later Warners is releasing an L&H DVD collection with one of their best films, THE DEVIL'S BROTHER (FRA DIAVOLO) and some very funny sequences from other films. Skip this and buy that, but by all means order a copy of Randy Skretvedt's essential book on Stan & Ollie to go with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star is too much - way too much","review":"The release of films such as these by Fox can do nothing but bury L and H. All of their 40s films are awful and it's a shame that that this wonderful duo will be judged by films like these.To see why these classic comics were so loved you must just hope that their silent 2 reelers will someday be rereleased. Only then will you be able to really enjoy these two geniuses and see see why L and H are ranked up there with Chaplin, Lloyd and Keaton.These two warm and wonderful men don't deserve this - and neither do you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"[...] First, the actual movies are not what is on the DVD cover. The actual movies are: Hustling for health; Paperhangers Helper; Lucky dog; The Soilers; Roughest Africa.

I suspect the makers, \\"borrowed\\" these from the source of the \\"Lost\\" series and put them on one disk at a low bit rate, so the quality is worse then the \\"lost\\" series, which are are about the best you can get, other than the Universal release in Europe (not available here).

Except for the thrown-together Hallmark volumes which , for the most part, use poor dupes of 35mm material and for Turner's L&H; \\"collection\\" with FRA DIAVOLO and BONNIE SCOTLAND, two of their weakest Roach films, their is nothing readily available to show the genius of these two timeless performers. The continued release of the weak - and frequently execrable - films for Fox and MGM in the 40s will only cause the unititiated to think L&H; are nothing beyond two aging, unfunny knockabouts.Although the Fox/MGM films might have a place on the shelf of a completist, they are really just depressing.

It was so bad that I notified Amazon and despite it normally being the practice to not issue refunds on video on demand items, Amazon was good enough to indeed issue a full and immediate refund of the small price I paid to rent this thing.Too bad too. The description of the movie looked like it would have been something I would have enjoyed immensely but when you see a car door slam (while dialogue is running at the bottom of the screen despite none of the characters saying anything at the time) and then hear the sound of the door slamming some 10 seconds later.........yep, something is amiss. I tried re-starting the movie, didnt work, still out of sync. Waited a while, tried again, same thing.....so I contacted Amazon who VERY kindly issued the refund.

His original use of the double bass drum had such a unique sound and power that it enthralled me years ago when I first heard it on a Duke Ellington live concert, recorded in Seattle in 1952.As much as I think Buddy Rich is the greatest I enjoy watching Louis Bellson for his showmanship. This video shows him really enjoying what he's doing and responding to the audience's appreciation of his prowess.His accompanying band includes former members of groups such as the Average White Band and Blood Sweat and Tears. It's always good to know that the truly good instrument players go on to do projects with others.Sound quality on this video is good but not great (muffled bass drums at times) hence the 4 star rating. Anyone, however, who enjoys big band jazz and great drumming will appreciate this performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"The tunes are very weak; if these are Bellson's compositions, he has done much better than this. The band does not swing, mostly due to the uninspried arrangements.This is Bellson in his prime, but playing far from his best.There are some good solos by Geller,the Breckers, and Soloff.Of all the great Bellson concerts that could have been filmed(especially with his West Coast Big Bands) why pick this one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for enhancing your own knowledge of it all","review":"Do you need ideas in how to expand and/or absorb the Internet world of knowledge about anything?Do you seek knowledge on topics that are hard to find explanations about them?Are you overwhelmed by the amount of unfiltered information you get every time you search the Net?Don't you feel mentally exhausted after spending hours looking to find good articles on subjects of your interest only to realize that the ones presented to you are of no value?Couldn't the system be 'a little' smarter and pick up notions of your interest from your previous query and reach for those information that you are really in need of?An excellent way to start to find answers to these questions lies in reading professor Ahamed's Intelligent Internet Knowledge Networks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted $.99","review":"Save your money and the pain of having to watch this .

He provides clear timelines of philosophical, theoretical, and empirical events that put this complex history in clear context. The writing is \\"thick\\" while managing to be accessible to even a beginner (if highly motivated) who is trying to make sense of the complexities of the field of cognitive psychology. He goes on to develop a rationale for the development of what is now known as cognitive constructivism -- of which he is a seminal thinker. His rationale and theory development are logical, well constructed, heavily referenced, and inspired. After laying the historical, theoretical, and empirical groundwork, Mahoney provides examples of how this theory is applied to clinical practice. This work is a gem. It is truly worth the energy and investment necessary to read and absorb it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. What a P.O.C.!","review":"I'm not an audiophile, so the sound is fine with me. My problem with this is the design of the cabling. I'm not a fan of the assymetrical cord lengths. Besides the assymetrical cord, the worst part of airbuds is the rubberized cord. This material allows for the cable to easily tangle. If you are tempted to put your earbuds in your pocket, please be ready to spend a few mintues untangling them. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are exactly the same as Philips SHE 9501 except they are black and twice the price","review":"These earbuds rock - great for women because you can just use the 1st half of the cord which is 0.6 meters long - I find that the standard 1.2 meters gets in the way when running etc. Also the cords are staggered so the cord for the right ear is about 3 inches longer then the cord for the left - I love these and I'm stocking up because I think Philips has discontinued this model"},{"rating":"1","title":"sound?...word. design?...turd.","review":"these sounds pretty good. i actually had to refit them in my ears so i could hear around work when i needed since they isolated somewhat decently when some one tried to talk to me. decent sound really. infact i would have kept these except...the one side being longer than the other is an idea to try but the designers should have seen how poor this is. the weight of the connection brings this design flaw to your attention as one side is always tugging. i tried multiple things and they're just annoying. and with this design you HAVE to have your musical device on your left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sound !","review":"The sound is really one of the worst I have ever had. Not only the quality is bad, but even when you push the volume a little bit, the sound becomes unexpectably distorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mediocre sound","review":"I picked these up as a middle-of-the road solution between the high-end 50+ dollar buds and the typical 10 dollar buds or over the head earphones. I wanted something that sounded decent and would not fall out when running. They are extremely comfortable, but that's about as far as they go.They do absolutely nothing for blocking sound. Furthermore, my previous set of 12 dollar hook-over-the-ear headphones sounded much better. These sound tinny and definitely like they're coming from a plastic case. The sound is a bit distant, like listening to MP3s from a cheap pair of computer speakers that weigh less than a few ounces. The bass response is fair, but otherwise, the mids and highs are muddy and blurry like listening to a nice AM radio. For the cost, definitely look for a better buy elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value and great fit for price","review":"I have had these for about a week. I love the soft rubber caps--three sizes included; very soft and much more comfortable than foam caps. They don't slide/pop out of your ears, either. Bass response is respectable for this price. Asymmetrical cord design is comfortable. Cord separates in the middle-- you can use shorter length for arm or pocket player location; add extension for belt or backpack use. A small ear buds-only case is included, which keeps the buds protected from dust or other unwanted dirt when not in use. Also included is a felt drawstring pouch to hold pieces you aren't using, or all of the parts if desired. I'm very pleased so far. I have used them for jazz, rock and classical listening. They are not active noise-cancelling type, but in-ear design blocks out most noise, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical for working out","review":"For me, the sound quality of these earbuds was fine...actually quite good. But like other reviewers, I found myself very frustrated with the wiring scheme. How frustrated? Well, I sort of snapped at the gym this morning and threw these babies right into the trash (I rescued them a minute or two later). But these are not keepers. In short, if you clip your MP3 player to your waist, the weight of the two cords connected goes all over the place. You'll be continually losing an ear, so to speak...or you'll feel an annoying tugging. Today it took me an agonizingly long time to get through my arms and shoulders weight routine, and I owe it all to these earbuds. Boo. Lesson for me to take-away: no assymetrical...I'm old school, baby...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating (and quite possibly the worst designed headphones to come from Phillips)","review":"I titled this review frustrating on account of unfortunate design flaw that prevents one from enjoying the semi-decent sound quality because they will not stay in your ears. No matter what size attachment you decide to go with, you will have difficulty in keeping them in your ears. The right cord is longer that the left cord making it even more awkward. Simple tasks such as, say, walking (you can forget about jogging), do not allow for the potential enjoyment of these headphones to even be remotely realized. You must stay absolutely still if you want them to stay in your ear. Anyway, I would not advise purchasing these headphones unless you intend on not moving. Hope this review is helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, crappy.","review":"that was my initial reaction. every aspect of the design is poor. its a shame that $30 cant buy you a decent pair of these things. i guess the technology to get good sound inside your ear is complicated. the sound is very mediocre. \\"turbo bass?\\" thats a pricey joke imo. they are fairly comfortable but i dont see them lasting very long. the cable insulation is so thin it almost ripped when i tried to pull it out of the package. the stems of the earbuds protrude from the case so they are not very protected if you shove them in your backpack. who knows what your expected to do with the cable, crumple it into the little satchel they give you? if you only want to spend >$30 you can find yourself some very nice over the ear-phones but it looks like you cant cheap out on the in ear stuff..."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound, bad for exercise use","review":"The Philips SHE9500 plays loud booming sound when I'm sitting at my desk, but I bought them to jog with, and they fail at that purpose. The asymmetric-cable-behind-the-neck thing is a disaster for me when jogging. Any attempt to turn my head to the left causes the ear bud to pop out, since the cable sticks too easily to the back of my neck or shirt. Plus in my opinion, the extender cable is a pain--it's too short without it, but when connected, it causes a weight on the cable itself, which means any swing of the connector during movement will put tension of the earbuds. And surpise, they pop out. Still, the sound is very good, and songs recorded as lesser volume are easy to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look and sound good, but buds are too shallow.","review":"The positives: These earbuds sound great for the price. The build quality, sound, split cable, storage pouch, are much nicer than the Sony 71s costing twice as much. (I've tried both)The negatives: The design doesn't allow for them to extend as far into the ear as the Sonys. Despite the adjustable ear buds, they need to go much further into the ear canal and they are just too shallow. A slight tug will jerk them out. This makes them unusable for me. They are going back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT For Exercising","review":"I cannot say enough bad things about these if you are going to use them for running. They are made to go on your arm, so one cord is longer than the other. They have a connector half way down that comes with an extender enabling them to be longer and attach to to your waist, but this makes the cord heavy thus pulling them out of your ear. Because the cords are rubber they also bounce a lot when running. I gave them two stars since they do come with multiple size pieces that fit nicely into your ear. If you are going to sit still when using them they are great. If you are planning on using them actively keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I use these earplugs with my 5G iPod. They claim to increase bass but they really do not. They are comfortable in the ear. I don't hear any real improvement over the earplugs that came with the iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing better for the money","review":"Above average sound. Comfortable, sizeable earbuds. And a great price. Sure you need to untangle but for 10 bucks nothing beats these headphones. I bought my first pair at 30 bucks and am coming back to get another pair at the new low low price.By the way, if you travel, these beat the Bose in ear noise canceling phones by a mile and 200 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound Quality But!!...","review":"... The Only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star.. yup you guessed it just like the previous posts the cord tangles badly. Other than that its nice crisp sound a hell of a \\"BOOM\\" Bass. I use headphones everyday at work mainly and it shuts out all outside sounds. And I use it while i play poker. I would most definitely recommend this product. But Be warned the cord is lengthy which is great but it tangles up very easy and thats what really s@%K$ !But for the price its a great Deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is fine, The wiring is horrible","review":"Unlike most of the reviewers giving low scores, I had no problems with the audio aspect of this product. It was a fine fit in my ear as well. No, my problem is with the wiring. It is soo fine, that I was sure it would go bad. Well, sure enough, after about a month of use, the wiring started to deteriorate and cause the sound to drop out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, but not a great a design","review":"Overall, this is a very good buy. Excellent sound and particularly rich bass for this type of product. Separate cord lengths for each ear are supposed to be convenient but instead too often lead to one side being pulled out of ear during activity. But I have yet to be satisfied with the stay-in-ness of any in-ear phones. The seal is pretty good (after choosing between the differently sized offerings)... but I sometimes hear a wind channel or whistling sound when wearing them while walking on a breezy day. The cord has to be untangled before most uses. I have owned my SHE9500 earphones a couple of years or more, and they have held up well. For the price, this is a terrific product. Indeed, when walking, I prefer these to my over-priced (but nice sounding) Bose in ear phones that cost multiples more (but I prefer the Bose on the train)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking????","review":"I purchased these at another store and did not have to pay the $30 because of a labeling error, but even then that did not make up for the poor design of these. I have had problems of these slipping out of my ears as well. And then there is the different length of the cording leading directly to the earphones. Why would that make it a better design. Maybe I am missing something. I string the wire underneath my clothes when I am working in the lab so they won't hang around everywhere. Unfortunately with the mismatched cord length, everytime I move my head, the stupid earphones fall out and I have to remove my gloves to put them back in, a HUGE hassle when performing an experiment. The sound out of these is not the greatest either, I feel sorry for the people who paid full price for them. I am going back to my Koss \\"The Plug\\" which are cheaper and sound a whole lot better. I guess I have a back-up now if I ever lose the other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock offs AT BEST","review":"I tried these because at the retailer where I bought them, they were 10-20 less than the sony fontopia in ear phones. \\"TURBO BASS! Excellent clarity!\\" Completely and udderly ridiculous. These headphones are terrible. They sit in the ear uncomfortably (the wire-tab that comes off the bottom presses on your ear), have a default volume that is too low, the clarity of highs and lows is awful, and are a FAR CRY from \\"turbo bass\\". Spend the 10 and get the Sonys. Definitely worth the money, great sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"sony's better","review":"it doesn't fit as snuggly as the sony fontopia headphones. they are only like 5 more dollars too. the headphone straps are designed poorly and makes it uncomfortable when doing anything except sitting still. wouldn't pay 10 dollars for them but the earbuds fit into sony's headphones so it wasn't a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philips SHE 9500 Earbuds","review":"I bought a pair of these a couple of weeks back and I need to warn everyone thinking about purchasing them. The sound is really really bad. I have bought many different earbuds in the past, from Sony to Sennheiser including a couple of pair of old Philips versions. I saw these and liked the design. They were on sale for less than 30 bucks so I thought I'd give them a chance. They look cool, they come with a lot of neat accessories like 3 sizes of flanges to fit your ears and an asymmetric cable. The cable itself is short, but there is an included extender cord and a carry pouch. I was real excited until I listened to them. They sound really really bad. Like a pair of gimmies that come with a trade show FM radio. I was disappointed. I'll continue to use my Sennheiser mx 350's, they were cheap but sound much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud","review":"I bought these from BB for way more than Amazon. Anyway I tried them for about 5 minutes and decided I couldn't use them. For starters, the so-called turbo-bass really distorts the sound, so much that you can barely recognize your music. Secondly (and most critical), the sound dampening does two things wrong: 1) You can't hear what's going on around you (bad for me, since I bike alot) 2) Everyone else has an opportunity to listen to your questionable music tastes. At normal volume an observer can hear the music 5 feet away. At 1 foot away you can actually listen to the music. Not good. The fit for me was perfect, I have normal sized ears, so that wasn't an issue. But these simply suck for the money. I buoght the AKG K12P from Amazon, and hope they are decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"User","review":"The product was not manufactured correctly.The wires to the ear plugs are a different length.One ear ire being longer than it's matching pair.The product is usable, but I am disappointed in the quality control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like my buds","review":"Use my ear buds just about everyday at the gym. I wish they had a little clip or something to attach to clothing while working out...I use a paperclip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"The product works great (sound, feel in ear, etc). I bought them for use at work and on the motorcycle. For the bike, the tension on the wire bothers my ear after about 30 minutes, but in the office they are outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Earbuds, Great Price","review":"I've generally gone with Sony earbuds, but I switched it up this time since the wires frayed on the last two Sony pairs. These have been excellent so far; great bass (better than similar Sony models), and clear, crisp highs. I listen to a lot of music and a lot of audiobooks, and they provide good audio for both. They aren't quite as comfortable as the Sony ones, but they are by no means uncomfortable. I recommend them, especially at this price. We'll see how long the wires last; if they match or outlast the Sony ones, I will be very, very happy with my purchase.Also, on a side note, the little felt bag that comes with the earbuds is the exact right size to tote around a 3G iPod nano--a very nice side benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but dont last","review":"The sound is really good but they don't fit in my ears all the way due to the ear bud stem that turns into the wire. Them stem causes the seal to be pretty poor and sound leaks out while also letting outside sound come in. If you want in ear, go for ones without the ear bud stem. Scullcandy makes ones that sound just as good and form a pretty good seal, plus they are only ten bucks and last a couple months longer. The main problem is in the extension cord half. The right angle jack ends up shorting out leaving you with just the headphone part, which is really short and useless. Also, one bud wire is longer than the other so you either have one hanging down or you have it around your neck, and that is annoying.Overall, these ear buds are terrible. There are better ones for cheaper, and WAY better ones for a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad cord material","review":"I've had several sets of Phillips earbuds, so I was surprised when I realized the material of the cord on these is very poor quality, it's like putty, gets kinks very easily (even right out of the package) and tangles too easily. Maybe Phillips went back to the better material of other Phillips buds I own and if they did, good for them. But I got a set I can barely use, which is a shame, because they do sound pretty good, hence the 2 stars despite the cord problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phones for the Price","review":"I love these earphones!I bought them to listen to my iPod Nano during my subway ride to work. I can still hear a bit of noise, but it's been reduced drastically, and I no longer need to blast my iPod (great for my ears and battery life). I have only used one set of the rubber fittings, so I may be able to reduce the noise a bit further...My only complaint, and it seems to be the most common complaint, is the coupler that extends the cable is a bit too heavy. It tugs on the left earphone as I walk, but this is easily remedied if I hold the coupler in place.I considered buying the active noise-canceling version of these earphones, but opted with the increased bass, and I couldn't be happier with my decision.If Philips made the headphone in a Lanyard style for the Nano, I would buy a set in a heartbeat, and change my four star rating to a five star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase if you're deaf in one ear","review":"These earphones sound great and are the most comfortable that I've come across. Main draw back-- the left channel quit working after 2 weeks of use( With ipod at no more 40% volume). Wow, great job phillips. What a bunch of noobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for running","review":"These headphones are great if you're going to sit on the train and listen to music on your way to work/school. However, if you plan on doing anything physical while wearing these i would not buy them. The cord lengths weren't measured correctly so regardless of how you try to wear them 1 ear will always be pulled on. They also have an unnecessary joint in the middle that just adds weight to the cord and causes the headphones to pop out while running. Sound quality is fine but i wanted these for the gym and that just didn't work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Spots are great","review":"I don't know about this particular one, but I bought every single Cool spot guide he was selling in the mid 1990's - they were that good. I think there were like 35 states done at the time. Each state is great. I gave away a few to friends as they moved to different places and they were always crowd pleasers and conversation starters. :) At the time they were simply xeroxed stapled zines I found in a bookshop in Bucktown (Chicago), but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, excellent book","review":"I'm currently enrolled in an 18-week First Aid: Responding to Emergencies course at my college and this is the textbook we're using. This thing is packed full of information! Everything from how to care for victims of various injuries and illnesses to life threatening conditions. Lots of articles in it-- I'm learning stuff I never gave second thoughts to before. It's very readable and it presents the information in a well-organized way. Lots of photos to show how different procedures are done (although nothing replaces firsthand practice). The end-of-chapter study guides are also extremely helpful.

There are numerous and pervasive errors in the science and engineering, many of which could have been caught by any reader familiar with the conventions of hard SF, and others that would have been caught by any competent person (layman) who is familiar with science on the level of reading the newspaper and magazines like Natural History and National Geographic.There are a fair number of word errors (spelling, word choice, etc) that should have been caught by a proofreader.There are general and specific problems with consistency and continuity, that (for me) affect the believability of the characters and story.I also was not convinced of the believability of some of the characters and situations.Decent story idea though.

The characters are unbelievably immature, the plot is unbelievably coincidental, and the villain is unbelievably evil. \\"Murphy's Gambit\\" is written with all the sophistication of a \\"young reader\\" book. It kept reminding me of the Jedi Apprentice series, complete with an overabundance of exclamation points, only those books are deliberately written for 9-12 year olds. This book, however, was ostensibly written for adults. The description of life in zero-gee is interesting, if sexist, but it's not enough to save this book. And nine as a prime number?

It was horrible! The story doesn't make a lot of sense. It is never made quite clear why his character had to leave town. The story had me thinking that he raped his own sister. Again, I may be confused from the fact that I was trying to stay awake.Swayze's character is also pathetic in the fact that he leaves and comes back like 3 or 4 times in this movie (or so it seems). Before I knew it, he was sitting in a church with his family and big stupid smile on his face. I remember thinking - what just happened?Not to trample on Swayze's memory (I loved Road House and Dirty Dancing), but the man should have never agreed to do this movie. It was just terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift from a talented gentleman.","review":"I have enjoyed most of the movies I have seen with Patrick Swayze.

The cleaver broke in half. No, I didn't use it drive nails or cut rebar. The thickest bones it ran into would be in a pork chop. Not even a thick cut pork chop at that. But it split in half just above the handle just where the transition to the blade occurs. Quite surprising and totally unacceptable for a product of this price range.

Otherwise, don't bang your bank balance too deep.I have, sadly, totally revised my view of Global and their quality assurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts well","review":"While this piece lacks the razor sharpness of other Global offerings, it makes up for it by being able to split bone without chipping.

The producers are to be commended for finding much previously unknown color footage. The only drawback is their decision to present it as 16x9 aspect ratio. The result is the top and bottom of the original footage has been lopped off and the remainder greatly expanded to fill the screen, thus emphasizing the graininess and flaws of the footage. I have seen several other documentaries, such as WWW in Color, that take this approach. It tarnishes an otherwise flawless and fascinating documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japan's War In Colour","review":"This is one of the most unusual documentary series you'll find, if you can find it...with plenty of B&W around concerning Japan the war in the Pacific and Asia, Brian Cox gathered and presents an surprising amount of footage, mixed with interviews and perspectives. - Prof Michael Haller"},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in Japan?","review":"Based on the Product Description \\"It was assumed no color films existed in Japan...\\" you might think this was all Japanese film.

However, I bought it for a more specific reason. I had seen the film on the 'History Channel' and noticed to my surprise that it included coverage of my brother's ship - HMS Swiftsure - anchored in a Japanese port. In October 1944, as the European War seemed to be heading towards a conclusion, a large British fleet was sent to the Pacific to take part in the advance on Japan; Swiftsure was part of that fleet. The DVD also provides coverage of the ships crew going ashore and meeting Japanese civilians, who allegedly were expecting the victors to massacre them. The ship was in Japan very soon after 'the Surrender'. My brother appears in the first shots of some officers and crew. The crew went on to help in the clean up of Hiroshima - which had experienced the first atomic bomb raid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview and color footage of Japan's entry into the war","review":"This is an excellent program showing very old footage of Tokyo before WWII that was not thought to exist in color. Also the narration by Brian Cox is very good. This program includes many letter readings by some Japanese who understood the insanity and fatalism of their position. It also shows why the Japanese were so motivated to go to war and what kept them going to the breaking point. This is actually part of a series of programs that apparently are only partially still in production...this one, and the \\"Hitler: In Colour\\" (also VERY excellent). \\"Britain at War: In Colour\\" seems no longer produced for Region 2 (USA).

As for the movie itself, my grand kids enjoy it, and the rest of us as adults are amused. It's typical quality for the vintage, and the VHS tape we bought was well worn (but cheap) and played fine.

I will keep this book at my desk and re-read a passage here or there for inspiration and to remind myself of the many valuable lessons contained therein. Some of the themes which particularly resonated with me were focusing on solutions and vision over problems and obstacles, becoming comfortable with being uncomfortable, trying to improve oneself without feeling the need to fix oneself and the fact that leaders must deal with paradoxes and contradictions which often require balancing seemingly opposing and incongruent truths."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Name It, It's Here","review":"To say that this set is the 'Ultimate' POTA collection seems pointless - look at the discription.

Now at last I can have it all for one decent price.

Check out www.SubterraneousRecords.com for more music and info"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every man needs an evolution","review":"First and foremost, One Be Lo is a hell of a lyricist. He has always kicked ass, solo or with Binary Star. He can paint a picture with his words unlike any other mc I've heard in quite some time. So, lyrically, this CD is top notch. There would be no way for me to pick a favorite vocal track, because each one is dead-on.As far as the beats go, this albums on and off. Some of the tracks are perfect, but some of them miss the mark a little bit. \\"Axis\\", \\"Sleepwalking\\", \\"Rocketship\\", \\"Enec Eht No KcaB\\" are my personal favorite beats. But most of the other tracks are just a little bit above average.This is a CD that's meant to be paid attention to. If you sit down and listen to what he's saying, it's truly profound. But, as a background CD, it's probably not going to hit the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Man Army","review":"One Be Lo is one of the best underground rappers I have heard.

Reading it at the end of my teaching stint, I find that there is not much substance to the style. It is a collection of quotes, which I generally don't enjoy, with each chapter being quotes on a particular theme. This works at first, various instructors or famous people reflecting on their tutelage. But maybe 25 pages in it begins to dissolve into just seemingly-random quotes on life. You could open the page at random, pick a quote and instantly apply it to teaching...or metallurgy. I finished the book and had found only two quotes to be meaningful, neither in relation to actual teaching but more as life affirmations.In short, if you need a gift for your child's teacher feel free to get this in hopes that they'll never do more than occasionally flip to a page in boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"Are there a few cute boys in this movie?

John Alexander is entirely right in that the tactics necessary to win this war are much too brutal for most Americans to stomach - until enough terror acts occur on the US soil to turn public opinion around. What Alexander does not seem to consider (and the reason I give 4 stars) is that Islamic fundamentalists, being aware of American strengths and weaknesses, may deliberately avoid striking at US homeland and instead concentrate on destabilizing their own countries. That way some Islamic states may fall to fundamentalism without ever provoking US and the rest of Western world out of its self-imposed restraints. Recent attacks in Indonesia certainly fit this pattern."},{"rating":"1","title":"two different books","review":"This book offers up a non-detailed summary of weapons systems that are being contemplated and tested for the next round of wars. Most of it is obvious from reading Popular Mechanics. The author attempts to write up possible scenarios as to how such weapons might be used in an imagined confrontation in the near future. Sadly he also comments on political and ethical considerations in the last part of the book that that sound like the ravings of a lunatic. ( For example: In an effort to stem the tide of murders in the Middle East the author recommends that we do as the Russians and target the families of suicide bombers, hack up their bodies and send the parts to their relatives. Apparently it worked. If you like hearing this sort of thing as a serious policy proposal coming from a high ranking American military officer then you might like the book.) It makes you wonder what a lifetime of service in the military actually does to your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for me.","review":"This book is useful if you want to take magenta pictures with a magenta filter, or blue pictures with a blue filter. On the other hand, the parts of the book dedicated to bringing out 'natural' light in photographs is small. It is mainly about creating fancy effects. A photography book should inspire you as you look through and see the photos. This book is full of shots with heavily over-used filtration. Not for me, but if you like more abstract photos, then you might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If bad Sci-Fi is your game, this movie delivers!","review":"Bruce Campbell delivers again!

I think it COULD have been a great film but unfortunately the acting's terrible, especially Ted Raimi, he just irritates the hell out of me everytime he's on the screen. The actors' Eastern European accents are extremely iffy and the film just DRAGS. I actually ended up falling asleep after 70 minutes.I think this could have been a great film if it had a bigger budget and better actors so I recommend you get hold of the excellent graphic novel instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Campy Goodness","review":"I liked this movie alot but its def not for everyone.

We got about a third of the way through before giving up. Isn't a spoof supposed to be funny? Up to that point there was absolutely nothing funny, or even moderately amusing. Nothing even vaguely resembling entertainment. Unless you count an overdone and heavy-handed \\"look what a jerk I'm being\\" character, presented with no subtlety or wit as worth watching, avoid this turkey.

As A die-hard Bruce fan, loving all of Bruce's work, (ie Brisco County, evil Dead, Army Darkness and Bubba Ho-tep) I bought this movie. I read these reviews on Amazon here, and thought It may possibly be good. DO NOT BELIVE THE OTHER REVIEWS. I was sceptical about this movie at first, and decided to rent it, but none of the rental stores had it so I bought it. This movie is the bottom of the barrel. There is nothing to like in this flick at all. As much as I tried to like it, I was extremely pi**ed off and bored. All of the characters suck, and I hated all of them. The plot is extremely stupid. None of the actors seem to enjoy doing this movie and the comedy is just lame. Bruce's character is the worst of them all.Do not even watch this if you enjoy Bruce movies.

I know it's a B Horror film but there was no orginality in this movie. I know it's suppose to be funny but come on people, was it really? The only part that was slightly funny was when Campell's wife was going after the Gypsy for the first time.Needless to say, I think it's interesting that this movie was a book.Going off subject, however, on a late night talk show Bruce acknowledged that there was no such thing as a PG-13 horror film. I'll conform with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This B-flick gets a D","review":"The king of the one liners pulls off none! No memorable quotes or scenes - nothing really redeeming. It's nice to see Bruce in something new, but it would be nicer to see him in something good. The extras (focusing on how the film came to be) was more interesting than the film.

Bruce stars in it, sounds like a blast. Unfortunetly I can't say any of this helped the movie much. The movie may be low-budget but so little seems to have been done with...well, so little. The story is out there but isn't supported by a very humorous script to help you forget about it (like Army of Darkness).

OK, so he's a cult figure and all, but there's nothing particularly redeeming at all about this movie and Ted Raimi is much more interesting. An American diplomat (played by Campbell) is accidentally killed and dragged back to the lair of a mad scientist who transplants the brain of a taxi driver into him and voila, that's about it, and of course stupid behavior ensues. I bought this with the highest expectations, and after I watched it only loaned it to a friend who watched it and also thought it was pretty lame, and then traded it in. As I mentioned Ted Raimi pretty much steals the show, as the Russian assistant of the mad scientist (as played by Stacy Keach, who must be hard up for money) and Raimi is the best thing this has going as he does his Russian hip-hop patter. Other than that, this is a bust, bleah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as strong, but still great","review":"Well, I liked it. I think certain aspects about Tenar's relationship with the Kargish princess could have been developed further, as well as deelings between the princess and King Lebannen, but on the whole, it was a wonderful book. I was a little disappointed by the lack of Ged in it, but then, the book wasn't about him.The book has charm, strength, and surprising bits of humor in it, that make it well worth the five stars I gave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Men do Everything Wrong\\"","review":"This book should have been titled \\"Men do Everything Wrong\\", in two senses: First, in every story the men can't do anything right. Secondly, everything that's wrong with Earthsea is the fault of Men. In this way, LeGuin begs forgivness for the sin of not being sufficiently Feminist in the first three books.If you loved the Earthsea trilogy, you'll be outraged by what LeGuin does to it in this book, and in Tehanu. As best I can sum it up, her attitude is \\"I spit on your memory.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Earthsea book?","review":"This seems to be the last Eartsea novel, though I hope it isn't so. This book is more complicated than any other book in the cycle and contains more depth.Their used to be a fine line (or a wall, at least) between the living and the dead. But now that line is being blurred. A young mender has been touched across the wall by his deceased wife. Tenar takes him in, and they journey to Roke with Ged, the Archmage. This company is joined by others who will try to make the line whole again or utterly destroy it. Accompanying them is a Kargad princess, the High King of Havnor, and fate. They go to the far west, farther than in the Farthest Shore, to the extreme edges of the Earth, where an ultimate truth can be broken.This, in my opinion, is the best book in the cycle. It is also the longest, and the one with the most morale. It also has an outstanding ending and a superb plot. This is a great book for any Earthsea Cycle fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I loved the EarthSea trilogy, but I was very disappointed with this book. I'm not sure why the reviews are so good. What existed of the story line, dragged terribly. The character development was poor and they failed to captivate me the way the original characters did. The ending was predictable and we seemed to be going over the same old ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult novel is finale to kids series","review":"Yes, you kind of have to have read the previous books to get the deeper meanings of the plot and character development. Yes, it is not the simplistic (as if anything by leguin could be called simplistic) plot of the first few Earthsea books. Unlike those first books: aimed at children, this book is aimed at the adult who can tolerate a more complex world, more complex characters, and a few suprises along the way. Less action, more food for thought.She undoes some of the pat solutions left earlier in the series, makes heroes into human beings, and does all those things I hated in a book in my teens but appreciate now: portrays life as messy and complex and makes you question everything: But in a deepening way, not a disturbing way.Fans of LeGuin (Left Hand of Darkness, The Telling...) will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"You've read the other 5 books?

Don't you want to follow the life of Ged? Don't you want to monitor changes in Earthsea?The Other Wind continues the tale. The barrier between life and death is breaking down.

Of course, pointing stereo mic is precise directions relative to each other is critical, but the only way to do that with this bar (unless you just get very lucky) is to leave them loose. But then they move out of position easily if you just touch the mic cables. Extremely frustrating and annoying, and the only way to fix it would be to get a couple of those thin nuts like most mic stands have, which can be tightened upward against a mic clip pointing wherever you want it, but I can't seem to find those anywhere.

No matter how long it was left in an area, there was always dirt left behind; sometimes it seemed as if it were picking up dirt in one place and depositing it in another. It is also quite noisy; having it cleaning in another room required cranking up the volume on the television in order to hear.

The basic problem that I had was caused by cheap Chinese construction; that is, the cheezy wooden steering wheel on the front of the Roomba was worn down all too quickly on our hard porcelain tiles. Most of the replacements wouldn't have been necessary if the steering wheel had been made of a space-age material that didn't wear so quickly. C'mon guys, how much would that have cost? Or how about a simple snap-in replacement wheel? This is really bad design, so I'll use this as an example of a poor application of a good idea for my engineering students.Maybe I'll look at the Electrolux model, but for $1700 do you get decent construction materials?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This product is a piece of junk!

This is one of the very best in that regard.The Quaker sweetheart was a nice twist. As was the description of \\"wives and sweethearts\\" coming on board. This is a very well researched book, lots of action, not much of the frustration and soul-searching of others in its class (which does get a bit tedious)... can't wait to read another by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Entertaining ... a Great Historical Fiction!","review":"This is a wonderful gift to all of us who are fans of nautical fiction in the age of sail and the British navy. Readers are treated to some terrific storytelling that is very much up to the high standard of C.S. Forrester, Alexander Kent and Dewey Lambdin. The development of the main character from a lower-ranking officer to commander is nicely done, and greatly enriched by his romance with an inconoclastic and beautiful Quaker woman. I truly look forward to many more great stories featuring Charles Edgemont, Daniel Bevan, and his brave seaman as they no doubt run into more troubled waters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I wanted to read the Hornblower or Aubrey/Maturin series but the publishers of these apparently not only write about the 19th century, they also must live in it since they are not available on the Kindle!!This did lead me to these books and I am glad it did as I have enjoyed them a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below C-level Naval Story","review":"Go read Marryat, Lambdin, or O'Brian if you're looking for great sea stories. This doesn't measure up. Edgemont has no distinguishing characteristics except that he will sacrifice any shred of honor, integrity or moral courage to win his Quaker girlfriend. In fact, his Quaker girlfriend gives up her religious beliefs for him as well, so the whole tale sinks into a post-modern relativist morass disguised as nautical fiction. The characters are shallow, the \\"action\\" is thin and predictable, and to spice things up, another author's fictional character makes an appearance.There is nothing to love about Edgemont and I only finished the book out of a seriously misplaced sense of obligation.Any resemblance to to nautical fiction is highly improbable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"As a female, and a grandmother at that, I would never have thought of picking up a book about naval adventures during the Napoleonic Wars, but a friend sent me a copy and I was delighted. I found Worrall's book an absorbing, well-paced read. I learned many fascinating details about how naval battles were fought and the social structure and reward system of that era, and I enjoyed the unusual and engaging love story interwoven through the action.

The foam is not firm at all, I would equate it to foam you might find a car panel which is not very thick or firm.

I also found it hard to stay in just the right position--maybe the cover fabric was too slippery, I'm not sure. I had to keep adjusting my position, though, which quickly became tedious.

I must admit, I chose this video only because I was familiar with David Carradine's work as an actor, and knew that he actually practices what he has portrayed in the Kung Fu series of films and TV shows. I found this video to be quite simple to follow, and the time lapse video backgrounds were wonderful, really adding to the experience. The multiple repetitions of the moves made it easy to learn, (about 4 weeks and I pretty much have it down!) and having a Tai Chi Master \\"Supervising\\" the instruction was very comforting. Finally, watching this video has given me the confidence to pursue the other forms of Tai Chi, and to expand my knowledge of the Chen form. I would whole-heartedly recommend this video to any beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of It's Kind","review":"Tis Tai Chi video is absolutely the best of it's kind availible! The movements are extremely clear and easy to learn. The music and background scenery make one feel like they've been transported back in time to the Shaolin monastery to receive personal instruction from Kwai Chang Caine. Carradine's love for the martial arts is evident in this (and all of his other) instructional video(s). This can be easily practiced by even the most out of shape people with great benefit. Combined with the Kung fu, Chi Gung and other Tai Chi workout videos, one can explore the arts to quite a level of proficiency. Thank you David Carradine! Your Commitment to Kung Fu, Tai Chi and Chi Gung do you honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparison of older tape and this new one","review":"Well, I've bought both Carradine's original tai chi tape, and this new version. For a student of the martial arts, either is fairly easy to follow, as many of the moves and postures are familiar. Now, my wife, who is not a martial arts students, likes the first tape better. The moves are repeated more often for a better chance to understand their kinematics.Personally, I would recommend starting with his original tape to understand the basics, postures, and some basic kinematics. Then, I would move on to this tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"<3","review":"Hahaha, what can I say? I love the humor of this book--witty dialogue and quite realistic human qualities.

The valve lets air out if you squeeze it. I could not see any bubbles coming out from the one I could check in the water. Had a great time, but it started deflating by itself on the way back. It is now over half deflated. I paid $10 for it. I never used one before and there were NO real instructions. Just said to blow it up, period. We did not know, and blew it up with a bicycle pump.

We don't even live in a windy city, and we in fact do not leave the umbrella up when he is not playing with it, but within 2 weeks the umbrella material started to come off the spines, and at this point the umbrella is holding on by a thread. I want to really be clear that we did NOT leave the umbrella up overnight or when our son was off playing with something else during the day. Never left it out in the rain, nothing. It's just bad quality. That being said most of the sand tables don't even have umbrellas so I guess it is better than nothing. Just don't expect it to last.

Unlike most of his toys, it will keep him engrossed for a good half hour at a time, with nary a peep (or \\"Mommy, come play with me!\\") We keep it outside, and fill both sides with water, based on the comments here that using both sand and water will lead to messy mixing.... The umbrella has been very useful in our Indian summer heat, and when it gets too cold to keep water in it (my son always ends up a wet mess) I plan to fill it with rice or beans for the winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water and Sand do Mix...","review":"My son just turned two in Feb. and he looks his sandbox so much,,the water and boats are the best,,we bought sand and he make roads from the sand to the water.

We especially liked how excited she was. It kept her interested for a LONG time and my husband and I were able to sit around the patio and talk without being interrupted! It was perfect.

The table seems pretty solid and has a good amount of room for playing. Obviously the sand becomes a real mess since it ends up in the water and everywhere around the table.

It might be nice if it somehow locked into the table since a sudden windstorm already took it out of our yard once.

This was a perfect size and height for her. She loves playing in the sand and the water table is just right. I think it's a great combo for the price. She spends a good 30 mins or so playing, which is great since most toys last 30 seconds.

The kids (6 and 4) love it. The only annoying thing is that they fill the hole with the umbrella in it with sand and then it is almost impossible to pull out. We have only had it for 2 weeks, but so far it has held up to a kid thinking it was a small pool and climbing on it and the other damage inflicted on it by small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy design, poor quality","review":"I bought 2 of these, one meant as a gift. One umbrella clip was damaged, the other broke on the first application. On closer inspection, the umbrella clip is a flimsy piece of plastic with a tiny bump that's supposed to hold up the entire weight of the metal/fabric umbrella.The large cover is difficult to handle and could do with a handle. It is held down by two elastic band that's a hassle to fasten and release. The elastic band will deteriote quickly when it's left outdoors in the sun and rain. A simple latch could have been better.A good idea but poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"not very sturdy","review":"I have had the sand and water activity center for a week.

They were very helpful!I found that this table was very easy to assemble because I opted to leave off the leg anchor screws. (I tried using a regular screwdriver as suggested in the instructions - very unrealistic!) The weight of the water and sand seemed adequate enough to make the table stable.The umbrella was a great idea to include.The only problem that I can see is whether or not one would care if the water and sand get mixed together - it's impossible to keep them mutally exclusive while the kids are playing and experimenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"my todder loves this","review":"This is an excellent idea, I got it for my son when he wanted to toddle around , he was new to walking too, now he's sure footed and loves to walk up and play. I like it because it's off the ground and in the south that and the cover helps keep unwanted pests/water out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre toy for an anal retentive parent","review":"From a parent's perspective, I think this toy is mediocre. For the money, you would be just as wise to purchase a normal sandbox & swimming pool. The sand and the water are constantly mixed together. The sand constantly is spilled over the edge. The overall sandbox is much smaller than you think. The positives to this sandbox are: the umbrella to protect your child from the sun and a toddler can stand next to the sandbox instead of in it (which prevents sand from getting buried in their clothes, hair, etc). I think if this toy was less expensive, I would like it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legs are horrible","review":"We were very excited when my 2 year old son got this for his birthday last year; he loved playing with it. Unfortunately, the legs on this are horrible! Even though we keep this on a flat surface, our deck, the legs did not stay straight. They are flimsy and only held \\"in place\\" by screws. As much as we tried to prop them straight with cement blocks, they just got worse. I would recommend buying a table with sturdier legs than this one. We now have to go buy a new one because this one did not hold up. Our son never sat in it or climbed on it to make the legs buckle, just in case you are wondering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great , fun toy!","review":"We had a floor level sand box before and what a mess it was. Sand eveywhere! But what a great change this is! My boys 6,4,and 3 love it and play with it everyday. They love the sand and water combination. What a great idea! It's been three weeks and they haven't gotten bored yet. So worth the money. Only draw back is that the legs and umbrella as mentioned in other reviews are flimsy. Our umbrella did not stay open. But we have alot of shade therefor it wasn't an issue. As long as you are not dragging the toy from place to place, the legs are not an issue. My boys are pretty rough and it hasn't collapsed yet even with 50 lb. sand and water. I believe mfg. suggests less than 50 lbs. Also, the natural colors blend well with my garden. Overall, great toy for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This water table is a summer time must have. I bought it as a gift for my 5y and 4y old.

Neither the sand nor water stayed on the table long but that was apparantly the fun part.It is good quality and the cover and drain plug make for easy cleanup and storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birdseed Schmirdseed!","review":"We purchased this table for our 3yr old at Christmas. Overall we have been quite pleased with it & he really likes it. The elastic bungee cords on either end of the lid were quite snug and did not allow enough slack to attach to the table as easily as I thought it should have, & subsequently they broke off after about a month. The lid seems snug enough without the cords. Also, I thought I'd be clever and use birdseed instead of sand, as several reviewers suggested. Not a great idea if you have squirrels around! Within a matter of 4 days, they had completely gnawed through the lid in 2 places, one hole large enough for me to put my hand through! Keep this in mind if you're thinking about using birdseed.

Not sure I'm going to try my luck again...We'll be using sand from now on :0"},{"rating":"1","title":"How are you REALLY going to use this?","review":"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday, thinking I would do the sand and water thing together, but actually I ended up buying a sit-in sandpit and separate splash pool just 6 months later, both of which my daughter prefer infinitely. This table is good for making sand castles/pies etc. where you're mixing water and sand together, but if you want to encourage sand and water play as separate activities then this is isn't really the best thing for the job. Also, don't kid yourself like I did that a table would be less messy - it isn't. My daughter loves nothing more than to pour sand and water all over the floor - and herself.For the table itself, our plug in the water side leaks, the whole table sags slightly in the middle so the boats get stuck going round the outside edge and if sand does get in the water side (which it does frequently) it's a nightmare to get it back out again as the plug area is raised above the level of the table bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun in the sun!!!","review":"After reading the bad reviews on the other sand and water tables I decided to buy this one. It took me about 5 minutes by myself to put it together and my 16 month old son LOVES IT!! It has a drain for the water, a lid (it hasn't rained yet, so I can't tell you if water leaks through), and my personal favorite an umbrella!! I literally have to peel my son off of the thing! It has been very durable also.One word of advice, when you get the table home don't cut off the black tie strapes to open it like I did. They unhook from the bottom and are there to keep the lid attached when not in use. Oh well, I used bugee cards to close it and that works too! :)I highly recommend this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy but needs stronger legs","review":"We bought this toy last year for my son's second birthday. It was a warm day and all the kids were busy playing during the whole birthday party. Both my kids love it the sand and water combination.The only negative I see is the weak legs.

So far, the legs have stayed on, but we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with table","review":"It is a great table however after a short period of time, water leaks out of the hole and the table is sunk a little in the middle.

I love that she doesn't get sand all over her, in her shoes etc. The umbrella is nice on really hot sunny days and it easily raises and lowers to different levels.Some things about the table:Don't cut the black cords on the lid! It keeps the lid on the table.Sand gets on the water side. The end. Its unavoidable.Its hard to find plastic cars that fit on the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"My one year old loved it, but it leaks","review":"My son constantly asks to go on the deck to play with his table. I put beans instead of sand, and it works just as good (it's easier to pick up/clean up). The only negative about this table is that the water side leaks at the holes where the legs are connected, the legs are supposed to act as a plug but it is not totally waterproof. The table should be redesigned to not have any holes on the water side. But other than that the table is a lot of fun for toddlers, it keeps them busy for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naturally Playful Sand and Water Activity Center","review":"This is a wonderful product.

It follows the plot to the film, but isn't hard to follow if you haven't seen the film. You play one of four characters- Obi-One Kanobi, Qui-Gon Gin, the Queen, and Captain Panaka. You can aquire a number of weapons, and items. I, personaly, don't mind the overhead view, but many people think it's one of the few flaws of the game (although the view can changed to a behind view, via a cheat). It's only flaw, in my opinian, is if your view is obstruced by large objects.

The voices are great and the musical score is excellent, as every John Williams' score. I'd recommend it to every Star Wars fan and I suggest Lucasarts to make a real adventure game based on the film.

It is excellent. Besides the challenging levels, it also provides crisp and clear sounds, and good graphics. Although at least 4 megs of video accelerator is required, I recommend that you have an 8, or a 12. Heck, the more megs, and Bit's you have the better. IN my opinion this surely one of the best games I've played since Quake 2, or Jedi Knight.

You get to whack things with yer light-saber which sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience are excellent in my opinion. Music even better. Gameplay OK.

Special effectsare the only redeeming quality of this bomb of a game. You have a very bad perspective with a very short viewing distance. Enemies can shoot you from far off, while you can't even see them. On top of that, this game is way to short and repetitive with bad acting and the same boring story from the movie. Discourage George Lucas from making games like this anymore by not buying this game. Then maybe the new Jedi Knight: Obi Wan game will be as good as Jedi Knight. Hopefully.

Typically, I stay away from the \\"bank slots\\" simply because you HAVE to find the right machine, right conditions, think about it, and spend a good amount of time for a seemingly small profit. He didn't outline any games as a good bet, he only told strategies and which games to not play. I have read multiple books on gambling, and didn't find anything worth while in this book.

Lund does not outline any kind of a money management technique which is often implemented by most casino gambling authors. He concentrates on slot machines that are unpopular compared to the overall selection in most casinos. Most importantly he outlines strategies that try to put the player ahead by a pocket full of coins, rather than the jackpots that all slot players strive toward. Searching aimlessly for machines that offer a few more units in a bonus payout as Lund advises, will not allow a player any advantage over another in the long run. Although Lund does provide some safety tips to all players when feasting on slot machines, a strategy to break the one arm bandits is nonexistent in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"translated book","review":"This book was amazing.

While it was an interesting approach to the subject matter (especially in what i assume is suppose to be an academic book), both Behar and the book get tedious.Although I appreciate Behar's efforts to relate her life to Esperanza's, somehow the book ends us being about \\"me, me, me.\\" She just goes on and on about how horrible Esperanza's life is, and how her life is very similar to it. It comes off as a bit of a stretch, especially since Behar is benefitting by writing about the struggles of this woman's life. The book is self-centered in a very subtle way. But, by the end of the book, I just didn't care anymore about what happened to Esperanze, Behar or the book.There are both a lot of critics and advocates of this book.

For me i found my neck ached pretty bad after, probably from so many mountain climber reps. Its just personal choice. My legs tend to bloat too with too much much cardio and i like them slim and lean like how barre workouts keep them.

Beautifully bound and decorated, including many wonderful full-color paintings that bring the haiku to life, the appeal of this book comes to a screeching halt after reading only one or two pages. Originally written by Japanese masters, Harold Stewart's translation of these poems turns almost EVERY ONE into something resembling a cutsie-poo children's rhyme. Two brief, rhyming lines--many with exclamation points!! You can never shake the feeling that you're not reading haiku, just some Englishman's lame poems.

This is a pretty straightforward collection of the group's hits from the late 1960s (it must be rembered that the album was released in 1974 and therefore does not have much of the group's later work). Songs like \\"Ohio\\" \\"Woodstock\\" and, of course, \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" do much to capture a bygone era in American history that is often emulated, but never duplicated. Worth checking out if you are new to CSN&Y or like their radio hits. The coverart for the CD is by Joni Mitchell and that is a neat bonus as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album from a classic rock band","review":"They need to release a more complete hits album (pre plus post '74) but this will do for now.

I read the warranty, and conveniently, the battery is not covered. There are other reviews complaining of this same issue. I read a review that said this model does not come with a battery. I opened it up, and there is indeed a battery in it, but it does not work. Good job, Garmin. Did you buy a bunch of junk batteries?

I wasn't worried because I just figured that as soon as an update was available I would download it. I received an email from Garmin stating that an update was available. I come to find that to update your maps on a Garmin will cost you $70.00, 1/3 of the price I paid for an outdated unit. Had the retailer told me the map updates would be so expensive I would never have purchased this product. My family members have Tom-toms and recieve their map updates at no charge.

I am happy with the product in general, especially the screen size and the price.Con: There are only two options for avoidance, and it won't let you avoid traffic or highway. You have to look at the display to know toward what street it is guiding you. The audio only tells you to turn or stay on left/right in certain number of miles/feet.

Never again will i buy anything from amazon!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised","review":"I bought this GPS for my second car. For my other car we bought the TomTom. We got a great deal on this model and thought that Garmin had a great name in GPS and decided to take a chance. Bad Choice - I was very surprised at the inaccuracy of the Garmin compared to TomTom.If I was going to the same place 5 times, I would get 5 different directions. After 1 month of getting lost and frustrated, I returned this item and went back to TomTom. I have to say I was very surprised with Garmin and Disappointed.Positives -Great window suction mountaverage battery lifeease of useSize of unitLarge ScreenNegativesAccuracy of directionsscreen does not keep up with driving - Many times screen would fall behind where I was on screen causing me to miss turnsHope this review is helpful! You need to decide what is most important to you when buying a GPS"},{"rating":"1","title":"My GPS is trying to kill me.","review":"I bought this when I moved to San Francisco 3 weeks ago, and at least for SF the Garmin is more than a little buggy. Since SF has several overpasses and freeways over streets, the Garmin has trouble when I go up an on-ramp and often glitches, suddenly thinking I'm on the road below. Once when crossing the Bay Bridge it suddenly thought I'd leapt off the road and headed over water, spinning in slow circles ... a situation it didn't correct until I was well into Oakland.I know that satellite technology isn't perfect, and it does a good job for what it is, but I'd at least expect the Garmin maps to know the difference between a one-way street and a two-way. Far too many times it plans routes that are either impossible or dangerous. Add to that the fact I've done store searches, selected the store I want to go to, and followed the direct route as instructed by the Garmin only to end up in an industrial park with no stores in sight. They really need to update their maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technology at a bargain price..","review":"We love this product for both its capability as well as its price....that is all we wanted from a portable GPS. The features that more expensive units offer provide no practical use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely slow satellite","review":"I owned this product for 6 months and although it usually got me from point A to point B it took forever to get satellite reception, which means you are either driving around lost or have to sit in your car for 5-10 minutes until you get a signal for it to calculate the route. After awhile my receiver stopped holding its charge so I had to constantly keep it plugged in, and my letters doubled on on \\"D\\" so I could not type in the letter \\"T\\". I exchanged it for the Magellan 1420 and it was MUCH faster, routed my drive immediately, and gave me more routing options such as fewer freeways, and more points of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow Connection","review":"this product takes forever to connect to a satellite.

The concept of her songs are just not understandable, and I guess you're not supposed to understand it at all. Tori wails on \\"God\\", the blasphemous single that turn some listeners away, and tragically ruins the record and ones to come. \\"Pretty Good Year\\" stands out as a great song and so does \\"Bells For Her.\\" Other than that, I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I wish this were as good as \\"Little Earthquakes\\" but it doesnt come close. The melodies are flat, the production slick. I'm beginning to think she's a One-Trick-Pony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to Little Earthquakes","review":"Except for a couple of tracks, I find this album immensely boring, almost unlistenable. I can't believe the same person that did Little Earthquakes put out this garbage. It is one of the few CDs in my collection that I will someday trade in for something else. Sure, her fans love it, but to everyone else...BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst album ever","review":"Where to start. This is the worst album I've ever heard -over indulgent vocals blend jarringly with meandering and ridiculously dynamic piano parts to create the kind of music that is sure to put me in a bad mood no matter how good I was feeling previously. I acknowledge that people have different musical tastes, but it is too far beyond me for me to understand how anyone could even be indifferent to this 'music' let alone like it enough to buy it. It's just plain rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeek!","review":"Does Tori Amos have an appealing voice? Certainly. Is the music good? Of course! Then why are you giving it 2 stars? The track, \\"GOD\\" is offensive. So are what I feel to be other references to God and Christians which express negative feelings towards them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Artistic","review":"I had been wanting this CD for a long time. I finally got it about a month ago and I was awed! Tori's voice sends me into a dreamy solitude. My favorite songs were \\"God\\", \\"Icicle\\", and \\"Cornflake Girl\\". Tori is the best female songwriter of our time, next to Fiona Apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of Tori's best","review":"The brooding tone of this record may put some people off, but overall the musical arrangements are more cohesive than her previous album Little Earthquakes. In Pretty Good Year she shows her Volcano Goddess side--my favourite on this album. By the way God isn't a blasphemous song, it's really about the hypocrisy of patriachal religion. (\\"A few witches burning gets a little toasty here\\"( Just don't take the lyrics too literally.In this age of disposable records, Under The Pink is one of the few that stands the test of time.(although Space Dog makes me cringe)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Tori CD","review":"This is my favorite Tori cd and the one that made me a fan. I had heard a little about her and decided to get the cd when I couldn't decide on another free cd when joining a cd club. I was instantly hooked. I thought it was a little weird at first, but Tori has become one of my favorite musicians. The piano in her music is awesome and her lyrics are something I find enjoyable to listen to and to read just as I do poetry. Another reviewer described Tori perfectly when he suggested that she is either a genious, insane, or both. This cd is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album I could not live without","review":"Many people favour Little Earthquakes, but for me, Under The Pink is Tori's best album. Cornflake Girl, still my favourite Tori Track, introduced her to me, and I was very impressed. The melodies are well crafted, the lyrics her finest. Beautiful \\"ballads\\" include Pretty Good Year, Cloud On My Tongue and Icicle, and Space Dog and God are among her finest songs. If I could only keep 5 albums from my collection, this would definately be one of them (together with Kate Bush's The Dreaming, Lisa Germano's Happiness, Joni Mitchell's Blue and Shawn Colvin's A Few Small Repairs)"},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"I really loved Little Earthquakes, I was weirded out (and a little scared) by Boys for Pele, and I respected and enjoyed Choirgirl Hotel. But I just didn't get this album. Most of it, anyway. Cornflake is incredible and Baker is beautiful and there are a few other good tracks, but mostly this album is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The much ballyhooed Tori Amos dishes out another set of pretentious, cloying songs. Except for the coyly blasphemous single, \\"God,\\" and the shuffling beat in the otherwise awkward \\"Cornflake Girl,\\" none of these songs have any appeal. If Amos is at the forefront of the new singer-songwriter movement, bring back Carole King."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Under the Pink\\" breaks out from under all limits...","review":"Brilliantly compelling, Amos' album, \\"Under the Pink\\" is a modern masterpiece thrilling the ears of all who listen. Including breakthrough single \\"Cornflake Girl\\" this album offers modern music a greatly needed kick of symbolism, talent, and meaning. Backed with incredible lyrics, music, and Amos' one-of-a-kind haunting voice, \\"Under the Pink\\" breaks stereotypes and proves that piano music is good for something other than elevator radios! The lusty playing and daring technique Amos uses defies convention and creates a new standard not only for classic piano, but for all music as well. Powerful songs like \\"God\\", \\"Baker, Baker\\", and \\"Icicle\\" balance the wickedly humorous stylings seen in \\"Waitress\\" and \\"Space Dog\\". Truly an album that will become a legend in its own right, \\"Under the Pink\\" is an incredible musical accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tori does it again","review":"I bought this cd because Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails fame sang back-up on \\"Past the Mission\\" (I'm a huge NIN fan) and I liked \\"Cornflake Girl\\" but soon I found myself getting drawn into the cd. It's catchy (God sometimes you don't come through/do you need a woman to look after you?), \\"Bells for Her\\" is haunting and some songs are even silly like \\"Space Dog.\\" On her sophomore cd (I don't really group Y Kant Tori Read with her solo cds), Tori did a real good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinking into the coming storm","review":"It's amazing to consider the fact that this is what preceded Boys for Pele, but if one takes the time to listen to the b-sides associated with it, the chronology no longer seems so surprising. This and BFP are very special to me, but you should round out (both) with some non-album tracks, like Honey, Sister Janet, the piano suite, Alamo, stuff like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is probably one of the albums i listen to more than the others. Excellent music, whatever your mood. And i don't give a damn about Royce's rabbit. I hope that thing dies. The bird is superior. And everyone freezes in the bathtub every once in awhile. You're just upset because your picture doesn't fit in the bestfriend pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily Her Best Album to Date","review":"I actually prefer this album to all her others, so it's no wonder why I'd title my review as such. It was almost tied with \\"From the Choirgirl Hotel\\" until I realized that I tend to listen to more of the songs on this one. This album just captures her fire more. I just love the edge from this album. I love how she played the piano back and forth between mellow and fiery, most notably in \\"Yes, Anastasia.\\" I miss her classic style, but I can at least appreciate her newer material and realize that she has matured as a mother (whose daughter, by the way, has an amazing vocal with huge potential).Tori has been my all-time favorite for many years now. I have all her albums and many of her singles. I couldn't imagine life without a new Tori album, but I'll always treasure her classics more than anything. There's no reason for me to give this album less than five stars. It's an enjoyable classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I believe in peace...","review":"Though a radical departure from her first solo release, Pink is the next logical stop along Amos' evolution. It's a fantastic work, a treasure I'm pleased to own, even all these years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Year...for Tori's _Under the Pink_.","review":"Tori Amos' second album shows she's not one to rest on her laurels. She explores new musical ground, and the melodies and arrangements are more complex than those of _Little Earthquakes_. Songs such as _Pretty Good Year_ displays complex musical struture. Tori fearlessly breaks from muscial tradition and provides an ever shifting musical terrain for us to experience. In _God_, she even dares to question if God needs a woman to look after him. This album is great, but lacks the emotional intimacy and candor of _Little Earthquakes_. _Under the Pink_ is another masterpiece by Tori Amos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worman Rocks !","review":"Dave Worman should be a cult hero for the motivating industry.

If anything moves, it blurs. The video is noticeably choppy, the stills are blurry. The sound is questionable. You can't fill up a 1 GB memory card on one set of batteries (about 40 minutes). From the time you hit the button to take a picture until it actually takes it is at least 3 seconds. It does not remember settings from power off to power on, I had to set the flash to auto repeatedly.It is small, it is light, it will fit in you pocket. It is actually quite amazing for so small a device.If you are filming for your website, this is cost effective, buy rechargeable batteries. If you are filming for posterity or a DVD to give grandma, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Excuse for a Camcorder","review":"This camera is a poor excuse for a camcorder; the picture quality (and I hate to use that term here) is pretty terrible; whatever stabilization this has seems non-existent. Don't bother using this without a media card or you'll only have room for about 20 seconds of video or 5 poor resolution pictures. To even compare this camera to camcorders from legacy manufacturers would be an insult to those fine brands. One additional note- if you are an Apple MAC user, don't even bother. Repeated attempts to install drivers or upload pictures only resulted in failure, frustration and hostility. Spend more money and get a real camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within the first week","review":"I had this model before and it lasted about 3 years.

There are 3 big annoyances: 1) calling it 'classic aerosmith' yet focusing on their more recent material, not to mention a lot of mediocre filler from those albums; 2) Neglecting big hits like 'Dude Looks Like a Lady' and 'The Other Side', to name a few; and 3) basically serving the same purpose of two collections already released by Geffen: 'Young Lust: An Aerosmith Anthology' & 'Big Ones', both of which summarize all the hits of this era and throw in some rarities just like 'Classic Aerosmith', only much better.

Man In The Long Black Coat is excellent.Steve's guitar cuts through like a hot knife in butter.The rest of the album cruises along until the last track Until The Last Butterfly winds down,leaving the listener grateful on the purchase.Personally I could have stayed and listened to 17 more."},{"rating":"2","title":"New And Vintage Hackett","review":"I have been a fan of Mr. Hackett and his former band Genesis, since 1972. Steve is the true meaning of Progressive. There are many \\" Wow \\" like moments on Orchids that keep in his tradition of haunting melodies, nestled with quiet spaces and lightness. You never quite know what to expect also rides along with trademark Hackett guitar passages that are his signature and never fail to blow you away, and I love his lower octave voicings, if Death Metal can do it, why not Steve ! Also long live his trusty Optigon keyboard ...always good for a few laughs !

It has cleaned beautifully in the dishwasher, so far. Anolon states to not use washing gels with over 7.5% phosporus, which I thought would be a problem.

The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh is one of the best (children's) shows of all time, and it is still quite enjoyable even when you're past the age of five. Who says cartoons can't teach anything? Animated shows are as much shows as live shows, and can convey as many lessons and messages as live shows can.

Susan is also sensitive and doesn't make any judgments about moms who choose to stay home and moms who choose to have a career while their kids are little. How refreshing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me.... but I gave up on this book","review":"First let me say that I'm reviewing Kindle version of this book. Not sure why, but the letters seemed blurry and it just seemed not clear. I've read a lot of kindle books before and never had this problem. So, it wasn't a good start.About 4 percent into the book I was getting irritated by the content as well. Jumping from one topic to another, not getting anywhere deeper and making a point. Since I remembered the book had good reviews I told myself I just had to give it more time. Well, 10 percent into it I gave up. It just seemed the author would never finish an idea, jump to the next one and it just irritated me as someone who keeps talking without making a point.My reading time is special to me and I don't get enough of it. Plus there are so many other great books out there that I just won't bother on suffering through this one. And I will be deleting it from my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having a Food Allergy is OK","review":"\\"No Nuts For Me\\" focuses on daily life for a child dealing with a severe nut allergy. The daily routine for the boy in the story is exactly the routine for my child. My 4-year-old could see that she is not alone; this book was a confidence builder for her. I will use this book as a resource for educating my childs public-school kindergarten classmates and administrators about life with food allergies. I was having trouble finding this title -- thank you Amazon for making it available."},{"rating":"1","title":"not about political crime, a text about communist jingoism.","review":"a very twisted book. simply put, it states laws create criminals, and denies the importance of real history and common laws that resulted from the bad preying upon the good. the book continues this inverted argument throughout. the book does not discuss political crime, or corruption, but lectures about ideas from a clear communist social adgenda. the book attacts the real american experience, and substitutes its own unrealistic, dogmatic, and most importantly, unsupported by facts, its own fantasy law."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Practical","review":"I view writing manuals with more than a hint of jaundice, but I found this one surprisingly practical. I first encountered in in law school, and the examples and exercises helped me to understand where people would find my writing confusing, even when I thought I was being clear. It also helped me become a better editor -- because I could explain to other writers where they were stumbling and how to correct it.I lost my copy when I moved after law school, and immediately bought another one -- money being perhaps the most telling recommendation of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally Good Advice","review":"Very thoughtful read-- I thoroughly enjoyed hearing from such a respected editor as Williams about editing and overall style. Many of his suggestions are good ones, and the simplicity of his lessons are encouraging for timid writers.However, I don't agree with everything that Williams suggests. In his quest for clarity, Williams cites many writers of the past, some who could use clarity, and others that I strongly feel wrote merely with elegance and their own sense of style. Williams proceeds to edit examples from these writers' works, in the process losing the personality of the writing.This is one of the few flaws I found in his book, and overall I would recommend Style: Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace to anyone who struggles for readable prose that doesn't sounds like something written by a twelve-year-old."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you work at your writing but it doesn't get better, read this slender book.","review":"You can be highly literate, and know good writing from bad, and hate your own writing and not know why.

GREAT BUY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How about some quilling in your quilling book?","review":"It's ok. It's more of a scrapbooking and card making book than a quilling book. The best part was the alphabet (upper and lower case)and numbers. Some of the designs are nice too. But not enough quilling for me. It's got lots of how to make cards and step by step scrapbook pages. Mostly I'm not going to be using more than half of the book. The scrapbook pages are so detailed that it's like you got to have the same picture just to make that same page. So, if your trying to JUST quill this book is not for you. But as for what quilling it does have they are nice. Designs that I haven't seen in other books, except a little too simple for some. But if you have kids, are religous, and can't come up with any idea's of your own for scrapbooking and cards this is probably a better book for you then it is for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product.","review":"One controller did not work.

I've been very disappointed by the Sunbeam blankets these last 10 years or so ; that's why I sought out a different brand. So far , so good. Nice and warm with good temp control. I like the color, too. ******** Follow-up Report (Nov 2011): Sad to say that this electric blanket has been a disappointment. It was NOT laundered but rather it was carefully stored in the linen closet during the warmer months. Now it is chilly again and I expected it to work as well as the first few months ....... but NOTHING. No warmth except in one little strand ...... 90% of it stays stone cold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then Sunbeam!","review":"After buying 2 sunbeam king electric blankets for $138.00 each in the last 2 years and neither keeping me warm on the high setting or warming my mattress when I preheated 1 hour before bed time I got fed up. I decided to buy a Biddeford king electric blanket from [...]. I was lucky enough to find one there for $59.00 a week ago. (After just checking they're back up to $119.00). I am so happy with my new Biddeford blanket! It warms up my mattress before bed time and keeps me warm all night long! It is well worth the $119.00 it sells for now and if I would have bought it before the Sunbeam blankets I would have saved $276.00! It is of better quality then the Sunbeam also so I don't think I'll have any problems with it lasting for many years.

My last two worked 2-3 days! I would not say it was just a fluke...that is poor quality! And I follow ever care instruction listed! Not like the old electric blankets ( that is why they are so hard to find)...now those blankets from 20-30 years ago lasted forever and stayed piping hot! Why did I keep buying them? 1. They are one of the only brands around for purchase and 2. They were marked down (guess you get what you pay for...no actually, not even that!) What I wouldn't do for a old Sears blanket!!! Stay away from these unless you are looking for a temporary electric blanket!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biddeford has bad controllers","review":"We purchased a king size Biddeford electric blanket about 4 years ago. This model has the digital controllers. I don't know if I just have bad luck, but I plugged it in again today for the upcoming winter and found that one of the controllers didn't work. The same thing happened last year. I have now replaced two digital controllers in one year. Oddly enough, the controllers worked the day before I unplugged them for the summer.

We have the queen-sized blanket with dual controls and my husband didn't even bother to plug his in. I, however, used it religiously, often starting it before brushing my teeth so it can be warming up. All that came to a halt last night when the power unit didn't even light up. I switched units and it's not the wires in the blanket that died, but the unit itself. I then did some online research and discovered that it's not uncommon for these to fail within the first year of purchase (so definitely use those warranties!).

My first one lasted almost 5 years before one side quit heating. The second only three years, but the quality of the blanket, thickness, thin wiring, gave me confidence to purchase a new one. I have also given at least 6 as gifts over the years. Never again! The new blanket is thinner than a sheet blanket. The wiring twists and can be felt through the top sheet. It is covered with fuzz and lint, and to top it off, if I pull it just up to the pillow when putting it on the bed , it only hangs over the foot by several inches. I was worried it would come apart when I removed it from the package, I would never dare wash it. I am really upset over the complete change in the quality of the blanket.

I really didn't want to compare it to the Baby Einstein Baby Mozart DVD, but it's impossible not to. The images on this Baby Genius DVD stay on the screen for longer periods of time and they tend to be more pastel rather than primary. Also, on the Genius DVD, there are images of animals (a brown squirrel running around on brown grass - which makes no sense to me since babies are stimulated by bright colors) and children who really aren't doing anything that entertaining or interesting. I really prefer the Baby Einstein Baby Mozart DVD because the images are brighter, they rotate in shorter periods of time (keeping my son's interest piqued), and the hand puppets and toys shown are just generally better and more interesting than the Baby Genius DVD.

They put a song on here from Get Free or Die Tryin'(maybe for those who did not hear it) and that kind of bothered me.I know it's a mix cd and not an official album but still they could have done better.

Every time I use this stuff it makes my hair smell good, and more importantly removes the oil and dirt quickly from my scalp. I notice that it works longer than my previous Burt Bees Shampoo.HOWEVER, not all Aubrey Shampoos are created equal. I tried the Egyptian Henna (Specially for oily hair) and that line left my hair gross and was difficult to wash out. Really didn't like that one at all. Left a filmy residue on my hair that I never seem to be able to wash out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, mild shampoo, pleasant smell","review":"I have been using this shampoo for two years and I really like it. I chose it because chamomile is known to lighten hair color, although the manufacturer makes no such claims. (The Body Shop had a chamomile shampoo many years ago that noticeably, gently brightened my dirty blonde hair with daily use. While I havent noticed that effect with this shampoo, I probably don't wash my hair enough these days to know for sure.) I like the subtle scent and the all-natural ingredients of this formulation. For people used to conventional shampoos, which are really \\"soapy\\" and suds up quickly, this might be an adjustment. It's much milder, and you need to use a bit more when you wash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold ambition","review":"Dating from 1969, Downhill Racer holds up remarkably well both as a character study and a visually impressive journey into the world of Olympic skiing. Robert Redford, in the title role, plays an egotistical loner aiming for Olympic Gold. Coming from a background of rural poverty, he is fiercely determined to achieve fame and fortune. Often abrasive and laconic, he is openly contemptuous of people who lack his ambition, and resentful of those who have been born to wealth. Gene Hackman provides an interesting foil, recognizing his ability, but manipulating him for his own purposes. All this plays out against a background of lofty mountain scenery and high-speed ski runs. There is something very legitimate about the characterizations here: the implicit subtext is that success requires both relentless perseverance and an element of cold-bloodedness."},{"rating":"1","title":"For visuals only","review":"Downhill Racer is essentially, a movie to see only for the terrific skiing sequences. Although there is a story here, Robert Redford's character, a skier trying to make the U.S. Olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why to care about him at all. Gene Hackman, in an early performance, adds nicely, but this is a film that could be watched with the sound off, and it wouldn't make much of a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Jersey Was a Gift for Someone Else.","review":"The item arrived sooner than I expected.

From the dramatic howling dogs introduction, through the gripping title track, Sweet Thing, Candidate, Sweet Thing Reprise and into the catchy Rebel Rebel it's a marvelous tour de force, comparable to the best work on his classic albums.I love the innovative piano rolls on Sweet Thing, and as elsewhere observed, the bridge between the Reprise and Rebel Rebel is absolutely brilliant. Rock \`n Roll with me is another powerful song while Big Brother/Chant impresses with its complex arrangement.Diamond Dogs is pure rock, free of the strange cabaret songs that dominatedAladdin Sane. And compared toYoung Americansof 1975, it is warm-blooded, human and vibrant. Perhaps this album needs to be assessed on its own terms, not in context of what went before or after. As such, it's a solid album with melodic songs and interesting ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers in that the Baby Genius series is not very educational.The images are very good, but the rapid pace between them doesn't allow such young viewers to distinguish or enjoy them.

None of us are from the inner city, all but one New Jersey scout eventually made the rank of Eagle, and we all revere the outdoors, even to this very day.

The aviator looks familiar--wasn't he in the Flying Corps, Ninety-Two Squadron back in 1917? Well... maybe. But how did a good English lad get mixed up in this Soviet business?The most memorable chapter is a solo flight Moran takes from England to Italy, navigating with a couple of map pages torn from an Encyclopedia Brittanica, sustaining himself en route with a flask of brandy and a couple of sandwiches made by the girl we hope he'll marry if he makes it back to England alive...Thanks for a fun ride, Mr. Shute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I purchased this extra transmitter after purchasing my second Harley-Davidson motorcycle.

However, it looks like Citizen Caine next to this rediculous steaming turd of a flm. Blame must be placed entirely on the writing and directing, as the acting is actually quite good. Now I'm all in favor of films that attempt to add to the Romero spin on the undead, you should only watch this as an excercise in how to make a truely horrible zombie film. I kept watching even after I lost interest, and I still only got halfway through this film. As a die hard cinophile, I will watch even movies I HATE at least twice, and I couldn't sit through this once.

It had nothing to do with Romero's Zombie flicks at all whatsoever and was probably a cheap cash-in on his franchise!

After a slightly entertaining first five minutes (the inept special forces team and least gave me a few laughs as they 'contain' a hospital with their rather pathetic skills), the movie degenerates into a talkfest with dull characters doing amazingly dull things - but do we have an exciting finale? Well no! No no no no no. A few people falling on others and pretending to eat them. The lead characters doing nothing in particular. The lead bad guys doing nothing in particular. A few messy looking zombies that are ineffective because - gasp, the things they are doing are so tension free, relatively goreless and frankly dull.I'm sorry, folks, but the crime of dullness has been committed . . . this movie is found guilty on all fronts.I know.

This movie is about space zombies that have a higher thought process than the reqular run of the mill zombies. They have a telepathic link to each other, morph into spacelike creatures after eating human flesh, and make regular zombies by biting and killing people. If I was George I would be seriously pissed off for this movie being related in any way, shape, or form to his series. I did give this film two stars for at least being a somewhat creative prospective towards the zombie genre.

The topics covered are done in brief, five minute (+/-) vignettes with very limited explanation of the data and how it relates to the feature being discussed. Essentially, you receive narration on what you see (i.e.: \\"now, I'll press this button and we can see that this feature opens...\\").More a short guided tour of the software than anything leaning toward genuine instruction / explanation. Crystal Reports is a very powerful analytical tool, and this group of videos only serves to scratch the surface in a very brief, confusing way.If you expect to come away with anything more than only the most spotty and limited understanding of CR, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rossini visits [...]","review":"I'm not sure why this is called \\"Rossini's Visitor\\" when the title seems to be \\"[...]\\".

Although I'm not over weight I feel my body craving for tone and definition. This video is GREAT for all levels. There is so much opportunity for switching between high and low intensities.

They're there to really help you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Unhip, but totally works","review":"I agree with another reviewer... this is not an exciting workout, but I have been coming back to this workout time and again for over 10 years. This routine goes by so quickly and doesn't kill you, yet you get fit so soon! Start off by using \\"no step\\" a few times and before you know it, you are putting everything you have into it with the step.I rarely did the abs part of the workout because I am always crunched for time. Also, this workout NEVER hurt my back. I quit this out of sheer boredom and tried the firm for 9 months and really killed my back. I've just gone back to Jane and will probably never leave her again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for novices; not challenging for intermediate or advanced","review":"The step part is too simple and does not have enough moves to keep it interesting (you can only do basic step so many times before you look at the clock, you know?).

I had much more fun at a gym step class than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Step Aerobic Tape","review":"This is the worst step aerobic tape that I have ever purchased. Don't waste your time or money purchasing this video. Jane Fonda doesn't even instruct the step aerobics! This video is a joke. I didn't even break a sweat.

I did fast forward through the video and watch to see if the routine ever became more challenging, but it did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for more instruction","review":"I had a hard time following steps because instructors are facing you.

Most of my fellow students are of traditional university age and the long references to World War II and other historical eras are just not interesting to them. I am one of the only students who remembers the removal of the Berlin Wall!

The sound quality noticeably lags the Philips HS500's and HS820's. This is the second SHS series phone that I gave a low rating because of sound quality. Check out my cumulative ratings under Philips HS820.The strangest thing about these phones is when I turn my head; I hear a \\"zizzing\\" noise. I turned down the volume and it is still there.

They twist in on your head and are horribly uncomfortable. I have an average size head and didn't ever think this would be a problem. My husband said they were fine, but my kids agreed with me.

My 2 year old (now nearly 3 and a very big child) is very happy in the front seat. The only downside is that she was too tall for the sunshade so I have never been able to use the sunshade on the front seat. She often sleeps when in the stroller and it is so easy to recline her seat and the back seat. Also easy to put the rain cover on and take it off. I had two punctures but it was just a matter of bringing the wheel to a bicycle shop to get a new tube. What is truly impressive is that I damaged the front brake disc two days ago, when the front wheel came off (appears that I did not put it on fully after I pumped some air into it).

His guitar playing on this shows why he's one of rock's best. The vocals are strong and inspired. He has a great band backing him including Nathan East, Steve Ferrone, and Phil Collins. Most of the songs are hard rock with a few blues rock songs and mellow song or 2. Bad Love, Pretending, Anything For Your Love, and No Alibis are the best songs on this CD.

If you appreciate the acoustic setting, get the Unplugged album. Either one of these you will not regret even though they are all good.

I found myself frequently re-reading paragraphs to make sure I wasn't missing something important, because the concepts that he took four pages to explain couldn't POSSIBLY be as simple as I was understanding them to be, right?! Wrong. They ARE that simple, and most of the text in this book is essentially pointless.In short, use the glossary in this book if you must, and take notes from that. At least that way you can avoid most of the self-adulation and long-windedness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring as hell","review":"I had to use this textbook for my world politics class and hardly learned anything.

I picked up Heidi's book from our church, and couldn't put it down. I've read alot of books on Columbine and all are good. This is no exception. Although it is short, I like that, as it doesn't take long to read and doesn't overstate things twice. I like how Heidi has it set up, with her life before Columbine, the shootings themselves, and her life now afterwards. It is a personal account, and perhaps can help some people who are still dealing with it come to terms with it, or at least make it more of a reality. It gets one inside the head of a survivor who was there and makes all that we heard on the news and saw in the papers come alive.

Beats are an improvement however, and there's a lot of variation throughout the album, as no song really sounds the same. I'm more into the eerie sounding gangsta songs such as \\"Kill or Be Killed\\", \\"Yeah N*gga Yeah\\", and \\"Bout Mine.\\" Other songs I liked were \\"Face Up\\", \\"Gotta Get Me\\", and \\"Real N*gga.\\" Overall a good listen, with lots of distinction throughout.

Hundreds of good ideas, but much more importantly, a blueprint for putting those ideas into action.That's right. Not only does the book contain information about the single most powerful marketing force available to the entrepreneurial professional, it has worksheets to help you not just read about building referral business, but to actually start building your referral network.

Mind you, I was expecting something as good as White on Blonde and the Hush. This album doesn't flow like the other two and feels rather uninspired. I'd have to say, I hate the added the R&B and rap insertions, I think this trend of adding R&B to pop songs is getting old. There is not a single song I liked on this entire album and not one song stood out as even remotely catchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Texas Invade America?","review":"Careful What You Wish For is rockier than their last two albums, but no less enjoyable. In fact, the more I listen to it the more I like it. It's quite diverse, with rock, pop, regggae influences, even a little punk. Held together by Sharleen's beautiful voice and the best pop songwriting in the business! The title track as a killer, as is Where Did You Sleep. I'm not crazy about every single song (Carosel Dub didn't strike me), but hey, that's me. Let's hope this album is the one to finally bring Texas the US recognition they so painfully deserve. The fans are still waiting!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning variety","review":"Be Careful What You Wish For really is a great album and a stunning showcase of this band's versatility. It contains at least 5 classic compositions, of which Telephone X is one of the best: an up-tempo number with innovative electronic infusions and a great tune.The best dance tracks are the ragga-style Carnival Girl and its remix Carousel Dub, And I Dream, Place In My World and Broken. All of these have catchy hooks and foot-tapping rhythms. Of the slower songs, my favourites are Another Day and I'll See It Through, both moving ballads with poetic lyrics where Spiteri's voice is displayed in all its beauty.The songs that stay closest to the familiar Texas sound are the aforementioned I'll See It Through, Another Day and the title track with its lovely piano. But overall this album is a welcome exploration of new territory, as it provides a refreshing blend of ragga, pop and dance in a set of beautiful and memorable songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cathy's Concepts Sparkling Entwined Ring pillow","review":"Not happy with item.

I contacted customer service and they were hard to reach. The one e-mail response I got only included a copy of the instruction manual. Since I had already exhausted all the options in the manual this was not helpful. I have players, a RCA and another Coby, the other Coby has the same problem even though it's a more expensive product with more memory and options. My RCA still works great. Avoid this product, it is hard to keep working and reprogram. Since I purchase and use a lot of PC equipement and help others with their stuff, I am very well informed. I recommend skipping this product, it's not worth the cheap price. Since my brother gave me the other Coby at the same as a gift, at least I am not out the price of two useless players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable job of explaining \\"the other side of the coin\\"","review":"The use of references in the book are excellent, and I especially appreciate the references mentioned throughout the book after many important points. I also think Dr.O'Shea did an excellent job of placing certain terms or important points in bold. The discussions on the difference between Vaccination vs. Immunization, Natural vs. Artificial Immunity, and the decline in diseases prior to vaccines also make very good and important points. If anyone has any doubts as to whether or not the government is putting their health and well-being first, just read this book and you will find the answer when he explains the money and political sides of vaccination. And remember, VACCINATION is the correct term, NOT IMMUNIZATION."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rough Prose, Great Content","review":"At first blush, this book seems a little alarmist. However, if you have any inkling of the influence of megacorporations, you'll realize that all of this is more than plausible. You need to read many books and talk to many people before you make vaccination decisions. You also have to look at everything you are doing to keep your baby healthy. For instance, if you are bottle feeding a baby who spends 10 hours a day in a crowded day care center, your approach must be different than for a breastfed baby who gets to stay at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazing view into paranoid delusions","review":"There just isn't space to detail all of the errors, inaccuracies, distortions and outright falsehoods contained in this book.

It gets the job done, though the insatiable critic in me feels like struggles to be more than the sum of its parts. Tracks 1 and 5 are my top picks.Evidently this band now goes by the name 'Gringo Starr', proving that they really can not pick a stage name to save their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited information","review":"This book is a major disapointment, as it is pretty much just a few ships from many different navies with little in the way of descriptions or information. Why these ships were chosen is not explained, and there is so little information about each one, that it is impossible to make any sort of generalizations about them. Even worse, the information presented could be found almost anywhere, and there is nothing new here. It does not seem that the author has anything new to add. For example, the French carrier Charles De Gaulle is presented, but the author presents nothing in the way of why it was built, the problems it has had, and the interesting anti-roll feature is mentioned, but there is no explanation as to what it is or how it works. Also, and this is a major problem, there are no dates given so it is difficult to tell the ages of the ships and if they are new or at the end of their lives.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good start but not for informed readers","review":"This is a bad book in that it only covers a few ships out of a few major navies of the world it only book mentions things about different classes of ships but then never explains how the changes were done. Which leaves the reader with no idea of how a warship weapons system operates.This book would be good in a child's library but not in an person with an interest in naval systems.

The medium size was a little large for him, but still fit him well enough (which is exactly what I would prefer so that we can use it for future occasions). There are various types of pockets all over the front, and there are some loops on the back. The material is close to a canvas feel, so it wouldn't provide much warmth.

I have read all of Thomson's books, except \\"Soft\\", and found that his first 2 (\\"Dreams\\" and \\"5 Gates\\") are his best. What seems to work is the off-kilter realism of the characters combined with the surrealism of the setting (a coast town based on the funeral business in \\"5 Gates\\" and a town no one is allowed to leave in \\"Dreams\\") and stories. \\"5 Gates\\" is an eerie read where you always feel submerged in the dreamy water-world of Moon Beach or its surrounding deserts where things mostly move in slow motion until drawn to a quick conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for old version 4.0 of WS Portal","review":"I regret that I've bought it.

Still, when I ran across a used copy of Cycle of Pain for a couple of bucks, I figured it was worth trying. I'm sure glad I did.Hailing from the good old US-of-A, Havochate serves up an intense brand of powerful thrash metal. If Tad Morose was a thrash band, this is what they'd sound like. I also think Mercenary (minus the death metal vocals) is a good comparison, though there are enough moments on this album to bring to mind bands like Vicious Rumors, Nevermore, Grip Inc. and of course Pantera. If that doesn't give you an idea of what's in store, I don't know what will.Havochate's second album, Cycle of Pain, is an intense thrash album, full of aggression, but with enough power to keep it from getting dull or repetitive. The changes in vocal style also keep things interesting.

It is fun but if you get stuck it is hard to get out of the place. It is fun partly because you get to play 4 different people."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fetid Menace","review":"Let's start off with what's good about this: there's an extended, behind-the-scenes look at the movie, which even includes a line from Darth Maul that was evidently edited out. The city of Mos Espa, easily the largest and most immersive of the levels, is quite fun, including at least one hidden subgame (a Jawa shooting gallery), and the levels preceeding it are decent training runs on the following levels.Unfortunately, that's not all there is to the game. Puzzles which consist of not being hit, jumping to platforms (which, due to the obnoxious camera angles, may or may not be close enough to land on), and keeping suicidal characters alive drop the game's fun considerably. What's worse is the absolutely terrible voice acting, and the script that goes with it (my, but that Darth Maul is suddenly a chatty fellow). Had this game not borne the Star Wars logo, its destiny would be that of a small, unaspiring game.

We got a playstation for Christmas, with Phantom Menace Episode 1. I find it extremely irritating that I'm stuck watching the movie setup for the first challenge every time I restart. There's no mental challenge to the game that I've seen yet (admittedly, I haven't got too far yet, but I may not have the patience to ever get far). I wish I hadn't broken the seal and could return the game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge dissapointment!","review":"If this was not a Star Wars game I would have thrown it out the window. The music video of the behind the scenes movie action was the best thing this game had going for it.

I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy, a maze game with little action","review":"I waited months for this game and traded a few good ones to get it. I am really disappointed. I expected a Metal Gear Solid caliber of a game, this game doesn't compare in any way. Bad playability, little story or dialogue, and for most of the game you must lead other characters through the mazes who slow you down to a frustrating pace. I really hoped I would love it. You win some, you lose some I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Game But Graphics Are No So Great","review":"Its a great game and really fun but also challenging at time.

I enjoyed playing it a lot but some of the levels got confusing at times. Others were a bit difficult because there were so many droids.

While you can probably start a fire with it, this product is terrible. The embedded firesteel does emit a good amount of sparks, but the magnesium bar is useless. The magnesium is too hard to shave.

Second: i tried it, shaved a small pile of \\"so called\\" magnesium, even though the tool is capable of producing sparks, the sparks would not ignite the shaved off metal. Real Magnesium would have burned nicely, given the amount shaved off.

It was so aggravating that I drove 7 min to the store to get a lighter.2. My sons & their cousins tried to start a spark lit fire for practice in the back yard with this new fangle mag block that they purchased. Result... damaged pocket knife, flint broke, and no fire.3. I tried this with my sons in our driveway with my camping knife. Result... dulled the knife, the itty-bitty flint dowel shattered, and no fire.May be if I had used a hack saw blade like others suggested but what's the point of buying a tool if you had to furnish the other half of it?

It always struck me that a much more logical tool for lighting a fire is a simple cigarette lighter. Instead of keeping a chunk of flint or magnesium in your survival kit, why not just throw in 3 or 4 plastic lighters? I'm not a smoker but I've got lighters I bought in 1985 that still work like I just bought them yesterday. Why not teach a kid to 'flick his bic' instead? Are we afraid he'll start smoking (oh dear). Well, maybe that's not such a bad idea. All these super-fat kids are the result of cigarette commercials being outlawed anyway.

As long as you patiently create a nice pile of magnesium shavings and strike the flint properly, it is very reliable and you can ignite just about any type of tinder. If you are in a wet climate, I'd recommend this over the Firesteel. Unless you are constantly dealing with wet tinder, you'll find the Swedish Firesteel quicker/easier to use (hotter sparks, as well as greater volume of sparks on the Swedish).

I haven't tried any other utensils yet but I am sure in a bind you could find an alternative.With a little dryer lint and some fine dry starter I found laying around I was able to start a fire in no time at all. For those that complain the magnesium shavings blow away, that's because you didn't dig a little hole first to protect it from the wind. I found that when the knife edge is placed at the proper angle of 90 degrees, you will have no trouble getting shavings and it doesn't take alot of work either. The shavings are rather easy to get.The difference between this and a lighter is that Magnesium burns at over 4000 degrees Fahrenheit. On a damp day this will make all the difference in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the hands down best in the Boy Scouts","review":"A decade or so ago when I was in the Boy Scouts this was, in the opinion of my troop, so good it was like cheating. It was more difficult to start a fire with a single match (which is how the scouts roll; one scout one match) than this. Also it put my little firesteel flint to shame.I cannot for life of me figure out how people can think this is not the greatest fire starter. We used the backs of the blades our 3\\" folding knives to scrape off a decent pile of magnesium and then scrape the flint for sparks. The result was always white hot sparks and fire.

They did so right away except that one wouldnt work either. I called them back and the next person told me that it may not be compatible with my dvd as it only works on 80% of all dvd players! WTH! He then said I could send it back for a voucher for another toy. Yeah sure thats what you can tell a 4 year old. So I tried it at my mother in laws and after a few codes it works there but overall I didnt think the toy was so great or taught them that much.

Most of the time I would have to try the code ten times before it would register that I entered it.Since my 3-year-old daughter was upset that it wouldn't work, I used a regular remote and went through the SpongeBob DVD with her (with her telling me the buttons to push).

We used the programming instructions in the manual and did not have to go through all the codes, (only the ones listed for our brands), to find one that worked. I feel badly for those who have had trouble because it really is a great learning toy for a 3 year old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting reviews","review":"After reading 10 reviews I can't resist adding one myself. This toy was bought for my 2 year old and we both love it. However, I think the age limit for the toy is way off. My two years old would sit for hours and play if permitted and as a two year old he is learning a lot from this toy. The first three times playing with the toy we worked TOGETHER and now he does everything on his own including changing the cartriges. I read in one review that this toy was bought for a school aged child and I agree with that parent...not the right age for this toy. I do hope that more cartriges will be available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set up","review":"I just wanted to say I just brought this for my soon to be 4 year old. I decided to test it first because after reading the reviews, I was thinking it would be difficult to setup with the VCR. It was EXTREMELY EASY. I got it set up on the first code! I was really excited at how easy it was and I played it to check it out. My daughter has not seen it yet since it's for her birthday this Sunday. I suggest that if you buy it and it's for a birthday go ahead and set it up. Don't forget to get 3 AA batteries since it don't come with it. I have a Zenith DVD so I was able to set it on the first code. I didn't try my other DVD so if I have a problem I will use the one it's set up on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just does not work with all DVD players","review":"I received this toy for my now 3-year old girl for Christmas. I have read the positive reviews from people who just can't imagine how anyone can have trouble setting this thing up. Folks, here's the deal. It just does not work with all DVD players. I have an older RCA model, and I noticed from the reviews that another person had had the same problem with her RCA DVD player in that the upper left button on the interac controller does not work, no matter how many times you try to reprogram it. So, if you want to take a gamble that this toy might be compatible with your DVD player, go ahead and buy it. But, if it does not work: Oh, the yelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING","review":"WE purchased this toy for our daughter's 3 year old birthday. The night before, we decided to set it up. First of all, the set up for us did not follow the instructions AT ALL. AFter an hour of trying to figure out why our set up procedures didn't match the booklet, we finally got it to work. It was really really boring. You have to watch more than you have to interact........and watch and watch and watch before you get asked a very simple question. NOt enough interaction. ADditionally, the material was boring as well....our daughter knew all the material already and we didn't find that it was any more educational than sitting a kid down in front of Noggin or PBS! THe interaction level is VERY low. WE opted for tons of art supplies instead and the traditional scissors, paper, glue, and tons of colors and interesting items to glue onto the papres have served far better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T WORK with today's TV setups","review":"Don't waste your time and child's hopes on this one. Overall the system seemed like a great idea, so I bought it. Received it today, and it WILL NOT WORK at ALL with all 3 of my tv setups. The dvd players are compatable, the problem is the location of the players. I have them on top of my television, I have a widescreen, and in my room and daughters room they are on a shelf above the TV. If you do not have a dvd player DIRECTLY in FRONT of where your child will be sitting, dvd at lap level FORGET IT, it WILL NOT WORK. Major dissapointment and flaw with this system. Returning to Amazon today, and getting the Vsmile instead, at least it has cords and will work wherever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Does Not Work","review":"Tried 3 different DVD players- Did not work at all.It is a shame because I love the idea of this toy.

I have an Apex DVD Player and it took a while to get it programmed, but after that it worked great for a short time. Unfortunately my son loved the game so much that he was nearly devastated when one day it just stopped working. I changed the batteries, tried re-programming it, but nothing worked. He just played with the system at a friends house the other day and after seeing his delight, I purchased another system to give it another try - no luck. I can't even get the darn thing to program and now I will have to return a second one!!! By the way, there were only 2 in the store when I repurchased it last week and both appear to have been returned. Maybe they should work out the kinks before using paying customers as test dummies and further frustrating our children at an age that is already frustrating enough!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Not only is it a waste of money, it was a waste of my 3 year old's time, her 8 and 11 year old brother's time and my time! We finally threw it in the trash because we were all so frustrated with it. It never registered the choice you touched, it wouldn't even give you the screen that matched the card you put in. We all tried several times and her brothers are video game wizzes and even they couldn't get it to work. Don't waste your money, time and energy on this piece of junk. GRRRRRRR"},{"rating":"1","title":"This System Faults","review":"I bought this system for my 4yr old son. First it took 20 min to program with the DVD player since i have a phillips dvd player there is several codes yoo have to try to see if it works. Then after he was playing with the system for a couple of min the dvd player shut off. so we tried the spongebob activity that we bought extra and it did the same thing. Now my son is frustrated with the system thinking he has not played with it right. My son is a slow learner and I bought it thinking this product will help him educ. ways. but it did not. My daughter who is older tried it thinking he was not moving fast enough and once again the system turned off on her. after taking another 20 min and programed the system into another dvd player in his bedroom we had the same problem. Personally i do not think this toy is worth the 39.99 i spent on it plus the 19.99 on the extra dvd. I hope this might help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed","review":"My kids received this toy for Christmas. Today is January 6th and we are on our 2nd controller. The 1st and 2nd controllers are not compatible with the 3 DVD players in our home - all new, all common name brands. Compatible DVD players should be listed on the box. I have waisted so much time going through the programming list with no success. I would make sure that your exact DVD player and model is on the list before purchasing. I wish it were easier. It looks like a really cool toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you have the correct DVD player....","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter last christmas and despite of some of the reviews I read I said, \\"what the heck.\\" Well, turns out that I should have listen to the previous comments. This toy is good if you can get it to work. It does work with every DVD player. My family and I have two DVD players and it really only works on one. and then my daughter has to sit a certain way and make sure the handheld is pointed straight at the dvd. once you get the system to work, its find but, I still believe it is a hassle because on slight move and you and the kid are fustrated. It sucks too because I bought every game that you can buy with the system. Most of the time I listen to the reviewers but my kid really wanted this.Soo... if your kid really wants this toy, try to convince he/she there is something better!! if not make sure you keep the reciept because once your child plays with it he or she will understand too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!!","review":"I bought this a while ago for my daughter and it worked okay the first time around. I didn't really have any trouble until I tried to use it on our new DVD player. It wouldn't work at all and the set up is very frustrating. I wouldn't really recommend this unless the store you buy it from has a good return policy in case it doesn't work on your DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put your money back in your wallet","review":"Stay away from this new technology. Very frustrating to set up, does not work with all DVD players, DVD constantly loops, more of a commercial for cartoons than real games.

Save your money and your time buy something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIECE OF CRAP","review":"We got this for my now 3 year old for this past christmas. I was very excited about it, but when i tried to set it up on our RCA DVD player, it didnt work. I tried the codes and I tried the manual method, but it just didnt work. I assumed it was because my DVD player is one of those all-in-one things, that's also a VCR and radio, etc.So, I put the toy to the side until this March, when, for my daughter's birthday, we got her a Disney Princess DVD player and Television. I was all hyped up again, and AGAIN, neither the codes nor the manual setup worked, and now its just a piece of crap lying around her room.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS","review":"We purchased this toy as a Christmas gift for our 3 yr. old daughter. We picked this over the V-Smile because of the lack of wires. WHAT A MISTAKE. It took us over an hour to set it, trying the codes, running the automatic program and trying to reach Fisher Price for assistance. It took so long our daughter fell asleep before we could get it programed. Now whenever she does play with it, which isn't often, you have to turn it off and then back on to change the cards. Its very repetitive and doesn't keep her attention long. How you can the Sponge Bob card is for 4 and up makes me laugh, my 8 yr. old niece had trouble picking the right answers. Overall this was toy was a waste of time and money. For her birthday we are buying her V-Smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product needs some work...","review":"I think that the idea of this product is great, but we have had more trouble with it than any other toy, ever. My three year old is a whiz at the computer and at playing nintendo games, but this game is just so slow, it stops often and it has to be re-programmed so often that it just frustrates her and me both. She is a pacient little girl, but has completely lost interest in this game and prefers to play on the computer and other toys that do not cause so much frusteration and consume so much time programming and re-programming. The ONLY game that worked out of four that I bought was the Spongebob one, and it really rarely works correctly anyway. Maybe this toy can be modified and will be a better product next Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea. Some problems with execution.","review":"My son received this for Christmas and he truly loves it! The only problem I have with it is that sometimes when he tries pressing one of the answers, it will not work. It also doesn't always read the correct card in the machine.

Our daughter was so disappointed because she wanted to watch and play the dora dvd! I highly recommend you make sure your dvd player is compatible before purchasing this toy - even though I'm not sure if it will do any good. We have a Marantz dvd player, and it is apparently compatible with this, yet we couldn't get it to work. I've read several reviews where children were disappointed because they couldn't play with this toy; I recommend setting this up to ensure it works before letting the kids see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas toy Nightmare","review":"This toy was a nightmare. My two daughters recieved it for christmas.Three days later we are still trying to get it to work. We set everything up with the dvd player numerous times and it still would not play the games.

I would NOT recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interactv a waste of time and money","review":"I have purchased 2 separate interactv models, have tried to install them in 4 different dvd's (all different manufacturers - Panasonic, Samsung, Go Video and Sharp) had 4 different people (all with advanced engineering & computer degrees) spend the better part of Christmas day and the 26th attempting to install this stupid game - all to no avail. I even tried their website help only to find their server has an error message in it and the customer service number won't pick up (unusually high call volume call back later - apparantly I'm not the only person having problems and their customer service is as bad as this product).

Needless to say, I now have to take it back along with the 3 extra DVD's we purchased.You would think that they would make something that was not so complicated to set up. If I were you, I would research this product before purchasing it.It isn't an expensive investment but not worth the aggrivation and the disappointment of a toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disapointment","review":"We got this for our four year old daughter for Christmas. On Christmas day we spent hours trying all 4 of our DVD players in the house. We were able to get it to work on 1 but the A button did not work. Assumed it was the game and returned for another. We had the same results. After waiting for an hour to replace it I have to go back and do it all over again. What a waste of time and money. I had the same Java error when trying to access the Mattel website and also searched for other codes. It appears that this product does not work with most DVD players on the market.

I would say that it is actually somewhat LESS entertaining than watching the normal, broadcast versions of the shows from which its content is taken.But here's the real problem: it seems we've somehow come to define \\"education\\" as \\"learning to give the specific desired responses to certain questions\\". Is my daughter being \\"educated\\" when she correctly identifies the sound an elephant makes? I don't think so.You know what's educational? Play Doh. Blocks. A ball. My daughter learns more in five minutes spent looking at a patch of grass in the backyard than she could in a decade spent with InteracTV.I have a new rule of thumb about \\"educational\\" toys.

Set up took all of 30 seconds (20 of which was to scan the instructions and find the DVD player code) and we had no problems with having to re-program it! Also, we found that my son can put his hand over the \\"laser part\\" and it still works! What a great toy! A great, safe, educational alternative to video games.

I called Fisher Price and press \\"3\\" instead of \\"1\\" to get a customer service. The customer service was very nice and said that my controller might be an old version, so she sent me another one by UPS without charge.

Of course there is no customer service rep available until Monday, and the website comes up with an Error every time we try to get help.

Setup was simple on my Sony 5 DVD player. She enjoyed the characters as she was crazy over Elmo and is now obsessed with Dora. She also saw the Spongebob movie.There are a few bones to pick:1) Ergonomics - forward and reverse buttons are place on grips for handles. Children who don't have developed fine motor coordination will keep hitting those buttons.2) difficulty of questions - some questions involve knowledge that the target age children might not have. The little stories do not provide info that the kids are questioned about; the questions involve prior knowledge i.e. Dora asking if you know where Boots is - He is hiding behind the plant with Rojo flowers [Rose bush]or SpongeBob asking if you can find the Jellyfish hiding behind the animal who grows and has a hard shell [Clam].It seems good for a kid who is old enough. I will try to add to this review as my 4 1/2 year old niece is going to try it out also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"First I will say that this is not compatible if your TV has a DVD built into it as many new ones do. We had to hook this up in our bedroom so my son could play it. He played it for about 20 minutes, (despite my encouragement to keep playing) I even played to try and get him into it, but its just slow and pretty boring if you ask me. There wasnt enough action to keep him interested too long and it didnt always recognize the right discs. I think it may have been rushed to market. I put it away after he finished and figured I would suggest playing again the next day, but he didnt want to play. I kept it for another week or so, and he never mentioned it again, so I returned it and bought VSMILE."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustruating toy","review":"This toy is very frustruating for my daughters and myself.

We also couldn't get the thing to program to one of our dvd players (A Polaroid)...sometimes it would function on our other dvd player, but not properly (a Toshiba). Finally on February 9th I called Fisher-Price, for the 3rd time, and they offered to pay for shipping to send the interac-tv and all the discs back to them at no charge and give me a full refund. I think the idea behind Interac-TV is a great idea, it just needs some work!

The book is a gift to Thoreau's fans and scholars. Scharnhorst doesn't play favorites with any critical approach. He offers a balanced view of everything he considers, noting trends and doing brief content summaries to save readers many hours of work.

The story line is just as new as if it were written yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely biased toward Muslims around the world.","review":"This book is extremely biased toward Muslims not only in Pakistan but in America as well. As a Pakistani Muslim I totally do not agree with his point of view on Muslims in Pakistan. It is unfairly written from a biased person's point of view. The majority of the text written in the book is written totally without any knowledge of Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter, Biassed and One-sided Account","review":"This is a terrible book! I am not sure why this author is so often lauded if he puts out such one-sided and distorted material as this. Clearly, Naipaul has an agenda with this book: to depict a negative account of Muslims who converted. (Naipaul seems very bitter that Muslims converted and left religions such as his own: Hinduism.) As a reader, I kept wishing that he could just learn to bury the incredible chip on his shoulder and let go his bitterness. As a student of Islam, there are plenty of reasons (populist, humanitarian, etc.) to convert to Islam. It is (believe it or not Mr. Naipaul!) the \\"social justice religion\\". What is most appalling about this work is that Mr. Naipaul often interrupts his interview subjects to inject words into their own mouths or to push along his very clear personal agenda. Why is he so afraid to let them speak fully, or finish there sentences? Is it possible, that then a very different novel would result? Hmmm ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain boring!","review":"While I find many of the criticisms levelled against this book to be quite true, the fact of the matter is that it is just plain boring. Naipaul's tone is arrogant and pedantic. I found it impossible to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"As relevant today as it was then","review":"Having travelled over the last decade to most of the countries mentioned in this book, I can say that the key advantage of it is that it remains highly relevant and applicable today. Thoroughly recommendable to anyone wanting an insight to the places visited by the author, easy to read at a stretch, wry in parts and unafraid to present things as they actually are. Realistic and sharp as you like, that's why it's a problem for some. Like someone in the book says, it doesn't serve their cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious journey","review":"While I learned a bit about Islam in the course of reading this book, it is a disappointing read--one of those books that starts out strong and, at too great length, peters out well before the final chapter. Toward the end I seemed to be learning more about Naipaul's opinions and biases than about his subjects.That said, the differences observed between the various Islamic countries visited are noteworthy and no less pertinent today than when the book was first released in 1981. I happened to have just read the section on Pakistan when Benazir Bhutto was assasinated, and felt I had a better historical understanding of the events surrounding her rise and fall and return and murder than I would otherwise have held."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really good","review":"I personally don't like overly good or overly bad reviews - but I can't help it with this book. Written in 1979-1982, every word that is written in this book is still holds true today. Well-written, flows smoothly, highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A deplorable recount","review":"Writers share their experiences and observations of cultures, religions or civilizations in an unbiased manner, so that the readers can form their own opinions. In this book, it appears that Mr Naipaul's mission is to mock Islam and the people who practice it. He conveys an opinion about Islam in Iran after having been escorted by a man who is not a Muslim and a rebel of sorts in his own country; he conveys opnions about Islam in Pakistan after a very contained exposure, and revels on the mundane; coverage of Indonesia is highly sceptical. Snide remarks on those the Shia community revers is unwarranted. Due to the authors limited reserach and lack of interactions with a larger cross-section, the book conveys a very slanted message of Islam and the people who practice it. Much was expected from the pen of a Nobel Laurate, but it turns out to be a poor purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This hardcover edition is a disgrace.","review":"I am a Naipaul fan. I am sure I will enjoy this book when I read it. However, I was so disappointed and outraged by the poor quality of this [$] hardcover edition that I feel it is important to warn other booklovers. This edition is a [waste] attempt to capitalize on Naipaul's Nobel Prize. If priced at [a lower price] I might have accepted this book as an economical, expedient way make Naipaul's work available. Bound like a library book with what looks like the cover of a paperback pasted on the front, this book,printed on the cheapest paper looks like something I'd find in a \\"books for a buck\\" bin.I feel cheated. Grrrrrr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not \\"an Islamic journey\\"","review":"When I first read this book, I enjoyed it. I was bothered, however, by Naipaul's peevish tone. After reading many other things by Naipaul I returned to this book. What I thought was simple peevishness, it seems clear to me now, is mean-spiritedness. And it is directed quite often toward Muslim people - not just fanatic Muslims, all Muslims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money with this age-old canard.","review":"This is a book that be surrenderes to a bias from the very first sentence in the book.Mr. Naipaul, the Indian-born author, takes exception to many Islamic beliefs and allows him to fall in the trap of letting personal feelings come in the way of historical analysis.The book unfortunately is therefore corrupted from that perspective.Better bet would be to read: \\"Journeys in Islamic Countries\\" by John C. Bennett who unlike Naipaul isn't held hostage to his anti-Muslim passion but rather lets his impartial accounts do the talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really small","review":"I order this thinking it was the same size as a large Balzac Balloon Ball that I had seen at a party recently.

My partner and I got a lot out of watching these DVDs, as we had gotten to a place in our relationship we were no longer much interested in sex.This video set discusses the sexual cycle of what they call tumescence, which brought a whole other element of excitement to both of us in the bedroom. The method of the man DOing the woman is clearly shown, with consistent lecture throughout the demonstration. There is an ease now for my partner to navigate his way around my clitoris. He has found my \\"spot\\" and is learning to \\"peak\\" me to give me longer orgasms. He takes the lead now in bed, and enjoys everything he is doing to my body. Our sex life is so much more fun, and has gone beyond the point either of us thought possible before."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I agree with D. Thayn's comment that those positive reviews are probably planted by the Welcomed Consensus. It's over rated.For one, the quality of the DVDs are very poor. Bad sound quality. Video isn't any better.

This is the beautiful, powerful and simple story of young love, between Johannes, the miller\`s son, and Victoria, daughter of the lord of the manor. First published in 1898, this is one of the finest works among Knut Hamsun\`s more than thirty books, and the story has its roots from his own dreams and experiences as a boy and young man. No others, before or after him, have been able to put words to paper like he did, though many have tried.

At last, a product that does what it is supposed to do and does it very well. If I could change just one thing it would be to make the receptical bigger. The shaver is so efficient that it needs to be emptied fairly often. But then it wouldn't be so compact. This shaver is very easy to take apart and clean.

I now suspect all of these similar-looking sweater shavers have the same problems and are of similar quality. I had to go over and over the same area to get the sweater fluff balls off. And even then, the area did not look perfect when I was finished. My best bet is that the sweater shavers that are far less expensive do the exact same job.

I wouldn't say they look brand spanking new put they are not covered with a million pills. It does take a little while proably 20 minutes a sweater but they do look much better.

While the story itself was filled with a certain existential isolation and angst, Steel's work overlooks a great many economic factors in this gripping, original work. For example, never once are we, as readers, privy to the financial situations of the main characters? What reference was there to the various market forces acting as the invisible hand, stabilizing the intersection of supply and demand? Is Steel simply living in a world without economics? Though her story may sizzle, the complete absence of economic theory makes this novel a true fairy tale. Ms. Steel certainly does not fill her usual role as prominent romance novelist/neo-classical economic theorist of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I have not always been a big reader, most books were so boring to me that I wished that I never had to read them (or force myself to read them). Accident by Danielle Steel was very different. It actually made me want to read, and I couldn't put this book down! It was amazing, I actually felt like I was in the story and I cried in many parts of it, sometimes my crying was out of happiness. I think that the accident in the story was a great way to bring out the truth of everybody's situation. It may have brought out the worst in them, but in the end it brought out the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Accident Reading This Book","review":"This book was written very well.

Being the optimistic person I am, I decided to see if it was indeed absolutely useless.It is.I took it out and chopped down a tree that was an inch thick. The blade was bent before I had even finished chopping. I was able to bend it back. I decided then to just take it apart. The tang (the part of the sword inside the handle) was glued into the handle. They had not even bothered to score the tang for a better grip on the glue and the glue was hard and brittle. If you want to display this sword somewhere, it looks pretty cool. I think it's a little overpriced for that, but then, I've been spoiled by better cheap swords and knives. Essentially, to me, this is expensive scrap metal.

It is almost impossible to not keep moving with this music. I also use this on the treadmill and elyptical. I now have the timing in my head so that I know how far to walk and get to the 1/2 way point (about 15 minutes), turn around and come back to get to my full 30 minutes a day.

He is certainly the quintessential role model for medical students to emulate. As a physician colleague, I congratulate him both on his book and his community service.I am sure you will find this book as hard to put down as I did.***** Great Job- Joe Greer and Liz Balmaseda*****"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nori crisps are an acquired taste but these are great for fans.","review":"As with other brands of ready to eat CRISP nori, this snack product is elaborately packaged in small ketchup-size pouches in large sheets inside a ziploc bag with a silica gel dessicant.

It doesn't give you bad breath, has some protein and fiber, and may have more estoric health benefits if one eats several kilos per annum.

Black people are the original Hebrew people only they don't know that they are we have been brain washed to believe that we are just African. The book does explain how many Africans came to the land of African, they were from Israel, however they were invaded by Arabs and many of them fled to North African and this is how some of the population began in African. Many Africans there are not really African, they are Hebrew Israelites. The book was infromative, however the author kept interchanging the word Hebrew and Jew in a time the letter J was not even in excistance. The letter J was discovered in the late 1600's and the author is talking about information way before that time so how is he referrering to Jews.

Blacks were forced into a title that was not African oriented through out history but this does not change their physical identity, only sex between two distinctively different persons can do that, and not by much as the dominate make up will still be noticable.

Simply put, this book is written poorly. Trust me, I am not anti african history. It's just that the book has the feel of a high school term paper. The content of the book is presented in an unconvincing fashion. The author goes into first person to third person, makes references to non-existent sources. Very bad. I agree that there is a rich history to be uncovered for those seeking to learn about the black influence on world history. This book could turn many people off from that search. Don't let it happen to you. Read \\"The Story of the Moors in Spain\\" by Stanley Lane-Poole, for example. Read \\"African Origins of Civilization\\" by Cheikh Anta Diop. There are many other books that can provide adequate references and make for a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"When one decides to read a Christian book one can expect religion to be a major player, and so I was not offended at all by the frequent references to Christ. However, I found the book to be extremely trite. Those \\"lovable\\" characters just seemed contrived and over the top to me. The kid was like a fairy tale, never fussy and always cute with his Malaprop tendencies; just a bit of a stretch to really believe this was a true child. The heroine was a real turn-off. For most of the book she was preachy and opinionated - telling the hero to \\"surrender\\" to God's will but failing to do just the same until way later in the book. When she did, she immediately became a whole lot more likable! Frankly I forced myself to read until the end just so I could write a review. It's not the Christian aspect that turned me off - on the contrary I've read a few of this sort and really have liked them. But the characters in this book failed to engage my imagination and my empathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Captivating","review":"This was the first Christian romance I ever read and (many years and many books later) it remains at the top of my all-time favorites list. Everything about this book works: The characters, the premise, and the setting. I love the way the author draws a charming portrait of a small town everyone would love to live in and populates it with people we want to know. Then she introduces the hero, who arrives with only one purpose that manages to turn the entire town upside down. Most of all, I enjoyed watching the relationship between the hero and heroine change and grow into a special and believable romance. It's a simple and charming story that works at every level. I love this book and it easily rates 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finders Keepers - you can keep it!","review":"I got bored with this after a few chapters. Very twee, simplistic and predictable.

Come on, I felt like saying, \\"Give it a rest.\\" I normally don't mind reading Christian books, but it was a little over the top. It was a very predictable read; not much in the way of unexpected twists. I kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately I didn't like it much. I probably won't read any from this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Blah","review":"I tend not to read religious fiction but every so often I download a free one and am able to skip over the references and find a good story underneath. That is not the case here. The book is way too wordy and preachy. I gave it two stars is for the cute kid, which was the only reason I kept reading. I found myself skipping through parts of it to see if anything exciting happened. Nope. Unrealistic as well in several parts-first, it is unrealistic to have a marriage proposal after one kiss and zero dates, that's not how real life and 99% of books are. Additionally, there are parts of the book where the main character's maternal skills are questionable.I wouldn't download it unless it's free and then, only if you have nothing else to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much religion","review":"The story line was thin, but ok...the characters the same.

I wish I could delete it from my archived list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Frustrating Story","review":"I enjoyed Finders Keepers a lot. It was a cute story about very independent people who need each other to be complete.I did find it interesting that the main character, Elizabeth, had adopted a Romanian son. From my experience, that is not a very likely scenario, but Nick definitely added to the story.I did find myself frustrated that this couple did not get a break with each other. They just seemed to trade misunderstandings and they don't find clarity until the last several pages of the book.I love all the secondary characters in this book also. Every good story has someone that ruffles your feathers and Phil Fox definitely did that for me. I just want to see him put in his place.Overall, this is a great, light read with an excellent message. If we allow Him, God will direct our steps and we will get to be finders keepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful read!","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

Some of it was to be expected from this type of novel but there are surprises along the way that make it a lot of fun to read.

One definitely gets lots of the Slater magic. Additionally, there are quite a few other \\"second tier\\" stars that make it fun.However, be warned. The VHS tape is recorded at SLP (slowest speed), so the visual quality is awful. The story and direction are very poor as well, and the sound direction is horrendous.

The story line was predictable and dumb. I liked the original Alien movies, especially the second \\"Aliens\\" as the suspense was great.

Star Wars Episode 1-3 were lackluster and Prometheus is even worse. Were you really spending the past three decades wondering about the Engineer and where the Aliens came from? It's here, but you could have been told in 10 minutes. The script is deadly dull and I didn't really care about any of the characters.

Acting a little stale, expected more of lead actress Noomi.","review":"The acting was certainly stale. The CGI wasn't what I expected of Ridley Scott. The plot absolutely didn't seem to follow Alien; as a prequel at least. The best acting I saw was from lead actress Rapace and even her performance in this film didn't seem like here. She was definitely not on top of her game in this film, nothing like the Millennium Trilogy where I felt like she really hit her stride. There was little to no character development similar to the \\"run and gun\\" feel of a late Rambo movie. The movie had a very \\"scripted feel for me. This film pales in comparison to Scott's older work. Especially the CGI, the part I expected to be the best, seemed beneath him. There was just way too many plot holes and bad acting for me to enjoy the movie.

Well, as a critical move-watcher of films by Ridley Scott and others, I feel like there is a certain standard they need to live up to. I simply needed more from this movie.It is not bad, really, in any way, but it has some small flaws in it that are hard for me to look past. They might spoil the story for those that have not watched it, so I will not list them here, but they are significant enough to ding the movie one star in my mind.As far as the good stuff? Wow - amazing effects, and some stellar acting by Michael Fassbender. Really a great example of how detail oriented Ridley Scott is when designing a movie, which makes me feel a little more strongly about the flaws.In any case, if you are a sci-fi fan of hardcore science fiction, or a fan of the Alien / Aliens movies, this one is definitely worth the watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting movie with great graphics","review":"It's got a good plot, okay dialog, great effects and the ending was quite unexpected but it prompted me to watch the follow-on movies. It wasn't slow and plodding like Battleship at the beginning and had a good pace throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of \\"Alien\\".","review":"In my opinion, if not better than the original, it is just as good! Rarely, does any great movie,(or for that matter),any movie at all have a sequel or prequel that does the original any justice. This one did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating movie","review":"I loved Michael Fassbender in this. He really steals the show. Noomi Rapace is also very good.

This is supposed to be the prelude to Aliens which didn't really emerge until the last quarter of the story. Character and set design was pretty good but the amount of action and adventure didn't meet my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prometheus the incredible","review":"I just finished watching Prometheus and I must say dispite all the mixed reviews, I found it to be a wonder to behold. Not only is it in 3-D but it's deep also meaning it is very thought provoking. The acting was great and most of the scenes and action were spectacular. This is what movies should be.When I was younger there was a film called 2001 A Space Odyssey and in order to fully enjoy and understand it, you should see it more than once and I feel this movie also falls into that category, even for me. My suggestion is, have a seat,turn out the lights, pay close attention, and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I love all the \\"Alien\\" movies, and I have to tell you that this one is not one of them. Maybe as a separated story will be fine, but the fact that it has being related to the first one makes it a complete fiasco.Yes the special effects are good, and some of the actors have a very nice performance, but the way the story was handle is wrong. They should watch the first movie one more time before they made this one. On the first one there were eggs with those nasty \\"hands\\" we all love. On this one they have pods with some black goo stuff that does not add any suspense to the film.The big alien with the broken chest was found inside their ship sitting on the control chair, not inside a human vessel next to a squid like creature.I could understand all the discrepancies if the creator of Prometheus was some one else. But this is not the case.In any way this movie is not what it claims to be.I am really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tense.","review":"Great movie. Leaves you wanting the next installment.

The picture and sound are amazing, it will give you HDTV a true workout. And if you like knowing the thoughts of the people behind the film you get the commentaries from director Ridley Scott and the writers. Plus there is the excellent 'Furious Gods' documentary about the making of Prometheus. The only thing this set lacks is a director's cut of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Playback","review":"Unfortunately i can review the playback so the stars will reflect on the movie.

It vacillated between being utterly dull and spectacularly inane.Some of the visuals were okay. I liked that it was consistent with 'Alien' in a couple of ways (though it was completely *in*consistent in several other ways).I wish I could have my two hours and $15 back. I don't know how Hollywood creates movies this crappy, nor how a script writer could come up with something this moronic. With a decent script it could've been an okay movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome prequel!...Don't listen to the critics.","review":"This movie was amazing in my opinion! Don't listen to the critics who aren't qualified to tell us what movies to like and nitpickers, who are never satisfied. I thought the film was visually stunning, had a great story and action packed. Also, more importantly the film did answer some of the lingering questions many of us fans had as to the origins of the creature we know as the Alien, it's purpose and the Engineers. Yes, It did also leave some questions, which are already fueling interesting theories online, but that's also part of the magic of story writing for such a well known and loved franchise. The director Ridley Scott said that he's already planning a sequel, so will most likely we'll have to wait in anticipation for some of those questions to get answered, but that's o.k. in my opinion. Well done Ridley Scott and Damon L.! This is a must see for Alien fans and Sci-Fi fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak plot after interesting opening","review":"The preview for Prometheus was promising so I planned to have a night in at the movies, which didn't work out. The plot thinned rapidly and midway through the show it plummeted into a sci-horror film, which was not of interest at all. I ended up catching up on the new catelogues & magazines that had arrived and glanced at the movie in hopes of a change in plot. It was not worth the time or money spent watching it, which was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu Ray is a SCAM","review":"Just received the Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital copy of Prometheus from Amazon.

In the (apparently) raging contest to see which disk author can do the most to ruin a Blu-ray, we may have a winner. Not only does a giant white bar cover much of the screen if you pause or slow the film (and this is a film that begs you to watch the FX frame by frame), a second bar appears above that one, a guarantee that you won't be able to see anything you want to see. Although they disappear after a few seconds, they reappear with every frame advance, virtually disabling your ability to study the FX. Compare this to the Harry Potter films, for example, where NOTHING appears on the screen when you pause it, which is exactly what a competent author does with a disk. Unfortunately, this one was authored by SLIME MOLD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie for the alien classic !","review":"Just got back from this amazing movie i will say this if u love the first 2 alien films u will love this movie !

The acting is good but the story is very boring and tries to add suspense but never fulfills. If you are going into this expecting something new and exciting - you will be disappointed as I was. The movie begins almost 100 years in the future and the team of doctors/scientists/engineers and yes, the ubiquitous millionaire investor, are looking for answers to our existence. Searching for God, if you will. If you are not religous, you might find the \\"awakening\\" for these folks funny. If you are religous, I suggest you be prepared to be insulted and even angry.

Watching the Colonial Marines storm the processing plant, feeling the horror of the crew of the Nostromo, and watching as Ripley found a way to defeat the nightmare were some of the coolest things I had ever experienced. And when I heard that Prometheus was set in the same universe, I was ecstatic. But for those of you who are going to buy this movie expecting to see the Alien, you will be disappointed. However, if you have an open mind, a great imagination and are ready to watch a true prequel, then you will love Prometheus."},{"rating":"2","title":"waited over 30 years for this!","review":"Yes there were problems, but it was all worth putting up with to see that damn huge gun-looking pilots seat come up out of the floor! That's how it works, and it wasn't an elephant in the seat it was a humanoid! I have waited over 30 years to see that! I remember going to see Alien and Aliens many times. The others were not that great, imo. And I thought my gorgeous wife, Noomi Rapace (she doesn't know we are married) was a great tough-girl Ripley-like character. Nice intensity - and stuff, ahem. I thought the entry and landing on the alien planet was spectacular and I thought David was a very interesting robot with obvious pride and emotions. I'm guessing he was working for the evil corporation just like Ash (bad Bilbo!). So this movie was made for me and I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! That was bad.","review":"This is not a review of the DVD. I'm sure it is quite delightful, however the movie sucked. I'll give it 1 star because of special effect. Not because they were good FX, just because they had some. (FYI - you can't give 0 stars). As other reviews have noted there isn't any science in their fiction. The tie in to the Alien movie(s) is really weak. What really bugged me was when the girl that did a caesarian to extract the alien and then hops off the table and runs down the hall. I took my wife 24 hours before she could stand up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I believe a lot of critics didn't like this prequel -but it left me wanting more. I watched the last 15mins over and over again. Ridley Scott really knows how to create tension and fear in a scene and despite everyone saying it doesn't live up to the original in my opinion it doesn't have to, it is a new and thoughtful concept for how it all began. That said I found it as riveting and scary in parts as the original.What I have always liked about his work is the strong female leads and the fascinating way he creates the creatures with this sort of hybrid sexualized male female anatomy and behavior. He always picks fine actors too, Noomi Rapace is great as the lead and Michael Fassbinder is excellent as the villainous but likable humanoid.

The opening scene made me want to know more about the origins of the alien people. In the end, however, I had more questions than answers. Furthermore, the actors were barely ok and their characters did not like one another with the exception of the anthropologist couple (who, in my opinion, did not fit together).

So Prometheus was the most anticipated of all his work and the first that I've considered a major let-down. It's a perfect example of less is more. Alien is on my top ten list of my all-time favorite movies and I could go on endlessly about how great that picture is - I won't. But its worth remembering how effective Alien is without the use of computer graphics, leaving the viewer to fill in what is not actually seen. Prometheus on the other hand is so overburdened with CGI that it becomes somewhat ridiculous and unbelievable.

We ignored the dumb plot in Alien because it was less sci-fi and more of a slasher movie. Prometheus is not so lucky; the dumb plot sticks out like a sore thumb. 3D effects are great; elevating my rating to a 2.

It didnt its just another bad horor film that wasted my time. The storyline is pathetuc trying to intertwine all his movies previously falls short not to mention the typical to be continued cheeze ball ending.

The visuals are interesting, but the plot is confused, the screenplay is terrible, the acting is mediocre, and it's full of holes both in the plot and in the overall conceptualization of the story.

Adris; what is that accent you are trying to fake? He has an English accent in real life, that apparently he can't cover up so we get some bizarre Houston-Luton speak. If our DNA can be traced back to mollusks (it can), how could this thing have given us DNA?? Did it cut in line between early primates and humans? Then how did the DNA from earlier creatures match perfectly? Why? Even with DNA you don't know what species are going to develop or die out.

One of the worst scripts I have ever seen on film.Alien is a masterpiece. Aliens is a great action sequel with its own take on the material. Alien 3 is a dark story, and does try to do something original,(the extended version does improve the story and helps to address some of the flaws). Alien Resurrection was an okay film that at least made sense.Prometheus makes absolutely no sense. The scrip is simply TERRIBLE. The story breaks Alien lore completely. The characters are boring, clueless, morons. Just incredibly bad.This is nothing more than a made for TV \\"Alien\\" spin-off, cash-cow. It is simply the worst Alien movie ever made, and possible one of THE worst movies of all time. It is a tragedy this movie exists, and is a totally wasted opportunity.Mr Scott, you should be ashamed.

I even tried playing the 2D version and that also didnt work. Looking online I discovered many other people are experiencing the same problems.

The way Prometheus ended basically sets it up for another type of alien saga movie, but then It completely contradicts the other Alien movies that already have been made.

Yeah, I know we might be a little sick of our old drooling friend with the acid blood, but at least he didn't talk, which is more than I can say for everyone in this movie. In fact, they yak all the way through it. The visuals seem like a fusion of \\"Metropolis\\" and \\"Stargate,\\" but there's none of that shadowy, dark, damp atmosphere that added to the impact of the \\"Alien\\" series. Noomi Rapace is no Sigourney Weaver, and Charlize Theron is totally wasted as a space vamp.

The complicated, exotic looking two-hand flame guns are less impressive than a can of hair-spray and a Bic lighter, and the movie is filled with lame effects such as that. Maybe the cliches will make it a cult film just for the silliness.

I want my 2 hours back Ridley, I really do.I will refrain from citing specific examples save for this one.

But - without getting into any spoilers - why does this movie exist? It seems designed to be the set up for the Alien series (disregarding the terrible AVP films) but in the end it violates its own directive by not completing the task and by asking more questions that it deliberately sets out not to answer.

(watch the original alien and judge for yourself.arthur's review is one of the best (take the quiz for yourself), and read his one star review and you'll see why I agreed with him,and many others.( go,go, goto the one stars and read and take the quiz it's great fun!)No scientists would act the way those idiots did.I hope the sequel is better (if there is one.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Prequel And Much More!","review":"Prometheus turns out to be what it has long been billed as -- a prequel (the origins of the Aliens and Space Travelers are revealed). But don't let that one word description fool you, because this movie is much more. It has deep undercurrents that sweep you into the beginnings of mankind. The age old questions of \\"Who are we?\\", \\"Where did we come from?\\" and \\"Why are we here\\", drives this technical marvel along at breakneck speed as it opens Pandora's box to find more unanswered questions than we had before the journey began. Truly a cinematic spectacle, it is more of a cerebral arheological dig than another monster movie. Monsters it has, but in this case the most menacing are \\"monsters of the mind\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't like","review":"It's not an entirely worthless movie.

However, bigger distractions were the fragmented, hokey story and the stupid, stupidcharacters. The story was not very coherent and made little sense.

Aliens SE (1992) was my favorite movie for a substantial portion of my life time. All the aliens sequels were alright movies but not none worthy compared to the uncut Aliens. This movie does not have Sigourney Weaver in it, and yes the actress that plays her pseudo-role is not as good as the original. Regardless this movie is really awesome. Some people really want to hate on this for some reason. I think it is a great day for the canon of aliens. They are coming out with a sequel in 2014 that will diverge onto its own unique story arc. I think this \\"reboot\\" of Aliens is exactly what the series needed.Video quality and audio quality of the bluray is just.

Sorry your brother was going through difficult times Ridley, but Jesus, maybe it would have been better to step back for a bit. This movie was complete tripe. The dialouge, the casting, the etc. was malignant. The only thing I enjoyed was David and his \\"knowledge\\". I just wish Bishop was there to guide him through this massive hemorrhage. I wouldn't be this harsh on a newcomer, but holy fin christ, you really had to pay the rent didn't you. It was a discombobulated farce of a cinema related excursion.....I half wanted David to morph into Bishop. No...I WHOLLY wanted David to morph into Bishop.

Once I installed the new CD-R with new F/W, the problem was the same, so I returned the set to Amazon and ordered a second copy assuming I got a bad disc. The second one arrived and I had the same problem. Doing some online searching I found I was not alone. Depending on which BluRay player you own, this particular disc may not play.

The crew act without the least bit of common sense or reason. You figure on this kind of mission they would have some procedures. Not this gang who stumble along from one disastrous mistake to next. Maybe they should have watched Andromeda Strain before heading out. It might have taught them a bit about how to go about examining alien life forms. It has all the dumb things I have come to expect of big budget. There is special effect; people with attitude; the required chase; plenty of gore and of course the naked lady running in distress. In other words it is a very typical Hollywood movie.On the plus side it is not the absolute worst movie I have seen. Thanks to the non stop stream of garbage being produced it misses that.

I got the first delivery and the code was invalid. Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement disc free of charge BUT again the redemption code for the digital copy was invalid.

It was entertaining, but once seeing the ships crew, became too far fetched. The story seemed to have too many holes in it.

I got retconned right in the childhood.","review":"I might have given this film two stars for at least being pretty to look at, but I deducted one for the damage this did to the series. It's one thing if you're going to make a bad film that's more style than substance, with characters behaving frustratingly irrationally and 'science' so shoddy and lazy (e.g. \\"we're half a billion miles from earth\\") that I question whether anyone involved actually enjoys the genre. It's another thing entirely to make a bad film that retroactively alters the plot of another beloved classic. If you loved the Alien saga but thought it needed to be less interesting and more Christian, this is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted 2 Hours Watching This Crap","review":"Do yourself a favor and skip this movie.

For me to hate a movie like this, it takes a lot of brainless, science-less movie gimmicks. Prometheus is packed with lots of gimmicks that defy basic intelligence and a basic understanding of the scientific knowledge accumulated by humans to date. For it to have come from someone who produced BladeRunner is nothing short of travesty. This movie should have been characterized as the prequel to Alien (that 1979 sci-fi horror movie). If you believe in the existence of a highly intelligent, but monstrous-looking alien who has developed the technology to roam through space with no purpose except looking for some helpless and hapless humans to terrorize, this is the movie for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prometheus Review","review":"This movie is truly awful.

Spectacular effects (as far as the main 'alien' character-though short screen time), but stupid things the characters do that you expect more from. Seemed more like the film was made for Sy-Fy channel viewing with some of the acting, and the plot was so boring and over done. I thought it might give some interesting perspective into origins of life, but that stale story of 'alien race bent on killing mankind' is kinda what we're left with. The additional Giger/Alien characters made me roll my eyes, and though I watched it to the end, I can't say it saved itself anywhere in the movie. Look elsewhere for interesting insight to creation, how about youtube for starters. Cause you won't find much here in Prometheus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"One of my fondest memories as a child was 1979 Alien in theater. I'll never forget the sound clunk clunk clunk of my Father brother and I smacking the back of our heads in total terror against the wall behind us in the last row of the theater as the alien erupted from the belly. I have always been a huge fan of sci-fi, horror, etc. Prometheus was really painful to watch. Almost void of terror, and really constantly unbelievable and at times just stupid and silly. Alien on the other hand was constantly feeding pure terror, and always realistic to the point of believable. Prometheus is unworthy of it's association with Alien. Quite frankly I am really disappointed with the terrible garbage hollywood churns out. Good movies are just so ridiculously rare these days. Yeah go ahead and rent this movie. What else are ya gonna do with $4, eat a McDonald's Cheeseburger.

But this one was kind of a let down. Some have rated it pretty high, but I feel that it was all special effects with a weak plot and weak characters. It was supposed to explain the source of the aliens, and though it did, it was confusing, and really left more questions. I ordered from Amazon Prime, got it in the mail, watched it that night, listed it the next morning, sold it in an hour, and mailed it that afternoon. Was happy to have it out of my home, and recover my money...

But we (the audience) is much wiser now and its hard to watch the science team make the same bumbling mistakes as the earlier teams. The interaction with the \\"master race\\" is not as expected and leaves many questions. But the alien species is as virulent and destructive as ever.This movie had a high bar to reach and maybe that's not fair. It was good but it did not deliver on expectations. It did not offer a clear good guys vs bad guys scenario. This may frustrate some audiences. Perhaps to the point that they will demand another movie to clarify the mysteries.

I was expecting a slightly more cerebral journey based on the hype, and there is a message for sure, but it does not reach the heights of a Contact for sure. Noomi does a great job as a proto-Sigourney and there story holds up admirably well. I have to admit I almost ditched the movie after the sub-par CG sequence in the beginning, but it gets better. Many of the \\"scary\\" elements are really recycled Aliens cliches, but at least Scott is recycling cliches he invented himself, and he is entitled to that, right? If you are scifi buff or \\"scifi adjacent\\", you will enjoy this flick.

When it came available on Blu-Ray, I decided to take a chance and purchase the title rather than wait to view it first via rental. I was not disappointed. The film does an excellent job of showing the sequence of events that would later lead to the Nostromo discovering the huge abandoned spacecraft in the movie Alien. I did knock my rating down one star because of one major detail glitch in the Prometheus: SPOILER ALERT - the alien pilot should have died in the seat of his own spacecraft and not on the floor of the company lifeboat to properly bridge into 'Alien'. Nevertheless, it also shows how the 'Aliens' that infect their hosts will mutate based upon the hosts they take.

However, I believe they had 5 year old children actually write the screen play. It was atrocious... the plot holes and failure to identify that the audience may be somewhat educated, made me feel like I was listening to a Current Day Republican rattle off their beliefs.This movie is not even worth illegal download.

The writer for this movie was well and extremely overly paid, to the point it causes me to ponder wether or not hollywood producer's want to continue to hand out charity, because if so, I have a great movie idea.

I rather have watched alien resurrection, now that was a great movie, This was not. special effects were great. but I could of wrote a better plot! even the first Alien movie was better than this it had a story. the ending was weird, and was hoping for a better flick.

But here's a summation of the most important bits.a) Great casting. Everyone makes the most of their part. Noomi Rapace and David Fassbender are particularly absorbing to watch.b) Visually stunning. It's just a really cool, unique and strange looking movie. Ridley Scott made some interesting choices.c) Grand themes. There's some deep questions and fascinating ideas in this film's DNA. Some answers are given, but many are not. The sense of mystery and unknown that made alien/aliens so engaging is still here.d) Thrilling. This film is intense. Once it gets going, it doesn't really let up. There's one scene in particular that is just twisted and there's several scenes that all but gave me a heart attack.For me, this film has everything that great sci-fi should have. Bring on the sequel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money with this movie!","review":"I am sorry to say this but this movie could've been better produce, it was jumping back and forth in plot ideas and creatures that none of it really made any sense except for the engineers. Then they throw a alien creature at the end answering none of the questions about the creatures themselves or nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why space is a vacuum","review":"I gave this film one star only because Amazon wouldn't let me post this review with a zero star rating. I am embarrassed for Ridley Scott. Either he has completely lost his touch or feels such an abiding contempt for his audience that he could not be bothered to make a good movie. Prometheus is among the worst collection of disjoint false starts, unkept promises, and unmotivated action to appear on the screen this century. I have no idea how many writers actually worked on the script, but it is clear that they never spoke to each other. I would characterize Prometheus as a multi-million dollar work of mediocre fan fiction clumsily based on the movie Alien. About twenty minutes into the film I caught myself looking for the slide bar at the bottom of the screen, only to remember that I was actually in a theater. This film may be why space is a vacuum, and anyone who likes movies should hope that no sequel of this jumble of mismatched cliches and set pieces is ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summers Biggest Disappointment....","review":"Probably the summers biggest box office disappointment. One of the most anticipated films...was one of the biggest flops. I hope the other summer releases are not as disappointing. I'm not making this a long review. (Who actually reads those things?)

Here, you get disappointed about every 10 minutes starting about the 30 minute point. One pointless moment after another. I guess that is what a secular Hollywood has become. I go to very few movies and blew it going to this one. I was close to walking out. Don't see it, don't buy it.

There are plenty of bad reviews here that relay my feelings of this horrible movie.

Just ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing - save your money :=((","review":"This is definitely not up to the superb level of Scott's previous work.

Not as scary as the original Alien but a good pre-Alien movie still. Very happy with purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I am not going to go into details here as I'm sure that this has been covered from every angle possible. I will say that this movie stinks. It may be some kind of prequel to the Alien films, but it has none of the magic and suspense of the original Alien nor the sheer fun of Aliens. It does however offer a contrived, derivative storyline with a plot that is very similar to the original Alien. Seen that. Done that. Why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on par with any of the Aliens movies","review":"This idea had so much going for it: a prequel to Aliens plus throw in the origin of humans. But the whole thing is messy, silly and basically ruins the whole Alien movie franchise. It goes on so many directions -- most of them with dead ends.Visually it is spectacular, but the story and the execution is flawed on a grand scale. Also, there isn't a single likeable character in the whole film. Some are made out to be villains, but we don't know why. The previous Alien movies all had very solid, very memorable characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Senseless and grotesque","review":"Begins on an interesting premise, but takes a downward spiral into gratuitous wierdness thereafter. Question: How does an alien octopus baby, mixed with a humanoid alien make a toothy hammerhead shark alien? And what does that have to do with anything else in the movie? The budget for this film would have been better spent on a credible charity.

Many of the events in the movie happen for apparently no reason and are left unexplained.SPOILERS (actually nevermind, just read them and skip the movie): Having sex with a person infected with an alien virus(?) makes you pregnant with a squid, even if you're previously infertile? Just one of the many scenes that will leave you wondering what the scriptwriters were on when they wrote this.Stay for the deleted scenes! Why the heck did they delete those scenes?? They were at least a weak attempt to explain why they were even there in the first place or why the alien suddenly went berserk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"Story is weak.

Terrible, incoherent script that insults your intelligence. Its like Ridley and Damon Lindelof didn't even bother and were in a rush.

Never mind that the behavior of some of the characters was, well, illogical. (They are still removing their helmets after one of their colleagues got deathly ill from some unknown contagian or alien life form??). I love that a number of questions were (seemingly intentionally) left unanswered. It just made it all the more thought provoking.

Ridley Scott is a great film director, but a poor story teller. If you can look past the poor script and simply watch this movie with a sifi mind set, you will enjoy this movie. Lets face it, Alien had just as much mixed reviews when it first premiered in 1979, and I feel down the line Prometheus has the potential to make just as big of an impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"bought it for my husband then found out it had another one that has 2 dvd's and then another one with more... too confusing....he watched it twice did not like it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition to the Franchise","review":"I thought this was a great addition to the franchise.

It leaves you confused because of the nonsensical plot, or lack thereof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, well done, Scott!!","review":"Having been a fan of the Alien franchise since I was in grade school, I was anxious to see this movie when I first heard about it. I then began hearing mixed reviews, and became wary about seeing it for fear it would be an enormous let down for me. I finally got around to seeing it, and I just have to say I am not the least bit disappointed. There are a lot of things in this movie that require interpretation on the viewer's part; they are not spelled out for you immediately. It also requires some knowledge of the first Alien movie- not so much the sequels. And some understanding in Greek mythology and the bible as well. If you want to see a movie that just spells it all out for you and you just have to sit there and watch it, this isn't the one for you. I thought it blended excellent elements of horror, suspense and amazing special effects into an incredible HR Giger-esque vision. Awesome movie. Can't wait to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This movie really sucked. There's barely a plot and it's poor at best. It keeps paying homage to Alien, and really who cares? How about creating a decent movie in it's own right? Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The journey is no fun, without a distination!","review":"The is a popular quote, \\"The Journey is the Destination\\". I'm sure whoever said that, didn't find themselves in a torture chamber at the end of the journey! That's exactly what this movie is all about, it draws you in with a fair amount of unknowns, and slowly reveals a few things, and then reveals absolutely nothing about the plot of the movie itself. In the end, this movie finds itself back at the beginning. If you like chasing rainbows, this movie is for you, because there is absolutely no pot of gold, or end of the rainbow here, just some pretty eye candy and special effects with a very thin story."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is it????","review":"Picture quality less than poor. Too much lag time. Never got past the first few credits. Would not try this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens?","review":"Worth seeing but not alien good.

Highly recommended for anyone who loves the Aliens movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiners!!!!....","review":"Sc-fi fans are the biggest whiners of them all.... Just like those who trashed TNG's Insurrection and Nemesis, the Prometheus whiners are ccomplaining because all of their expectations haven't been met.... To be honest, Prometheus is certainly not at the same level as Forbidden Planet, but it's not that bad....the visuals were incredible (on blu-ray) and the sound was amazing.... Sometimes people expect too much from a film and then they end up not getting what thry are looking for....one should view a film by letting it tell the story instead of trying to bend it to fit your needs....when you do that you just end up hating it.... This film was pretty cool....you just need to open your mind a little and let the film serve its purpose, otherwise you will never see what the rest of us see...."},{"rating":"1","title":"prometheus asks all the important religious questions, such as \\"who created us?\\" and \\"can i have my cross necklace back?\\"","review":"wow what a deep deep movie. its depth more than makes up for the horrible pacing. the characters range from unlikeable to flat out idiotic which is always the hallmark of an intellectual film. oh wait, i forgot about the redshirts. there are a LOT of redshirts in this movie. at one point a creature comes back to the ship and wastes a whole bunch of people and for the life of me i didnt know what any of their names were. i asked someone who is a fan of the movie and i believe their names were \\"mercenary 1, mercenary 2, mercenary 3, and mercenary 4\\". well at least its pretty to look at. if you like painted turds, this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"freak me out","review":"This movie made me feel very nervous and freak me out so bad I couldn't sleep all night. I keep worrying about some aliens from distance universe is planning to destroy mankind. This movie is very deep and NOT for young people,This movie is very disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome special effects","review":"The movie is a little far fetched about being able to travel to an alien world millions of miles away within a persons life time. Once you can get over that fact, the discovery process that the humans make to find the aliens and the predators is very exciting. The visual effects are awesome and Ridley Scott leaves everyone with a cliff hanger. If you have enjoyed the previous aliens movies this is definitely one to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid Sci Movie","review":"This movie appeals to a narrow group of sci fi lovers. It has great visuals and graphical design work. After watching additional movie scenes on this blu ray that were cut from the original theatrical version I question \\"why weren't some left in\\"?..... they could have really added to the depth of the movie. Also I wish they would have better pursued the theme of \\"creation vs evolution\\" as that is one thing that really stands out in this prequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are into Scifi","review":"I got this for someone as agift but was able to view it with them ! I am not into scifi's but the story grabbed ya"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie for someone who hasn't seen, or has forgotten the Aliens movies","review":"I haven't been able to see or view the Aliens movies. Much like a Harry Potter movie series fan that hasn't even read any of the books, this is a huge plus for me :) I had little to no expectations about the movie, but was fascinated by the storyline and the high-level idea that this is a precedent to an alien invasion on Earth.The graphics and 3D were ok, but you could live without the 3D. Sounds and scenes were pretty stagnant, but I like the gore and naivity in some of the characters especially if they were trying to befriend alien form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, with a twist ending","review":"The special effects are top notch, the story is a little slow in the beginning, but with a surprise result in the end. I know it's Si-Fi, but my only gripe about the movie is that it's only set 100 years in the future, and the technology that is introduced to the viewer is absurd for a 100 year advancement from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has all been said... Nonsensical!","review":"Prometheus is a movie the makes you wince as you watch. The behavior of the \\"biologist\\" on board a trillion dollar mission? A contaminated mission leader who tries to hide his contamination? Major surgery followed by running and jumping? Another decapitated android? Aliens that can grow in the absence of calories? And on, and on, and on...Good grief, Charlie Brown!This was the first, and only, movie I purchased while on a airline flight, and that time through I thought both the screen size and the airline editing must have affected my perception of the movie and plot. Then I just finished watching it in HD yesterday.I nominate Prometheus for a Razzie Award. Any seconds?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"Although the film was visually stunning,the film was poorly written, the characters were not very believable and I found it difficult to sit through the entire film. I just felt like it was a terrible waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant classic with the best in home theater quality!","review":"Prometheus is well directed in the unique taste of the original Alien movie, the story-line is cohesive and true to the Alien saga, and in the end it leaves you begging to know what happens next. The product came well protected without defect or damage to neither the box or the discs. For those that are fanatics over home theater, this is one of the best choices since every frame of the movie is 1080p and 7.1 surround sound, and the movie looks true-to-life on 120Hz televisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise to me...BORING!","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this movie. First, Ridley Scott is top notch as a director. Second, I love sci fi, especially scary sci fi. I generally like 3d as well. So I went to see it in 3d.Let's start with the 3d. I think animated movies look the best in 3d. Live action movies are rated by me as good, to poor. Avitar is the exception which I thought was great. I rate the 3d in Prometheus as fair.The movie itself started out to make me think this was going to be really good. Instead, as the movie dragged on, I found it boring most of the time. Alien is a movie this is compared to. There is no comparison. Alien held my interest from beginning to end. This movie did not. Maybe it's because there was too much reminiscent of Alien. For me, this wasn't very original.For all the 5 star raters, I think you are very generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed..","review":"I expect much more from a futurist sci fi movie these days.

A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn. what a bore. not SF or even horror. just plain pathetic.","review":"I waited for this embarrassment?Yikes.

First half hour or so it was perfect then it started lagging and giving connection issues. I went to my PC and did a speed test and got 30mbps did it thru the PlayStation and got 25 too. So it was not on my side yet I had to keep restarting my connection so that amazon refreshed my IP.Amazon needs to get more professional talent to work on this software as it is laggy and poorly arranged.

I wanted to be overwhelmed by the \\"anthropology\\" of the myth behind Aliens. I don't know if it was the director that made this production a bit too \\"mature\\" for my liking. I've had better exposition during a twenty minute Marvel animated feature regarding the other worldly dynamics of an alien culture and the reason behind the conflict. It's a Blu-ray keeper for the visuals alone but the story won't pass muster beyond the first viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"blu-ray","review":"Its a nice blu-ray.Lots of extra feauters.3D its amazing and im glad that i bought this version.Plus you can download to your other device."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the SCI-FI buffs","review":"This was a great film to watch... totally entertaining... as always though the scientists want to save, study and bring an alien species on a ship and go back to earth with it even though it oviously not a good idea with the soldiers sent to protect them from these things in the first place... but I won't spoil the ending for ya... remember it's entertainment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining with obvious plot issues","review":"Ignoring what others have already gone into detail concerning obvious plot issues and problems with some of the characters in the film.

It's long and boring. There's not much story. Mankind's first mission to another planetary system is crewed by narcissistic punks. They're all American. In classic Jurassic Park fashion, they go where they shouldn't, do dumb things and get killed. A comic book has better characters. Where is the plot and charm and suspense of the previous Alien films?There are pretty costumes and matte backgrounds from Space Family Robinson. The boss alien resembles the Michelin Man. He collects black oil from the X-Files, gets raped by an octopus, and their kid looks like H.R. Giger's classic conehead. Must be a black sheep in the family.Let's hope humanity's real ambassadors are better than this. Let's hope Hollywood can do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ridley's finest flick","review":"This not a good movie, story-wise. Too many flaws in character development, and behavior. The characters are silly and make ridiculous decisions, especially since they're supposedly experts in their field.There are some positives... production quality and cinematography are pretty good. Special effects are quite good as well, thanks to Weta.Far too many glaring problems with this movie warrant the low review.

But after renting the blu-ray, I have to say I really enjoyed this visual stunner of a film. Maybe this first Aliens prequel installment is more teaser than anything but as a sci-fi buff, I liked the \\"old school\\" SF feel of this film. Get in a space ship, travel to a mysterious planet and chase a dream and then find out the reality is so much more than you thought. Cast and effects were fantastic.

Entertaining for first half of movie then collapses","review":"Science fiction calls for audience to \\"suspend its disbelief\\" We know going in that what we are about to see is fiction and impossible. But for fun we suspend our disbelief so we can get on with the story. But about halfway into this flick that threshold collapses and we can no longer enjoy the story because it becomes childishly unbelievable. And even if we extend our license to the director to \\"go ahead, make us believe,\\" it was impossible to avoid giggling while the movie's climax rolled: a woman chasing the baddie while holding her abdomen together with her fingers after she has undergone emergency life-saving surgery conducted by a computerized robot. I don't want to spoil the suspense but my advice is wait for the cable version. We had very high hopes considering this movie's pedigree. But other than a terrific first few minutes, this one is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prometheus 3D","review":"With a fifth installment to the Alien series, I was really excited.

Special effects great, story weak","review":"Beautiful scenery in a few parts, great special effects (but frankly CGI is getting pretty boring), but my enjoyment of the movie was greatly lessened by a weak and incoherent story and sloppy details like scientists immediately jumping off their space ship onto a new planet without taking the necessary precautions to ensure they don't cause contamination or put themselves in danger. In this movie \\"Scott\\" doesn't rhyme with plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a turd.....","review":"I was very excited to see this movie.Imagine then my disappointment.They took elements from Aliens 1 and 2, wrote them into a new script with pathetic dialogue, no surprises and a total lack of originality. It's one thing to use other peoples ideas and warp them into your own creation, what Mr. Scott has done is take his own ideas, chewed them up and shat them out and told everyone \\"its a new movie, I promise it is!\\"And the ending?

Not a very good attemt even using the actress from the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It seem to be all about computer grahics and a badly knitted together plot.

Save your time and money, this was a bust."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a prequel.","review":"Answers a few important questions.. leaves room for more movies.. Friday the 13th has over 10 movies.. Freddy has a bunch aswell. those of you looking to have the whole mystery of aliens laid out and explained in one movie are not using your heads. this franchise requires several more movies to do it justice.. we are about half way there... that said, hopefully the movies keep coming every few years.. waiting 30 years for the next one would suck immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much promise...","review":"Going into this movie, I wanted to love it. I truly did. I was excited when the credits began, and as the movie progressed, the excitement waned. I know a lot of people hated this movie, and conversely, a lot of people loved it. I'm in the \\"meh\\" category. It had so much promise, but it left it all in the trailers.I don't care that it wasn't a direct prequel to Alien. I don't care that it left the ending wide open for a sequel. I do care that the story and characters were never fleshed out to the point where I was invested in what happened to them.There were several points where the movie showed flashes of brilliance, only to then to fall back into the convoluted mess that it was.Watching this movie is like going on a blind date. You're glad you experienced it, but you're more glad that it's over, and you can just move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good prequel","review":"This movie started off very slow, but once it got going it was very interesting.

I learned recently that this was a prequel to the Aliens movies, this only enhanced my experience.

I would have expected better from Scott, who did such a great job with the initial Alien.Somewhere around the third sequel, the look and feel changed from believable sci-fi to MTV. This continues the trend with hip-hop dudes and dudettes, replete with tats, attitude and street language, posing as accomplished professionals. Of course we have to have a baddy corporate babe, concerned only with profits - no modern 'sci-fi' is replete without that.Somewhere, Ridley forgot about story and just went for a minimally connected sequence of effects, punctuated by \\"Oh-my-gods\\" and other shouts of incredulity.Diehard fans (like me) will see it at least once. Not twice, I don't think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to this. An intelligent and thought provoking sci-fi ... or so I hoped. The characters are 2 dimensional and the storyline is utter nonsense. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Answers will be questioned","review":"Wow, this didn't even seem like a Ridley Scott film.For a laundry list of what's wrong here, you can read the other in-depth reviews, but the image of a couple of the main characters trying to outrun the path of a rolling spacecraft instead of dodging off to either side pretty much sums it up. The most ineptly manned trillion dollar mission ever.This film also underscores just how important a good soundtrack is. Go back and listen to how effective the soundtrack to the original \\"Alien\\" film is in supporting the awe, suspense and horror of the visuals. The soundtrack for \\"Prometheus\\" just doesn't cut it.Though I will watch this movie again for the sets and cinematography, it's too bad \\"Prometheus\\" has more in common with \\"Alien Resurrection\\" than Ridley's original classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Advised: Digital Copy","review":"To anyone buying the version of the Blu-ray that comes with the digital copy, please be advised that you will only be able to get the Ultra Violet version and not the file from iTunes.

The mystery promised by the cover page and introduction was not delivered from my point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a nice prequel of the Aliens series","review":"Like the special effects and the look of Vickers actress.

Meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Ridiculous and Stupid.","review":"I love SciFi movies and have probably seen every one made or at least a lot of them. This was one of the worst. I've seen SciFi movies made in the 40s/50s that were better than this one. It was obvious that Scott made this movie to capitalize on the success of Aliens. The movie is not well thought out, has ridiculous action sequences that make little to no sense. The movie was so bad that I now think Scott made it as a spoof of the Alien series. There are plenty of other reviews that detail all that is wrong with this movie.If it made even the remotest sense, I would recommend it to those SciFi buffs that can overlook ridiculous actions by the crew but it doesn't. If you are totally bored, have nothing else to watch, like special effects just for the effects and can overlook anything, then you might consider wasting a couple dollars on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro-messy-ness....","review":"See other reviews.

The actions of the supposedly bright individuals was laughable and stupid. I don't like monster movies, and this was a thinly disguised horror film, not even mediocre Science Fiction.

It's truly sci-fi, perhaps flawed by fan servicing and studio pressures. Critics argue against plot points in this film that they don't mind in John Carpenter's The Thing. Also suffers perhaps, from a more film savvy audience. It's in 3D too! Badass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good film, made feel inside an estrange atmosphere even after finished","review":"I think this film is very good. Many people expected to find another Alien movie, but for me it was an explanation to many issues related with the beginning of Alien saga. I think this film could bring more interesting parts to articulate something bigger.The characters on this film are just ok. I can consider is lacking of the strength of Sigourney Weaver character, even though Naomy Rapace is doing his act very well. In the hand David, the android, has a heavy role, and it is played consistently along the movie as a robot should be.Special effects are just great. I've always admired Giger's art.

I'm at a loss to comprehend how Ridley Scott made this monstrosity. He had over 30 years to think about it and this is what he comes up with. What makes it all the worse is that Alien is possibly one of the finest films ever made.

I am still stunned that absolutely every aspect of the story is so groaningly, eye-rollingly ridiculous.The acting is good, but marred by the awful story and dialog.The special effects are good, but are also marred by the awful story.I, however, can not say that the direction is good, because a good director would have changed E V E R Y T H I N G. Yes, even Ridley Scott can make stinkers (and this one isn't his first).Basically, without a good story, you have nothing but well-done crap running around in a ridiculous plot saying and doing ridiculous things. And that's exactly what we have here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I rented this movie based on the trailer (looked promising) but was quite disappointed after watching it in its entirety.

I loved the Alien series and am a huge sci-fi fan, but this film is a jumble of different ideas and stories forced together into one big pile. Granted, some of the CGI effects are great, but in the end you will see that there were so many plot holes in the story it dissolved and floated away. I certainly hope there is no sequel to this.

The acting was superb, the special effects were great, I found it interesting that our ancestors felt it necessary to destroy us. I would like to have heard their reasoning explained in more detail.

Lousy plot, mediocre acting and virtually nothing to do with the original Alien movies, even though they claim to be the prequel. Sorry to say, but in general: highly disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-Fi Prequel","review":"If you like the Alien series or great visuals, Prometheus is a must see.Although according to Ridley Scott it wasn't meant to be a direct prequel, you can definitely catch some connections. The plot is solid (although it does leave you with more questions than answers; they are planning a sequel or two as of my last check), the acting is amazing, and the visuals are incredible. Along with Avatar, Tron: Legacy, and The Avengers, Prometheus was my favorite 3D movie to see in theaters. They did the 3D effects incredibly well, making sure the effect could be seen throughout the shots.If you've heard some flack for the plot not answering enough, still give this a try.

I do not reccommend it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to see here, please move along","review":"In its theatrical form, this movie is a straight-up botch. It is so poorly written and delivered that I have to wonder what Ridley Scott was thinking when he signed off on the whole mess, and I cringe to think that this was meant to be the kick off for a round of linked stories. Further, I would implore any fans of Alien or Scott who have not seen this yet to just avoid it entirely. It's that lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing","review":"The Alien movies have had some ups and downs. Obviously, the original was wonderful...not for the special effects, but for the fear of the unknown. This movie was highly anticipated and left me feeling quite disappointed. It seemed more of a galactic human origins documentary than a sci-fi horror. The alien seemed fake and even disproportionate at many points. However what put me off was the story line itself. It was almost like someone was trying to convey their belief of the origins of mankind through a sci-fi movie. I enjoyed the suspense of the original...that is what made it scary, not some profound \\"let's make the audience think\\" story. Overall, a letdown for me personally...glad I rented it through Amazon, instead of seeing it in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"And it started so well . . . . . .","review":"Definately not an Alien prequel - sort of a sideways nod to the film, which is only fair since they re-used the H.R. Geiger props. Basically - they just bit off way more than they could chew with this one.This film reminds me very much of the movie \\"Below\\" - it doesn't know if if wants to be a sci-fi action film, a thriller, a horror, or a commentary. In the end, it does well holding your attention, but fails to satisfy. Seems like they just lost focus on what type of film they were trying to make - very sad, because it got off to a very good start. Delivers on the tag-line \\"questions will be answered,\\" just not the questions you thought should be answered.All things considered - a straight-up remake of Alien would probably have been a better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke this movie is!","review":"From weak dialogues to non-sense everything, this movie was made for the same crowd that loves watching Jersey Shore, Honey Boo-Boo and worship the Kardashians, that is, the dumb people.When in the world scientists sent to another planet to discover somethign BIG say that they are in the missinon just because of the money and not for the finding? What's the point in having Charlize Tehron in the movie?What about that \\"replicant\\" role?

Let's see: dumb and incoherent script, dumb characters, dumb scientists that would seem to have been chosen for a hugely expensive space exploration by their level of incompetence and stupidity, a deranged android. One can easily imagine to be watching one of those awful and cheesy 1950s science fiction movies, if it not were for the beautiful and shamelessly wasted special effects of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but everyone is dumb","review":"If you can get past the serious, devastating series of mistakes - defying common sense - that the crew members make every few minutes, then this isn't a horrible movie. I had trouble getting into the suspense because everyone was always doing something so incredibly stupid that it took all the fear out of the situation. \\"Oh, hey there cute little alien snake monster! Aren't you adorable with all your hissing! Who looks like a penis? YOU look like a penis, yes you do!

While sequels and prequels never seem to be as good as the original film, and that is true in this case, Prometheus had enough suspense and action to keep me watching! While there are numerous lapses in logic, such as when the scientists decide to remove their protective helmets because they believe the air is safe to breathe, you have to suspend belief to a certain degree in most sci-fi films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prequel to Alien Films.","review":"Consider this the origin of the Ridley Scott Alien films.

I will say that the first time I watched it I thought it was an awesome movie. The 2nd watching was a little boring. Obviously this movie depends on \\"shock value\\" to keep your attention. I'm star-rating it based on my first watch-through but would say that the \\"rewatchability\\" of this movie is probably a \\"2\\" star.I was also hoping that watching it the second time would clear up some questions I had. It didnt. Maybe that's because I'm just dense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A criminal waste of artistic resources.","review":"Walked out of this flick last month and demanded my money back.

There are so many stupid elements in the story of Prometheus that in my opinion, it's not even worth owning on DVD, unless you're a special effects guru/fan of sci-fi films.

Packed with an excellent photography (CGI?) and a good action pace.It's not a terror movie but there are some terror scenes. And of course It is not an Alien movie which is good because It's hard to imagine another plot with Aliens all over the place. Nevertheless there is a conection and some clarification to the first Alien which is thanked (or should it be).It isn't perfect but is good enough as to make you want more!!The best character, no doubt about it: the android.Probably some edition would have been good but all in all a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this movie but I ended up very disappointing.

It ends there. It was intended as a prequel to the Alien Franchise and failed horribly. I had hopes for this movie being under the original director, but it failed. James Cameron set the ALIEN franchise out of everyone else's reach apparently, since every Alien film since has utterly failed. Mainly because the fans want more of what James Cameron gave us in ALIENS. Hollywood can't seem to grasp that notion. I do not recommend paying over 5 bucks for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aliens 12, or something like that","review":"I was quite disappointed in the movie. It's visually stunning, pretty well acted, but it's just Aliens redux. The dark gut of an alien ship, the pods, the goo.

Also, just because it is a precursor to great films does not make it great either. If that was the case prequels to Star Wars were great films, and they were not. This movie was boring. I felt like I was watching it just to watch it. It did not grab my attention at all. Did it have a cool flying ship and futuristic guns and gadgets, yes, but so what. I almost laughed when the lady said my company spent 1 trillion dollars to go on this mission. This was meant to pop your eyes. Wow! 1 trillion dollars! That's just crazy money no wonder they have a huge spaceship. Give me a break.To all those reviewers who think this is going to be a classic down the road, LOL!

Many other reviewers here have disected the film in great detail. I won't repeat what they've already written.I will say that I enjoyed the movie more the second time I saw it. The Blu-ray has features that give a better explanation of what the film and Ridley Scott were trying to accomplish. It isn't bad Sci-Fi (like lots of Sci-Fi) it's just different.

All the Creator says is \\"Why did you come here?\\" and then it kills everyone for no particular reason? Are we to understand that our \\"gods\\" are vicious thugs who revile us for no reason? Did they create the Alien creatures to wipe us out? Why did they fail? What went wrong? None of those questions are answered. I wanted to like this movie.

The director counts on (extraordinary) visual effects to bail him out almost as if blinding the viewer by cool tricks would mask the many internal inconsistencies within the plot. I was unable to relate to any of the actors, which was intensely dissatisfying - the movie lacked, for the lack of a better word, humaneness. The characters were unidimensional, without an inner life as well as unconvincing (especially the scientists). When the best act is provided by the robot well then the director has a problem.

This movie has a lot to connections to the original Alien and to the books. Anyone who is a fan of the Alien movies should love this one. It's sort of a prequel with many of the tie ins to what happens later (or 30 years ago for us). It also adds more elements of 2001 a space oddesy and Event Horizon.

I rarely get my husband to sit down and watch a movie with me. We both were amazed at the pure stupidity of the plot or lack there of. Trust me just don't waste your time!

If you want to see actor/director interviews they are in the 4 disc blu ray version.The look of the film is great but you spent no time with the characters to care about any of them. I found it laughable when the captain who stayed on the ship the entire time doing very little out of the blue had the 'complete' explanation of the canisters and how they got on the planet and why.It was a 'what?' moment - just like the Engineers. Theron had a cameo as well as Guy Pierce - they were completely wasted.Alien was a home run out of the park.

This time he shows up as the two bumbling fools, the guys who do everything wrong and defy all logic. One guy is basically Begbie from Trainspotting, looks kinda like him, sounds kinda like him, and acts kinda like him. Who takes psychopaths on the most important mission ever? Ridley Scott, apparently. Then you have the bigger idiot, who is basically Skipper from Sex and the City, goofy, naive, etc.I propose that someone edit this movie removing every moment of these guys on screen. I am sure we'll at least have a better movie. Everything they are involved in is a subplot at best and does not really affect the shit hitting the fan. Even if it does, a little mystery could go a long way. I might be able to forgive the \\"daddy doesn't love me\\" stuff and the \\"really?\\" tacked-on ending... Please don't let RS ruin Blade Runner with a twilight career sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dumb, it was painful","review":"So, let me get this straight, ancient astronauts are found and we make our way to their home world; it's the first contact with aliens. When they get there, the crew starts a bunch of petulant behavior and the chief scientist starts boozing it up. Geez, Hollywood, I guess you assume your entire audience is a bunch of freaking retards. Well, I suppose you're right. I spent $3.99 and all I got was 2.5 seconds of where the Alien came from. Hint:from a guy's gut.Actually, come to think of it, there was four bucks worth of information in this movie. If you are ever trying to run away from a giant ring shaped space ship that is falling down toward you and rolling along it's perimeter, turn 90 degrees and run, rather than run along the path of the falling space ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest Sci-fi movie ever!","review":"I mean super stupid. Not even sure what the plot was about, not sure why Charlize Therone was in it or what she was supposed to do. The rediculous robot, big blue man....holy smokes, this was stupid.

First time on an alien planet, they go splunking, see a snake thing, then try to pet it or whatever...ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? OF COURSE IT ATTACKS! What happened to the aliens again? Why are they trying to blow up the earth? What...? Prelude to Alien my butt. The end was just lame, there is nothing new here. Cliche, tired and old, and lame imagination. I am dumber for having seen it. Not to mention the tired old rich guy chasing his youth vs. the young idealistic doctor trying to find enlightenment. I don't like to write negative reviews, but good Lord, I had to vent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic art direction without a good script","review":"I'd have to sum up Prometheus like this: Five stars for art direction, one star for the script. It was fantastic to look at. However, all the character archetypes are still there. It's esscially the original Alien with a few changes. That being, how they originated. While I wanted to like this film; Ridley should have stepped in and made changes to the script.This prequel is to be part of a trilogy, according to Scott. Where is he going to go from here? I'd make Prometheus a dream if I were a director. Without giving away major elements of the story, for those who haven't seen this movie, all the mystery is gone. We are left with a very simplistic answer to all the questions that have been part of the franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alien-ish","review":"I remember loving the alien movies as a kid, at least Alien and Aliens for sure, 3 and 4 were good since they were still Alien like. This one has a feel like the others but there was a bit of waiting for the big thing to happen, then waiting and waiting and when something did happen it lacked the punch I had wanted it to. The movie is good but my pre conceved notions took a bit of my enjoyment away. The graphics are awesome and the acting is pretty good though like other action movies there is a sceen or two that make you go \\"How the hell are they still moving\\".

I watched it twice in a row, watching for all the details I missed the first time...fantastic. one of the best movies of 2012.

There is a lot of mysteries in this movie, some are explained, others are implied, and even more are unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fractal Stupidity","review":"\\"Prometheus\\" is one of a new wave of pseudo-SF films that achieve what I call 'fractal stupidity.' It's actually impossible to list all the logic flaws, because between any two given flaws, it is always possible to find a third. Just as a Mandelbrot curve is convoluted in an infinite way, the film is illogical in an infinitely fine-grained way.In other words, no matter how thin you slice it, it's still baloney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Alien fan","review":"I've been a big fan of the Alien franchise for over 30 years, & can't express my disappointment enough with Prometheus. I can't believe that the creator of the original Alien would screw over the franchise like this. When John Carpenter prequeled The Thing last year, he tied it together to the original perfectly. Ridley Scott surprisingly was as far off base as one can get with his prequel to his original Alien. Gone are the face-huggers which have been the staple of the entire Alien franchise, & now replaced with the kraken, snakes, & a deadly virus!? WTF! Gaping holes are left between this & the original as Prometheus plays out, with the debacle finally concluding with an ending that could not possibly be any worse. The only consolation is the visual perfection that is present in all of Ridley's films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunning 3D for a 1D story","review":"3D! As Dave craddled the earth in his right hand during one of most awing inspiring scenes in recent date for a movie, Ridley Scott crushed the life out of this movie in his left hand with a misguided effort trying to tie two movies together that didn't need to be. This movie truly needed to be a stand alone story. Had it been it wouldnt have been crushed under the weight of expectation.This was worse than Alien Resurrection due solely to the pedigree that presented this newest work. While the movie looks astonishing it managed to offer no coherent storyline and lacked any true character. The actors were stellar, they we all very convincing in their roles. That said this film is an utter disaster in directing, writing and editing. However I am still going to buy it just for the 3D."},{"rating":"1","title":"What in the World?","review":"Can somebody please tell me just what in the World this crap was about? Way too complicatedfor its own good. Utterly devoid of any of the suspense of the original Alien. As far as I cansee NO questions were answered about who the \\"Engineers\\" were. Why they created US. Why they thendecided to destroy us. Why that Engineer at the beginning was committing suicide? What the hellthat squid-like thing was supposed to be inside Noomi? Why David put that Alien substance into thescientists drink? A confusing and highly disappointing mess in my opinion. Thank God I didnt seethis at the cinema. Boy I would have been pissed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expected much more when I saw this in IMAX 3D. The plot was disjointed and was hard to follow. From the opening to the end, the story felt like someone was just trying to make a movie but forgot the purpose. Some scenes were \\"entertaining\\", but I was not expecting to be so let down in the end. Some good cast members, but this movie has only one point, which is to separate you from your money and you get very little for it. Don't waste your money, I am sure it will show up on HBO or Showtime quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to research the web to understand what happened...","review":"I was disappointed at what a terrible job the film did at unfolding a story. I had so many questions about what was going on there was no satisfaction in watching the movie. I had to go to the internet for answers or what could be answers as it appears many people felt left in the dark. The characters' behavior was so off the wall it was not believable. Prometheus had potential for greatness but missed the mark by a couple of light-years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite attempt at a prequel.","review":"Have you ever seen anyone look at a cobra and think, I'm just gonna cuddle with it? Have you ever seen a deep sea diver decide, I'm going to take off the suit that ensures my head isn't crushed like an egg by the intense water pressure at the ocean floor?Though quite pretty at times, this movie was riddles with terrible writing and poor decisions. You know when someone in a horror movie says, \\"let's split up\\" that someone is going to die. This sort of writing is generally unacceptable, unless you're watching something like Scream 18 or Bride of Chucky. Those are movies where that level of lazy writing can be accepted under the fun of camp and too much blood. Some like it, some don't.This movie makes all those decisions without any of the camp. It might be better termed, \\"What happens when we let children who have been dropped on their head go into space.\\"I don't just want my money back. I want Riddley Scott to hand it to me himself with an apology for what he has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and subpar","review":"The only thing i enjoyed about the movie was the set production and special effects, visually it was appealing. Considering Mr Scott's rep, this was well beneath his previous work. The story is weak, the characters are unrealisticly idiotic, and the choice to make this a prequel was absurd since its ability for special effects was far superior to the other movies and so therefore makes the technology in the others appear primitive. Recommend waiting for free streaming on Netflix if your morbid curiosity cannot be quelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great.","review":"This video was incredibly slow, which was really frustrating while I was watching it.

It has a very rich story line and the characters have depth. There is so much to take it from watching the movie that there is no way to get all the details from one viewing. Amazing CGI too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The whole concept that humans were \\"created\\" by an alien race and scientists go in search of them is just ridiculous. We saw stuff like this in \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" 40 years ago. Why add this plot line to the \\"Alien\\" story? \\"Alien\\" was simple, direct, and to the point...humans are the creatures that put a sense of morality in everything they do. As horrific as the Alien monster was, it was simply trying to survive and it just so happens it needed human hosts to gestate its young in. The simplicity of nature's savagery (and we have examples of such parasitism on earth) made ALIEN, together with stellar performances and effects, the great sci-fi-horror-drama it was. PROMETHEUS developed a convoluted, full of plot holes, preachy back story to the saga that just sucked the life out of the storyline....and shameful repetition of some of the events from ALIEN along the way to try and up the horror ante. Epic failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pet the alien","review":"First, I have no idea why Charlize Theron was even in the movie. Her character was pointless. The 3D cinematic was captivating at times but not enough to wow me. The movie had potential. It was on the verge of being smart and philosophical but it did not fully deliver. Alien and Aliens are far superior because they were unique, the action was better, and the story was not as cheesy. Case and point (*this is sort of a SPOILER ALERT); don't assume a brand new species, or race, on a foreign planet is friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Visuals","review":"....but nothing else was great or good about the film.

I went to Prometheus simply based on the fact Alien is one of, if not the best, sci-fi movies ever made (partially due to its simplicity). I was expecting something on the same vein, yet new...what I got was a generic back story, copycat bits and pieces from the original Alien, a fake Sigourney Weaver, another talking severed android head (couldn't come up with anything else?), a lame octopus and a blatant setup for a sequel. I want a real ending...and a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A product placement movie","review":"Visually, very nice to look at. Depth of plot was pretty shallow, and I think it stems from rushing to get the movie out. Alot of Sci-fi is about product placement these days, ie, models, statuettes, memorabilia. And as I was watching the movie I got that impression that that was one of the motives for getting this out. But what really drove me crazy about this movie, was the incessant background music. A droning muzak that droned on and on during scenes where the acting and dialogue would have sufficed. If you watch ALIEN, and then this movie, you see and hear the diffence. Amazes me that both movies came from the same director."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good Scifi... Okay Alien Prequel","review":"I really enjoyed this movie as a stand alone Scifi thriller. Good plot and good pacing. But I don't necessarily see it as a good prequel to alien. There was too much that could have been done better as a nod to that particular franchise. Hopefully the next one will tie in better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie.","review":"The second time I watched it, I caught a few more things that made me realize it was a better prequel than I had originally thought.

It brings nothing new to the table. It raises a million questions but answers none of them. It makes absolutely no sense at all & it's just a bunch of scenes put together that don't go anywhere. The creatures are really retarded looking & just appear with no rhyme or reason. And it has nothing to do with the Alien franchise. The only reason it's getting good reviews is because they stuck the Space Jockey from ALIEN in it to trick Alien fans into thinking it has something to do with Alien. So they're all giving it good reviews because they want the Alien franchise to continue & they feel some kind of strange loyalty to Ridley Scott. I've seen better direct to video releases.

This film will terrify, horrify, and amaze you with scenes that reach levels of suspense not reached since 1979's original 'Alien'. The visual effects are beautiful, the acting is fantastic (especially great Michael Fassbender), and nearly every scene is adrenaline-pinching. There is no doubt that this will end up being one of the best films of the year. This is definitely better than some of Scott's more modern movies (Gladiator, Hannibal, Robin Hood, etc.). He is a visionary of a director, and is one of the best in the business. I definitely recommend this to anyone who loved ALIEN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must see for ALIEN fans","review":"If you're looking for a straight forward ALIEN prequel, be prepared to be disappointed.

I hate it.","review":"The premise of having humans coming from another planet to populate the earth is not bad at all, it intrigued me how would a human conceptualize another human as its own creator, I mean, that is basically what the bible says, God created man in his own image. So if there was a human race that would be able to go to a planet and plant the seed for human procreation, so many questions emerge that a I get goosebumps if this idea had fallen in the hands of a good creative writer. So there I was waiting for creative breakthroughs, interesting dialog, good action sequences... but what I got was disappointment over disappointment, especially at the end. It reminded me the movie \\"The Mist\\" which takes you to a good level of entertainment, and at the very end they blow it.

Not this time. With so many added and unnecessary scenes it is hard to figure out if they even had a screen play or if they were just winging it on the set. While it is not all bad there is enough to make you shake your head and wish they had called you up and asked for your advice. FX cannot save this film any more than a good guitar player cannot save a bad drummer. When it is bad at a deeper level it stays bad. This franchise has always had a problem with hit and miss films. This one is off target in the plot, consistency of characters, confusing and inconsistent motivation of characters and sometimes it comes down to just adding things because they think we expect certain scenes. No, we want to be wondering what will happen, not predict it as we go along.

Personally, what bugged me the most were the characters in the film - totally boring and non-believable, a complete mis-casting. And the movie simply was not scary, not one scene! Furthermore, all the alien monsters we've seen before in Scott's films - nothing new. Finally, the whole premise was convoluted and nearly impossible to follow.

The movie begins as a tense thriller, but quickly devolves into something else entirely. There is a heavy dose of moralistic pontificating (which never works in movies like this). Scott was successful when he did this in Blackhawk Down, but it does not fit here. The characters are barely likeable and they share no chemistry. And after all of those issues, it is the plot that kills the show.The only good about this movie comes from the great visuals and sound.

Piece of advise, keep the story line and do not insert any religion. It would be one thing if it was just some opinions of some of the cast, but the whole story was based upon \\"the creators\\"(of which they are label \\"the engineers\\").It is obvious that there was a lot of money spent on this movie. The acting is good and so is the computer animation. To me the main failure of this movie is that they try to do too much with one movie.

I wasted 15 bucks on this piece of crap and I hope no one else has to waste their money thinking they are about to watch a good movie. The characters lacked anything that would grant them the viewer's heart or compassion. The story had many loopholes and the fact that the aliens immediately killed us was like \\"COME ONNN!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sifi","review":"I had low expectations based on reviews.

If you are a true fan of Alien then you would know certain details dont add up and it wasnt much of a prequel. Lance Henriksen was the actor who owned the company and in ALIEN VS PREDATOR was a great detail of his death and way in Alien 3 he was found out as a robot. See Predator 2 at the end as u can see the skeleton trophies. one of them was Alien related so as u watch Alien vs Predator you get the full picture of details that this movie failed to display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"The Blu-ray version is really of high quality.

If you manage to get one that works, it will tell you whether or not you spelled _a_ word correctly, and if not, give you a list of other choices, but it will not tell you the definition of the words so you can make sure you spelled the RIGHT word correctly. Thus, it will not help you with write/right, pore/pour, they're/their, etc., the kinds of words that people in need of spelling help are most likely to have trouble with.Also, the unit I got was defective. After struggling for several minutes to get it to initially power on, it worked as advertised for about 3 minutes, and then began resetting itself after every 10-15 keystrokes, abruptly powering off and back on, and randomly reverting to demo mode.Needless to say, I am sending it back and purchasing something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but boring","review":"I have not used this device as often as I thought I would.

However...within 36 hours the lid came off. It does snap back on, but so weaklly that it's constantly coming off. It doesn't impair the function of the unit so we're dealing with it and I wouldn't let that stop you from ordering this product.

I read another reviewer let it burn and the smoke went away. So I set it up on my concrete porch and the smoke did go away. This unmasked another problem though. The control knob gets HOT. I am pretty tolerant to pain but it was almost as hot as the bottom of the iron. I could only nudge it until it went to the off position. Even after letting it sit for a few minutes unplugged, the knob is still very hot. The sides of the iron are not rounded like the older irons, making it hard to do some rounded fillet areas.I honestly recommend looking for a slightly more expensive iron, in the long run it would only cost you $15-20 more (about the price of some mono/ultra/econocote)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello, this is not a toy","review":"I purchased this iron for my encaustic work.

I figured it was just burning off some residue or small bit of plastic packaging from the iron. As it heated up, the amount of smoke increased. I soon realized that the smoke was not coming from the iron surface but from the hole on top where the temperature control was.

There are many close-ups of the instructor demonstrating the Deliberate Orgasm technique, and the instructors talk about what is happening in her body, which I found extremely useful. It takes the mystery out of what orgasm is and how to have it happen.

The art is still gorgeous (especially the 8 or so color pages at the start), so this book scores on all counts. The core of the story is police using tanks to hunt a criminal. The subplots give the book its charm, with a host of characters (particularly the lovestruck meter maids) zipping about on their cleverly-interwoven agendas.

If so, then you may very well want to pick this book up. Warinner sets forth on a task to broach the barrier which many authors use as a security blanket - the one that allows the most amazing things to occur while using mysticism as the single word excuse for its possibility. By doing this the reader begins to consider that the unlikely can actually occur. This is integrated into a rather directed plot that leads you deep into the world of Sumdar. One can only hope that Book Two will be at least as entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumdar, The Tetralogy","review":"This well-written story creates a feeling of being 'in the moment.' The writer's imagery is beautiful, and each chapter leaves a taste for more. I felt Pierre's every emotion, and his questions about life felt like old 'friends.' He faces each new change with a courage and an enthusiasm for living that gives a wonderfully positive flow to the story. And his passion for his true love, Grace, is described with a depth and sensitivity that bursts off the pages. All in all, Sumdar is a work of art from cover to cover, and not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful","review":"I began reading this book when I spoke with a few friends who recommended it to me. After speaking with others, I realized that most, if not all of these reviews, are written by associates of the author, himself. One has to wonder how hardpressed an individual must be if he feels it necessary to convince his friends to write glorious reviews in order to bolster sales. By the way, in spite of this, I couldn't bear to finish the book. It was too boring and self-indulgent. Truly pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent gameplay, lots of laughs, highly recommended","review":"Surprisingly good gameplay for a cartoon based character, and extremely funny (true to classic Spongebob humor)... lots to explore and solve, pretty challenging even for adults, overall a delightful PS2 game. I was surprised to find it is a very well developed game (no glitches that I could find), controls work smoothly and gameplay flows seamlessly. Awesome fun! Definitely worth buying, and an absolute must-have for any Spongebob Squarepants fan! I just wish the game was longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this game","review":"I can't believe the bad reviews that have been written. I bought this game for my 5 year old son and he has been playing it almostevery day since. The game has lots of levels and is not overlyhard for a child to play.

There are many levels and lands, they are challenging but not to the point of frustration. We bought SpongeBob Squarepants Revenge of the Flying Dutchman first, and after 3 weeks we never got beyond the 3rd level.

So it is my OPINION that younger kids will like this game, but not older ones. Also, i think the graphics are not as good as i would have expected; it sort of looks like the old playstation games graphics to me (I rented it on the XBox system)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash! ...don't waste you're time and money....","review":"I purchased this game for me and my children and we did not find it fun at all.

It speaks nothing but the truth and shows the multi-dimensional behavior of the Asad regime throughout the years of the Lebanese war.The author dissects the events of the war in a fine-grained manner, showing Asad's relentless, genius and terrorist decision making and actions all throughout.Evidently, the interpretations made by the author stand strong after eight years since it's writing. The future of the peace-process, the war with Israel, and the relationship with Hizbollah can be easily predicted after reading this book.Highly recommended to anyone wishing to understand the reality of the Asad regime's system of thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushing an agenda","review":"This is a very biased book peddling the author's agenda of hate-mongering and false history.

Blind hate and propaganda driven by ideology and a false sense of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely readable book for all levels and backgrounds.","review":"This book is truly wonderful. Easy and fun to read. It is one of the few science books I have read that eschews all mathematical formulae and still does a great job fully explaining the material. I really appreciated the way he explains background material rather than just glossing over it. For example he does a great job explaining magnetic fields from a very basic level. Unfortunately the price seems almost prohibative, I received the book as a gift from a relative in England, I hope it is cheaper there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb storyteller","review":"Lolita Files is one of my favorite authors. She is an excellent writer, and her stories are very entertaining. Also, she creates believable characters. And if it wasn't for all those reasons, I would have hated this book. In the beginning, the story is so gripping and funny. Then at some point, it's no longer funny because of immoral acts committed. And then when you reach the end, you are left hanging. I wanted to rip this book into pieces. Such a disappointing ending, but I'm glad I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air for reading","review":"The timing is just right for a good book. Actually, it's long overdue. Therefore, I highly recommend you read this book. I promise you won't be disappointed. If this doesn't make the bestsellers list something is definitely wrong here. This well written story is so engaging, funny, almost true, etc. The character Beryl was funny and sad. Unfortunately, there are women just like her and people take advantage of them. What we won't do for love. Penn said, women can be so stupid. He told her he love her on their first night together and she belived him. That was her demise right there."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word \\"disappointed\\" does not say enough.","review":"This book was very disappointing. This was the first time I ever bought a book from an author I didn't know anything about and I'll never do it again. I started to return the book when I first got it because it had a slow start but I forced myself to read it. I don't know if this author meant to sound cruel or mean but she did. The characters were so unbelievable, I couldn't picture them in my mind. There was so much unimportant fluff in this book, it was crazy. At the end of the book, I just started skipping over the drawn out parts, which were many. I don't think I really know the ending but I wasted enough time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Your Library Card","review":"A friend told me about Sex.Lies.Murder.Fame.Sorry I bought this one.

It was extrememly hard to get through and I only finished it to see if the ending would be highlite of the book. The character development went on forever and she seem to repeat herself a lot in this book. I'm all for my favororite authors to veer off to another stlye of writing but this is just strange and I hope I never have to read a book like this from Miss Files ever again. Please bring back Misty and Reese or even a story like Child of God would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I thought the theme of the book was interesting, but the book had too much going on. It had too many characters and the plot was EXTREMELY far out there. The graphic nature of Penn's behavior is sickening. I read another reviewer say that she understood why he was so cruel. I would have to disagree. There is no justification for him being such an arrogant maniac. Also with the technological advances of forensics today wouldn't the police be able to track him down ? The language was a challenge which I liked, but I would not recommend this a read for those who want a \\"light\\" read.

I loved every word...every minute....I savored every second I spent between the covers. Pure genius; excellent talent!Files' writing oozes talent; it reaches out, grabs you, plays with you, and leads you along the journey of a story that's full of the drama, the sex, the lies, the Life we all dream of living and love to read about. sex.lies.murder.fame. is THE book you won't let out of your sight or out of your hands.

One of my book club members chose this book as the selected book for the month. Several of the other members expressed the same sentiment.As an avid reader, I read all types of novels, but this book was unbelievably horrible. I struggled to complete it. It was slow but will add, whenever I had problems falling to sleep, after about 5 pages, I was fast asleep.As stated by some of the other reviewers, the characters were unreal. I won't discuss all of them, but must say the description of Penn Hamilton was ridiculous, especially the part about his sex life. No one is that attractive and in demand that much. This was the first and probably last book I will ever read by Lolita Files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I consider myself a true fan of Ms Lolita Files, I have been following her career since Scenes from a Sistah and for her to release something like this is disappointing.

If she released another book I wouldn't hesitate to buy it because I know her talent, she just slipped up on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Book!!!","review":"Anyone that says they didn't like this book, needs their head checked! Ok, I admit the first 40 pages were slow; but it was necessary to setup the characters personalities; after that, the book took off, and I couldn't put it down. Yes this book was nothing like her other fabulous books; but that's not a bad thing. Anyone that is open-minded to new ways of writing, will love this book.Penn Hamilton is a bitter, wounded, genius, trying to become famouse. I wanted to hate him so bad, but I found myself understanding how he became the man he was. Although he took it to the extreme.Beryl on the other hand was just down-right crazy.All the twists and turns in this book made this the best Lolita Files book to date. I loved it and can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited use camera","review":"I guess this is a good camera. But let me tell you the places you can NOT use this camera: You can't use it indoors. This camera has the worst case of flash flare I have ever seen. The flash is just too close to the lense.

I did buy the hood for the viewing screen, but dosent help. I have to wave my hand in front the the lens to see if the camera is on after it automatically shuts down power. Ok thats it..

I have found it to be an excellent little thing - remember, it is for snapshots. I never use the flash as it bleaches the picture...by 'night scene' enables you to take some excellent pictures. Of course, by increasing aperture time one needs to steady the camera, therefore I have a little tripod that fits in a pocket - or I wedge the thing against something solid. I have an amazing array of pictures from it...and have had some win prizes and sold others. So, all those of you who are knocking the camera...I suggest you look at yourselves before blaming your tools!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOO!!! God Aweful!!!","review":"I liked the way the camera looked but it lacks many features that the other 2mp cameras have that only sell for $[money]. It does look cool but they could have done much better. It does not have a viewfinder, which makes it difficult to take out pics since lcd screen is hard to see in day light. Because of this many of my pics were cut-off and off-center. It takes bad action shots because of the 2 second delay and makes the shot blurry. If you want a good 2mp entry level camera do your homework and go for the other 2mp cameras that cost $[money]or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Customer Service","review":"I received the camera with a large scratch on the LCD monitor and was referred to Nikon customer service for a replacement and they have been horribly unhelpful.

However, I used the Tech Support line which was quick and professional (had some issue loading the driver, but easily fixed)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolpix quality","review":"This camera has almost all the coolpix photography options as the more expensive coolpix 995. The menu is easy to use and its use improves the image quality. Pressing the shutter half way in will set the sharpness and lighting thus allowing for even more manupilation of the image quality. On the otherhand the camera can do point and shoot as well. Some reviewers questioned the lack of a filter to protect the lens, but the filter is but in and when broken can be replaced. Drawbacks? Digital photography has its limits (like color saturation, number of pixels compared to price) and this camera seems to handle them appropriately. For higher quality in resolution and color saturation I go back to 35mm SLR camera with film."},{"rating":"1","title":"SYSTEM ERROR","review":"Okay, for 18 months it was a reasonable--not great--camera. It's not big and looks cool, but it is also slow and performs poorly in low light. Red eye is a huge problem.But, after 18 months, the camera failed to work and displayed SYSTEM ERROR.SYSTEM ERROR is apparently a common Nikon problem and requires the camera be sent to Nikon for a costly fix. Thus, my one-star rating; I don't have enough cash for my digital cameras to be disposable, I need them to be reliable.I recommend heartily against the Nikon brand and am awaiting delivery of a new Canon A95."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat Camera but went dead after 19 months","review":"This was pretty good deal for me or atleast it looked to me till 1 week before.

Similar serious, grown-up ideas are in the other books, but in all four cases presented subtly and understatedly. All four stories give one things to talk and think about.With the possible exception of \\"The Little House\\", all are books that will appeal to little boys; as reluctant readers are more likely to be boys than girls, this is a good thing.It is wonderful that these classics are available with their delightful illustrations are now available in an omnibus edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, must-have stories to share with your children.","review":"These stories are timeless. Sure the cars and truck (and steam shovels) are dated, but your young kids will love the stories. The Little House and Mike Mulligan & His Steam Shovel are must reads.

I am now happy to gift it to my four-year old grandson. The fact that his grandfather has a backhoe much like Mike Mulligan's steam shovel, Mary Ann, makes it a sure fire winner. And, of course, the repetition and playful rhyming just add to the appeal for a future reader. Katy and the Big Snow and The Little House my sons discovered simply because of name recognition, located next to their favorite on the library shelves. They too became familiar friends, much read and much loved. The last story is unfamiliar, but I plan to read it along with the others and perhaps discover a new friend.

His performances of his traditional hits are somewhat \\"jazzed up\\" versions of those hits and might be kind of aggravating for the viewer who wants to see and hear the hits as they were done originally. But, Darin's showmanship and talent on stage definitely comes through. He was a stage performer through and through and does not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darin is amazing...","review":"After watching this, I defy you to believe this man was deathly ill while taping this (he had septicemia and died a short nine months later). Bobby moves around the stage like a teenager, does stand up comedy, banters with the audience. But it's when he sings that he simply blows everyone away. The sheer enjoyment he gets out of performing completely sucks you in. This tape shows the kind of entertainer that is no longer bred. You won't be sorry for a moment that you own this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've always been a Bobby Darin fan and remember his show from the 70's, so I was quite excited when I found this video. Unfortunately pretty much the whole thing is a disappointment. I don't know how they selected the songs presented here, but they seem to have managed to find some of the worst songs recorded in the 70's; ones that just have the same line sung over and over AND OVER. There's a lot of useless pandering with the audience which I think was mostly to give him a bit of a rest between songs as it is so obvious in this video that he was not well. He still gives it his all and you have to give him credit for that, but do yourself a favor and get \\"Bobby Darin Beyond the Song\\" instead. It's just clips, but oh so much better. I'll stick to that one and his CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good but not Darin's song's","review":"Bobby Darin was a talent but, when I think of Bobby Darin I think of \\"Mack the Knife\\" and \\"Splish Splash\\" not \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water' and \\"Midnight Special.\\" He sings many songs in this film but only four are his songs. If it weren't for those it would be a one star Think of it as Elvis singing songs from Frank Sinatra (besides \\"My Way\\") it would sound terrible because Elvis sings a different type of music. I was very upset that I paid for this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Bobby Darin but this video is just terrible. Instead of hearing Darin songs I want to hear I'm forced to hear songs like \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and \\"Midnight Special\\" might I add these songs are performed terribly. He sings Mack the knife And Beyond The Sea but he sings them boringly (is that even a word) and lame. no enthusiasm at all. I wish they would give out a tape of him in his earlier years so it would be more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Side of Lounge Music","review":"I have always heard Bobby Darin, I have some of his live recordings, and always thought he was great. I bought this DVD, thinking he would swing like Frank did in his TV specials. Wow. It is sad to see him like this. Maybe it was the time (the 70's as opposed to Frank's 60's TV special) but if you ever wonder where Bill Murray got his inspiration for the lounge singer for his SNL skits, this is it. Painfully cheesy arrangements and embarrassingly cheesy audience pandering, make this painful to watch for anyone who had always loved the Darin sound. It seemed that he was trying to do too many things at once, cover too many genres, all the time trying to be current and hip. Unfortunately it was the 70's, and no one could be hip.Do yourself a favor and buy \\"Bobby Darin Live at the Copa\\" CD and just listen. Use your imagination, don't see this and destroy the illusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manageable controls, but bad durability","review":"My sons used these controllers for about five months.That's how long they lasted.For both of them, the + directional pad broke and fell out.The plastic parts that held the directional pad was too weak.I recommend using other controllers if you are looking for controllers that are durable and responsive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great controller, but very sensitive.","review":"I really like this controller. It feels great in my hands and the programming software works well for most situaitions.My only conplaint which is why it only gets 4 stars is that the analog controls are very, very sensitive, so if you move the control slightly, the game will think you moved it a lot. Therefore, don't expect to be able to make very small movements with it. There is no way to set the sensitivity.Also, I have to calibrate it everytime I restart the computer, because it forgets. This doesn't bother me though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not dependable","review":"This controller has all the makings of a great but is missing some crucial features.1.

I have only one game for the computer, Halo, so I know I'm not working it to hard. I purchased these controllers from Best Buy so maybe they just have a bad stock, but whatever the case may be, I will never purchase another one of these controllers again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm for Nintendo64 emulation","review":"I couldn't find a better gamepad for Nintendo64 emulation. Six buttons allow for A+B+C pad setup like on the real controller, with the Z mapped to the left shoulder, R mapped to the right shoulder, Start mapped to the S button, and the left analog as the analog stick.I don't know why everyone else complains about durability. This controller lasted me five years. It didn't fail until I accidentally broke the circuit board while swapping out a worn rubber dome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fighters","review":"Although this gamepad is probably fine for some things, it is not for fighting games (emulators).

The description is so long and detailed that it's reminiscent of Patrick O'Brian (Aubrey/Maturin).The book's ostensibly a mystery. And it's a taut one involving the obvious Caribbean bounty - pirate treasure. There's more characterization of Ramage in this book than in some of the previous ones, but it's more C.S.

If you like wilful British sailors solving maritime mysteries, you could do worse than David Donachie's Privateersman series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of Dirk Pitt's best","review":"The fourth Ramage carries on with the tradition of highly entertaining naval action .

I am always impressed with bands that write good songs that are melodic and not just loud guitars with no ryhme or reason. The title track \\"Only Human\\" is amazing! probably the best of the CD. \\"Fly to the Rainbow\\" shows off the vocal range of this singer. Truely amazing! The cover song of Rainbows \\"I surrender\\" is a great way to end this CD. anyone who is a fan of Yngwie Malmsteen or neo/classical bands need to pick this one up for their collection.

I suggest that Ms Caldicott educate herself in the fields of physics and radiation as this is clearly lacking. As a physicist who has worked in both the nuclear energy and medical radiation fields, it appears to me that Ms Caldicott skirts around any factual evidence as this would disprove her contradictory arguments and instead wishes to engender scare politics and mass hysteria.I am very disappointed that any publisher would agree to publish this without adequate research. One can only assume that their knowledge of physics is also extremely lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"HYSTERIA","review":"Fear mongering and hysteria are strong words to use when describing a book, but they accurately apply to Helen Caldicott's 'Nuclear Madness'. She informs us, among other things, that a power plant disaster is imminent, likely to take hundreds, even thousands, of lives. Cities such as Denver may even now need be evacuated due to radioactive contamination. While they have been unable to build any new plants in decades, the powerful nuclear industry 'controls' our lives. Finally, it may be too late for any corrective action. Is there any up side to nuclear power? None of any kind, we hear.There are several advantages and disadvantages to this kind of energy. It is all worth a healthy debate. Nuclear waste, accidents and contamination are all serious concerns. But it should be clear to everyone that we need all the energy we can get. Solar and wind can only generate a tiny amount.

The story is set in 2235. Mankind has developed a faster-than-light drive. Other than that, the entire setting is pulled directly from the late 20th century. The director of the space exploration agency wears a white blouse and blue pants. A pilot grabs a bagel and jelly for breakfast. Congress threatens to slash funding for the space agency. The Arctic ice-cap might collapse. Hasn't the world changed a little bit more than that in 225 years? It's as if history stopped dead in its tracks.A writer of science fiction, in addition to creating characters and a plot, must present an imagined future setting for the story. McDevitt has created an adventure story involving space ships but doesn't seem to have any concept of what science-fiction is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another enjoyable old fashioned space adventure","review":"Jack McDevitt is one of the authors I look forward to the most. I love challenging, take-no-prisoners SF, but once a year it's great to settle down with an easy, enjoyable read. His writing is concise, his plots are clear, he has a great sense of humour and there are always heroes to cheer and wonders to discover. His science is always inventive and interesting.The setting is Earth in the 23rd century, and most of the action takes place on \\"Academy\\" ships, science vessels exploring and investigating phenomena in deep space. Famed Academy pilot Hutch and some other familiar faces are back, and it's more fun if you have read at least one other Hutch story, but McDevitt makes sure that the novel can stand alone.Only 4 stars because it doesn't have as much adventure as the other books in the series, but for a fast, fun read, 'Odyssey' doesn't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his best","review":"Not one of Jack's books unfortunatly.

I really hate wasting my time and money on short stories grossly inflated simply to make more money. McDevitt never really gives you much of any 'meat' in his perenially empty universe; just nibbles and bites of ancient civilizations and advanced aliens. But this book just gives you nothing at all! Old Jack must really have no respect for his readership. I slugged my way through his other books hoping against hope that something would come of all the thousands of pages of prose but I'm left feeling used. I'll never read another of his books again.

It doesn't seem as interesting, or possibly it's just that there are no real mysteries to solve as in the Chase books. The difficulties just seem like normal problems that some people want to solve and some don't. Added to which, I can't like MacAllister. And in this book, Hutch is no longer interesting. Mostly, I think it's that the characters are no longer telling the story. It's more like McDevitt is preaching his version of \\"what's wrong with the world\\" via flat characters. Boring, and almost insulting.

We are again hit hard over the head with the notion that there WILL be CATASTOPHIC HUMAN-CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING enviromental damage in the near future, to the point that the Green Party replaces the Democratic Party. YAAAAWWWN! Somewhere there is a story inside, but I couldn't find it - indeed, that may be why the book is entitled ODYSSEY, because you will have to go on one to try and find the story!... and I'd forgot about McDevitt's NAU (North American Union), in which he has actually managed to kill off the USA.

It's just another example of a movie that tells too much story in a short amount of time. They should have used that money to make this into a standard 26 episode T.V. series or an OVA series. On top of that, Nemo and the Princess's recording sessions must have been done in one take or something because they sound HORRIBLE!! The poor sound quality didn't help either. I will give it some points for the great looking animation and the good music. This is what happens when you put all of your money into making the movie look good and not paying attention to anything else.

I personally enjoyed it as a child and bought it now because it brought back great memories.

The first chapter about simple transverse waves on strings is pretty good except for the confusing treatment of Fourier series (which I can't imagine would help anyone who hasn't seen them before). Chapter 3 on elastic theory was fine too and the EM waves stuff in chapter 8 wasn't bad.However, the introduction to tensors in chapter 7 and their application to more complex elastic theory was horrible. The dyadic notation they use is really old-fashioned and their presentation is confusing. The stuff in chapter 12 on fourier transforms and integrals wasn't that great either.More generally, the problem is that it spends too much time diving into excruciating detail without teaching and emphasizing important concepts. Not to mention the fact that there are no example problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Quick Delivery","review":"The book is really great and covers all the fundamental aspects of wave prorogation in different mediums and different kind of waves.Also delivery of the book was very quick and I got the book in a very good condition, as shown on Amazon.com during the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok for the price!","review":"As a Powered and Portable PA system this guy does a pretty good job.

The reality, however, is that (in the words of Malcolm X) \\"African Americans will never be respected and treated equally until they become educated and earn the respect of other races.\\" A lot of books I have read on helping African American students have made excuses, blaming other races and living situations, and the system, etc. This writer offers no excuses and just explains why some children act the way that they do and how to then deal with them. It also offers suggestions how to counter-act their excuses and complaints to show them success.

It's just this side of bitter (a good thing), one sip of this and you know you're drinking Serious Coffee. I do agree with the reviewer who said to grind Fogbuster more coarsely than usual.

Like Five.Bolt.Main, thy lyrics for a lot of the songs, especially \\"A Different Someone\\" helped me through a really hard time in my life.

This guy has the magic touch. Travis cleaverly takes a known dog and makes you love him. Genesis Styles is a certified puppy but Hunter uses his skills as a top notch writer to change your heart and have you rooting for him. I don't know any other writer that has what Travis Hunter's has. This book is a must read for anyone who enjoyes a great story. I'll have to say that I'm highly upset with his Publishing company, Random House for for not promoting this guy in a big way. There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Hunter will be a literay star with or without the help of his big publishing house. E. Lynn Harris and Eric Jerome Dickey, You guys now have company at the top because Travis Hunter is coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I read this book after reading The Other Woman By Eric Jerome Dickey. So I wasn't expecting anything great after that excellent read. But I was so WRONG this was a good book about family relationships and true friendships. The ending will mess with your brain something that was really not expected at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alrighty Then","review":"Great book.

Being an avid reader, I was thoroughly entertained in the few hours it took me to complete the book. TRUST ME, it's a page reader that keeps you on the edge of your seat while holding your emotions in check. Hunter does a great job at engaging the reader in various plots without being predictable. You will laugh out loud at characters you can identify with personally. You will cry in silence at characters who through no fault of their own start to die in spirit even before they have an opportunity to live their lives as a result of sins of the father, family secrets, and drugs. Thank goodness it doesn't end there. Don't judge a book by the cover, you might be fooled! I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an Ending","review":"What a heartfelt surprising ending. One that I certainly did not expect. It almost brought tears to my eyes. I will admit there were some twists and loops which became unsurprising /surprising outcomes to the story.Just when I thought I had figured it out. I was not so sure the author but some doubts in my mind . Only to find out later I was on the right road.I hope I do not give anything away. I will say this was a good read. NOt as good as The Hearts of Men but nevertheless a good read. With so much cleaning out the hearts. The dad played a negative affect on each of the siblings.Phyliss did not want a black man so she thought . Grace could not trust men.Genesis was to much like is father when it came to women.You even learned why the mom put up with such foolishness as if we didn't know.But the ending blew me away when the door open and Terri walked down that aisle.....Okay I'll stop before I give it away !I will be waiting for the next novel Travis ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Married But Still Looking","review":"Genesis Styles have attracted women from ever walk of life since he was a teenager. He's a good-looking, smooth-talking former pro-basketball player, but he has a problem: He has never been satisfied with just one woman. Then he meets Terri. Terri is his fiancee'. Genesis knows that Terri is a good woman that he wants to make his wife, but while Terri have decided that their first sexual experience will be their last (at least until they are married), Genesis has been \\"spreading\\" himself around town.While juggling a host of other women, Genesis had to deal with family problems such as his drug- addicted brother who doing a not so good job at raising his son, a sister that has decided to become a minister, and ever so tough Phillis who has her own faults and personal problems.I truely enjoy this story of love, lust, cheating, abuse and family secrets. In the end you will learn that it never too late to make a change for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!","review":"This was an excellent book. From the very beginning I was hooked. While Genesis is a scary brotha to know, he's real and he's out there sistas. Travis did an excellent job of bringing all the characters together. I found a deeper message however, in that the deceased father left a leagacy that he probably did not intend to leave. He managed to leave all his children with psychological issues that carried over well into their adult lives. At times, certain characters challenged my patience (Genesis, Phyllis, and Terri), but in the end I came to know and like them all for very different reasons. Prodigy...what a guy! I couldn't have been more pleased with the ending! Can't wait for the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"This is a definite page turner, I couldn't put the book down.

I've recommended this book to my friends,family and co-workers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst book I've ever read...","review":"...but close. Maybe it's just me and my expectations, but this was not a good book by any stretch of the imagination. The writing is pedestrian, the characters are one dimensional, the story is obvious and uninvolving, and the dialogue, while often ludicrous and over the top, goes on and on without any point and without moving the plot (such as it is) forward. I read this book over a month because I found it so unbelievable and the writing tortuous. It's great that Mr. Hunter is published and selling books, but you have to wonder about the target audience: is this the type of book anyone wants to read? In a word, I thought it was an awful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for more of Mr. Hunter","review":"I really enjoyed this book!Genesis Styles is a dog that is engaged to a good woman, but it takes a lot to make him realize what he has at home.This was the first that I have read by Mr. Hunter and I will be looking out for more.Very good read that had me laughing out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"I really enjoy Travis Hunter's writing and would go so far as to say that he's one of my favorite writers, so I went back to his older books to see how he started. I'm glad I started backwards because had I read this book first, I wouldn't have continued. It's not a bad book. Two friends, one a [...], the other one trying to make a difference in the black community, two brothers: the [...] from earlier and a crackhead, a sister who's disgusted with her own race and another sister with her head in the church. The book was so incredibly cliche. I wouldn't say it was a bad book, I've just read it a thousand times before and then turned on the t.v. to watch reruns of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerry Springer should be proud","review":"There is absolutely nothing orignal in this book whatsoever.

He was humorous and enlightening, yet I did not believe that a novel written by a man would hold my interest. I was pleasantly surprised. I could not put this book down; I had to finish reading this weekend. I never knew that men would be able to weave tales like this. I see men are capable of feelings and emotions and are aware of their mistakes.

I purchased this copy for my granddaughter, because she volunteers at Washington Family camp each summer and hopes to intern there next year, after she graduates from college.

If your kids grew up with Barney, Elmo, and Sesame Street, and Disney videos, this video is probably not for them. The animation is low budget, and there is nothing captivating about the video. No songs, no dance, no action...just dialog between the girl and the older man. Unless you appreciate art or know who Monet is, this is not the kind of video that you or your child would appreciate. This video is more educational than entertaining. Compared to all the other children's videos that my kids have seen, this one is downright boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"My children age 3 and 6 were bored by this video after watching it only once and they don't watch a lot of \\"junk\\" t.v.

Then we got the DVD, and we weren't disappointed. My 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son both love watching this short (30 minutes) movie. The only thing is that we want more! Maybe more interactive games on top of the \\"quiz.\\" The garden sounds add up to the \\"effect\\" of a tranquil garden.

If you like guitar in your funk, that rocks but grooves look no further here. i wore the vinyl out on this one at least twice. Possible due to the limit original run and promotion it just did not get it's due. Rising Sign. Last Toll Before the Gate, Turn Around Hate are just rocker.

I find the delineations quite good, though sometimes too short and incomplete. I'm not sure if these delineations are based on massive research or whether they are more theoretically written down. Anyway if you want to know something about the importance of the final dispositor, receptions etc.. you should read the book because these items are very well explained in some short chapters. These chapters I find the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but incomplete","review":"This is a well-enough written book, mainly for intermediate astrologers and beyond. The content helps deepen a person's understanding of horoscope analysis beyond planets in houses and signs. However, due to editorial or author oversight, some of the sections are incomplete, and an inquiry to the author and editor have not been answered. It does expand on books such as the \\"Only Way\\" series which have this same kind of information in a more concise format, but still, one wishes that the art of editing were as rigorous as in former times."},{"rating":"1","title":"know your industry","review":"This book was current in it's day, more than 30 years ago. But other than the guidelines for visual research, which is standard practice in Design school today, along with understanding how repeats work, save your money for a book that let's you design in Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop. It has a method of transferring parts of design using a rice paper that is hard to find today, and the industry is different with samples being printed on wide format inkjet before being put into production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"I bought this for my 1996 mazda protege as a replacement and it fit perfectly, worked fine, fast shipping, no noise.

What a Mistake. It's not a terrible game but the graphics are only so so and so was the game play. In my opinion it was simply \\"rushed\\" out to stores and will probably be one of x box's first reduced priced games in the near future. One word of advice on purchasing these expensive games for any system including GameCube and PS2: Rent them or try to play them before you buy them. I know everyone is guilty of buying games without trying them and when I popped this one in the Box I felt like I was ripped off almost instantly. It stinks that Software Producers actually put games like these out on the market for that price when they have to know that they are putting out a substandard product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arctic Thunder","review":"no me sirvio por que el juego es de xbox solamente y mi consola es xbox 360 perdi mi dinero"},{"rating":"1","title":"this game really really...","review":"i bought this game in hopes that it was a semi-realistic racing game (think sledstorm on dreamcast) but really it's a low quality copy of super mario kart without all the fun. it... so i traded it in for MX2002 and i'm soooo happy i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow... could it be worse?","review":"I would have to say without a doubt this is the worst Xbox title on the shelves.

The gameplay in multiplayer was so blinding fast that you could hardly tell what you were doing. It was more like random shooting and there was nothing even vaguely fun and/or exciting about it.

The noticeable difference is that my breath feels authentically fresh, and stays fresh. With other toothpastes, the food taste comes back quickly, when the fake minty taste is gone. Therabreath toothgel has a lasting effect. It also has aloe vera which strengthens weak and swollen gums.

What the heck? The time it takes to turn is so unrealistic. The worst part of all is the inclusion of a speedomoter. Headin down the mountain, the game claims you're going 50 mph, yet gives the sense of snowplowing down a bunny hill. Its so incredibly fake and stupid.Snow board games are fun cause they give people the chance to do tricks most of us will never do. In Mad Trix, actual skiing is better.

Out of the almost 10 MILLION possible phone numbers in area code 202, the Hardys just HAPPEN to call one which gets them crucial information regarding a case their Dad was ALREADY working on! Can you buy this outrageous premise long enough to enjoy this book? If so, there's no point in reading book reviews.

The premise for this book is rather ridiculous considering that the area code for New York is 212 and that for Washington D.C. is 202. The 0 and the 1 are nowhere near each other on either a touch tone phone nor a rotary dial phone, so I don't see how a mistake like that could happen if you know the number you are calling.

When I am done, all I need to do is empty the dirt cup and put it back on the charger, way to simple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised","review":"Does the job it was designed to do. I have noticed a slight loss in power since when it was brand new, not significant enough to make it unusable.I am dismayed at the complicated charging instructions. Your not supposed to leave it plugged-in on the charger for more than needed. Well, common sense would dictate that the charging base should cut off power to the unit once charging is complete. I have too many things going on in my life to worry about unplugging my electric broom from the wall so I don't ruin the battery's capacity. I just want it to sit there and be nice and charged when I need it. What's so hard about that? Oh.. the higher priced model doesn't require these annoying steps.But overall, I am happy with the build quality and performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a disposable vacuum","review":"This is the greatest little sweeper for about 6 to 8 months. Then the battery begins to weaken and won't hold a charge for more than a minute or two; and guess what: Bissell doesn't sell a replacement battery pack, nor can they tell you where to get one or even what type to get. Additionally, when I wrote the company regarding this problem, they offered to sell me another one, instead of trying to honor the warranty! If you can afford to replace it frequently, it is the handiest appliance you will own. If you want something reliable, the Go Vac is not for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a penny...","review":"It seemed like a good idea when I bought it. With two dogs, and two parrots, the house gets dirty so quickly, and I hate using the heavy vacuum cleaner everyday. I didn't expect this to be as powerful, but I just wanted to sweep up small everyday mess like dirt and bird food on the floor and carpet. It worked ok, but it kicks off the dirt, and I ended up sweeping bigger area, and this thing clogs so easy. brush is so soft, end everything will be stuck on the brush. This sweeper is probably good for dusting, but not for small vacuuming work. I really hate using it now, I use old broom for my sweeping work. It's better than dealing with dirt spread everywhere and clogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"After seeing the rave reviews on this product I just had to have it. Unfortunately, after a month or so the vacuum started to lose its ability to hold a charge for more than 5 minutes, had problems with hair sticking to the brush, but most importantly, doesn't suck anything up anymore even though I've cleaned out the filter and removed as much hair from the roller brush as I could. I am now looking for something more worthy of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but not well made","review":"3 members of my family (including me) purchased one of these around the same time. All 3 vacs were broken within 3 months of light use. The beater brush stopped working. I contacted Bissell customer service, and they sent a new one, which was terrific. But it, too, was broken within a few months. I love the idea of having a cordless vac with a long handle and a beater brush, but this one is just not well made. I think it's reflected in the low price, but still it wasn't worth my money. Judging by the other reviews, not everyone has had these problems but I know of 4 vacs that failed very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it!","review":"It worked great while it lasted...for all of two minutes! It worked well on the carpet in my apartment the first few times I used it. Now the little brush will only spin for one minute and then gives up! Definitely not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted...","review":"I loved my GoVac when it worked fully charge. After about 5 minutes of cleaning it would start to bog down. After about 2 months of use it died on me. I believe it needs a new battery pack to help hold charge but that isn't offered in the parts replacement order form. A bit dissapointed in something that costs [price]!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHY SO HARD TO FIND?","review":"I ABSOUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE MY GO VACS.

It broke as I was sweeping underneath the couch and it got caught under the cushion?? I can and do still use, but it is only for light touchups. I have a dog that sheds his own weight daily and we have all hard wood floors and I have to empty the debris out three times before I finish with the whole house. It's still better daily than lugging out a larger vaccuum. Considering the price, it's not a bad investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves it","review":"Got this for her for mothers day. She just loves it. It runs about 15 minutes which is great for getting a fast clean job. She was also suprised it picked up so much dirt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Dissatisfied","review":"After only a few uses, this sweeper would no longer pick much of anything. I exchanged it for another thinking that it must be a fluke and was doubly disappointed when the second NEW sweeper quit on me soon after. I will never purchase a Bissell product again. A total waste of time, money, and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good start but fizles out fast","review":"I bought one of these but after only 6 months, it stopped picking up anythig bigger than dust and still threw lots of that around.

People either give it five stars or one star. I bought this just to pick up dog hair in the kitchen and laundry room. The suction was terrible and the sweeper was messy to empty. I was so disappointed that I returned it after three days use.The Eureka 96B Boss Lite is the same price as the Bissell Go Vac, and it has amazing suction and battery life. I highly recommend the Eureka 96B Boss Lite instead of the Bissell Go Vac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality parts","review":"We bought this vacuum for minor cleaning up. Even with minimal use, the thread on the handle that goes into the vacuum base wore out. This resulted in the handle becoming loose. We have removed the handle completely and now use it like a handvac.We do not recommend this product at all. Also, if you leave the food, etc. collected in the vacuum, it is a good place for ants to feast on. You have to immediately empty the vacuum after you are done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other than the Jorge Ben, terrible","review":"With all the great Brazilian music to choose from, this is the best Byrne comes up with?

When Snoop left Suge, Death Row kept the rights to all his songs. This is just a way for Death Row to suck the last bit of money it can off its classic acts before the label crashes.

The grinding guitar/synth sound seems to be what the new band is moving toward. None of the covers deviate much from the original recordings. I expected a bit more from new versions of very well known songs. Well, a bit more than adding \\"my a** getting bigger, my chest getting bigger\\" to Big Time.There are two new songs thrown in. They aren't too bad. The first, Scream, sounds a bit like Concrete Blonde gone electronic. Gothic, slow and sexy. The second, Down and Dirty, has a bit more blips in it, more like early Depeche Mode.I hope that with this out of their system, the band puts out a dark, electronic album worthy of the brand name."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRI NUNN AND BERLIN AT THEIR BEST!","review":"BUY IT!

Throw in the garbled Jimi Hendrixx music and it just doesn't get any worse. If your used to the slick production of A&E produced Mafia programs, you'll be extremely dissapointed.

It's almost as if the author isn't using an editor; as if he's just writing, flipping the middle finger to a rewrite and just putting the book out there. There are so many gaps in the text; I found a few misspellings, etc, etc. Regardless of how good the book might be, I can't see beyond the bad writing and lack of editing. I'm going to TRY HARD to continue reading these two books simply because I paid for them. But Isadore Johnson really needs to consider investing in an editor for all upcoming book projects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, But Nice...","review":"Looking back on the \\"Rumors\\" project, I am very glad to see Marshall back on the scene. I believe some of this material can definitely make an imprint on the charts. The music here has a very unique sound and will go far with a little promotion and airplay. There were 10 songs I really liked, but the best would have to be \\"If I Could Get The Chance\\", \\"Git Wit Me\\", \\"Just Walk Away\\", \\"In Love Again\\", and \\"Open Your Eyes\\". I find inspiration in \\"An Eagle Flies\\", and \\"Magic\\" is a very nice cut as well. I can only imagine if at least two of these mentioned were released as singles and edited or remixed. A big fan of the old Timex Social Club, I really like the original \\"Thinkin About U\\".Overall I am impressed...if you appreciate diversity in music, then this is a CD that you will find pleasing and enjoyable to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Silvio Light\\"","review":"I have to agree wholeheartedly with the review of this CD by Antonio Rioseco. This CD is for marketing Silvio to the gringo. It has the 'de rigueur' revolutionary songs like \\" Cancion urgente para Nicaragua\\" & \\"Playa Giron\\" but it is far from the essence of this singer/songwriter. I suggest exploring his triptychs (Triptico 1, 2, 3 and Silvio, Rodriguez and Dominguez). My favorites are the second ones in each series (Triptico 2 y Rodriguez) which include some of his best poems put to music. I love \\"Llover sobre mojado\\" & \\"El tiempo esta a favor de los pequenos\\" and Rodriguez's \\"Casiopea\\". So don't go for the Silvio Light go for something more filling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one","review":"Cuban \\"trova\\" music has suffered a lot because of the compilations. They tend to reduce the music to \\"hits\\". And this compilation represents that manipulation (I dont care if it comes from Byrne or whatever) for Silvio Rodriguez music. If you want to really enjoy Rodriguez begin by his old albums (Al final de este viaje, Unicornio, Mujeres, etc). You can follow to the 80s big albums (especially \\"Triptico\\"), and then probably you will like to try the 90s solo work (\\"Silvio\\", \\"Rodriguez\\", \\"Dominguez\\") Trova is not about hits. Get the albums. Dont by this one, you will loose your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing toy for babies as young as 3 months","review":"my twins LOVE this toy as well as Tiny the Elephant.

The toy is in GREAT shape though it was played with frequently.

I purchased this Truefitt and Hill shaving oil after having good experience with their shaving soap.In general, the oil was ineffective I didn't perceive any noticeable differences in my shave when using it. The oil smells okay - like cheap citrus. It's also very thin. I believe they did this on purpose so it does not clog up a razor blade. However, I think a more substantial cushion of oil would have provided a much more comfortable shave.For a more comfortable shave, I've had better results with Jack Black Beard Lube. It's an all-in-one shaving solution that slicks the face very well for a razor, but does not provide the luxurious lather of a traditional wet shave routine. If you don't want to give up the lather (as I do), you're better off skipping this oil and spending the extra money on good soap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Letdown!","review":"Yikes! I like their shaving cream but good lord, this stuff is lame. I won't list brands but the inexpensive oils have more substance (thicker) and protection than this.

Well, maybe they were, indeed, but I'm not and I'm converted. It isn't as expensive as it appears to be because if you wet your skin first as suggested, it only takes 3-4 drops to cover your entire face and neck. There's always oil left on my hands afterward so I could cut back to 2-3 drops easily.The difference it makes in your shave is incredible, especially if you shave with a straight razor and/or you dislike being poorly shaved and make three or more passes with the razor."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for sensitive skin","review":"As it says on the bottle - if you have little prep time or sensitive skin, this pre-shave oil is for you! I know some say this is either too thin or too thick, depending on their preference. The main point I MUST stress is that you should only use 3-4 drops max. I've experimented and used two to three times more and got poor results. In fact, I would say it hurt my double edge shave performance. But when I used a few drops, it did the job and didn't clog the razor blade.Yes, it's pricey and you probably can concoct some similar version using drug store products. To me, time is money.

He had worked toward it for weeks. He already has a large Rescue Hero collection, including the Aqua Command Center & airplane. We like all of these toys. The URV robot does not really do anything but walk a little bit, talk & activate the Voice Tech dolls, which it can also identify by name. The remote is attached by a short cord & barely works, and the robot is very clunky and unresponsive. We don't have the Powermax figures so I cannot comment on that feature. It also shuts down if not used for a relatively short time, and is then hard to restart. For fifty bucks, I would expect more! This toy does not deliver value.

And the robot keeps repeating that it's been deployed as this is one of the \`cool' features. My son finally retracted the thread so tight that it stays on. Very resourceful.

Her attention to higher values -- her life question is &quot;What is wisdom and how do we find it?&quot; -- gives a strong voice to an often-missing element in knowledge management books. The evolution of knowledge must serve a higher purpose, and Verna prompts each of us to define that for ourselves.

He describes many of the antipathies with which these authors regard New England cicles of thought (including Poe's distaste for the Transcendentalism of Emerson and Thoreau), arguing a reactionary position for Southern authors. He concludes that Southern literature is not original but rather an extension of New England and other American literary models. The work is useful for quickly surveying some regional literature; however, invoking such literary milestones and treating them rather briefly, leaves a certain \\"something\\" wanting that a fuller arguement might provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","review":"Cromer does a wonderful job when he stays on the topic he knows well, how to explain principles in physics. He also does an effective job of skewering postmodernist critics of science. However, the promise of \\"connected knowledge\\" is not fulfilled. Cromer makes connections the way a shotgun makes marriages. He can't make real connections among knowledge domains because he is ignorant (often arrogantly so) of the knowledge domains outside physics that are important to his thesis.

Dunst is not a spectacular actress like everyone thinks she is, she's not sexy whatsoever, she tries really hard to be in this film, flashing her navel and parading around in her underwear. Hernandez on the other and is a cutiepie and an ok actor. Dunst's character Nicole is mentally-disturbed and her love for Carlos is threatened when her dad (Bruce Davidson) tries to end their relationship. He is from the wrong side of the tracks, just the same old, boring formula used in practically every film.

She meets Carlos (Jay Hernandez), a poor but hard-working Latino boy who has to get up at 5 a.m. to get to school and who dreams of going to the Naval Academy to become a pilot. Nicole and Carlos are drawn to each other. At first, Nicole treats him like another drug. Carlos has felt the burden of delivering all his family's dreams of achievement.

This one starts out with a tough latino boy and a trashy white girl and sets up the viewer for an I've-seen-this-1000-times-before film, but none of the characters are who or what you expect from outward appearances. The pounding beat of the music and the risky situations the two put themselves in make the film tough to watch in spots; at other times it is borderline sappy. I found both these swings to be a realistic representation of life in the teenage years.

It's a fairly typical poor kid falls in love with rich kid movie with the usual difficulties such a relationship would bring. It seems a bit stereotypical to have the rich kid be an unfocused wild child and the poor kid be a highly focused and driven person looking to move up in life, but that doesn't detract from the movie enough to ruin it. There are a few risque scenes and some suggestive language, but it's not too bad.

But don't pay money to see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melo-Drama at Best","review":"It's hard to say just what went wrong with Crazy/Beautiful. Perhaps it's the static characters, the plot without any peaks or the simple fact that it's impossible to empathize with another rich, white girl. Personally, I expected more from Kirsten. Aside from the fact that she resembles a boy throughout the film, she lacks the personality needed to pull off a character with so many emotional problems. The plot was simple. Boy meets girl. Girl and boy have sex. Boy and girl face challenges. A monkey could have written better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not another teen movie...","review":"What a great movie this is! I saw it the other night on cable and am getting it on DVD. I've become a huge fan of Kirsten Dunst, especially since my recent obsession with \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" (which she was AWESOME in). She's had talent all her life, and this movie is no different. Dunst and Hernandez are the perfect couple (on and maybe off-screen too). The movie was not corny or cheesy like many other teen flicks are, and it's incredibly easy to relate to in some ways. The way they flirted and carried on are similar to relationships that most teens go through in high school. A wonderfully written movie, and an incredibly display of talent make this film definitely one to be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 'crazy' Kristen, the 'beautiful' Dunst!","review":"This movie is a twist of fate to me. I thought it was going to be a silly stupid teen movie, but it was really one of the best teen flick I ever saw. Kristen Dunst(BRING IT ON) plays a troubled rich girl who likes to party and is very bad in school. Jay Hernandez plays a straight latino \\"A\\" student meets Kristen and they fall in love. Though Kristen Dunst's father in the movie makes a twisted spin in a love teen movie. He tells Jay to stay away from his daughter. Not because her dad didn't like him he said that she was wrong for him. He was a good student and he didn't want him to ruin his grades. This is a true hearted movie and you will love it. I definitly recommend this to teens everywhere to go and see this movie. You will come out of the theatre and makes you feel good. You and your boyfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly cliche","review":"I do agree that it is a total rewrite of Save the Last Dance, with worse acting and shallower plot.

I am a 16 year old girl who generally does not enjoy going to see films indented to entice the \\"youth of America\\", nevertheless, I went to see Crazy/Beautiful. I almost walked out within the first half hour. It was such an overgenerlzation of teenagers and basically told today's youth that sex is meaningless and doesn't need to be safe.On the postive side, the film did a great job of showing the different lifesytles of teenagers and how it can effect two people's feeling for one another and those around them. Kristen Dunst's acting was very, very good and she remains one of the very few younger actors that I can stand. She gained my respect when she was 11 for her role in Interview with the Vampire.Overall, this film is not overally special. It's not an epic. It's actually rather dull and overdone, but for the few moments were the film really shines, it's worth it to sit though the lesser scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, probably leaks...Horrid Assembly!","review":"1.

Then try to rember which combination of buttons to push to make the man plant the bomb. After twenty minutes of set up time the enemy attacks but it happens so fast you can't move any of your men around in response to the attack. If you lose even one of your men the games over.

This is by far the most complicated game I have ever played due to the controls. The game does have a wonderful tutorial for learning the controls that from start to finish is only about an hour long. EIDOS should have packaged this game with a 300 page quick referance guide just for the controls. This is probably the worst game I have ever purchased. Granted it is very complicated to learn; however you would think it would be fun to play once you get the controls down.

But actually this game is extremely boring. First, hte controls are very difficult to understand. Second, this game is incredibly difficult. I owned this game for 2 months and only beat two levels. I ,personally, like action games that put you on the edge of your seat. This game made you get on the edge of your seat because you almost fell asleep playing it. Even if you turn down the difficulty, it is still nearly impossible. The view is third person lokking from above onto the game. Sometimes this view can get very frustrating in parts of the game. Therefor, this game is definently not worth your money. If someone gave this game 4 or 5 stars i would be very fascinated to figure out what is wrong with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Them","review":"I love the clip in extensions.

He made more of a fool of himself here than he did in THE BETSY...and that's saying something.I know the video industry has absurdly abused anniversary editions, but no company has been more abusive and insulting thanLION'S GATE (once known as ARTISAN, and LIVE).To celebrate a 25th anniversary of a horrendous film, shows how pathetic some people in Hollywood are just to make a buck.For shame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched it in class","review":"My friends and I thought it was alot alike the movie Yentle.

I first saw \\"The Jazz Singer\\" in 1980 in the cinema and was immediately hooked on Neil Diamond. It was gratifying to find a Jewish story on the big screen, too, with Shabbat and Yom Kippur services and Hebrew songs, juxtaposed with Diamond's secular hits. Looking back after 26 years of life experience and three extended stays in Israel, I can't help but to have warm memories of this movie. The story, in my opinion, was sufficient to maintain interest, and although the acting was either VERY method (and who can forget Olivier's \\"Eye Heff No Son!!\\"--how often has THAT been passed into popular culture such as \\"The Simpsons!\\") or painfully amateur, this film is eminently enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Diamond is ENTERTAINMENT!","review":"I loved Neil Diamond - he came across great in this movie even thought he's of course not an actor.

I found it less terrible than people have said. Neil Diamond isn't a great actor, but he does a competent job, and Olivier is very entertaining with his coke-bottle eyeglasses and heavy accent. (James Booth is a treat, as always, for the five minutes or so he's onscreen. More! More!) The biggest plausibility problem, for me, had to do with the overnight success of Diamond's screen character. With those songs? And that (nonexistent) stage show? Dream on.

In that volume, every single joke in every single film is indexed. Quite impressive, actually.This book is for true die-hard fans. In addition to covering the obligatory biographies/career overview/filmography, it chronicles the Stooges' relatively unknown works, including comic books, record albums, and television shows.The career overview and filmography and biographies are among the most entertaining and tidbit packed of any Three Stooges book, and this even contains an introduction by Joe Besser.

(Let me exclude the ever classic Gloria Estefan...thank you for some dignity) Since when did every stripper get a recording contract, and ATTEMPT to become what Selena was naturally?? Where were the TRUE artists of Tejano? Where was Shelly Lares?Jennifer Pena? David Lee Garza? La Mafia? They would have done Selena justice.

Apart from this event being a total mockery of what Selena stood for, to release this CD is as comparable of a tribute to Selena as it would be to dance on her grave.

Instead we got alot of people who prior to her death did not even know of Selena's existence! So are we lead to believe that these people all seriously felt grief in their hearts when they falsely said \\"we miss you Selena!\\" at the concert?.

I watched the tribute in disbelief when it aired and was truly taken aback. I felt that most of the performers butcherd Selena's songs, The re-inacments were not of Selena's style, and most of the people who sang her songs were not sincere at all. It was a big dissapoitment for me, being a Selena fan. The only few people who I thought were at least decent was Gloria Estefan and the young Puerto Rican who sang \\"No Debes Jugar.\\" I must say, I do question the vocal abilities of some of the females who sang; Ana Barbara, Thalia...But I am not writing this review to bash anyone, I'm writing to give my opinion of this albume. Personally, I wouldn't buy it becuase for me it's not a very good representation of what Selena/Tejano is.

The only artist who seemed to even seem half sincere was India. God bless her and that beautiful voice. She was also one of the few to do any justice to Selena's timeless classics. I am sure Selena's father already has another 5 greatest hits compilations lined up in case this tribute album flops, which I hope it does.

When I called Sanyo service, they said the unit is discontinued and there are no parts available in any of their warehouse and offered no further assistance.[...] is being great about accepting it back and offering a refund, but since there are still some of these units available (and in white as well as stainless), anyone considering purchasing one should assume they will get no warranty love from Sanyo and will need to return the unit to the seller if it breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toaster for everday use","review":"We've been very pleased with this toaster oven after using it for a month.

The trays pop out when you open the door...no more digging out burnt toast from a regular toaster!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, with qualifications","review":"It is compact, neat, and provides more flexibility than a conventional toaster, at the price of perhaps a slightly longer toast time. It does the job,and does it well, but it is a toaster, not much of a toaster oven.Dislikes: (i) It does not shut off automatically when the door is opened. (ii) It has a clockwork timer that has several toasted-ness settings - you need to ignore those and learn to mentally calibrate it yourself. Not hard, but you need to know.

This is exactly the kind of toaster oven I need. I experimented a bit making toast before giving my regular toaster away. Some give it a negative mark for having no thermostat the user can set. It seems to heat up to about 375 degrees and the only control is time. This suits me fine. I am not good enough of a cook to fiddle around with different heat settings.So, as you can see, I am giving it an upcheck from the point of view of an old coot living alone who needs something simple to warm up his grub."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little toaster","review":"I first purchased the Sanyo Toaster Oven approximately twenty years ago, and I loved it. It is tall and takes up much less counter space than the conventional ones. My trusty toaster was white, and over the years it got a bit discolored - but I never once had a problem with it working. I just purchased a new Toasty Oven from Amazon - at a great price of $50 with free shipping - in the silver color and retired my old white one. The new one looks and works the same way my old one did, and I am very happy with it. I use it mainly for toasting bread. If you need a basic toaster, I would absolutely recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly disappointed by this one","review":"'Hula Done It' is much the same as the previous books in writing and style. I have, up to this point loved this series; however, I do not understand the vitriolic attack against overweight people in this novel. Nor did I find it to be the usual light-hearted pokes the author traditionally has indulged in. I would not have minded that. But, after the ongoing mean spirited comments about overweight people, I found it galling to read how physically alluring and perfect Emily was. I found the repetitive comments to be insulting and negative and cannot bring myself to continue the book, much less the series. It seemed to me to bring out an arrogantly demeaning and cruel side of Emily I'd rather not be exposed to. This is a shame as the premise was funny and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a good book","review":"I love this author and have not read anything I didn't like.

The third book, \\"Pasta Imperfect\\" was mediocre at best - very juvenile. But \\"Hula Done It\\" is downright unreadable.

Yes, it often needs to be reassembled, especially if your child is closer to 3 and if he's rambunctious. But it gets better as they get used to it and get older.

Every time he moves a door or opens a window, something falls off. Or the whole thing falls down because he picks it up and the levels don't stay together.We have owned the Little People farms, garages, etc. and they are great, but we thought he was ready for something a little more advanced.

So I got rid of the first coffeemaker, and got a coffeemaker with an insulated metal carafe. The metal carafe wouldn't break. Unfortunately, The insulated carafe coffeemaker was posessed, and dumped coffee on the floor whenver the filter basket wasn't set exactly so. So, when the husband made coffee, or when he allowed guests to make coffee (Bad husband!), coffee dumped out everywhere.

She expect to be able to play her own music now :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing toy","review":"We bought it to my second son's 1st birthday a couple weeks ago. We wanted a toy which is good for a 1 year old but a 3 years old can enjoy too. This toy is great with wonderful new ideas. While it teaches e.g the alphabet and the numbers since it is big and has great features it can help the babies excercise too! It has two convinient volume level which is really useful in our noisy life.I was afraid that it would easily tip over, but it is sturdy, even my really big 3 years old son can't push it over!I can definitely suggest it, actually this is the best toy we ever had (and we have a lot!!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Awesome","review":"My daughter received this item for christmas last year (2004) and loves it.

There are so many activities, she is constantly discovering something new. First she learned to open and close the door, then to open the mailbox, then the window, etc. And there are a couple of things that she has yet to discover. Although it is regrettable that I find myself singing the little songs it plays, it is well worth it! The smartest buy we've made (as far as toys go).Just a follow up: My daughter is now almost 5 years old, and still won't let us put this toy away. It remains one of her favorites, after all these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great toy!","review":"Our daughter received this toy for her first birthday. At this time, she enjoyed pressing the buttons and turning the light switch on and off. As she got older and her play got more imaginative, this toy was perfect!

It was a Christmas present for our younger daughter, who was just 6 months old at the time. She loved it from the first moment she saw it by the tree. In just 2 months she has learned how to open and close all the doors, move the numbers for the address, get the shapes out of the door, ring the doorbell, move the hands on the clock, change the sun and the moon, and press the buttons on the radio. She plays with this every day, either independently or with others. An added bonus is how much fun our 3-year old thinks this is too. She loves to play house with her sister. I would recommend this toy for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Christmas Present!","review":"I can't believe how much fun my 17mo son has had with this house in the past few days.

It keeps him entertained for several minutes at a time, several times a day. We've had it for nearly 2 months now and it's only just starting to lose it's initial interest. The songs are fun, the activities are multi-leveled for exploration that is appropriate for a child who is developing new skills all the time.In the beginning, my son was satisfied with just opening and closing the door. Eventually, he's explored the toy on deeper and deeper levels to learn how to open and close the window, to turn the clock, to choose which radio button is his favorite song, and so no. This is an EXCELLENT toy and its value matches its price."},{"rating":"2","title":"FISHER PRICE LEARNING HOME","review":"I bought this for my 15 month old grand-daughter.

In addition, he stands on the little step, holds onto the moon, and rocks back and forth...twice he has pulled the entire thing on top of himself. When he was younger, he would use openings in the door to stand himself up. Then, as a door would naturally do, it would swing and he'd land flat on his face and cry.

She sings along with all the songs and loves saying all the little saying for all the actions.It's a versatile and truely educational toy. My daughter had a slight speech delay and the specialists that came to our house were completely enamored with the house and are talking seriously about getting at least one for their center!My only issue with this toy was the key. It didn't stay in place, and there was nowhere to store it. BUT I've seen they've fixed that in the newer models by attatching it to the door.

She just turned two, so we've had it for a year. Many toys have come and gone during that year, but this one is a hands-down favorite that she still plays with several times each day. I think what she enjoys most about it are all the little songs it plays because she loves music. But she also loves the activities -- crawling through the door, playing \\"get the mail\\", opening the window to peek through and say \\"I see you\\". Even my four-year old likes playing with it. They will play a game of \\"crawling chase\\" where they chase each other through the little door.

I wasn't sure if I really wanted to spend so much for just one thing for a one year old, but looking back now, I think it's worth twice the price! My daughter is now almost 22 months and still plays with it every day - although she likes to stand on the end of it and rock it back and forth which scares me a little. But it has been the best purchase I've ever made. I love all of the different activities and it has so many different songs that I never get tired of it. My daughter loves to play peek-a-boo behind the door and through the window. And we've had absolutely no problems with the durability - all parts are still together and it looks as good as the day I put it together despite her being very rough with it. Believe me - it is worth ever penny!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best toy purchase for our third child who is now 19 months","review":"Wow. I don't go crazy over toddler toys. In fact, after three kids I generally don't notice what my 19 month old is playing with because he tends to play with the older kids toys. By the time I had him I was kind of \\"over\\" buying baby toys and had given a lot of the toddler toys away. We got this as a gift from a friend when our baby was 6 months and he has been playing with it non-stop since then. First he was able to crawl up and press the buttons. Now he walks through and does all the activiites. There are still activities he will grow into. Our other children ages 6 and 8 have a blast crawling through it with him and using it as a play house. It's big but really worth it. We ended up putting all the pieces to the shape sorter away because he tosses these around the house. Without those pieces there is nothing to clean up and it's 20 toys in one. A real winner. Yea to Fisher Price this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE BEST!","review":"This was the best toy that I have ever bought. I bought this when my youngest daughter was 9 months old.

She is now 21 months and still uses this house on a daily basis. The songs that it plays are so cute and catchy, she loves to dance to them.

She is now 18 months and while she doesn't play with it as much as she used to, she is still discovering new things, like the shape sorter.

It is so durable, busy, and fun. Their favorite when they started crawling was the doorbell and the light switch.

I've spend literally many delighted hours watching the awe and joy in my grandson's expressions as he plays with this superb toy.

It has been very durable and very stable--she has never managed to knock it over, which is something I was concerned about when she was \\"cruising.\\" It does play music and make noise, but it also has an off switch. This is just about the only toy of hers that in my opinion deserves five stars. This is a great buy because it will be played with so much and last so long--really grows with the child.

At 14 months, I started reading the scripture in the Devotion from the Bible so he can become familiar with the source.

The pieces look like you can assemble them any which way. The first time you assemble the walls and the platform won't snap on top you learn otherwise. You end up putting it together and then taking it apart and trying again. The pieces have a specific way of going together that is not easy to figure out. It looks simple like Lego's, but really it is much more complex. I have to wonder if they did any usability testing.

The switch of my six year old Braun which made excellent coffee broke and the replacement cost was more than a new model. I found no negatives with the process of preparing the coffee but keep in mind that the gold coffee filter (which my older Braun came with) is not included with this product, but.....fortunately, I was able to use the old one in this model instead of paper filters.

Good coffee is ready in just a few minutes.I read a lot of the complaints. Talk about whiners. One complained about no timer (order the Braun with the timer!) and another that it was too hard to fill (this hardly requires skilled eye-had coordination).If you want a coffeemaker that is well built, dependable, and makes good coffee without spending an arm and a leg, this one will fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the sponge out, we're making coffee!","review":"I had owned a Braun coffeemaker earlier but had switched over to Krups and was dissapointed. So I went back to Braun, purchasing the KF510 with a separate gold filter. Overall the design is good, it's a stylish piece. Coffee was decent and hot but what I found really dissapointing was the pause and serve feature. I don't think it works properly and after removing it, the coffee floods seem to have stopped. I'm not sure if I got a bum coffeemaker or what but I've seen mention of this issue in a couple of other reviews... So I guess I'll have to buy another one!(Addendum: The pause/serve feature doesn't always work so the coffee ends up coming out of drainage holes at the top of the filter basket and not out of the drip spout, very messy!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing Braun Performance","review":"Compared to a previous Braun Coffeemaker that we replaced the performance is poor.

We had the ability to determine the automatic shutoff time, which is important to us. The new model has only a two hour shutoff. However, after a few weeks, the shutoff failed. The only reason that we replaced the old machine is that the Carafe broke and would have cost over $20 to replace it, so we opted for a new one. Bad choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good coffeemaker","review":"I am very happy with this coffeemaker. I was looking for a no-frills coffeemaker to replace my 13-year-old Braun.

It also offers superior ergonomics. The unit is well designed and comfortable. The carafe opens easily and feels secure in the hand. The water resevoir is wide open so that you do not have to be William Tell pouring the water into the resevoir. There is an outside water level indicator just can case you use a vegetable sprayer to fill the carafe. It has a pop out cone basket for easy access. It also offers a Brita water filtration system which only improves the coffee flavor.My only complaint - it is only a 10 Cup Maker. One can never have enough coffee so it would have been nice to have the 12 Cup option but alas, I guess that means I'll just have to make another pot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun KF510-BK","review":"I'm disappointed in this coffee maker.

Ergonomic handle fits hand comfortably.Only very minor complaints - 1) head of steam comes rolling out when done making coffee 2) when pouring water in several drops always land on the carafe plate making spattering sounds and 3) carafe lid does not stay open by itself when filling with water.

The basket is easy to fill as it isn't tippy as are many others. The sight gauge/level on the side is easy to see, making filling with water easy. The 10 cup size is more practical and handier than the 12 cup machines I've had in the past. Two criticisms. The on/off swith is too easy to activate by mistake when moving the machine. Second, there is no automatic off feature, so you have to remember to turn it off before you leave the house. This is a glaring deficiency.

Unlike Brauns of the past, this one gushes the water through so quickly that it doesn't saturate the grounds. Hence, the coffee is weak and tasteless.

The stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works, when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere, and if you do not use additional paper filters, you get coffee grains.

The carafe does not drip and has an ergonomic handle. The coffee is really hot but the hot waterjettisons out and pushes the grinds in the filter to the sides which makes for a weak cup of coffee.Today I will bring this coffeemaker back and will probably get a Black&Decker; for half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aune provides up-to-date Revelation commentary","review":"Not since R.

It looks OK and reasonably well made, though the gray components are a rather flimsy plastic. But what a disappointment! This is the most uneven toaster we have ever experienced. The problem seems to be the outer heating elements. The inner elements (in the center between the two slots) are the typical flat metal filaments. However the outer element (on the outboard side of each slot) is a single ceramic rod about a 1/2\\" in diameter, which is positioned horizontally in the lower third of the slot. So, if you toast something long enough to give it some color you will find the lower half is dark while the upper half is virtually untouched. We sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Toaster Choice","review":"The Rowenta toaster is an excellent choice. First and foremost it does what it is supposed to do: it toasts very well!Why only 4 stars then? The only drawback is that the toaster slots are about 1/16\\" to 1/8\\" too short so that some brands of bread loaves can't quite fit and have to be put in the toaster lengthwise. Other than that we are quite pleased and while the design is not your \\"typical\\" toaster design, it has a \\"newness and freshness\\" to the design that we like."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGH PRICE+HIGH EXPECATIONS =BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"I bought this because of using a Rowenta iron for a few years and knowing that the extra $ for it was well spent. Also, after reading reviews from this site and reading its high ratings from other people who had purchased it. If we don't have a defective one then everybody who gave a 4 or 5 rating is insane!! I bought the new one because my girlfriend was tired of the one I owned for 10 years and I thought Rownta would make a bombproof unit like their irons. It is the most uneven toaster I have ever used. I could care less if we paid $15-20 that would be expected but considering their price no way. I'm in the process of returning, I'm going to try to get another one and see if it was faulty but I'm not holding my breath.

I found the 200, which is essentially the same camera with higher resolution (1600x1200).Your computer sees it as a removable drive, so downloading is as easy as cut and paste. You don't even need drivers for XP Pro.A couple caveats-after you take the picture, you have to wait about 10 secs to take the next one. The other problem-just like others have said-battery consumption. Standard alkalines will last about 15 minutes if you use the LCD. Get the Ni-MH rechargables-they last hours and you then you can recharge them.Overall, I am extremely happy for with this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"This camera is not so great. I received it as a present some years ago, so I can't really complain all that much.

Many of them have large lines running through them.--It takes the camera quite a long time to turn on and then it beeps for a while.--Batteries get the life sucked out of them. The batteries it came with couldn't even keep the camera on long enough for it to stop beeping and let me take a picture.--The date and time is printed on every picture in large, orange font and it resets itself every time the batteries are taken out.

I had NBA Live 2001 for PS1 and it seems like that game has more controls than this one. First of all, the big name players can always find a way to get inside and dunk. There are just too many foul calls when you even try to steal the ball. You can't do any fake passes or pivot one way and go the other way ( or at least I haven't been able to do it, and I pressed every button on the controller).One thing I was shocked about was that there is No Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry, or Trenton Hassel on the Chicago Bulls. They have almost every other draft pick except for these guys, I mean Chandler and Curry were the 2nd and 4th pick, how can you not have those two in the game???"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn...","review":"Im VERY glad I rented this game before I bought it. Im really dissappointed in EA. Madden 2002, NHL 2002, and F1 2001 are all very good games. I was hoping for the same in their NBA game. After playing a season of NBA 2K1 on my rommate's Dreamcast last year, I was expecting to have my jaw dropped by this game. The camera angles were poor at best. The controls weren't all that. The only thing that saved this game at all was the 1 on 1 play. But the terrible music that was playing there ruined that, too! After renting this game, I will be renting ALL games before I buy them. It just goes to show that even the great EA can come out with a dud. I returned the game after the first night and got NHL 2002 again. THATS a fun game. THIS is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed by this game considering the PC-based NBA Live series is so much fun. The players move very stiffly, and their other movements for things like blocking shots and playing defense looks very artificial and unrealistic. Also, the system for storing stats in season mode is woefully inadequate. Every player on the active roster is charged for a game played regardless of whether that player actually plays. On offense, a simple ball fake will almost always get the oposing player in the air, allowing your player in for an easy dunk. But even then the movements are very stiff. I was hoping that the more powerful processor on the Xbox would increase the excitement of the EA Sports line, but NBA Live 2002 crashes the boards like a skinny two guard. I wouldn't say avoid the game, but just make sure you know what you're getting and that you can live with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben- 20 Years Gaming Vet","review":"Basically not much difference in this version or the PS2. High sky-hook shots from the post is the biggest downfall. Slow play on the advanced level makes a baller play on stater just for excitement.

This coffeemaker is beautifully designed and has an ideal combination of features, but the coffee it makes doesn't have the deep, rich flavor I had experienced with the old Krups. The water flows through quickly in a continuous stream and isn't in contact with the grounds very long. After two weeks of adjusting the amount of coffee, I gave up and purchased a Krups Procafe II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This thing is an absolute steal. It makes great coffee and the design is simple while genius.

For 6 cups of coffee I need to use 6 heaping tbsp of coffee, where in my previous coffee maker I could get by with 3 or so. My wife also noticed that the coffee was very weak the first time she used this coffee maker.

I bought two of them (one for my primary residence and one for a vacation house) and they both have the same problems. When the coffe is through dripping, it is too hot to drink. The worst problem is that if the coffee is gorund too fine, the basket overflows and leaves large puddles of coffee on the counter. The manual addresses this problem, advising the use of a coarser grind. but then you need more coffee grounds for the same amount of coffee. I have had these pots for two months, and am replacing them"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Braun's Traditional Standards","review":"We have used Braun's better model (was called the FlavoSelect) for many years. We chose this model because we make coffee only once a day now, and usually no more than 6 cups.In every way, this new model does not look, feel, or perform up to Braun's traditionally very high standard. I certainly would not trade it for Mr. Coffee or anything else I've seen on the retail shelves. But it is just less than we expected from Braun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filter Basket IS replaceable","review":"Have had my Braun KF550 coffee maker about a week and it makes wonderful coffee!In one of the reviews, I saw that the filter basked could be replaced in the black or white only but not the grey/silver. I wrote the company and here's what they replied:In regard to your inquiry, we do have silver/black trim filter basket available for your Braun unit. At this time it is not currently listed on-line, but you may purchase this item by calling us at 1-800-924-4950, Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The item number for the basket you are looking for is C7050-288 Silver.So, everyone, enjoy your coffee maker and fear not, the KF550 filter basket CAN be replaced in the same color that came with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor!","review":"We are very disappointed with the coffee maker. The coffee itself is not horrible unless you use the gold filter and then you have grounds in your cup even if you use the more coarse blends. The most annoying thing is the dribbling pot. You have to pour over the sink unless you want to wipe up spills. The basket has also overflowed several times which makes a huge mess. Also, the temperature of the coffee is not hot enough. I would not recommend this coffee maker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Coffee Maker !","review":"After reading some of the reviews here on Amazon, I was a bit reluctant to try this coffee maker. But then I thought \\"what the heck\\" and decided to buy it anyway. I've had the Braun KF550 for about six months now and I've been very pleased with it. This little coffee maker brews a great cup of coffee (and the machine looks great on my counter). It doesn't have many of the bells and whistles that some other models offer, but who needs those anyway. If what's really important to you is great tasting coffee, then give this coffee maker a try.I haven't had any of the problems described in some of the other reviews (such as overflow or coffee grounds in my coffee). If you're concerned with the possibility of coffee grounds getting into your brew, you can always use a paper filter. They're cheap and easy to find - my grocerty store sells them for less than $2 a box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hot: wrecks beans","review":"If you're a serious coffee drinker and can get top quality beans (like Peet's) stay away from this machine. It has the worst possible fault in a coffee-maker: the water is too hot. It's not very much too hot, but the oils in coffee are so volatile than being over maybe two degrees can wreck a good cup. I've encountered this problem before: I think Americans still think coffee should be \\"hot\\" like in the percolator days. It shouldn't be. Anyway this one went back right away (always a plus with Amazon) and I'll keep my old, stained Braun in action until I find a better replacement. (If you're not particular I suppose it does everything else fine and it is pretty.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly weak coffee","review":"We were very happy with our previous Braun coffee maker, so when it finally died on us after years of faithful service, we naturally bought this updated model. Unfortunately, the new system now pumps water through the grounds so fast that the coffee comes out extremely weak (if you can see through your coffee, it's too weak). The only solution we've found so far is to grind the coffee really fine, but that makes for muddy coffee. We're fed up and going to get a new one - not a Braun this time! Don't buy this coffee maker if you appreciate good, strong coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it - filters cost more than the coffee maker!","review":"This is my third Braun coffee maker in 20 years, which demonstrates Braun's reliability and my loyalty. HOWEVER learn from my mistake - when I purchased this unit two years ago, the filters were inexpensive. Now they are very hard to find and third party sellers are price gouging. Read the reviews on the filters and run screaming - use your own filtered water and avoid this model.Braun + Brita = price gouging - SHAME on you both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun = excellent coffee","review":"I'm very happy with this coffeemaker. It brews an excellent cup of coffee reasonably quickly, the basket is easy to remove and clean, and the unit is attractive. I had looked extensively at other units with stainless steel carafes but after reading about problems with retaining heat, etc. decided it was more practical to just get a simpler coffeemaker and use a separate airpot/carafe to keep my coffee hot. The only drawback about this decision is that I have to remember to turn the unit off after emptying the carafe! I chose to use paper filters instead of the included gold cone--I'm glad it takes the full #4 filter as I had to cut about an inch off the tops to fit my old coffemaker--and I also don't use the Britta filters as I have a water treatment unit in my house so I'm glad it came with a \\"dummy\\" replacement. Overall, I have no complaints at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cup of coffee every time","review":"Consistently good cup of coffee -- actually enough coffee for two adults who like coffee.

It could be restarted, but stopped the machine again and again. This coffeemaker should have lasted a very long time, and I am disappointed. I've had Brauns that lasted until I had beaten them into ugliness, but they never stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, that's about it though...","review":"I bought Braun because the name used to mean high quality, but I think they've lost the plot. The coffee is very weak & there is no setting to change this - I've had to resort to using more coffee to try to get the strength to a reasonable level - surprising from a European company. (My old $30 Philips had a coffee strengh setting - this can't be a difficult feature to implement). The pot always dribbles when you pour, so I am forever wiping up spots, and you can't pour a cup while it's still brewing - coffee continues to dribble through the filter opening (I think the design of the lever to control this is too complex - the leaking started after about a month).I see the price has come down by $10 since I bought mine - I think I know why..."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak coffee","review":"While the overall design of the maker is great -- the carafe pours without dripping, parts remove and fit well, and it looks great -- the new \\"fast brew\\" system pushes the water through much too quickly, resulting in a very weak cup of coffee. Even putting in more beans than usual did not help improve the coffee to our liking. If you like your coffee strong, as I do, I would highly recommend against any of the AromaDeluxe models. We were very disappointed with the quality of the coffee it made."},{"rating":"2","title":"very stress-free","review":"After A LOT of research, we bought this coffee maker and love it.

No electronics to fail except a 2hr shutoff which is a good safety feature. The carafe is easy in and out, does not spill when you pour, and has an ergonomic handle. It brews fast and delivers hot coffee. It is a militta style basket (good) with swing-out easy access. Bottom line is that it is very functional while being tasteful and doesn't cost a fortune. The one and only drawback was that we would have preferred a white coffee maker. Oh, well, it's the coffee that counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything excellent except 100 minute shutoff is too soon.","review":"Old Braun lasted 10 years with almost daily use; we loved it; only fault was spillage if poured too fast. Been using new KF550-BK daily for 1 month. Everything works very well except 100 minute shutoff is not settable and is too short for us (our fault for choosing this model). We like the glass pot (instead of stainless; you can see how much is left), it won't spill no matter how fast you pour, the filter has a tapered bottom (instead of flat) so it requires less coffee, also works well when making a small amount of coffee, easy to clean, black hides stains. Nothing to complain about except 100 minute shutoff. You can turn it back on after it shuts off; coffee will still be hot if you catch it in time. Our old Braun had status LEDS and \\"coffee ready\\" and \\"4 hr(settable)shut off\\" polite beeps which we miss, but now I'm being real picky."},{"rating":"1","title":"QC getting worse at Braun","review":"My last one (same model) was good.

Save your money on this set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"stylish and cool looking","review":"This was not the machine I wanted. I read the recommednadtions of the ones i wanted and was disappointed. I went to the store and saw this model. It has a great feel with the rubber handle. It is stylish and looks very contemporay. It is solid and not flimsy at all. I orgianly wanted a all in one with machine, but found they always seem to have problems. Tis machine does what it is supose to do. It bvrews coffee and has a timer. It has the cool little water filter extra whioch gets rid of cholrine build up in the tank. It is a great solid machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Coffeemaker","review":"Braun makes excellent coffeemakers, though they can be hard to find, especially in the color white. Was looking for a replacement for my previous 5 year old Braun model. Had new water filters that could only be used in that brand. After much searching, I found the Braun KF580 AromaDeluxe (in white) here on Amazon from a partner site. It was listed as \\"like new\\", but used. The price was reduced, so I took a chance and bought it. Don't think it was ever used, but the owner's manual was missing. A minor detail, as I was able to download the manual from Braun's website. Packaging and delivery was excellent. I am very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun","review":"I had a Braun coffee maker before. It was one of the best coffee makers I ever had.There are draw backs to this coffee maker:1. It is Highly over priced.2. They don't make a twelve cup coffee maker.3. This one seems flimsy,not as durable as my old one.4. It doesn't seem to brew very hot.5. You can't see the water level on the side very well.6. Couldn't find it in black. Coffee stains the white after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, inconsistent coffee","review":"We've been using Brauns for years -- they make a decent cup of coffee even if I can never seem to pour from the carafe without spilling. But this most recent one...bad, bad, bad. Some key flaws:1. On our previous machine, we used 5-6 coffee scoops to make a strong 8 cup pot. This one requires at least 8. That's 33% more coffee.2. Even with the additional coffee, the taste is inconsistent. One day it is strong enough...the next day it tastes like a brown crayon dipped in warm water.3. The coffee never seems to get hot enough. We don't even keep the carafe on the burner, preferring to pour it right into a thermos.4. A good 20% of the time, something weird happens -- the water may spray out of the grounds; the water may start to leak; etc. etc.The unit is now on its way to trash-heap retirement. And I can say that its replacement will not be a Braun. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braun coffeemaker experience","review":"I bought the Braun 10 cup white coffeemaker about one year ago. My coffeepot appears to have the same features as this one except for the TimeControl. I can not find out if my model is still available. Initially I read positive reviews and was quite pleased with it. I had owned a Braun coffee pot previously for 18 years with no problems until the heating element went out. This new coffeemaker, however, has developed a series of problems so severe that I am going to throw it out. Initially the coffee started tasting bitter, especially if not poured as soon as it was made. Then the \\"pause and pour\\" feature quit, and I noticed the coffeepot started dripping whenever I poured from it. The most recent change is that the filter basket swings out while the coffee is brewing, every time!! I won't buy Braun again."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok coffeemaker but overpriced","review":"I like cone-type coffee makers. Braun was always the way to go. I tried to find them in \\"brick-and-mortar\\" stores and I could not find any! So I look online, and there's only 2 choices: The old units (plastic) sold online and overpriced, or the new units on the Braun website (stainless steel and outrageously expensive). I went this direction but I have to say a plastic coffee maker should NOT cost this much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make really weak coffee and aroma.","review":"we bought this Braun KF580 Aroma Deluxe 10cup cofeemaker several months ago. And, I'm so sorry we did!! this machine brew coffee very fast, resulting in a very weak taste. We have to use 2 filters and double the dose of coffee than usual(believe me, a bag of coffe goes very fast at this speed) and still can't have a good cup of coffee. You can't even have that good smell of coffee in the house when brewing, it is such a disapointment for us. It's to a point that I surch for another coffeemaker now. If you like to wake up and smell coffee in the house and drink a good cup of coffee with a rich aroma, DON'T buy this model its a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"super coffee","review":"This is a better coffeemaker than I thought I would get. Must be the water filter. The coffee is excellent. I grind my own and found I like using the paper filter better than the included gold reusable one. I grind it pretty fine and the instructions said not to do that or sediment would be in the coffee. Hubby actually liked that - I did not. I won. Great coffee maker. Will buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Coffee Maker","review":"We have had braun coffee pots for several years and have been happy with the coffee maker. Unfortunately, the two coffee makers that we had ordered from Amazon had a persistent leaking problem unlike the exact same models that we have had in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffemaker","review":"I've been using the Braun KF580 AromaDeluxe 10-Cup TimeControl Coffemaker for five (5) weeks now and I love it. I had a Braun 12-Cup coffemaker, for years and loved it, so when it 'died of old age' I wanted another Braun coffemaker. I purchased this 10-Cup one and found it to be just as good as the 12-Cup one. It does keep the coffee warmer, than the 12-Cup one, but I've learned to like that. It overflows down the back of the unit, through an overflow notch, if you overfill it past the visible 10 cup marker, so be aware of that. If asked would I buy this unit again, the answer is a definite YES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good...","review":"After one week in service, I'd say that this maker is a definite notch above the Braun KF-420 that it replaced. The coffee stays nice and hot and the water filter prevents having to use bottled water. And it's made in the Czech Republic, so it's at least got a chance of lasting a little while before it goes the way of all coffeemakers. I don't think most folks who used the earlier Braun coffeemakers will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm Weak Coffee","review":"This machine makes warm, weak coffee. I have tried adding more coffee and using different blends, but the coffee remains weak. I am throwing this machine out and buying a different brand. I am quite disappointed with this Braun product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with Braun....","review":"I had purchase a lot of Braun small appliances but this would be the first time it failed me. Month after the warranty expired, it died on me. Have the cheaper braun and it's till brewing after 5 years. I guess I'll try another brand...Shame on your Braun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tast poorly designed","review":"I really love Braun and was excited to get this. I wasnt disappointed to get the same great flavor that I had with my old unit. Yet the design of the carafe sucks. It leaks virtually every time I pour no matter what. I have resort to pouring it into a thermal carafe, which I prefer anyway. I just pour it over the sink and who cares if it leaks. I have come to live with it. But it is ridiculous that such a thing was made. Dont tell me that it tested in the factory without spilling. The previous model didnt spill. Just like an idiot to change a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"when unplugged it does not come back on","review":"I had this machine for about 3 weeks. A week ago I unplugged it to move it and when I plugged it back in it would not come on. Finally the next day I plugged it in again and it came on. This has happened two more times since. I called customer service, expecting them to ship me a new one, but they wanted me to take it to an authorized dealer to verifiy the issue. The machine works great when it is working. The coffee is hot!."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason why the warranty is limited to 1 year","review":"I'm writing this review because I came to the Amazon site to check on the replacement cost of this coffee maker. After 1.5 years of daily use, it seems to have died (no power - the screen is blank). Because I invested in a 3 pack of Brita filters (they are expensive!) I thought that I might go ahead and just replace this coffee maker. After all, it's a fairly low-priced option for what you get: the coffee does taste good and the programming feature is handy. However, as others have mentioned, it tends to drip behind the carafe, which can be messy. The mid-brew pour never worked on mine. Though I have the now useless Brita filters, I will most likely try a different brand and model because I'm not interested in annually replacing my coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool, bad coffee","review":"Life is just too short to get frustrated by bad coffee every morning. A decent cup (or three) of *strong* coffee is all I require - is this too much to ask? Apparently so for this machine. It looks cool and the carafe feels heavy and high quality, but the coffee is really weak and awful. I have been putting in 2-3 extra scoops of grounds and I still don't like the coffee. Now, I feel like I'm just throwing good money after bad by wasting all that extra coffee grounds. Plus, the warming plate keeps the coffee way too hot and it tastes burned within 15 minutes or so. I figured out why the coffee is so weak - the hot water only sprays out of one little hole onto the grounds - my previous Krups had about 6 little holes to \\"shower\\" the coffee grounds. I wish I could return this Braun - I will give it away and buy either another Krups or a Cuisinart."},{"rating":"2","title":"The luck of Red Orm--classic action adventure","review":"\\"The Long Ships\\" deserves all of the reviewer praise that it has received on this site. When a title receives unanimous fives from more than 70 readers, you know it's something pretty special. It has also inspired a large number of well-written reviews over the years, leaving me with little more to say than, even at more than 500 pages, it's a story that you don't want to end. The writing is straight forward, witty and engrossing from the first page, and it makes you want to read it again and again. Well-researched history and great entertainment. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old yarn","review":"If you liked Michael Chabon's Gentlemen of the Road, you will love this, which I believe was the inspiration for that first book. Published in 1954, it is by turns, epic saga, straight forward, historical, engaging and sly, and generally a satisfying old yarn about the Vikings in Scandinavia in the 10th century. Adventures on the high seas, romance, and kidnapping abound. Released as a New York Review Books Classic. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Saga","review":"Very well done. Definitely shows where Robert Low's inspiration for the Oathsworn series appears to have come from (from title character on through the story). The dry, understated humor is excellent, as advertised. NOTE: this is not a rock 'em, sock 'em Viking action story, but much more of an updated Saga. The cultural insights are superb and it is overall a very enjoyable read once you get into the rhythm of the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"One of the most exciting surprises I have run across in a long time. Bengtsson has managed to take the literary style and tone of the great sagas, and modernize it without losing any of the original, laconic humor. A very happy surprise and at the same time, some dismay that this book is not better recognized for the adventurous gem it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Long Ships","review":"Written during WWII, this wonderful adventure, one volume in four parts, is a droll early medieval travelogue, a comradely adventure tale, a wonderful romance, a wild comedy, and a held in its grip read for all ages. Ord the Viking, his mother, his Love and his Fellow Oarsman,Toke, are characters to remember forever, to say nothing of King Ethelred the Unready and his frail, but bold little priest. A serious and amusing classic. Frans Bengtsson wrote well and with with passion and a tongue in cheek of his people. Walwyn M. Trezise"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Reading","review":"I read this first when I was about ten and now fifty enjoy it as much now as then.I have read The Long Ships about 8 times over the years and still love it.The book is so compelling and interesting I have had dreams about the great hounds from time to time over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelency in Fiction","review":"Not being a big fan of the so called \\"Historical Novel\\", I must admit that \\"The Long Ships\\" are an exception from the general rule that the authors of these will change history at need, and lie outragously at will. Frans Bengtsson did a god groundwork of the field - and of course writes marvously. A classic that can\`t be read too many times, unless inactivity is used as a tool to spare the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book ever","review":"The book I have read the most times by an easy margin, I refer to it as the Bible, it's simple funny, and philosophical. Most suprising from an author who has written so few books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every star!","review":"I was hesitant about this book at first, despite the consistent high marks that other reviewers have given it. But it seemed like something I would probably like, so I tracked down a copy. One word: wow! What a terrible shame that this book isn't currently in print. Absolutely fantastic. I love good historical fiction, and The Long Ships is the best of the best. Intelligent humor and bold adventure in equal measures. I just finished it this morning, and I'm already thinking about the next time I'm going to read it. How many books can you say that about? I can't think of any in recent memory. Easily as good as, say, The Lord Of The Rings, but with the added bonus that it might have actually happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want more?","review":"Frans G. Bengtsson is one of my favorite authors and I sorely wish he had written more. Perhaps not about vikings, because The Long Ships (R?de orm)are so full of action, atmosphere, wisdom and wit that it would be folly to wish for more. Bengtsson has, however, written some hundred essays, only a few of which have been translated into English. They are written in a very different style from that in ORM, but many of them, especially those with historical themes, are so excellent that I keep rereading them (in Swedish). I think they are long overdue an English translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well told and exciting story","review":"I discovered this book in the school library over 30 years ago, and bought my own copy as soon as I found one. A well spun yarn, an adventure story set in the wholly believeable world of the Vikings at a time when Christianity and other new ideas were beginning to make their mark. Buy it, and you will find yourself reading it year after year after year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Viking yarn","review":"Lots of action as well as information about Viking travels and settlements. A story of adventure and Viking long ships."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"If you like historical fiction this is a must read. You will come to love Red Orm and his adventures. But you will also learn a lot of history about Denmark, England, Norway, Sweden, etc. I kept repeatedly referring to Wikipedia to read more about the kings and others that Orm kept meeting up with. I also found out that our modern day bluetooth was named after King Harald Bluetooth! I highly recommend this book to any fan of historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traders or Raiders?","review":"The vikings, according to older theories, were primarily raiders, but this no longer holds true in the academic literature- they are now also seen as traders. Interestingly, the view was put forward by Bengtsson long ago. It's standard reading in our family- has been for 3 generations, and I'm looking forward to reading it aloud to my grandson when he turns 5.INCIDENTALLY- TO ALL OF THOSE WHO CAN'T FIND IT IN THE US- AMAZON.CO.UK SHIPS IT! (I've just sent it to a friend in China.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, vivid and witty, in short one of the best books","review":"I read The Long Ships c.1956. I was a high school student then and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had borrowed the book from the library but since then I couldn't find it in the book stores; either in Europe or in the United States. However, when I went to Sweden in the 1960s, I bought the Swedish version, Rod Orm and with my limited Swedish, I was again able to enjoy it. It is one of the best books I read and enjoyed.

There you can have the picture of the lives of the wonderful Viking seafarers."},{"rating":"2","title":"When?","review":"When the Sam-Dickens is this book going to be published again?

I was engaged the whole way. Great adventure story for a long winters night. Good history read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scandinavian History","review":"I am enjoying this book very much as it gives a good view of the movements of Vikings and the coming of Christianity and how it started to be applied. Also the ways of Odin, and the long boats that went to far thru seas. What violent people they were in their plundering. especially since that blood runs thru our family! The near generations we come from are so far from that kind of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reflection of the Scandanavian Mind","review":"The Long Ships by Frans G. Bengtsson offers a glimpse into the ideals and attitudes of Viking life at end of the 10th century. The Epic takes the readers into the Kingdoms of Spain, England, and Russia as it follows the adventures of Orm and his fellow adventurers. I particularly liked the attitudes expressed as the new religions were confronted. It illustrated how religions are altered to fit the needs and existing attitudes of the new adherants. I agree with the other reviews and wish the book were republished so more people could enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Adventure","review":"Quiet simply, this is one of the great adventure stories. It deserves to be read by everyone who loves wonderful characters, exotic settings, fast action, and clever dialogue.Like Michael Chabon, who writes the introduction, I first read this book as a 13 year old. I remember sneaking the book into church and hiding it in textbooks on top of my desk. I don't remember where I got the copy I read. I always remembered the story, but the title was lost in my memory banks. Despite searching many bookstores through the years, I was never able to find it again.It was a great pleasure to rediscover the book on Amazon. In the last few weeks I've sent Kindle copies to my wife, my grown children, and many friends. I've also bought a couple of hard copies just to make sure I don't loose track of it again.It you only have time to read one book this year, I strongly suggest you choose this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward prose, flat story, poor translation","review":"Although the story started and finished brightly it was a laborious read. I'm a big fan of historical fiction and this appeared promising. However, about a third of the way into the book I found the plot grew cold, the characters grew flat, and my overall enjoyment plummeted.The writing style was awkward and clumsy; I trust the story reads better in its native language than English. This story is intended to be a fun read but it needs a lot of editing and refactoring.If the middle 50% could be edited out of this book, I could, despite the translation, give this a 3 stars. As it is, I find the two stars overly generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Translation!","review":"This is one of the worst translations to English I have ever read. It is so bad I couldn't even finish it. I tried to read it but stopped after 3 chapters. In some places it looks like the translator did a literal translation to English rather than adapting the story. Some phrases used would never be used in the context in which they appear. I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but eventually tedious","review":"Has fun aspects, with believable historic detail. However, the endless 'blood & swash' (to pull a quote from an old favorite move, \\"The Ghost & Mrs. Muir\\") gets a little tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, The Long Ships are indeed long","review":"I know this sounds picky, but I would have enjoyed about half of \\"The Long Ships.\\" What I truly did enjoy, however, was the writing style and the language. Every sentence sounds like it came from one of the Islandic Sagas. This gave a feeling of the Viking Age that was enjoyable. Orm's adventures never seen to end, though he tries to settle down to farming. Is this still part of the Nordic character. I hope so."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Companions Companion","review":"This is an excellent book; it can stand on its own, if you have any interest in that time of history as well as being an excellent companion for Patrick O'Brian's seafaring legacy. It puts all the answers at your finger tips. What is a stone? What or where is the ships knee? And a whole host of other terms from the obscure to common, this book helps answer many of those questions that you might have if you're no well versed in the language, terms, and history of the era. I highly recommend this book as well as Harbors and High Seas by the same author, together they will make your Journey around the world and back again with Jack Aubrey, and Stephen Maturin, a very memorable experience, you may even want to start all over again when you finish. Pleasant voyages, and glorious sunsets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Companion Piece to the Series","review":"While I somewhat enjoyed the task of deciphering and tracking down the myriad of specialized, arcane and obsolete words employed by Patrick O'Brian in his majestic Aubrey-Maturin series, the discovery of this book provided a much more concise and handy way of doing this.O'Brian's vast vocabulary and vast knowledge of seagoing nomenclature as well as late 18th and early 19th century social mores is impressive. This book allows one to appreciate the level of scholarship applied by O'Brian. However, this is much more than a simple glossary. It includes short biographies of leading personages of the day, histories of important battles, diagrams of ships and rigging and geographical references.While one can probably get along without this book; assuming one has access to a good dictionary, encyclopedia and other reference books, this tome certainly eases the task."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Companion Volume For The Series","review":"Covering all of the arcane terms and characters from the age of Napoleonic Fighting Sail, this book makes an excellent companion for the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian. From an \\"Able Seaman\\" to a \\"Younker\\", \\"a Sea Of Words\\" covers the terms needed to understand this lost age. A vital reference for any arm-chair Admiral.Unless you are an expert in the subject of square-rigged sailing ships, this book should be purchased along with the first book of the series \\"Master and Commander\\" and remain at one's side. It will serve the reader in good stead throughout the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheat sheet","review":"I found this book a wonderful resource reading through the series for a second time. I would NOT recommend having this book during your first read through, as stopping to look up a curious phrase cuts into the flow of the book. Just as a child learns vocabulary in context THEN learns to use a dictionary, just like a traveler learns a language more thoroughly by struggling to speak it than by relying on a translator, so should one use this resource as a cheat sheet and not an open book test. The opening chapters on their own are a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the \\"Bible\\" for the Aubrey/Maturin series","review":"Invaluable - Indespensable - Don't start an O'Brian novel (Aubrey/Maturin series) without it. You will waste a lot of time trying to look up references in the usual books (encyclopedia, etc.) on the various every day things mentioned in the Aubrey/Maturin novels. This is the ONLY book you will need. Place it by your side and find that the only references in it, are the ones you need.

Its value is not so much in its historical perspective, although the history is very interesting. The value is in the way it addresses the challenges of life, especially for women. This book takes on the struggle of being an individual and at the same time being part of a community and the necessity of collaboration with give and take. The third important element overall is faith. This is so relevant in today's world at every level from small groups of people to the global economy! There is a need to have a voice and be who we are, and yet sharing and caring and community are essential for our survival. Ultimately, it is necessary to be able to just have faith. Balancing these seemingly opposing forces is what life is all about! I also am impressed at the way Jane addressed the issue of domestic violence. Nice going, Jane. I look forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tale ... but needs proofread!","review":"The story is excellent and you really like the characters (most of them, that is!). The other reviews cover the plot well. The only reason I did not give it five stars was because the Kindle edition was obviously scanned with an OCR and no one previewed it for errors. It seemed like every page had some typos. Things like \\"you'll\\" were written as \\"you 11\\" with ones instead of \\"L\\"s and \\"slaves\\" would be \\"slakes\\" and even \\"Keil\\" sometimes was presented a \\"Veil\\".

I am actually anxious to read the other two in the series, and I hope they'll be as good as this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clearing in the Wild","review":"This is the first of a series of three historical novels. I found it fascinating to learn about this German colony of people that moved from the Midwest to Washington state where they encountered many hardships.
