Not only isn't it the 'thinking man's Kramer v Kramer', it's a direct steal from that film (check out the improbable kid falling off his bike scene, not to mention the entire set-up). It tries to appropriate some of the Nick Hornby bloke-in-his-thirties feeling but comes up short because Parsons has neither the wit nor the imagination of a Hornby. The characters are sketchy - either stereotypes (the bluff old father with the heart of gold)or just not thought through (the protagonist's wife).

Nick Hornby's High Fidelity or Dave Armitage's Born to be Mild are the only ones which come near. Both of those are laugh out loud funny(partic if you like the British sense of humour). These are the guys the Brits laugh at - give them a go.

Tony Parsons' writing can be poignant at times but he seems too interested in making this a commercial success. There is much that is trite, cliched and has been done many times before. If you are rewriting a classic you need to do it with syle. Tony Parsons does not. The final scene with the girlfriend (and why he is so enamored with her is beyond my comprehension) is borrowed from The Graduate but it is unbelievable and ridiculous. There is a poignant scene with his son and his father in a hospital room that was the best thing about this book. This book annoyed the heck out of me. It is a mediocre effort at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T MISS THIS BOOK!!","review":"One of the best books I've read in the past year. Parsons does a wonderful job of blending humor and drama in this wonderful story about a single Dad in his 30s struggling to raise his son, mend his marriage and reignite his career.

The original book was touching and left me in tears. This book left me in tears because it was so cliche and so incredibly boring. It's not even well-written. This book is a combination of every possible cliche out there. I yet have to understand the kind of people who loved this book.

It looks pretty good, definitely fitting into the ultra-mini category. The sound quality is pretty good at low to medium volumes. This is not a system for someone wanting big volume. But with surround sound (which works) and X-Bass, it is more than adequate for small houses/apartments. The 2x recording is obviously one of the strongest features of this system. Probably the only features lacking are jog-dial titling and some of the connections which audiophiles would appreciate (which I am not).

I recommend it to anyone in business or the public sector who is hearing the need for greater innovation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly the authors best work","review":"I'm a fan of Gibsons, to the point that I waited to buy this novel until I found a autographed edition. It was so not worth the wait. The protaganist, Cayce, is about as interesting a 2 day old bagel after a fine french meal. If she had died in the middle of the book I probably could have cared less. The book starts off slowly with this boring person and really goes nowhere for quite a while. My impressions of the first 100 or so pages is summed up with the constant thoughts of \\" I will finish this book, I will not quit reading it\\" . The book does pick up toward the final third and becomes more interesting to finish up with a ending that makes the reader say \\" so what?\\". Really a poor effort from a talented writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read that stays with you","review":"Not really what you might think of as Sci-Fi, or even Mr. Gibson's other works, this reads more like a literary novel. The plot is well paced, not exactly a page turner but engaging and never slow. The characters are interesting and realistic. The social commentary is thought provoking. Some have said the ending is a bit abrupt and a let down, but I did not find that to be the case. What kept me reading was the characters and their experiences, not the mystery. Overall a really good read that goes into my permanent collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Disappointing","review":"This is the first of William Gibson's novels that I've read, and I must say that I'm pretty disappointed. Doubly so, because it wasn't something I just picked up off the shelf and decided to read; I had been looking forward to reading it for over a year.The plot was excruciatingly dull, and there was no realism to it at all. I am in the marketing field, and felt more embarrassed by the book than anything. I mean, how could anyone think that the focus of the book--the social implications of \\"the footage\\"--could be that valuable, cause so much of a raucous? Seriously.And the inferred underground and technology was not that appallingly futurific either. I was so looking forward to something that would blow my mind and really make me look at things from a different perspective. This was a huge let down.I have heard that William Gibson's other books are more intriguing and thought provoking though, so I might check those out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like refreshing a travel blog for the first 120 pages, then decent, then fizzels","review":"My take may not be quite the same as many other similarly starred reviews- this is my first Gibson book and as he is generally so well reviewed and clearly thinks big thoughts I might give him another try but this was a pretty lackluster plot that fizzled at the end with a bunch of amateur plot closures.For me the first 120 pages nearly did me in- I ended up skimming endless descriptions of London, apartments, markets, coffee houses, etc. The heroine was just compelling enough to stick with it until it gained some momentum with the introduction of an interesting character... only to lose it again and stumble into a rambling face plant. One particular scene involving effigies of the Michelin man had me doing double takes as the least believable, most melodramatic literary moment in recent memory.I stumbled though but largely because I was trapped in China with nothing else to read (or buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big expectations - disappointed","review":"One of the only novels I've ever stopped reading through sheer boredom (although I did pick it up again to give it a chance to redeem itself).A paradigm example of what happens when you create characters that are difficult to sympathize with - the reader just couldn't care less about what they think or what happens to them. Just about every person in this book has unlimited money, unlimited access to the most powerful people on the planet, and inevitably get called 'brilliant in their field of work'. I felt like I was reading a book about the adventures of Bill Gates, Paris Hilton, the Queen of England and the head of the CIA. No resonance with their world, their activities, or opinons.Coupled with an unbelievable and seemingly arbitrary wrap-up of all the plot's mysteries (the phrase deus ex machina comes to mind), I was left very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Not worth buying this new -- especially in hardback. This read more like a fluffy summer mystery you'd take to the beach. Very cliched. It seems to me that Cayce's rescue scene involved a tired deus ex machina ploy.

Its heroine, Cayce, is afflicted with an allergic reaction to brands, whether pushed at her from electronic advertisements or attached to her clothing. Tommy Hilfiger is close to life-threatening for her. This, of course, makes her invaluable to the advertising world because her reaction to a planned ad campaign or style is usually a clue to its probable success. Like much fiction that grows out of technology and its impact, Pattern Recognition, is difficult to bring to an end. We are left without knowing whether the film snippets are some vital message to us, or merely the beginning of a wildly successful advertising campaign.

And yes, the tragedy of 9/11 seems grafted on to this plot give it a bit of gravitas.

I picked up the read hoping for a thought provoking story with such an intriguing title. I was disappointed to find that the characters were slightly more than one dimensional. Mr. Gibson surely should not have placed a woman as his main character and wrote about her experiences and perceptions as if she were a man. I feel after 300+ pages I know less about the character than a face I see in Starbucks.I do believe that Mr. Gibson wrote this entire book simply to have his allegory of a rose petal to the 911 attacks published.This book was truly a waste of time, and I have had more enjoyable reads while waiting to have a root canal in the dentist's office."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I had read Gibson's Neuromancer several years ago and really enjoyed it.

Gibson shows such great sensitivity to contemporary cultures and technologies, and the implications for personality and human consciousness. I've spent several years in Tokyo, and quite a bit of time in London and NY, and now I want to go to Moscow, so I can verify that his picture of that city is as illuminating as of the cities I know.

For me, the author had been getting a little, if not predictable, then recycled. His take on the present is both hauntingly familiar and as exotically mysterious as any of his spec futures. As always in Gibson's work, the reader learns to inhabit the book and care about the characters through offhand remarks, snippets of e-mail, random verbal snapshots. The story is not so much narrated as evoked -- very much like the \\"footage\\" that is central to the plot. \\"Pattern Recognition\\" reveals Gibson as a maturing writer, exploring and contrasting private and cultural emotions of grief, loss and alienation in the wake of 9/11, the collapse of the Soviet State and the insidious nature of modern communication and media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, bad finish...","review":"I have been a reader of Gibson since the \\"Burning Chrome\\" collection, and I have been less and less enamoured of his work as time has passed.In spite of a great premise and some good characters, \\"Pattern Recognition\\" fail in the end, when Gibson is unable to sustain the mystery and give us a decent payoff. After all the build-up regarding the \\"footage\\", the resolution is so flat I re-read it to make sure I hadn't missed anything.

Gibson, having NO idea of what he is writing about, has failed miserably with this book.Where he struck lucky with the cyberpunk novel \\"Neuromancer\\", this book is just ridiculous. He writes about cool hunters and amazingly enough, this book seems to have no plot. Unfortunately he has tried to take the easy way out: Hiding a non-existent plot behind utterly non credible persona descriptions of the principal characters.My guess is that this book reaches audiences that think this book really is a window into \\"the real world\\" as concerned to where trends come from. Or perhaps this is just the result of efficient marketing.

While there, she is convinced to delve deeper into her \\"hobby\\" of sorts, a mysterious, online posting of short film clips of unknown origin. She is convinced to seek out the source of the clips and along the way is attacked, followed, harrassed and faces various other perils.

There were a couple of cool ideas, such as the main character's alergic reaction to branding, but the story just didn't go anywhere. There was little action, and not much real character development. A few characters where thrown in for reasons that were never made clear, I suppose they were filler. In the end, the \\"big mystery\\" isn't very mysterious at all -- this was one of the most disappointing books I've read all the way through.

The little that is there doesn't fit well logically and in the very end things are explained with information and additional characters yanked out of the blue. Very unsatisfying ending. It's like those old detective stories where in the end it turns out that the murderer was the gardener or cook who was mentioned in a half sentence in the whole book. Gibson's book feels like this, except the gardener doesn't even get a half sentence.It feels as if Gibson wanted to write a book about cool but had no ideas for a real story line. You get everything from leather jackets, to anime but not much originality and creativity.One thing the book certainly deserves: the title for the worlds longest written Apple commercial."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended","review":"A haunting look into the chaotic nature of the globalized, digitized, commercialized, present-day world, anchored in the compelling story and resilient character of \\"coolhunter\\" Cayce Pollard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow read","review":"I like books that catch your interest in the first page, and hold your attention page after page. This book didn't do that for me. It is 367 pages long. I read the first 60 pages and there was nothing happening...not a single incident where you say, \\"Ahha, this could be good!\\"The author used a very interesting style in some of his sentences that I have not seen before. They weren't complete sentences, but you could understand what he was saying. Great new idea.The main character was uninteresting, except that she had a very unusual job (she is hired by companies to spot trends for the future, to help them develop and market new products.) She could have been quite an attention-grabber, but that didn't materialize...she was just an odd person moving through an uneventful life.WIth no intrigue, no exciting events, nothing to make you say, \\"I wonder what will happen next?\\", I gave up at page 60 and threw the book away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A retro-disappointment","review":"This is the first book I read by William Gibson and I thought it was entertaining, gripping, but light. And disappointingly not science fiction in any possible use of the term. Then I read Neuromancer, which as advertised is a great creative prediction of a cyberworld that doesn't entirely hang together but is immensely enjoyable. Pattern Recognition, set beside Neuromancer, is a fine airport book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't wait to finish so that I could stop being bored.","review":"This is the first novel in a long time that made no connection with me at all. I didn't care about the characters, much less like them. I couldn't understand exactly why the characters cared about \\"the footage\\" or why they were willing to go to such extremes over it. But I kept hoping that by the end of the novel the author would put it all together and make me see why they cared so much. He didn't, and I was glad that it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a thriller","review":"Cacye has a near-supernatural sensitivity to trends - what clicks in the social mass mind, what doesn't, and what's coming next. What's coming now, though, is an incredible video, or set of videos. Brief segments appear on the net, in no visible order, but clearly related. They develop a cult following, Cayce included.Then she follows them, trying to find their enigmatic source. And someone follows her, maybe many someones, way too closely for comfort.It's a good thriller, with side trips into the strange marketplace of antique computing equipment and the cryptographic world of steganography. The technical details may be debatable with respect to real world steg, but that doesn't get in the way of a good story.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull book with dull characters","review":"I had a lot of trouble finishing this book. The characters seemed unrealistic and I never grew to care for either the characters or their situation. My reaction at the end of the novel - when the novel's main mystery was revealed - was to say, \\"so what?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Gibson's pretty much done","review":"No more plot, not much character...this is the new Gibson. He langorously winds his way through page after page of description of night clubs, new products, international manufacturing trends...and we, the reader are left standing around while he ruminates. The fresh breath of hip he injected into SF in the mid 80's is very much dated now and labored. He's been imitated so much that he now comes off as a pale imitation of himself.Idoru and All Tomorrow's Parties were much the same. Virtual Light was really his last good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pertinent Commentary","review":"I can well understand why those who cut their teeth reading Gibson's _Neuromancer_, _Count Zero_, _Mona Lisa Overdrive_, etc., would find _Pattern Recognition_ very disappointing. However, not being a die-hard sci-fi fan, and not having been familiar with Gibson before I read this book, I found his satiric commentary on today's consumerism refreshingly erudite; I liked the way he couched his terms. Now, having read the aforementioned books (and finding that after the first one, all the \\"cutting-edge\\" stuff got a bit old), I think that although they are fun, \\"visionary\\" reads, _Pattern Recognition_ holds a stronger, more important message. No, it is not \\"cutting edge\\" in terms of sci-fi, even Gibson's sci-fi, but I admire Gibson's guts to embed social commentary within this genre so accurately and well, making this book more au curant in terms of its particular techno-gyrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes me want to clean up my room","review":"A highly personal identification with the main character made me want to clean up my room and sand off the logos off some of personal clothing and accessories. An engrossing read that at points gives the impression it's going to finish a little too neatly, yet doesn't finish in quite the way I expected. Still, the sources of power discovered at the end are a little too extreme and therefore simplistic and too easy a solution for the intricacies explored earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Years later...","review":"I read this book more a little more than 2 years ago and finished it on an airplane. I was so obviously happy reading it that the person sitting next to me asked about it. I ended up giving it to him since after I described it he really wanted to read it, but have regretted ever since not having my own copy. I am not a traditional science fiction fan, but this is a book I'm still thinking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"I read 100 pages & I'm kicking myself for having wasted that much time. Characterization was never Gibson's strongest point, but these characters aren't just one-dimensional, they're NO-dimensional. The heroine is determinedly anti-fashion and is allergic to certain trademarks....believe me, you won't care. Her name is Cayce Pollard so her clothes are CPUs--Casey Pollard Units. This is what passes for wit. The book contains one of the most annoying mannerisms I've encountered in years: In the first chapter, the American heroine, waking up in London, notices that electrical outlets are different, the English drive on the other side of the road, etc., so she dubs England \\"mirror-world\\". From then on, any reference to an English object or custom is accompanied by the adjective \\"mirror-world\\". It wasn't especially clever the first time, and it is maddening after 50 repititions. Gibson needs to find some fresh ideas, his last three books have been awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Gibson?","review":"Boring. Boring characters, boring plot (if you can call it a plot). I have admired Gibson deeply over the years, and have studied his writing because he can draw a character more vividly, and in fewer words, than any author I've ever encountered in any genre. What he leaves unsaid in his novels (i.e. in his previous novels) is what makes the biggest impact of all on the reader, and that is a gift that is beyond deciphering; it can only be relished. Pattern Recognition is a total failure. But then, even great authors are allowed to fail. And Gibson remains a great author, this lemon notwithstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"pattern recognition by william gibson","review":"Book was in great condition and was shipped quickly. Got it in perfect time for class!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cool","review":"I hate to be the first less than glowing review here, but I was let down by Gibson's latest work. The social anomie and alienation here is more tangible than the text, plot or characters. With the plot moving as slow as molasses, circling around images on the internet, and halting to explore strange looking calculators, I felt this work was held together by tone alone. Granted the language is beautiful but the work tried to explore advertising and globalization (according to the bookjacket) yet I feel I've seen these dim glances before. I feel the My Year of Meats (Ruth Ozeki) much more powerfully did what Pattern Recognition thought it was trying. The book is worth reading simply because it's Gibson looking at the present."},{"rating":"2","title":"camden town is the center of the universe","review":"I've lived in camden for 45 years so i was already aware that it was quite a neat place - i've read all of Gibson's books - i rank this near the top since he has finally got on top of some of the clunkier bits of his style, but written a more plausible character than in the past (the motif/icon based \\"personas\\" in the early works smacked of comic strip, later i think he did ok (virtual light has some sort of notion of people you might meet) -the detail of camden lock and surrounds rang pretty true, though some of the routes around were not ones i would use.....style and content - neat ....now just waiting for the new neal stephonson to see where he's got to in cyberspace so far:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"patterns","review":"Pattern Recognition was not much fun to read. I found myself having to back up several times just to figure out where I was, who I was with, and what we were doing. Gibson introduced some neat ideas, like \\"coolhunting,\\" but they went mostly undeveloped. When I look back now, 15 minutes after finishing the book, I see darkness, some half-grasped plot points whirling around like street trash in the wind...and I'm a good reader. I wanted to like Cayce, but there wasn't enough of her to like, or the other characters either. The whole novel seemed to pick up and discard elements of modern life--modern wealthy life, that is--with abandon. I thought the ending was less than satisfying. Yay, happy ending. I was more relieved than anything else. Having committed my time and money to the book, I couldn't just not finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-1/2 stars - a weak pseudo-spy novel","review":"Cayce Pollard is a fashion consultant hired to find the maker of a mysterious auteur film that's slowly being leaked onto the Internet. As she bounces around the globe following clues, others are after her for various nefarious reasons.I love Gibson's first three novels, but now he's abandoned cyberpunk and moved on to... well, whatever this is. PR comes across as an imitation of a spy novel by someone who doesn't understand the genre. Yes, there are attempts to create a paranoid/who-can-you-trust vibe, but they fall flat through inept handling. The \\"twists\\" thrown in aren't so much surprises as eye-rolling contrivances. There are also huge chunks of this book where nothing happens, making it a tedious read at times. At least he's abandoned his stunted prose experiment that made All Tomorrow's Parties such a painful read.100 pages in, I debated if I wanted to follow through and finish it.

Clever and fun to read.

The problem isn't that it's a lazy device, though it is. Or that it lends itself to the kind of armchair, pedantic observation that you're supposed to grow out of after college. It's that Mr. Gibson succumbs to the tyranny he tries to observe.This is less a novel than a numbing series of lists. Where there should be plot, he gives us vaguely connected riffs about the emptiness of Tommy Hilfiger and plasma TV. But the real heartbreaker is that the man who wrote perhaps the best opening sentence of all time -- \\"The sky...was the color of a television, tuned to a dead channel\\" -- is hacking here.Pray he rediscovers his chops, because you won't recognize them in Pattern Recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"With all those 4 and 5 star reviews this is probably in the minority; but I have 1 question - what the heck is this book about?No plot.

His tech savvy style translates perfectly to our tech heavy present and without the burden of having to describe a futuristic world his prose has become punchier and more dynamic. There is very little down time or meandering (unlike some of Gibson's past work) and the story and themes really resonate with the current zeitgeist. I loved the characters too and as a result this is the first Gibson book that has genuinely made me want to read a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from Gibson.","review":"Took two attempts to make it through this one.

That's the case with this CD, which shows very well the mood of these youthful concertos (Mozart wrote them all at 19). Especially Dalibor Brazida is to be heard here as one of the good (so-called) \\"no-name\\" artists. His playing is clear, bright, with good technique, that's what Mozart requires. And I have a good recording with Brazda on the Beethoven concerto. Don't underestimate these artists. The world is so large, and there are huge talents all over the world.

Since that day, I still refer back to it again and again. The techniques and illustrations are wonderfully formatted in such a way that is easy to understand. Everything from the history of floral design up to todays job opportunities within floristry are covered. If you strive to be a knowledgable designer in all areas, this book will surely lead the way. More examples of topics covered are; wiring techniques for corsages, proper care and handling of flowers, understanding color, design principles, controlling cost, holidays, funeral arrangements, the list goes on and on. This is a must have book for any designers library. Sincerely, Julie E. Bargeron"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book for learning and teaching floral design","review":"This is an excellent book! It has great descriptions of the history, art, and mechanics of floral design. The only thing it lacks is a guide to pricing in the floral industry. This would only be needed if you want to teach it or go into business. Otherwise, it is a very good book and I highly reccommend it. I help teach the laboratory section of a floral design course at the university level, and this is the book we use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks good design, but great practical knowledge.","review":"Norah Hunter was my floral design instructor, so of course, we used her book. Coming from a strong design background, I think that the arrangements are at best mediocre and lacking creativity. Some of the design theories seem over simplified to me as well. However, although the design instruction falls short in my opinion, the practical knowledge she teaches about flower names, running a floral business, care and handling, etc. are invaluable to anyone working in the floral industry. The book also contains an excellent appendix of flower and foliage names with illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly organized","review":"The book looks great, but when you begin to study it, you realize that it is poorly constructed. For example, the study guide that accompanies the book gives the answers to every other problem, which is nice. The problem is that the answers are for the easier of the two questions (the book is constructed so that every two questions are similar). So when you are trying to teach yourself the material, you finally get the answer to the question that is given ane then you are faced with a more difficult question, for which there is no answer. Then when you look at the learning objectives, which are listed in the margin next to each question, you find that there is NOTHING in the learning objective, no sample problem, that will help you. It is frustrating to say the least... Perhaps the next edition will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book from McGraw Hill Publisher I've ever seen!","review":"McGraw Hill put a lot of efforts in order to compensate for the indigestible content, but unfortunately they could not compensate for that and their good design merely created an illusion that the book is on an acceptable level.I had this book for one of my online accounting classes and the whole class was crying from that. It felt that one author wrote the text, another one wrote the content of exercises, and third one wrote quizzes. All of them did not talk to each other during the whole process. As a result, when you read the text, you feel like you understand everything, but when you do exercises or respond to quiz questions, you can miss around 90% easily.We demanded that our university should withdraw this textbook from the program.

The Broke Diaries is right on the... um, money when it comes to being a broke college student. In order to keep her mind off her empty pockets, Angela Nissel chronicles her penniless life on the Internet. And her outrageous and hilarious anecdotes land her a book deal.

Shamelessly funny and frighteningly addictive, THE BROKE DIARIES is a humourous look into the past for post-broke university graduates, a friend who can relate for financially challenged students, and required reading for anyone in high school who plans to go to college. Diarist Angela Nissel certainly deserves all of the success that I am sure this novel will bring! The downside is that since the girl is no longer broke, readers do not have the pleasure of looking forward to a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Broke and Totally Fabulous","review":"I think that any college student or graduate that has been truly broke can relate to Angela Nissel's story. What I admired most about her is that she never let the situation get her down and stayed focused on her goal of graduating.I've read some reader reviews that wondered why she didn't work more or get an extra job in addition to her work study gig. Well they have obviously not attended an expensive private school. You need to study to graduate and she stayed focused on her goal.I remember washing clothes by hand and having just a few items in my day. I was never as broke as Angela (I lived in the dorm and had a meal plan), but had some friends who were putting themselves through school and were. Everybody knows what they can hadle to make it academically and she was willing to sacrafice. As a person with two MA's I can appreciate that!

Her \\"Broke Diary\\" chronicled her senior year of college and cost-cutting measures that she had to take to survive.

I'd suggest this to everyone out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Read","review":"A good, fun, quick read--I zipped through it on a cross-country plane flight.

She addresses a wide variety of situations broke students face (i.e., would you date a guy for a free meal? is it ok to go commando if you can't afford to do laundry? etc.) A laugh out loud adventure that makes you appreciate your own situation a little bit more. Don't listen to the haters. Read it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was better than Snoopy, Come Home!","review":"This book is funny because it is true. You read about Angela going to a check cashing place and getting picked up by a broke fool in line. She goes out with a man who raises his own prize winning chickens because she wants a free meal. It is a great book to read while you are in college or just starting off in the real world just so you know you are not alone. Revolution!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"This book is too funny!! The trials and turbulations that the author goes through as a broke college student are something that almost everyone can relate to. Some of the things are so outrageous it's almost hard to believe they really happened. But the author doesn't try and make you feel sorry for her, she basicly pokes fun at herself in a very witty and sarcastic manner that had me laughing out loud. I would HIGHLY reccomend this book to anyone who wants a good laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help a broke chick out... buy this book- win free samples!","review":"Okay, no free samples, but you could learn how to get free other free stuff... This book is a riot. Incredibly easy to read, but not simple, pandering, or dull. The passages just flow; before you know it, you've completed the entire book in one sitting. I can't imagine having had to read it on the net and actually be forced to WAIT each day for a new entry. Her style is conversational and inviting, to say the least. The best part is that she never makes you feel pity for her brokeness; this is not one of those sappy poor-is-me--search-for-the-zen message books. It is a hilarious priviledge to be let in on her life for a time- thank you, Angela! To the rest of you, go buy this book right now and stop feeling sorry for your broke selves.

But by the final third of the book, the author is into total self promotion, and it gets on ones nerves. Instead of \\"How Fiction Works\\" being the title, perhaps it should have been \\"How Fiction has Worked Very, Very Well for Me.\\" The book appears to have been dashed out to meet a contract committment without any serious thought put into it.

A group of attractive people who are killed off one by one. We've all seen it before and it can be fun escape viewing.But this movie doesn't even deliver this. They seem to be attempting a plot with the scientists at the very beginning and then the military involvement but the scenes at the beginning that are obviously meant for shock provide nothing as does everything that follows.I honestly recommend this movie to no one.

While not a huge fan of the 70s versions of the Hills Have Eyes, I loved the orginal remake in 2005. I thought it was the best horror remake I had ever seen. And after viewing this sequel I am again impressed. This movie delivers. Its gross, and it shocks. The caves and desert terrain that the hideous mutants hide out in provides a dangerously forboding atmosphere. Throw in the mix the impending threat of decapitation, rape and torture and the scare factor climbs pretty high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to go Fox","review":"just a suggestion why not release part one before its sequel thats pretty much a no brainer. besides this movie sucks the first one was great"},{"rating":"1","title":"decent gore, but bad actors.","review":"I don't know this is like watching the chainsaw massacre series. when ever there's a remake and then part 2,3,4 and lord knows how many others. they just lose that eerie thrill.It becomes repetitous you know? a group of ppl comes into an unknown area and then runs into some sick murderous creatures that kills about half of the cast and then you have to flip a coin on which person will live to the end.THATS LAME NOW, CAN THESE DIRECTORS MAKE UP SOMETHING ELSE?"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie...","review":"The movie is not good at all, It'd be a better choice to buy the wes craven's original movies than this.

Much of the material he has written forms the backbone of the Christian religions. He is an important person in Western civilization. This book by Garry Wills is supposed to tell Augustine's biography. Instead Wills spends countless pages on philosophical arguments and one does not get a good view of this man nor the times he lived in.A previous reviewer commented that one should read the writings of St. Augustine himself, rather than try to fathom what he stood for in the Wills book. I agree with this assessment.I don't really care for Wills' politics and after this book not alot for his writing. This was a difficult book for me to get through. Even though it is short, the writing style has a lot to be desired. Perhaps Wills intended this book for his students at Northwestern. A real disappointing read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I learned very little from this book.","review":"If you are trying to learn more about this famous figure in history, I do not think this book will serve your purpose. While it does contain a few facts that are worth noting, for instance, the religious differences that prevailed long before the Reformation, very little stirred my interest or imagination in this account.I cannot recommend it as a source for truly understanding this major church and world figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small book - small story","review":"As a non-Catholic I had heard St Augustine's name nevertheless on countless occasions, usually uttered with a suggestion of awe. I wanted to know more, but did not fancy a specialist's tome; yet I wished for more than an encyclopaedia entry. Unfortunately the book is not for the beginner, but supposes much prior knowledge. While the author's view that the saint was not a reprehensible debauchee who made good when his hormones had subsided with age seems somewhat unorthodox (and quite plausible) there is little to put the reader clearly in the historical or geographic or, even, political background. No index, poor bibliography, not a single map. Thus it seems too slight as an introduction to the life of the saint, and is, of course, not a definitive study. It did not inspire me to seek other studies of Augustine. If it could not inspire the author to write in a more inviting manner, perhaps the inspiring days of the saint are long past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Insightful, Interesting, Not Introductory","review":"This deceptively small book contains a wealth of information about the life and thought of one of the foundational thinkers of the Christian Church. Wills approaches Augustine in new, unexpected, informed and refreshing ways. He gives new and vivid translations to old words, new names to nameless people and misnamed books, new life to old phrases, new slants to a character and thought we presumed we were familiar with. He is especially good talking about Augustine's youth which turns out to have been not as bad as our imaginations fancied, and his doctrines not quite as dour and obsessed with sex, and his mother not quite so possessive and controlling. It is a good and insightful read especially for those who are already familiar with Augustine's milieu who have acquired enough of a false impression to appreciate being disabused. Anyone looking for an \\"introductory\\" work may well bog down here and there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A balanced view of Augustine's gifts and weaknesses","review":"Wills's book offers balanced and judicious insight into Augustine's gifts to western thought and civilization as well as to his mistakes. One gains a new respect for the man's contributions as well as for his weaknesses as a human being. The book is clearly organized, eloquently written, and rich in references to sources ancient and modern. Augustine's understanding of God's actions in creation and of the nature of the human will in reference to time and memory is clearly distinguished from his Neoplatonic disintegration of human sexuality from the wholeness of human identity and experience. The author makes clear that Augustine's contemporaries and later major theologicans, as well as likely our own generation, have often made hash of his insights and misapplied them to the human condition and our understanding of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AN INTRODUCTION","review":"Wills' essay on Augustine was written for a series of new introductions for use by students and the public. But unlike Peter Brown's superb biography, now stronger than ever after its revised 2000 edition, Wills does a very poor job introducing big chunks of Augustine's life and background. If you don't know about Donatism and Pelagianism, or have never heard of Julian of Eclanum, Wills won't help you. His selection of themes and angles is almost eccentric and he skates over way too much. This is an essay for the specialist who knows the background and wants another pungent point of view. It is not a beginner's survey. If Augustine interests you, try Henry Chadwick's short, superb \\"Augustine\\" from Oxford, or dive into the warm, deep waters of Peter Brown's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing performance increase!!","review":"I just installed the TB Spacer on my 05 Ram 1500 Quad cab 4.7.

From the first paragraph I was hooked, and chuckling all the way. I love Ms Carlyle's turn of phase and her use of humor, as she told the story of Helene and Cam. Two very contrasting individual's that are the perfect foils for each other. I am still chuckling about the way that Helene with no effort or even knowledge had Cam turned inside out and not knowing which way was up. He meant to do one thing, but just being in her presence found him doing the opposite I loved it. But more than that the book plot had substance and lead you down a merry path right into the mouth of danger. A tender story of first love's second chance, doing the right things even when they are the hard things and taking the risk for happiness. This book has something for everyone. Hats off to a great storyteller, and please keep them coming."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only got halfway through","review":"I am sure this book gets more interesting in the second half, but I didn't get that far. I got tired of these characters, and the lack of plot. It went like this: Governess arives. Employer recognizes her from a tryst they had as teenagers. They both regret their past. She wanders around in the garden. She visits a church. She plays backgammon with a brother. They remember the past. They worry about a child. They meet in the library. They talk, but not really. They are repressed and depressed. Nothing happens.Sorry, I can only take so much of this. I'm going to go read some Amanda Quick -- at least her books are entertaining.

The story fills in some great details on Dick's transition from \\"Boy Wonder\\" to \\"Man Wonder\\".Every character has their own voice and familiar characterization. Dick is brave and resourceful, Alfred is caring, Batman is callous and Jason Todd is a brat. The linear nature of the story is wonderful, not wasting time in re-caps and histories, but going forward with a great adventure.The only drawback is the blocky, cartoony nature of the artwork, but the story is so well-written you hardly notice it.What are you waiting for, buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Things we learn in this story:Dick Grayson is an unfaithful mess, who would cheat on the woman he would later attempt to marry with Barbara Gordon if Babs didn't have the morals that she did.Dick Grayson is a pathetic mess who bullies children.Dick Grayson is a sad creature who doesn't know what to do without Batman dictating his life.This is pretty awful. Chuck Dixon is the worst thing that has ever happened to the character of Nightwing, as he took someone who was pretty awesome and made him a spineless jerk.

If so, I think I will skip the other Heroes Reborn books (all of which failed after an initial surge in sales). The artwork is not Jim Lee's best (sorely missing the inking of X-Men collaborator Art Thibert) and the writing is astonishingly bad.Marvel followed up on the concept of updating their classic characters with the highly successful (and fanboy approved) Ultimate universe a few years later.

Were they dead?","review":"The Fantastic Four will NEVER die. They will stand united and fight for justice until all the members die in unison. This relaunch of the Fantastic Four by Jim Lee is visually stunning. Perhaps the best of the Heros Reborn group. However, is it necessary? I think not. I give two stars for the art, ZERO stars for the story or originality. I'd recommend The Essential Fantastic Four for the best FF stories. I'd recommend waiting for the Carlos Pancheo and Jeph Loeb series which would surely be bound together in Trade paperback form in the near future. I'd recommend many individual issues of the FF, but this series is so unnecessary that I was completely regretful of my purchase. If you like Jim Lee's art, buy it. If you like FF as a group, don't. If you like to collect trade paperbacks, get it. If you like to collect great stories in one volume, don't get this.

Its great to see these Great episodes uncut for the firs time in years. I have watched the series constantly in reruns and I don't even remember some of these scenes I am seeing. I can't wait for season two.

The DVD represents a chance to see the shows with improved picture and sound quality. But as was already mentioned by reviewers the menu interface is inconvienent and clunky. Also (this may just be an issue with my DVD player) the subtitles seem to use the wrong tracks. When set on 'no subtitles' I get the subtitles in French. When set on 'french subtitles' I get no subtitles except for whenever printing appears on screen (usually on a sign in the show), at which point a french subtitle appears telling what the sign says.

Definitely worth the cost of the DVD. I intend to collect the whole series."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS edition has extremely poor picture quality","review":"As delighted as I am to finally get the whole season one of MASH on video, I am very disappointed by the poor quality. The VHS tapes are recorded in EP mode, and somehow I could adjust my VCR's tracking only to either get a distorted picture and good sound, or acceptable picture quality and distorted sound.Also, the episodes are arranged in production order rather than broadcast order. This makes more sense as far as some of the story lines are concerned, but the VHS boxes list the episodes in broadcast order, and therefore are useless.MASH is a great series, and it was great to see these episodes again, but the viewing pleasure was spoilt a lot by the extremely poor quality of the VHS edition. If you own a DVD player that plays region 1 tapes (mine only plays region 2), go for the DVD edition, by all means."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it simply to see the uncut episodes","review":"I've watched the first eight episodes thus far, and I can recommend this wholeheartedly for the casual fan up through the serious fan.It is truly amazing how much is cut from these episodes when they are broadcast in syndication -- I can honestly say that while I've seen all of the episodes from the eleven years of the series that I have definitely not seen all of the scenes.Each episode runs about 25 minutes, so about 3 minutes are chopped from each episode when you watch in syndication.Also, I really enjoy watching these episodes without the laugh track. I've found it much easier to appreciate the inflection in the actors' voices and the jokes are even funnier when you don't feel like you are being \\"forced\\" to laugh.Run out and buy it. I can't wait for the other ten seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"M*A*S*H is awsome!","review":"I am almost pleased with this DVD of season one. While the show rocks and clears up some missing information for me, I had never before now seen the season one episodes, I am however, disappointed in the start and delay aspect of each DVD. It takes this DVD a really long time to load, then you must go back through the process with each episode on each disk. This is a real drag! I am used to selecting \\"play all\\" and in fact the shows will keep going or at that the least take you to the title of the next show so that you can click \\"play\\" agian. Here there is a long pause after each episode, then you must return to the main menu and start again with your next episode, I real pain in my opinion! But over all I love the DVD, picture and sould to me were as they should be, no complaints there! I will definately be looking forward to viewing season two!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare opportunity","review":"I've always wanted to see this show and finally the opportunity has come thanks to these wonderful DVDs.

One minute, you're laughing, the next you're reminded that these people are in the midst of a horrible situation. My favorite episode of this set is when they steal the commanding officer's desk (don't think that would go over well in the Army!).Kudos to all involved. I just wish the opportunity to see this great show wasn't limited to people with DVD players or those with the inclination to purchase these DVDs.

I remember when I first watched it with my dad back in the late eighties and hating it. Now I love it because the humor is something I can finally appreciate!The series does start to stink as it ages, much like Frasier. There is something about the way the jokes are delivered by certain characters, which show that the creative team has changed a bit since the beginning.However this first season will be thoroughly enjoyed by me.Some of my favorite other shows: Frasier (first six seasons), I Dream of Jeannie, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Airwolf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Not Chopped For TV Versions","review":"When MASH is on, I HATE it.

This is where it all started, the episodes get better & better, no other show could take you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions like MASH.

I can honestly say the last two years, the charactors (and actors) did show some wear, but nonetheless, I still drew some enjoyment. FOX really did a good job with this release, but one drawback is FOX should've included more extras (like background information on the series itself and comentary from budding actors appearing on the show0 Young actors appeared on this show including Ron Howard and John Ritter.

Just thinking of the show makes you smile. It's perfect humor, always with a message and always saying that war is hell. For example Klinger, who wore dresses and ate jeeps just to get out of the war. That makes for great humor, and if you look deeper you can often see a serious part of the show.MASH is definitly something special, and you can watch almost every episode over and over again without being bored. And the price for it is great! Let's just hope the other seasons are going to be released too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be better","review":"I've been a M*A*S*H fan for years, and I couldn't be happier with this set. To me it has everything that I would want. Excellent quality, the complete first season in broadcast order with the restored scenes that were removed when it went into syndication, and the fine writing and acting that were the hallmark of the series. And most importantly, it gives the viewer the ability to turn the laugh track off so that we can watch the episodes how the producers originally intended, before the CBS executives insisted that the laugh track be added. The only thing I would hope that they would change in future compilations would be the ability to play all the episodes on a disk with one press of the button instead of having to go in and restart the next episode when the one you are watching ends. Otherwise, this is a perfect package. Who needs extras?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best series...","review":"M*A*S*H has to be one of the best series in television history. This collection of 3 discs contains the entire first season uncut. It is interesting to see how quickly the main characters' personalities are developed. While some of the plots are farfetched (even the actors complained during the filming of the episode in which Hawkeye & Trapper convince Frank that there is gold in the surronding countryside about the absurdity), each one is funny & poignant in its own way.The only complaint I have is that there is not a \\"play all episodes\\" option; rather, you must play each episode individually. Hopefully, the season two set coming out in May 2002 will have that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"But What About The VHS Version?????","review":"OK, we've had many favorable reviews about the new \\"MASH\\" set...but they've ALL been about the DVD version.

Worse yet, this is stated NOWHERE on the external set box...Just on the back of each individual inside sleeve.What a supreme disappointment to find these great shows recorded at fuzzy EP speed....I would rather have paid more for a set of SIX tapes recorded at Standard Play speed.This just is NOT fair to MASH fans and video collectors!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy about the price jump","review":"Amazon had this series at 20 busck per season and I started buying them but jacked them up to 30 so I stoped"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it!!","review":"It took a long time to receive this item and when I finally did the set contained 1 tape of Volume One and 2 tapes of Volume Two in 2 Volume One covers and 1 Volume Two cover.

The kid Loudan really wanted something and wasn't going to let anyone or anything step in his way. He put so much time and effort into it and that's what it really takes to succeed at your future goals in life. You have to make big sacrifices and take great risks to accomplish something like that. It sets a great example for anyone who wants to succeed but is hesitant about it.

I thought the movie was better than the book, because the book gets into more details when it's really not necessary. I personally thought the book was ok, but the movie was better than the book, I recommend the movie to other people who are into wrestling , because it shows how Louden searches for his personal strength and understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh","review":"The only reason I picked up this book and read some of it was because it was a class assignment.

I never thought a book could be bad, I guess I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect ending to a durned good read","review":"This is one of the most real-world inspiring and beautifully understated pieces of fiction that I have read. The protagonist, Louden Swain, is a 17-and 18-year-old who is doing his very best to become the best (the most alive, capable) person he can figure out how to become. It's durned good to see such a life as Louden's promoted in a fine piece of writing instead of the maladjusts we often find in contemporary, \\"cool\\" literature. Although Vision Quest is listed as a young adult title, the writing transcends that genre. This is not so much a book for adolescent readers (although they'll likely enjoy it) as it is a fun read for adults who powerfully connect with good novels. The ending: it's downright perfect. The wrestling match between Louden and his opponent is not the point of the story. The journey of becoming is what matters here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vision Quest : Louden seeks his place in the circle of life","review":"Louden Swain is a wrestler's wrestlerbut he has a problem in form of a up and comingmatch with the state champ ,Shoot, a real teratoid!Oh and by the way... he has to diet down to 147 lb.to wrestle shoot.

No blender needed - just use a shaker cup with one of them wire balls in it and this one is perfectly smooth and drinks easier than any of the others.The only down side i can see is if you don't want any sucralose (splenda) or acesulfame potassium (Ace K) for artificial sweeteners....then you might want to stick with the ON Natural 100% Whey that uses a little Stevia - the all natural sugar free sweetener....ON also makes this Pro Complex in the \\"natural\\" branding with Stevia but we have not tried it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good....but it tasts little different","review":"I usually buy from Vitamin Shoppe.

I was expecting to see more Demon and Angel stuff, but it's only got one story of this kind, and a couple fairy-tale like and sci-fi stories. This book lacks creativity because there's not a lot of story telling involved, although the author can sure think of a lot of different ways to fornicate. If you are looking for good stories this book is not for you, and if you are more interested in the graphic aspect of it, you might as well pass on this one. The art is very simple and most of the characters are lifeless and lack any charisma.

DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE COVER-I don't know what photos they pirated to put a handsome Kilmer on the jacket-but if you look on the back, you will see how he actually appears in the movie. I wonder if Val and Cuba sued their agents for letting them get cast in such a mediocre film or if they owed somebody a favor and this was payback. Either way-I rarely get rid of a movie, even if I only paid $4 for it, but this one is going to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"And they all lived happily everafter","review":"Great characters.

I rushed out and bought it. I wish I had read the valuable reviews here first, I was very disappointed. This game, if you can call it that, is just taking advantage of the success of its predocessor, Metal Gear Solid. I did not have fun with it and it was not challenging. The operation of weapons are limited and do not allow for traditional aiming as in Metal Gear, rather a laser scope dresses it up a bit, but does not give you freedom to be efficient in tactics or battle. I would rather see Konami do something original rather than produce reconstituted practice missions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Metal Gear Solid, (the first one) is a really really good game. If you enjoy action/sniper games, its definatley for you. However, VR Missons is an attempted continuation of the story. The game isn't really a game though. VR Missions is nothing but a training game for the same price as the real game. I wouldn't waste any more money on this if my life depended on it. Be my guest and try it out if you want, but I would definatley rent it before you order it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"It's a good game but it doesn't compare to the action of the original Metal Gear Solid, this one focuses on trainig."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Follow up to Original.","review":"Over 300 VR missions just waiting to be played. Some can be played by the Ninja, but there are only three (which are pretty short and easy). The game is divided into 4 sections: Sneaking, Weapons, Advanced and Special.

I had already owned EA's Nhl 2000 for a few months and I was having doubts whether Fox could measure up. Thats until I got it home and put it on my computer. I found it to have more realistic scoring, more practical player customization, and a cool rivalry mode. As gameplay goes it more than matches EA Nhl 2000 by making it harder to make the great plays. I was never finding myself saying \\"Boy I made that look easy!\\" The game didn't allow for beginners luck so I had to learn how beat other teams.

I thought the heat was too high, but even on low settings this happened and the clothes were left all wrinkled. After attempting to iron w/this iron, I had to re-wash many pieces of clothing - due to the marks it left.

This totally rates an -F"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for leaks","review":"Someone else mentioned that this iron tends to leak water, and it does, but I've only had it happen when I overfill the (very small) water reservoir. Usually happens when I first turn it on and it's sitting in the upright position; once it heats up it seems to be fine.Other than that, works fine. I wish it had some steam holes towards the tip of the ironing plate, but I guess that's something reserved for the higher-end units.----------------------UPDATE - 7/2010: I bought this iron in 2007 and recently it started leaking more, and now it has stopped working altogether. The lights come on, but the plate never heats up. You can't even take it apart to check for a blown fuse or something because there are security screws on the bottom. I no longer recommend this product at all.----------------------"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a what it is, $25","review":"I purchased the iron almost two years ago. I still have it. It worked great in the very beginning, but it did begin to leak and spit water out while ironing. As the other reviewer noted, it does leave marks on clothes, but I cannot say it is the worst iron ever. If there is water in the tank while the iron is on, in the upright position, it will undoubtedly leak all over whatever you are ironing.To make it work best, I can only fill the tank with very little water, just enough to get by one shirt at a time. Yes, you have to be ready with small water bottle with a good spout to keep refilling this tank in small increments. The only reason to keep this iron is it does produce steam when it is not leaking or spitting. Needless to say, I am in the market for a new iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic DMW-LND52","review":"This is a really nice filter, I have no vignetting, does not create color aberration or alter the color of the picture.

Merry","review":"I bought the book because I wanted to splice high-tech yacht rope, especially the 12-strand braids like Amsteel. This review pertains only to splices related to such rope.The photos are not always of the splice being described (p.84). The illustrations appear to have been cropped to fit the page, which is especially confusing for complex splices (p.88). The hollow braid splice on p.83 results in a weak splice with a bump at a vulnerable location - I believe this is a dangerous splice and that the authors have failed to grasp the workings of the Chinese Finger Puzzle principle mentioned in several places.Conclusion: don't waste your money. Go to the web sites for Yale, Sampson, and New England Rope to get better illustrations and text for free. Also, study the test results from Layline.com on the importance of tapering the buried eye splice tail."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"This is a good and inexpensive book. You'll find a lot of information about splicing, perhaps more than you will ever need.The problem with a book is that you have to understand how the strands -- and which strands -- lie up next to each other. It's not that easy to figure out the first time around. I learned how by watching my Dad. That gave me an idea how splices are made.Consider Amazon's software on splicing; ISBN 0970971419 if you just want to learn common splices. It's a software program for beginners to do the basic splices in front of a computer. It's more expensive, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splicing lite","review":"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!

It is rock steady with both height and width being INDEPENDENTLY adjustable. With \\"X\\" stands, as you raise the height you are also narrowing the distance between the two bottom feet. This causes \\"X\\" stands to become more unstable as you raise the keyboard height, exactly the opposite of what you want. \\"X\\" stands are also inherently more unstable and more prone to tipping over if you (or someone else) bumps the keyboard. This \\"Z\\" stand does not cost much more money than a heavy-duty \\"X\\" stand but is a much better product. A second tier can hold another keyboard with the KSA7550 adapter.

His four daughters are who the story centers around. Susannah is the key person who shows southern hospitality and sweet innocence in the matter of the heart. The scene is ripe for her to be swept off her feet by a young dashing--reprobate. Robards spins her yarn telling how these two opposites' paths cross and love blossoms.

I have never heard a Joni Mitchell cover taken so gently in one's hands, yet experienced so fully. Her voice was made for songs such as these.And I can not serve Love is Everything properly, you simply must hear it's melancholic words and her treatment to know what that heartbreak feels like.This album touches me in ways, subtle, longing, and sweet that few albums have.

I'm a huge Neil Young fan, but I think it's a mistake for anybody but him to sing his stuff. His songs are personal in a way that doesn't translate well. As for the Leonard Cohen covers--is the world not a depressing enough place without more Leonard Cohen? And why re-record \\"Simple\\", the weakest track on Invincible Summer?

She uses far too much effort in making them \\"sacred\\".Part of their value is that the originals took creative chances.

An interesting side note: When Johnny Carson died, lang made a special appearance on the Tonight Show at Jay Leno's request. Apparently she was Carson's favorite.

However, I have been extremly let down with XXX and this release. I'm a guitar player myself and I learned most of what I know about great guitar tone by Billy. I have not heard what I would deem as really great guitar tones from Billy in many years. BILLY-PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR OLD GREAT TONE. ANY TONE FROM 1ST THROUGH FANDAGO WILL WORK. PLEASE THROW THE FUZZ TONES AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry. Over-fuzzed.","review":"I'm a ZZ fan since 1974. I have most all their albums. They just keep getting better over the years. In my opinion, XXX was their last great achievement. They started using fuzz box on Antenna and it was great. They had the sound perfect on those albums. Then they put out Mescalero and over did the fuzz sound to the point it where it sounds way too distorted. Billy's leads are adversely affected. ZZ needs to go back a notch to the XXX sound where they had it just right. Example: Sin Pusher -Outstanding fuzz. I don't care for this album except for songs Buck Nekkid and What It Is Kid, which are cool but again, could have sounded better. Same thing happened to Neil Young's great songs when he started using so much feedback it became ridiculous. Come on guys, get your sound straight again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun at times but weak overall","review":"I recently got Mescalero and what a weird and mostly disappointing album. Too many odd noises and particularly inane lyrics, that sound like written by a mutthead. Even though they have never been ZZ Top's strongest point (Actually the opposite) I was expecting a little more.At least you may find some amusing stuff - being Spanish I always like to see or hear words in my mother language in an otherwise English context. Qué lástima is fun though the song is lazy. Billy Gibbons doesn't sound too bad in Spanish. Him singing in my mother language reminds us that the band has always had sense of humour though I don't always agree with their dirty jokes. They get tiresome pretty soon.2/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"if youre thinking about buying this...","review":"my advice is don't. go find a good Lightnin' Hopkins, Elmore James or Junior Wells cd. i have Rio Grande Mud, Deguello, and Afterburner, been a fan since late 60s/early 70s (bought their 45 of Salt Lick on Scat records) around Houston area, but this is not what i consider up to their potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a few good songs, the rest is crap","review":"I am a very big fan of ZZ top and, believe me, Most songs on this record are quite shallow and uninspired. Terrible singing in spanish also. You only 5 or six few decent level songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had my hopes but...","review":"I had high hopes that this album would be something great. Sadly there is only one really good tune \\"What Would You Do\\", its the kind you would want to listen to again and again. The rest... geeeze, makes me wonder,what happened to this band?While trying to get through the rest of the album, I thought, 'who is giving them advise? Are there people around them telling them this stuff is good?'So much of this album seemed a painfully feeble attempt to stay cutting edge and ended up sounding really bad.ZZ Top IMHO should go back to being what they used to be 'that little ole' band from Texas', putting its signature style to the traditional sounds of its roots and stop trying so hard to be hip. I still think Billy Gibbons is one of the greatest guitar pickers ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going where no man has gone before","review":"This album has a groove from beginning to end. Its the best and most complete album they have released in a long time. Billy Gibbons is constantly trying to grow as a player and his sound on this album is really unique. The lyrics are fun and the songs really groove its just a good time to be had by all. ZZ top blends some different styles of music together but it all works well together. It has 16 cuts and there all good. New territory is covered here and it sounds like they had fun making this record cause it seems to come threw in the songs. Buy it try it and you will not be able to take it out of the CD player it gets better with each spin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Suprise","review":"The ZZ Top grunge album, of all things, and it's fantastic. Overall, I find this to be one of the most appealing albums the band ever made. Saturated guitar tones, royally overdriven bass, superb drum sounds - \\"Mescalero\\" is a bigtime treat to hear. The songs are very groovy, very fun, and very, very distorted. This album is awesome, and kind of f**ked up, actually. Texas has had its share of ever-unique musicians, and here's another fine example that proves you never know what they'll do next. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album Rocks","review":"Great album buy some of the best talent's in Rock they never seem to disapoint me I like every song but I wish they had a english verson of QUE LASTIMA as a hidding track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Good Sound Changes","review":"ZZ Top has been a vital part of the blues/rock n roll music scene since the early 1970's. Most of their past efforts are rooted in simple three chord rock.On Mescalero, ZZ Top varies the formula just a little to make a positive impression. Songs like What Would You Do and Me So Stupid are actually well definied pop tunes. This is something that ZZ Top has not explored as well since their fabulous Eliminator record. Also, tunes like Crunchy and Punk Ass Boyfriend offer some hip hop flavors while retaining their rock n roll/blues roots.Other highlights include the latin flavored Que Lastima, the calypso touches on the title track, and the super hidden track cover of As Time Goes By. These little extra touches work well to my ears as ZZ Top did not eliminate their old sound. They enhanced it and quite well and a 3 1/2-4 star rating is a big improvement over some of the two stars that they had put out before this release. Nice work guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"These boys keep on getting more creative!","review":"As a fan from the first album, this \\"Little Ole Band from Texas\\" still keeps you guessing! Instead of plodding along in the same old groove like other bands, every album brings a new flavor to their sound. As always, there is great humor here, but the boys, and especially Frank on the drums, really shine on this release. Packed to the gills with a wide range of style and sound, I can't get enough of this disk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed After All These Years!","review":"Been a ZZ Top fan from their entry onto the scene (long time ago); have always eagerly awaited the new releases...but I wish I hadn't spent my money on this.

Sorta like Black Sabbath visits Lajitas. Predictably, \\"Mescalero\\" continues ZZ Top's slide away from that sound and back into \\"Antenna\\" territory. But this album\\"s just plain silly. With comic art work and mostly goofy uninspired songs, this time they've really got nothin' to say. Maybe they're not trying or maybe they just don't care as long as the bucks keep flowing on \\"greatest hits\\" concerts.(Ain't goin' to THOSE anymore).One thing's for sure- some of these songs are embarrassingly immoral.

In addition, Delorko has a very fluid, spontaneously ever-changing approach to dynamics and tempos as well.In this recording you will hear Delorko's voice, although it will sometimes have a Gershwin accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"An underrated album","review":"Don't be fooled by the stupid cover.

Although their music is difficult to categorize, I can assure you that their sound is strangely uplifting and stealthily addictive. What sort of sound has this Danish combo wrought? Well, some may call it art-rock, others may call it alt-prog, and still others may just call it alternative rock. Whatever you call it, it is definitely both fresh and refreshing. The best way to put it if you are new to Mew is that if you like Arcade Fire, you will almost surely like these guys.Nearly an hour of delightful music makes that hour pass quickly indeed. I deduct one star because there are no real highlights, I can't even pick any favorite songs!

I found it very moving and in some cases disturbing. Before reading her diary ( My grandpap has one of the first copies of it) I could have cared less about the civil war or any war for that matter, but after reading it I gained a new found respect for everything that people in those days had to go through and I think that my grandmother gave people of today a great idea of what the war was like and how people were.

When Billie Whitelaw sings \\"Evilmanya\\" my ear drumbs start pounding in pain. Who would idiot enough to lend their voice to a movie only to make it sound awful. Another not too bright person, in my opinion, is the reviewer who gave this actrocious piece of crap 5 stars!!! Also, my actual rating is -100.

We could barely pry it away from his grasp, so we just had to buy it.He's now 14 months and still absolutely loves to play with it. He thinks the music is just great. It also has three different volume levels- which is nice from my perspective.The top of the barn comes just below his waist, so he do some building with the blocks even from a standing position.He also has the fire truck, the boat and the Mega Truck. This seems to be the easiest and most fun to build on to. He also likes the see-saw in the front of the barn that he can put a couple of animals, or the farmer, on.If there was one negative thing about this toy, I'd say that it's the doors of the barn loft. They come off very easily and are difficult for him to open when they are closed.Other than that, it's been great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cant and rhetoric","review":"This is a couple of articles padded out into a book. The potted histories of the USSR, Poland etc. are completely superfluous. The only original work is in the last 3 chapters. Even there, however, there are lots of problems, including more secondhand histories for no reason. Social Democracy is dismissed in a few pages as \\"in crisis.\\" This allows him to make the case for revolution instead of reform. When we finally get to the argument, he makes no attempt to respond seriously to potential objections.

BAD DEAL Lenmar.\\" I'm giving 5 stars for the seller who has no control over the product, but LENMAR should only get 1 star for poor quality control. The battery does hold a charge, but again you have to cram filler into the battery compartment to hold the battery against the battery terminals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live and alive performances","review":"This CD has been around a long time and these performances have been available on a number of labels. Both performances were recorded at live concerts and the performances are passionate and quite riveting. The Violin Concerto is taken at a very quick pace. It is about 5 minutes faster than most recordings. Unlike many contemporary performances, the music does not get bogged down. The Piano Concerto is also exceptional. However, there are many great 2nd Piano Concerto recordings, even at this low price. For 4 dollars, you cannot go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valor is ok again in this album","review":"This album was just another Valor's average work Songs like \\"Damn you\\" recycled lyrics in part from another song which made them sound absolutely stupid. *BUT*, this time there were exceptions! I'm not a Valor fan. Half the time when I pick out Christian Death CDs, I take a 50 - 50 chance that it's Rozz. But I do like the songs \\"This is Heresy\\" and \\"Serpent's Tail\\". Both of them had that, one of those songs that gets your adrenaline pumping for no reason at all, qualities. Songs that do that, even if only two of them, deserve ALOT of credit. They hard extremely hard to come by. They make this cd worth the buy. I'm probably exaggerating greatly, but it's just another way of saying, those are two good songs.."},{"rating":"1","title":"HA HA HA","review":"This is a terrible album.

When I first heard of it, I thought it was great that everyone's favorite dysfunctional family were coming to PCs everywhere, however when I purchased the finished product, I was disenchanted.The game, which should appeal more to children between the ages of 6-14, allows the user to create cartoon scenarios using various characters, settings, and props. Allowing the user to create their very own episode might sound like a great idea, however, it is not. The instructions weren't too helpful, and about the only cool thing about this product is the packaging.In other words, if you are a die-hard Simpsons fan, and must have everything with their likeness on it, then purchase this CD-ROM.

It really is the worst Christian Death album, and I say that in all sincerity, as an adrent fan and a long time collector of their discography. Fans of Rozz Williams will probably know to avoid this, and fans of Valor will only be disappointed. The corresponding darker and more aggressive release, \\"All The Hate,\\" is a bit of an improvement, but has only a few standout tracks.

I can't believe my professor in college assigned us this book knowing how bad it was. Maybe there wasn't anything else available at the time...(1996). I seriously doubt this. The publisher's did a mickey mouse job putting it together, from the binding to the orientation of the pages. Typos are everywhere and formulas are wrong. Nothing looks right and neither do the concepts. The book looks like it was made in someone's garage. This book wins the prize for worst book of the millenium in my view.

I've seen it pass through a variety of CD incarnations over the years--- and now, on the Point label, it's still one of classical music's best kept secrets. And how authentic can you get, to boot? Nanut, a fine Mahlerian in every sense of the word, and in every aspect, is here conducting the very same orchestra Mahler ruled over years ago. Listen, for example, to the hushed, growing drama of the Langsam Schleppend; Nanut's vision never exceeds his grasp, especially in a movement that, under improper direction, could go wildly astray. As well, the 3rd Movement \\"Feierlich\\" is wonderfully paced, never metronomic; it has breadth, with just enough sardonic wit, and a glorious, glowing trio section. The recording is warm, but detailed, with particularly fine string sections--- both left and right.[Running time: 51:26]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last time I will purchase a MegaBloks set","review":"I purchased this for my 6 year old son who is a wiz at legos.

Well it was so frustrating he has not played with them since.

It gives an excellent synopsis on all different aspects of infertility and is extremely thorough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical","review":"The suggestions in this book are completely impractical. For instance, it recommends that everyone have their hair tested for vitamin deficiencies before trying to conceive, but then states that there is a lot of controversy over whether hair testing is accurate. So unless you want to only drink water out of glass bottles, give up swimming so that the uterus doesn't get cold, only drink dandelion coffee, and give up sex for a month to get to know your body, I do not recommend this book.More than half of the book is on infertility treatments, so I would not recommend this book for anyone who hasn't already tried conceiving naturally and had issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, thorough fertility overview","review":"I found this book to be informative, educational, and visual enough to be interesting to my husband.

It was an easy and obvious read. It may be a good book for teenagers or women who have a history of making very bad relationship decisions, but for anyone with any common sense it does not provide much insight. Most of us know to not date liars, alchoholics, abusers, etc...If you know someone (or are someone) who needs to be told fundamental common sense things, then this book is for you. If you are someone who can occasionally make a not-so-smart decsion, but have the ability to realize it, then I would not recommend this book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a Reality Check","review":"I have this book and LOVE it. It's not the most complex of books you will ever read, and it certainly doesn't delve deep into the psyche of the female mind...but it does provide you with some sound advice for those times when we excuse or overlook certain traits that, if our friends were involved with men who were exhibiting the same traits we'd be all over them with advice.This isn't a 'self-help' book, but does provide you with the necessary grounding you can get when you are a smart woman trying to make a go of it in our stubbornly coupled society. We can often overlook what our smart selves would see as a blatant flaw. 'Smart Women..' just reminds us that the behaviors we might be so easy to excuse at the expense of a boyfriend really are pretty awful or could signal something more.I recommend this book for young women or single woman who struggles occasionally with the topsy-turvy world of dating."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you want to move on","review":"this book is published in 2000 as I see. it kind of reminds me the book he's just not that into you, though it is not that brute. it mentions examples of women who end up in relationships that do not work. Using these women the reader can see their ironic situation. What i mean is that, the women are in a bad situation and they can't move on. Most women suffer from this syndrome of not getting out of relationship. So the point of this book is that when you are suffering in a relationship move on, get over him.The reason for not giving it five stars is that there is another whole issue missing and i bet the author must have written it in another book. The reason why relationships don't work does not rely only on men who are afraid to commit but also on clingy women. Of course the author recognizes the behavior of these women but does not give clear suggestions on how these women could change. I am not sure if this issue is addressed in another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied","review":"I never received this product. Very disappointed!

One of my favorite hobbies is roller coaster riding, and the book was about roller coasters so I knew i would like the book. This is a great brain buster book. It was a great mystery.My favorite part of this book was when the Jumper first opened. The Jumper is a roller coaster that jumps over the other cart half way through the ride.

The iron works ok, but the steamer does not work at all.

However the steamer doesn't work properly. It does put out steam but it spits out more water than anything else.

Cameron is not a bad guy, just not conflicted enough in his feelings for Merlyn (love that name, by the way!) to create much emotional or sexual tension. An unhappy ending is never even a remote possiblity for these two, so the reader has to wade through a lot of filler before they finally get around to admitting they've been crazy about each other from the start. Merlyn is a delight, however, and anyone who is a fan of Jane Eyre will love how she slips into character in her frequent teasing of Cam.

I got it when I was beginning to study, and I still use it. It doesn't matter that it doesn't contain the kanji or kana for examples because it is purely grammatical structures for the English speaking learner, not a primer on Japanese writing. I think anyone who says it's flawed for that reason doesn't understand the books purpose. It's very compact, easy to find things as a reference, and covers a LOT of information in such a small book. I can always open up this book and find something new to learn.

My key problem with the book is that it does not use any hiragana. Everything is romanji. I don't really have a problem with romanji in a dictionary, but in a grammar the examples should definitely include the Japanese scripts.

Yes, if you are suddenly faced with having to do business with people from other nations. I cannot praise highly enough how this book, in both its current and previous editions, enabled me to come to terms with the challenges of working across cultural divides. It has come to my rescue on no end of occasions, helping me adapt my expectations and be open to differences.

If nothing else, it'll remind you that for them, you're the foreign person. Also good to remember that even if you yourself immigrated, your cultural outlook is likely still from your country of birth, especially if you lived there through adulthood and first job.The first half of the book covers different concepts (e.g. time, communication, life outlook) for a variety of countries. The second half is an encyclopedia of short chapters on different specific countries.While being expert at working in another culture comes only with time, it's certainly worth reading parts of this book (the general chapters plus a specific country's chapter) before your first working meeting on a multi-cultural project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Ink Cartridge","review":"Only the magneta ink would print.I placed the cartridge in warm/hot water, let it dry for thirty minutes and was able to print one card I designed, in which all three colors printed.The next day I attempted to print a birthday card and only the magneta printed. I again placed the cartridge in warm/hot (microwaved filterd water for 1 minute) and only the pink and blue colors printed.This is the frist time I've had any problems with a remanfactured cartridge.I believe it is the company's method of refilling and packaging that is the problem. Other cartridges had tape over the copper part that had to be peeled off. This one had a plastic cover. Not effectively sealed seems to be one reason the cartridge was partially dried out.The other reason to consider is the age of the refilled cartridge.I would not purchase from this company again.

There is a cute little crocodile named croc who runs around squishing enemies and freeing his friends, the gobbos. Although people say the graphics are bad, they are actually quite good, it all depends on the computer. On my computer from 95, the graphics were indeed pretty bad. However, when I tried it on my new Gateway computer, the speed and graphics were excellent! Furthermore, the game is quite challenging. For example, in each level Croc is supposed to rescue 6 gobbos. In order to get the 6th gobbo, croc needs to get 5 diamonds to let him pass through a door which leads to a room where the last gobbo is hidden. There are 37 levels in this game. However, if Croc does not get all the gobbos and the jigsaw pieces resulting after beating the boss, you only get 32 levels. Collecting the 8 jigsaw pieces opens up a secret archipelago= 5 extra levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of a!","review":"DON'T BUY THIS GAME.

I'm also very Catholic. So I thought I'd love this book. However, I'm so sorry I wasted my time with this mess. Where do I begin?The romance was soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo slow, which caused the book to be super boring, as there was nothing else interesting about the whole story.This was mentioned before, but I'll say it again. The way the kids talked was so not accurate. Kids don't talk like that.Sophie was made to be stupid. I hated that no one either corrected her speech, and that she never learned from how people speak.The way this book was written was incredibly disconnected. I couldn't connect to the characters, I couldn't relate to any of them because not enough time was spent on describing them. More time was spent explaining all their activities and none of their thoughts or feelings.Finally, what in the world was wrong with Sophie's hands? They were always sweaty or wet or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Story","review":"It is a sweet, clean story with a predictable course of action.

I had several friends tell me it wasn't Lori Wick's best work. I couldn't disagree more. This book was wonderfully written and showed that Lori Wick is capable of writing incredible contemprary fiction. I was pleased with the plot although predictable in a lot of places, it was still thrilling.

What follows is the cutest, sweetest love story. This is definitely Lori Wick in her finest form-gentle lessons about life, cute bits of humor, and a warm love story make this one of those \\"comfort\\" books to curl up with.

She did not seem real to me at all. I felt that there was no depth to any of the characters and I never really felt any attachment to any of them. I almost didn't finish the book, but I did. Long before the book ended, I already knew what the ending would be. There was absolutely no excitement. It was all very predictable. I also felt that the story was rushed. It went from one thing to another, without any time to develop the plot or characters. This was a very disappointing read for me. I really don't think that I will be buying any other Lori Wick titles. However, if you are looking for a book that has little character development and a predictable feel good storyline, then you will love this one. There is one positve thing that I will say. Sopie has a very strong faith in God that I did admire. The storyline, however, was lacking substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow, sappy and like a boring sermon","review":"This is not a good romance novel.

A friend told me to listen to the first two albums with Paul Dianno. Needless to say, I didn't like his style, until I really listened again. Neither of them are Dickinson but just as I got to like Iron Maiden with Dianno, I got to like Maiden with Bayley.Bayley is a baritone... He doesn't have Dickinson's range (who does) and I think that's what disappoints other people. Sometimes he is off key, but he can hold a note, it's just a low one. The music is actually pretty good. It's different, just as Dianno was different from Dickinson who was different from Bayley. I think Murray and Gers are in sync but the drumming lacks. McBrain seems to be simply keeping the beat rather than driving it. I have read some reviews alluding to a \\"tired\\" band, perhaps the drumming makes this so...Give this a try, listen a couple of times, and don't expect 7th son. I think you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtual XI","review":"I reviewed X factor by saying that it was a solid overall album.When x factor came out originally, it was 1995 and i didn't originally like it (still missing bruce). So when virtual XI came out, there was a hope for optimism (as is the case with every maiden album). however, nothing disappointed me more than when i heard the first two minutes of angel and the gambler. I hope i don't insult anybody but songs are too long, boring and repetative. In angel in the gambler, he says \\"Don't you think i'm a saviour\\" like 65 times or something. and there are other songs that are repetative like this.What I like, the clansman and futureal and the guitar solo's. some of the best solo's i've heard. but overall, it is a forgetable album. Don't get me wrong, the reason i don't like it is not because blaze is the singer, i just find that maiden was trying too hard to be maiden. i would give it a 1.5/5. Tour for that album was quite good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"This was my first Iron Maiden cd. I bought it for very cheap at a used cd store. Now I know why it was there! \\"Futureal\\" is an ok song, but it doesnt even compare with their older stuff. \\"The Angel and The Gambler\\" is probably the best song on here, if you can listen to all of it without getting bored. I guess \\"When Two Worlds Collide\\" is another decent song, but thats about all. The guitar work is pretty good this album, but that's not enough to make you wanna listen.Definitely don't buy this if you are new to Maiden, because it will leave you saying \\"What's everyone talking about? Iron Maiden's not that good\\". Anyways, You have to give them credit for coming back and making one of the best albums of their career, \\"Brave New World\\". Luckily i decided to give them a second chance after i bought Virtual, because their older stuff rules!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT COVER!","review":"The cover is so coool!

THis CD is weak, weak, weak..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"This is perhaps one of the worst rock/metal CD's of the 90's, and certainly Maiden's weakest release. Not only because Blaze's voice is flat and boring compared to Bruce Dickinson's (one of the greatest vocalists of rock music) but also because of the songs that sound very flat, very uninspiring..very boring and totally un-Maiden. I think that even No Prayer For The Dying is better than this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIRTUAL END OF THE ROAD ....","review":"The fans were betrayed. THis is the only reasonable explanation for MAIDEN release such a horrible, incredibly bad album. There's absolutely nothing here, no matter what some fans say. The \\"ANGEL AND THE GAMBLER\\" seems to be joking with the fan. The songs is ten minutes long repeating the same chorus over and over again for endless minutes !!!! \\"FUTUREAL\\" is so juvenile, it seems MAIDEN in 1977 !!! Well, you wanna some proof that this CD is horrible ? Why do you think Steve Harris fired Blaze Bayley after this record and calle Bruce Dickinson back ? BEcause sales dropped terribly in this album ! This is the only reason. Of course tha band was coming thorugh a period of total lack of creativiness (with Janick Gers aboard, this is not difficult to happen...), but a scapegoat had to be found."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THEIR WORST EFFORTS","review":"I've known (and loved) MAiden for a long time. I still do. But I was shocked when I heard this fiasco called \\"VIRTUAL ELEVEN\\". Unbeliavable bad. THe song \\"ANGEL AND A GAMBLER\\" is a joke, repeating its chorus endless times. \\"FUTUREAL\\" is a failed attempt to reproduce tracks as \\"BE QUICK OR BE DEAD\\" and \\"ACES HIGH\\". \\"THE CLANSMAN\\" is pathetic, trying to be an epic. Well, listen it yourself, but do yourself a favor: listen it first from a friend, before buying it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Unappreciated Album","review":"It is the second Iron Maiden album featuring Blaze Bayley. It is important to consider that it is impossible to find another \\"Bruce Dickinson\\"... simply Blaze Bayley has a different singing style. The songs in this album are not as introspective and dark as in The X Factor but: 1) Riffs are all beautiful. 2) The songs are an attempt to content the fans: there were so many bad opinions about The X Factor (only fans were not able to accept the new singer) that Harris decided to make a new desperately bad produced album.If you listen The X Factor for several times, than you are ready to listen Virtual XI.If somebody is unable to accept Blaze singing style, I suggest him/her to buy the Blaze album: \\"Silicon Messiah\\": it is a pleasing surprise (and a real good album).((sorry for my bad english... but I'm good only in speaking Italian))"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool","review":"I think this album is great for a number of reasons. Iron Maiden did'nt saacrifice their sound for it. As soon as \\"Futureal\\" begins, you know who it is. And Blaze's vocals sound strong as ever. And the Bayley/Gers song \\"Como Estais Amigos\\" is tremendous, as well as the rest of the album. The only reason for a 4 star rating and not a 5, is the ending of \\"The angel and the gambler\\" Goes on ust a little too lon. Although I am glad that Bruce and Adrian are back with Maiden, I will miss Blaze. I wish him well."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD !!","review":"well.. this is the worst iron maiden album forever. well.. it's the only BAD album. i only graded it 2 stars because some songs like futureal and the clansman make it listenable. anyway, i RERELY listen to it because i have those two songs live with bruce dickinson. if you don't know iron maiden yet, don't buy this one. if you are starting to know iron maiden, and intend to have all albums, buy this one as the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIRTUAL MAIDEN","review":"This is the worst album I never heard.

The situation reached a point where the band had to hire Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith again. Simple as that. They fired only Blaze, but I think Janick should have been gone too."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIRTUAL GARBAGE","review":"THis Cd defis any explanation. How Harris and Murray allowed this to happen ?

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaze will never be a part of Maiden.","review":"One song and that was it: Self Destruction. Blaze has his own identity. He couldn't seem to hold his voice longer than 5 seconds, and he is off-key most of the time. He can have a potential like Bruce, but he doesn't know how to harness it. And the album is kind of weak. It's good to know Bruce and Adrian back in the lineup."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY, VERY BAD !","review":"I can't believe. They did an album worst than X-FACTOR ! It's amazing!

We bought it with the hope it might actually cool down a room, or at least keep a room comfortable, but alas nothing of the sort was achieved. Instead we are left with a frightfully noisy and large thing that fails simply does not work.It is besides a very poorly engineered machine, demanding that one spends half an hour at a time just adding or subtracting one of the hoses depending on how hot it is outside. And then one is left to refit it to the window, which cannot be done without copious amounts of unsightly gaffer tape. The instruction guide is so idiotically conceived as to explain, with an entire page of the booklet, how to fit batteries into the remote, yet not a word was written on how to connect any of the hoses, nor how to adjust the vent.It should be a crime that such a machine be allowed to be sold. Do yourself a favor and buy something, anything, else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Wynton Kelly","review":"This collection of Hal Singer tunes (the first issued under his own name), is somehow to me worth having out of two reasons: First and foremost because this includes four tracks (maybe some more)that is also early Wynton Kelly-recordings. The other reason - i then think in listening terms - must be that this is another one of those boogie/soul/R&B-albums that became so popular in the late 40's and early 50's. If you are a fan of \\"mature\\" Earl Bostic, Slim Gaillard, Louis Jordan, Big Moose Walker and such, this is the line Hal Singer is following, allthough i personally (without beeing a great listening fan to neither)think the previous mentioned are more interesting. The last material in the collection, from 1951, is flirting with plain rock'n'roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"This book was written by my father-in-law more than 100 years ago.

In Chapter 4 it talks about Reptiles and Birds. Last, in Chapter 5 it talks about Mammals. I only am up to Chapter 3 in school. The only reason I rated this book 4 stars was because, I find almost all my homework answers in there, and because this book is not the book I would read on my own free reading time.

Ivy Smith and Raymond Jones were a nice enough pair but their relationship contained little heat and absolutely NO!! fire. Mitch or Ray they both were so low keyed I was almost hoping she would chose Bethany her equally wealthy sister friend. The secondary characters were predictable and irritating, I had to force myself to finish this book. Many women earn more money than their men for some it's an issue for some it's not, either way they GET-OVER-IT or GET-OVER-each other, in the case of Ray and Ivy it would not have made a difference. I give two stars for Ray's daughters Mya and Yolanda who as far as I'm concerned was the only good thing about this dull story. I have never read any other books of Ms Griffin although I have one on my shelf, I chose this one because a website I visit gave it a good rating.

It is specifically a guide to effective, empowering communication when facing life-threatening illness, yet it is similar to Dr. Horner's book in having a more conversational style and colorful, uplifting images."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't read this.","review":"A loved one bought me this book after my diagnosis. I've been awaiting surgery with a fairly positive attitude - until I started flipping through this book. She says one out of every three women diagnosed with breast cancer will die from it (when I understood the survival rates to be much, much higher). She tells the story of her mom, who was diagnosed with it in the early stages and died of it 5 years later. I'm devastated. All the people I've talked to, all the great stories I've heard, were just undone by one casual flip-through of this book.

It was mostly in black and white with some odd accent colors like olive green, and red and yellows. Besides what I thought of the strange colors, there are quite a few pages of solid text, which also deterred me when I was little. However when I got older I grew to love this book.

I read this book, and the premise is not to be believed, especially for the true student of Elvisology. Elvis reforming? Conflicts with every known account of the man there is. This is a fairy tale, with Elvis' name attached to it. There is no editing, mispellings are rampant, and get this, there is another book yet to come.

Don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of genius that brings you in touch with a man's heart","review":"Derek Walcott's \\"Collected Poems 1948-1984\\", is a work of literary genius. It is a classic that echoes the works of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin, and other great poets of the past. Walcott not only echoes their styles, he has embraced them and made them his own; adding his own strong island flavour. So what you get is a very refreshing read full of images and sounds that bombard the senses; carrying you away to another world.

Although I'm not a prude by any means, I found the graphic descriptions of sex between Carrie and Kyle to be a bit of a shock because it seems out of character for her writing style. Many of her books have a religious thread in them since they deal with angels or have titles like God's Guest List. No one in this book was remotely angelic.That being said, I found the whole premise of two people who literally hated each other so badly that they were at risk of losing their jobs all of a sudden becoming lovers and planning a life together within a couple of days to be ludicrous. Reminded me of the whole Bachelor/ Bachelorette premise. Life and love just don't happen that way.Ms. Macomber should stick to what she does so very well and leave the graphic sexuality to the Harlequin series that so it quite well. Her attempt seemed like an awkward foray into an unfamiliar territory."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gets crazier by the page","review":"Of all the Debbie Macomber books that I read, this has to be one of the ones that I was most dissapointed. It starts out as a quite likable story, with two characters who strongly dislike each other but find out that they will be canned by their boss if they don't start to get along. So they put their differences aside and go on a road trip! As they travel together, this book starts to crumble. It starts to get so unbelievable that it's not enjoyable.

Instead of skillful literary technique, he relies on one explicit homosexual act after another to string the book together. The main character, Johnny Rio, is obsessed with these perverse encounters throughout the novel; his character remains static, flat, and frankly, boring. Graphic content aside, _Numbers_ fails to engage the reader by settling for underdeveloped plot, characters, and conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"For older gay men only","review":"Any gay person born after 1970 will find this one to be weird.

Should carry a warning that it should only be read while covered in latex. A sickening, piggish descent into pathological promiscuity and anonymous sex. Will leave even the most ardent supporters of gay hedonism with a sense of disgust at the total absence of any moral values. The maladjusted mentality that Rechy details here is just a few steps away from a fascism that sees human beings as nothing but meat to be consumed-whether in anonymous sex or the gas ovens.

In fact there's one scene where the two speed by a European castle and in the chaos, it turns into a series of mobile homes. Please, tell me how that's funny?Because it's not.There's another scene where a reporter gets nearly choked to death, another where Tom's owner just wails on him with a broom, I mean, how are these things funny? This movie is contrived and unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suitable For Older Kids","review":"This is definitely for older kids or maybe even adults, I got this for my 3 and 6 yr old, they didn't get most of the humor, and the chases weren't all that funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT Watch this!!!","review":"I watched this movie one to many times and I only saw it once.The first five minutes were the only funny, true Tom and Jerry,scenes. Other than that, the show was stupid and most of the scenes were inoppropiate for young children. Five people are KILLED and there's three creepy monsters. I'll just tell you what happens at the end. Tom and Jerry are the only ones left in the race and they tie. They win a big mansion to replace the house they wrecked in the beginning. Tom and Jerry are having a big party with their friends when Tom's mistress comes home to the mansion she thinks Tom won for her. Then she sees Jerry and tells Tom to \\"get that mouse out of the house!\\" Then a very short chase ensues and the house starts getting wrecked all over again.

Yeah, \\"February 14\\" and \\"Gravity's Gone\\" are good tracks, but other than that it's pretty forgettable. I'm especially bummed by Jason Isbell's tunes - what the heck happened? The tracks he wrote for \\"Dirty South\\" and \\"Decoration Day\\" were far and away the best songs on amazing records. Now he sounds like a Doobie Brother or something equally silly.C'mon guys, get it together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this album!","review":"The drive by truckers sealed the deal that they were the best rock band in the world when \\"the dirty south\\" was released. After listening to this album i'm not so sure anymore. \\"A blessing and a curse\\" is the worst album the truckers have ever put out. It's obvious that this was written for the radio, and not for the fans. If you want to listen to the DBT, buy \\"the dirty south\\", \\"decoration day\\", or \\"southern rock opera\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"LAcks the the energy, emotion, and imagery of there last few albums.

The album reminds me of the Eagles as a southern rock band particularly with \\"Little Bonnie\\", but they rock with a touch of the Stones with \\"Gravity's Gone\\" and the lead in \\"Aftermath USA\\" even has a touch of Rod Stewart's voice. The band has great vocal diversity such as in the great song \\"Daylight\\" and \\"Feb 14\\" that probably sound more pop than rock. The lead singers make stand up music creating an album that excels and virtually each song is worthy as a single release. If you like a more laid back southern rock sound that includes even an acoustical ballad like \\"Space City\\" mixed with some jammin rock as in \\"A Blessing and a Curse\\", and then you will like this album. Each musician in the band can play, write and sing. Go easy on yourself and give the CD a play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Safe, and Cute Carseat","review":"I love this carseat!

I can't imagine how a \\"regular\\" car seat could ever fit in this car. If you have a Honda Civic (or similar sub-compact), this car seat from Britax is the only choice for your vehicle.Cons? Of course. My daughter is about 15 lbs. and has much less support in this seat compared to the one that came with our Chicco travel system. This seat is rated for newborns but I would never put my newborn in it. The other issue I have is how the base digs into the upholstery. After it was installed for a week I had deep impressions in my back seat. You might want to consider a car seat saver from Prince Lionheart. That's what I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"It sits higher than most car seats so it's easier to strap the kids in. I have three car seats in the back seat of my car and it fits nicely. The seat also has velcro that attaches to the straps so when you unbuckle the seat and take your child out the straps stay open. This is great for when you are putting a sleeping baby in the car and don't have an extra hand to open the straps. When my youngest grows out of the infant seat, I'll definitely get another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for your toddler","review":"This car seat is perfect for a toddler and especially for owners of small or compact cars.

This car seat is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right Size & Comfy","review":"My nearly 1 year old daughter loves this seat. I have it rear facing in a 2008 Rav4 and even fits front facing in a 2002 RSX coupe. It's slightly smaller size has worked out perfectly. Installation is easy with the LATCH system. I'll have to wait to see if the 40lb limit Vs. the Marathon's 65lb limit will make a difference.

I bought one for my older daughter and at 6 months when my son was getting to big for his infant carrier I purchased another one for him. They are rated on of the best car seats and they both look very comfy in them. They must love them because they normally fall asleep in them. I also like it because of the dark black, hides the satins from their juice/food they spill. Also love that it is both froward and backwards facing and will be able to have them for many years. Recommend this brand of car seat to everyone! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"I found this very easy to install (rear facing). Our 9 month old loves it especially how she can sit up more and look around. She seems very comfortsble and the straps are easy to adjust. I do think the straps could be tight around her thighs if she keeps growing at this rate, but so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't crashed yet, but...","review":"Feels very secure, with the rear facing setup, there is a strap that attaches to the base of the seat in front. Like I said, I haven't done the crash test yet (and I hope I never do), but it certainly seems a great deal more solid than any other setup we've used. Dylaney loves the pretty flowered pattern, and she seems so comfortable. Overall easy to use and quality excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits well in cars.","review":"I have 2 Britax car seats for my sons and they are well worth the price! They fit better in the many cars we have put them in. The latch is very easy to use. If you don't have a latch there is a clip at the side top of the seat to help install with a seatbelt. (makes it snug). My sister tried other seats and then switched to Britax too. I thought they were expensive at first, but your kids are worth a well fitted car seat. My son's find them comfy too. As with any car seat- if it doesn't fit well (very snug) in your car- find one that does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best convertible car seat","review":"Top rated in security both by costumers and experts reviews, once you try it you'll realize that everything is true about it. Very comfortable for my baby, very easy to get in and get out from the seat, and fast to install, not to mention the size, wich is very convenient for those owning a small car, we have a ibiza and the seat fits perfectly in the back seat. In conclusion, dont look around with other brands, this is you best option if the security of your kids (as in my case) its priority, althought a little bit expensive, its worthy"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK product","review":"I like the seat cover, both the print and the touch of fabric, but it doesn't seem to breathe well in hot summer day.

I purchased it after reading so many reviews and I feel great that I made the right decision. I would really recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for a small space","review":"Not only is this carseat rated one of the safest, but it is great for someone who has limited space in the back seat. My daughter has plenty of room and so does the passenger whose seat is in front of hers (unlike her infant seat - ouch). I love the velcro on the shoulder harness so when you take the shoulder harness off the baby to remove him/her from the car, you can velcro the strap to the side of the seat; that makes it so easy when you put the baby back in the seat - shazam! there's the strap ready to go, no need for digging under the baby. The only downfall I've found is that the velcro stick to her wool sweaters and fuzzes them up a bit, small price to pay and I'll take it! Excellent seat - I am hooked on Britax!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd one for #2","review":"We've had this carseat for our daughter since the day she was born.

She also sleeps much better in this seat. It doesn't seem like her neck is breaking:0)...I also love the way there is velcro on the side of the straps so when you remove the child the straps don't fall in. The only thing I wish I would have payed more attention to was the weight limit and would have gotten the Marathon..but other than that I love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome car seat!!!","review":"I knew I wanted a well-rated, good looking car seat when I was doing research for ours, and wanted something different from the standard Graco and Fisher Prices out there. Britax consistently had great reviews and many awards so we decided to get the Roundabout. This model is more portable for travel since we travel a lot. We haven't traveled overseas with it yet, but we really love it so far. I also have great peace of mind that I have a car seat that exceeds U.S. safety standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Britax Roundabout review","review":"Great car seat. Only issue we have with it is the child can loosen the chest part. I wish someone could invent a part that does not slide easily. But all in all it's a VERY nice car seat. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good carseat","review":"I am not rating it 5 stars as I have only been using it for a month now. I really like the part that it is compact and not too heavy. I was using Eddie Bauer before and that was very heavy and took lot of space in my car. Also, I like the fact that it is easy to remove the seat cover and put it back when you are want to wash it. One minor minus point is that the seat cover is not as soft as the Britax Marathon I had before. I have heard a lot of great things about Britax (Marathon and Roundabout), so I went ahead with this purchase though it is a little expensive. When it comes to the safety of your child, I think a little more money would not matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debut album from a Brazilian MPB legend","review":"This is the first album, from 1973, of Brazilian MPB (\\"Musica Popular Brasileira\\") star, Joao Bosco.

We took it on vacation and used it to charge a camera battery. The planes that I've ridden on so far either had no power or had 120V, so I haven't used it on a plane yet and I haven't really put it to the test in terms of power draw, but I've used it to charge items over 120V or USB and have appreciated the USB output.The cigarette lighter adapter does seem to have a hard time staying in place in certain instances."},{"rating":"1","title":"easy connection?","review":"Looks great and nice case.Everything works and is very easy connectable to the car or plane sockets butthe problem that I have is how to link it up to the power entrance of my Sony Vaio via the USB oulet?Where can i find the cables and plugs for it?Not clear and not explained anywhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Overvoltage protection","review":"I have used this on planes and it worked with my laptop. Really like its small size. Today just plugged it into a solar panel that puts out 12V (but has large voltage range) and it started to smoke. So I took it back to my car and after it blew out more smoke continued to work. Reading the spec, the input voltage is 12.8 - 13.2 volts - which is pretty tight. I shouldn't have plugged it into the solar array because the voltage with no load is probably like 14-15V, but come on. Its not that hard to design a circuit to handle a higher voltage input. Car systems are known to have lots of strange noise and voltage jumps. So I give it 4 stars because while it smoked, it continued to work. I suspect a couple parts are a bit crisp on the inside. Going to purchase an inverter with over voltage protection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not handle 150 watts","review":"This is a small inverter. It will not power my 15 inch laptop. It will only charge it at best. The USB would not charge my IPOD. It would not work on the airplane. The green light showed it had power to it, and showed it was charging my laptop, but after 2 hours of charging, there was no differnce in battery level.In conclusion, I think it is good for charging light load electronics (cell phones) but considering my laptop draws 75 watts and it would not even power that, I think it is nowwhere near 150 watts capable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Given as a Gift","review":"I can't attest to the quality/functions of this product as I gave it as a gift.

The power light cycles from green to red (on to off) when plugging my Dell Latitude D630 laptop with high capacity battery into it.

I then plugged it into my car to test if it would handle 120 watts by pushing on the graphics card. It would not. The inverter switches off and on causing the laptops power management to have serious problems. Towards the end of the car test (~30 minutes) it would no longer recharge the laptop battery and was starting to make a horrible noise. Prior to this purchase I tested a Duracell 813-0291-07 175 Watt DC to AC Pocket Power Source Inverter which wouldn't handle the laptop on a plane (in any mode) but would in the car.

Piano Quartet No. 3 in C major, WoO 36/3 is a tuneful gem. Op. 16 is performed here as piano with string trio (uncredited pianist), while not as slyly humorous as the wind version, more than holds its own (compare with the great Klara Wurtz recording for Columns Classics). Album concludes with a collegial String Quartet #3 by Bamberg Quartet. There are better interpretations of the latter, but the program here is so right, like a Sunday afternoon concert, that you'll usually let it play through. Just put it on & read the Sunday NY Times Magazine. Media Partners, like Pilz, Madacy, Delta & other bargain label recyclers is notorious for mislabeling.

The story is garbage, just rehashes of rehashes, completely cliché and all done before, and done better. The CGI is bad, but in all honesty, I have seen a lot worse from the Sci-Fi channel. The acting is bad, the pace is unbearably slow and it's just an all around terrible movie. It would pain me, physically pain me to have to watch this again.

I'm a fan of low budget, shlocky horror movies, of the kind Corman is famous for, but this waste of time was too much even for me. Maybe it was the cheesy digital effects, because bad acting and bad writing have never prevented me from enjoying any Corman's older films, as well as gems by Ed Wood, Bert I. Gordon, William Castle, etc. When you start rooting for the creature to win, you know it's a bad film. Many shots had backlighting problems so bad that the actors were in silouette and you couldn't see their faces- even Ed Wood didn't make mistakes like that.89 minutes of my life I'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible movie, but not in the good way you were hoping","review":"This movie is crap. It's not worth watching not even for the cheese factor. The first half hour is very funny, however, after that the movie starts trying to take itself seriously and then it nosedives. Yes there are pretty girls in bikinis, yes there is some deliciiously awful acting, but after awhile these things just aren't enough to carry a movie. They certainly weren't enough to carry this one.

It's an hour and half only, and if really bad sci-fi movies are your thing you will probably like it.

It's all bad: cinematography, editing (jump-cuts galore, and who approved that awful DVE phone con sequence!?), VFX (compositing was dreadful), etc. Just terrible.

The white plastic-made subwoofer buzzes and rattles, middle range pretty lacks, and the treble sounds something like metalic. My 20-dollar two stpeakers from Creative sounds better than this. Don't fall for the design.

Their first record was quirky and decadent, and very over the top. My Melody relies on more subtlety within the band and more cover versions, especially heavy on the Serge Gainsbourg influence. Lead singer, Franoise Cactus is slowly becoming a legend in the international moogcore jetset pantheon. \\"Discjockey\\" is a danceable song which sound more like the first record, but most of this one is more torch and tragic. For the fans of Franois Hardy and Gainsbourg, this one is for you. Many club people who live for dressing up retro and fuzzy can't seem to get enough of Stereo Total.(www.freewilliamsburg.com)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better with every listen","review":"On the first listen, I felt assaulted by a raucous, rank amatuerism. But by the third spin, I was absolutely won over by the goofy insouciance of the band (not to mention the multi-ligualism--they make German fun!). A love for pop music oozes from the album, and the band's joy is infectious.

I find that this book will shed more light on hospitality that Derrida doesn't cover in \\"Of Hospitality\\". Derrida's analysis between absolute or unconditional hospitality and lawful or conditioned hospitality is coherent along with the foundation of Deconstruction between the external and internal.

This story called \\"Sleep-Away Camp\\" deals with self-mutilation.Your child can read about a four-year old girl and her sister getting felt \\"in places that aren't meant to be seen by other people.\\" How about a suicide story? How about a mother with flesh-eating disease? Or the deaths of best friends, fathers, or the death of a mother by mixed meds? It is all in this book.

I am certain this book is excellent reading for *middle-school* students, who are more emotionally mature and more world-wise and more ready to handle it.

Some of the preteen girls I work with really like this book because they relate to some of the stories personally. They also seem drawn to the rest of the stories because, while the events may be unfamiliar, the emotions expressed by the authors are easily recognized. A warning though, the book contains stories that express the challenges of growing up and do not depict an idealistic childhood some may think they are exposing their children to when they purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional book but parents should be cautioned -A Kid's Review","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it comforting to see what other girl's my age were going through, and that I am not alone. I know that thousands of other girls who read that book felt that way too. Many of the topics are everyday topics that every girl goes through, but some of the topics may be too mature for some girls. There are stories of body changes, suicide, death, cutting, and drinking. I didn't find these stories too shocking because I know these things go on in the world. But do be aware, girls under the age of 8 DEFINITELY shouldn't read this book. Girls ages 9 through 11 who don't know about these issues shouldn't read this book because it might frighten them.

I don't like the fabric and when tightened it digs into my neck and my baby's legs and hurts. It seems to be twisted 90% of the time and I know that I'm threading it correctly. I have to readjust it too often because the fabric is always sliding and loosening up the sling. I NEVER go hands free using this carrier. I don't know what they're talking about but this sling isn't that secure. Another thing about slings is they are only supported by one shoulder and your back so eventually the weight from any sized baby causes a lot of pain and discomfort. I am looking into the Moby or Sleepy Baby wraps because they're softer, more secure and distribute weight evenly, but I'm not sure if I want to be bothered with all that wrapping."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate it","review":"I tried the Maya Wrap for about 1 month then returned it.

I think it was twisted and it wasn't very tight but it helped so much with the weight after watching the instructions I am even more excited to use it. My daughter is 15 months old 25 lbs. I'm used to carrying her all this time, but she loved the maya as much as I did, she was happy and calm in it. Will post more later! Get it!

I agree with the other review that criticizes the film for trivializing the sad horrors of South America by playing them out in a movie about a psychic. The 1982 film MISSING with Jack Lemmon and DEATH & THE MAIDEN with Sigourney Weaver touch on the same topic and do a better job of handling it.You almost feel guilty for watching a form of entertainment about a dark and despicable part of history.Watching IMAGINING ARGENTINA is kind of like watching THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION if that film had included numerous brutal prison gang rapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like progressive rock, then the title tells you how to leave this one......","review":"I had to try it.

The first tune, Who Are You, is not bad, but I did not find it getting better from there. I gave up with the 3rd tune.

No. 23 is widely regarded as possibly his best piano concerto, and the Elvira Madigan has a very beautiful slow movement. These performances, however, are just terrible. The soloist is dull, the orchestra doesn't sound good, and there's no emotion here. Moreover, the piano and orchestra seem to be playing at different paces throughout.

The songs are complete with introduction, which is great because not all versions have the songs with the introductions.

The first application shows how to display a duck in a pond, and the second one shows how to create a really simple spreadsheet. For 69 bucks, how about including serialization, jdbc, servlets, RMI?

Why they abandoned complete season releases in favor of throwing together a random mix of sketches in no set order from the 3 most recent, and arguably the worst, seasons makes no sense to me. Of course this does have some classic sketches, impressions and characters on it, such as Debra Wilson's Oprah and Mo Collins' Lorraine, but a majority of it is just random. Most of these sketches aren't some of the better ones.

I thought I was getting generic information about success techniques within the industry, instead I got little more than a flyer that instructed me to join his mlms, buy his books and advertise in his card deck.

I don't consider myself to be a power hound, but I have been using Macs exclusively for 16 years. I discovered a satisfying number of of useful and undocumented tips. About two thirds of the items are easy enough for a novice to follow, such as simple modifications of standard applications, and using Terminal to modify how the System behaves. (Working in Terminal gave me the same kind of thrill I remember from Res-Edit years ago.) The final third of the book is devoted entirely to Unix and was completely beyond me -- probably only useful to programmers.There are a fair number of items that reminded me of David Letterman's \\"Stupid Pet Tricks\\" -- things you can make your Mac do just because you can, not because they are particularly useful.

Heavy majority of the songs sound like they were recorded thru a wall. The sound is far inferior to the one provided in the original game.

No matter what I did to my stereo system, I could not get the game to sound right. Furthermore, what happened to quality of the covers? Some of these are absolutely bad; definitely below the quality produced by Harmonix in the first game. The only redeeming quality is that the song list is good and graphics are improved.

These live recordings really embody what was so wonderful, and vital, about Springsteen in those early days, before \\"Born in the USA\\" came around. Listening to this concert also shows that it wasn't just Bruce's songs and charisma that thrilled audiences; it was a band effort. Listen to these songs, smile and remember the greatness of Bruce, Clarence, and the band. Their version of \\"Quarter to Three,\\" the old Gary U.S. Bonds hit that's one of the encores on this Hammersmith Odeon, show how this band was able to transform an \\"oldie\\" and make it their own. This album is nothing but a brilliant rock and roll performance. I'm a believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with Peter Savage","review":"I too was at the 1975 Springsteen show at the Hammersmith Odeon. It was brilliant. I too remember Springsteen's version of 'Pretty Flamingo' and it was, for me, a high point in a great show. So it's a pity that it is not included here--though I have to say that it was a *very* long spoken intro as I recall so that might have had to have been dropped!

Like a super hero discovering his powers for the first time. They have extended, improvised, boot-stompin', roof-raisin' rockin' jams and you can tell they are having fun. There are lots of songs with a good combination of big hits and deep cuts. My only complaint, and this is just a personal pet peeve, is that two of his best rockers, Thunder Road and For You, are stripped down to just a piano and slowed down to the point that you can't even sing along. That was a disappointment since they played a big role in my buying this cd in the first place. When you have bonified rockers, let'em rock man! He has plenty of good ballads if he felt like going slow but to castrate your best songs doesn't make sense to me. It's still a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"Great stuff! It was performed when they were at their peak. follow their first (and in my option, best 3 albums). Bruce and the entire band are really strong. The drum work is exhausting!To my surprise, the sound quality is fantastic. Only one very small dead spot that only lasts a split second. The balance is perfect. It's great to hear all of the material come from one show, done at a small venue. It sound like there were only a couple of hundred people there that night.

An animal or person being heated up, causes Goldberg's desired effect only because he drew the human to do so. But for the human, the number of possible responses are many.

The sound is distant and murky, and you never know when that crashing cymbal is going to make you jump out of your chair.

But this one stinks. Jarring, out of tune and just plain mediocre to bad, depending on the song. His vocals are mixed way too high on many of the songs, resulting in sometimes painful(off key) results.

I am fascinated by Elizabethan times and by the life of Shakespeare, and I can barely force myself to focus on what is being said in the video. The entire 50 minutes is basically a collection of drawings from the time, nature scenes, and people wandering around in period costume, while a pair of narrators trade back and forth, reading in a monotone about things that should be really interesting but instead end up sounding dry and pointless.

Disturbing, yet intriguing elements are explored when the mind of a serial killer is opened as the clock ticks for his last victim. I was impressed with the performance of Jennifer Lopez in this flick because I'm not a particular fan. She becomes her character, expressing insight and devotion, while joining the race to save an innocent life.

(Fortunately, we also rented 'Rules of Engagement' at the same time.

Her line delivery is wooden and stiff, if not a montotone.2) \\"Hey, haven't we seen this before?!\\" Yes, we had. It's called The Silence of the Lambs, folks.3) We could have made better special effects in our spare time. I don't know what sort of look the director was going for (of course I do- \\"Cheap!\\"), but every effect looks fake if not downright laughable.4) This 'movie' to throw the term around loosely, tried, and failed, to use excessive violence in lieu of a plot.

Its one of those lets get inside the mind of the serial killer and find where he is hiding the victim movies that have been done into the ground. The director really trys to hide the weak plot under a bunch of special effects which in the end make this look like a Euro art fim reject. The director makes things even worse by casting Jennifer Lopez of all people to play a serious role. I don't care how good she looks she can't act. All she does is mumble her lines, walk around in her underwear, and gives no insight or sympathy to her character. In fact the only character who is even developed at all is the serial killer. There is quite a bit of gore for a mainstream movie but not even that is enough to make any true horror fan sit through this Mtv generation garbage.

I give his acting, in this movie, 5 stars.I enjoyed it, it was different and new. It is not a deep movie, it is, however, a dark movie. The visual effects were creative.

Through her we go inside the killer's mind, but what we see are just images without any form of meaning. The dreams are filmed with such overly saturated colors and outrageous contrast, that you may even forget that these thoughts are supposed to mean something. Granted, they are disturbing and present the eye with colorful images, but that's all. Then we're to believe that even thought the psychologist only goes inside his mind twice, she becomes quite attached to him. There's no basis for this odd relationship. All in all, I'm left thinking that this screenplay has to be based on some kind of short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh the agony","review":"The bad news...a serial killer has just captured his latest victim.He's imprisoned her in his holding cell and if the FBI don't get her in acertain time frame she will be drown. The good news? The FBI have justcaught the killer. The bad news? He's in a coma and they don't know wherethe woman is being held. The good news? A Psychologist (Jennifer Lopez) ispart of a team which has developed a means to send a doctor inside the brainof comotose patients to assist in their regaining consciousness. The badnews? She's never been inside the brain of a killer before.It is an interesting concept, though it strikes heavily the memoriesof Dream Scape from the early 80s. Unfortunately they don't build anytension or interest in the characters. Instead the director relies heavilyon the computer and ends up making a twisted art film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cell","review":"Well what can I say this film is bad. Totally unoriginal, with very little shocks and a predictable screenplay. Jennifer Lopez seems very miss-cast here and makes what she can with the self-conscious dialogue, although there's nothing wrong with her acting but I found it really hard to believe her in this role. Vince Vaughan is good playing an FBI man and is well cast, but I feel that his character as well as Lopez's never really develop fully, although the killer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio) is well thought out and is shown as three different characters, this is quite ingenious, but it won't save the film. On the visual side of things, the film excels with elaborate dreamscapes and costumes and good production design, but once again this won't save the film from being just another Hollywood hack film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too disturbing for me....","review":"Freaky. Disturbing. This guy is some kind of schizophrenic. His dad abused him. He has some obsession or fear with water. He's a serial killer. He kidnaps young women, locks them in this air-tight glass cage that has a toilet, food, etc., then has this automated timer to turn a shower on that makes them drown inside the cage. Then he soaks them in bleach, does something so that they are naked, covered in bleach, and he is suspended above him by chains that are in his back. And then, after that, he dumps them somewhere. Very disturbing. So he goes into a coma, and there is still this girl locked inside his glass cage, and the FBI doesn't know where that is. So Jennifer Lopez is this child therapist type person who goes into his mind to find out where she is. I'm not sure which is more disturbing, his mind or what he really does. And don't tell me I shouldn't have watched. I'm glad I did. Now I can warn you about it =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"The Silence of the Lambs meets MTV. I've yet to read a positive comment here (there are no positive professional reviews except Roger Ebert's) that makes any real sense. The movie isn't scary. The movie isn't suspenseful. The movie is pretty. It's a very pretty and a very gruesome movie. Movie watchers raised on MTV and VH1 think if a gruesome movie is pretty, it must be art. Well, that's a rampant misconception. See the aforementioned Silence of the Lambs -- study it -- to figure out the difference between a film director in his element and a video director out of his depths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible flick and waste of time!","review":"One sentence: Jennifer Lopez couldn't act her way out of a phone booth.This is a simply AWFUL flick. Gruesome, nauseating, I came away with a pounding headache.BTW, I love GOOD sci-fi, such as The Matrix, Bladerunner, both Terminators, The Abyss, and more.But, this movie is one of those flicks where they try to constantly ram special effects down your eyeballs and use them as a substitute for good acting or a good story line. It doesn't work. And, if you are watching this movie to see Lopez undress and show off her body, you are wasting your time and money, 'cause it ain't gonna happen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cell as seen on TRL","review":"I watched this in hopes of seeing something other than recycled movies. But, yet again I was disappointed. People heralded this as a great movie with great visuals. Though, to tell the truth this is in the same vein as Seven, Kiss the Girls and others in the serial-killer genre. So the plot was very, very familiar. As for the visuals, i.e. inside the killer's mind, you can see such visuals in videos for Tool and especially Marilyn Manson. I'm a fan of neither band but it's interesting that this was seen as something never done before. Hype is a very powerful entity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Version Cut?","review":"It seems that the Region 1 version of The Cell does not include some scenes that were left untouched in the film's European release. Europeans buying this Region 1 DVD for your multi-region players, wait and see if the European DVD release will include the cut scenes as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"Real dumb. I really don't know how to describe this mevie. I was really looking forward to seeing it! Boy what a disapointment. The movie just doesn't make any sense. It plods along with one bazzar scene after another. Then at the end the climax really has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. What a bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure eye candy, no story","review":"I was really excited to see this when it first came out in the theater, but didn't get around to seeing it, so my friends and I rented The Cell the first night it was out to rent. It's a good thing we waited to rent it, because it was a massive disappointment.The plot is painfully contrived, and so predictible most of us didn't finish watching the movie out of boredom. What little plot their is takes leaps and bounds that defy explanation. The special effects in this movie ARE superb, but that alone isn't going to make a great movie for me.Even though a girl's life is at stake in the movie, I was so bored, I rather she just up and die so the movie would be over. That's a horrible thing to say, but this movie didn't make me care one ounce about the characters.If you don't care about a plot at all, go right ahead and watch this! But if you want a shred of a storyline, you'll be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been so much more.","review":"This movie could have been so much more than it was. They had the opportunity to really explore some interesting concepts and ideas. But they utterly failed to explore them. They could have shown the how the killer was unassuming, almost pathetic, but how in his mind he is strong and powerful. But they never really explored it in any deapth.But what utterly destroys this film is Jennifer Lopez. She mumbles all her lines and delivers the role with as much animation as the kid in the coma.This movie just didn't want to try hard enough. As soon as the effects started it was just, look at the pretty images. Although the images are impressive it doesn't carry the movie.It is another example of making a half hearted effort and hoping the audience won't try and think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"This movie is just plain bad. After entering Jennifer Lopez mind, it turns out she's as sick if not sicker than the schizophrenic (most overused mental disorder in Hollywood aside from autism) Apparently she fancys herself as some sort of self righteous virgin Mary. A total waste of time. This movie reminded me of a comic book, one with decent art but no story."},{"rating":"1","title":"JLo's Madonna Video....","review":"....if Director Singh himself says that the visuals took precedence over the plot and the storymaking, what else should the viewer do, but turn down the sound and watch the stunning scenes go by?

What is happening with New Line Home Video?. It stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vile Film","review":"I am astonished that anyone who has seen this film would have something positive to say about it. The imagery in this film is not only boring, but offensive and gratuitous. It is as if someone on acid watched \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" decided to make a movie. Worse still is Jennifer Lopez's \\"acting\\" in the film. She really has no business being in any legitimate motion picture, and should stick to music (where the engineers can clean up any inadequacies in her voice elecronically). In short, avoid this disgusting film, and hope that the knuckleheads in Hollywood stop making this trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this one...","review":"This must easily be the dumbest movie ever made. If one didn't have the pleasure to look at Jennifer Lopez - it would be unwatchable. Unfortunately, the mind of the director works very much like the mind of the perverted serial killer - he enjoys showing a girl drowning in desperate circumstances; and the one moment which would be really interesting to see, where Jennifer Lopez is supposed to connect with the kid, she is all hiding behind operatic costumes... most of the audience walked out of this one, when I saw it in the theatres. Tarsem, the director of the movie, is a world reknown commercials guy. But unlike Spike Jonze, who's in the same commercial league but did not opt to bring amazing but meaningless imagery to his first movie (BEING JOHN MALKOVICH), this director indulges in his images and pays scant attention to story, characters, empathy and believability. Ultimately, it's a forgetable and soon to be forgotten attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Vacant","review":"Having seen some beautiful stills from the film, heard the soundbites I was expecting something pretty damn good.Be scared, be very scared. Of this film. Avoid at all costs. I repeat, all costs. It's a shimmery, pretty, fluffy ball of nonsense. The only real highlight is the end. When you can leave the cinema or turn off the DVD/Video. Phew, what a relief.The dialogue is agony, the acting is abysmal, the story....er, what story?And, oh dear, the lead actress. How does she get away with it? Somewhere a little old lady is smiling away to herself, thinking that she was the Drama teacher that told the little Jennifer that one day she would be a great actress. Big mistake. Huge mistake. Maybe she was good at playing a tree, she's certainly wooden!PS The 1 star rating is because I couldn't complete this form with it!

Lopez should stop 'acting' & (3) the fim relied heavily on the effects.But let us give the director some credit for his work for it takes creativity & uniqueness to come up with something different & infamous for the market to view. Oh, & yes, great effort to pull the entire film together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vincent D'Onofrio","review":"I thought this movie was utterly boring, and even moreso when I heard some of the director's commentary of his motive behind some of the scenes. Frankly, the only reason I even saw it was to enjoy Vincent D'Onofrio's performance, because he is a very talented actor. If you are an avid D'Onofrio fan then I recommend renting it on DVD and at least watching the scenes he is in. The visual affects were entertaining as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not just the visuals, folks","review":"We have here a delirious blend of psycho killer and psychedelic delirium, all tied up with a fantastic sci-fi plotline that is just believable enough to carry the entire film. I was astonished at my first viewing of a Jennifer Lopez movie\\"she has the acting chops to carry this off-kilter story. The acting is generally very good, and the visuals are on another plane, completely original, vivid, and powerful. Even if you didn't like The Cell, you should check out Tarsem's new film, The Fall, which shows no falloff in creativity from The Cell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately memorable","review":"I want to start by saying that the editorial review posted with this entry MUST have been for some other movie... surely not this one. It's a shame that people more easily shun that which they don't understand.For those who know what I'm talking about here, the Cell is the most interesting representation of D/s I've ever seen in a movie. It's just a pity that a correlation between viral/mental illness and kink is made, hence the rating of 4.J-Lo's performance is memorable and believable... and the characters equally so. The movie highlights the fact that no matter HOW its manifested on the outside... we are ALL vulnerable human beings on the inside.I'm a fan of movies with a message or purpose... not mindless action. I liked this movie so much because I understand the nuances of D/s illustrated here. This is the third time buying it... and I'm THRILLED to have found it here on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sci-fi","review":"This movie is like one big music video. Admittedly, the movie has phenomenal special effects. The story line and acting however is not close to par. Watch Matrix for depth and Silence of the Lambs for thrills and suspense. This movie was marketed as a combo of these two. It is not close in calibur. Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the movie, just look at the few pretty pictures.","review":"This film has only one thing going for it: lavish Peter Greeneway style visuals (I'm it seems one of the very few people who REALLY LIKE \\"Prospero's books\\"!). This movie has everything else against it. Boring story, boring uninteresting actors, a SciFi value lower than a \\"bad\\" episode of Transformers and a lot of sickening shots which are a rip-off of that other bad shock movie \\"Silence of the lambs\\". These shots are intended only to shock, they represent nothing of any storyvalue. This movie is like a bad conceived X-files episode. However \\"X-files\\" is just cheap television and to be enjoyed on that level. A theatermovie should be far more sophisticated since what else do you have that bigger budget for? All in all this movie is 90% waste of perfectly good celluloid. When this movie hits the rentalstore I'll do a montage of the visuals for my own enjoyment and forget that there ever was such a person as Jennifer \\"I can't act\\" Lopez."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Substance, horrible effects","review":"Haven't you noticed that for the last three years Jennifer Lopez's movies have had terrible scripts.Her last good movie was Out Of Sight, in my opinion her best movie to date.The Cell is just a collage of nightmarish scenes compiled together trying to make a movie. Simple and short review.Vince Vaughn in underused and Jennifer Lopez wears too much makeup even when she's not inside the killer's mind.I don't get all the fuss about the special effects, they are terrible they look similar to those of Mortal Kombat from 1995. There's also a very weird color scene when Vince Vaughn enters the killer's mind, what's that??This director is as bad as Joel Schumacher.If you don't get movies like The Silence Of The Lambs or Seven stick with The Cell, The Bone Collector and Kiss The Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst.....","review":"By far one of the worst movies of all time. The Cell rates right down there with \\"Howard the Duck\\" and \\"Stigmata\\", which are perhaps the two worst movies in the history of mankind.The story... stinks, the acting is borderline bearable (I'm a Vince Vaughn fan, and although I can't say anything bad about him, this movie was tough to swallow), and the movie seemed to be generally without direction. I was very anxious to see this film and was sorely disappointed. The effects were good. But unfortunately, this is just a miserable mess of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"put lopez in the cell and throw away the keys","review":"Ok I went to see this movie because Ebert gave it 4 stars. I heard this someplace: Siskel was going to have to watch this movie, he took the easy way out. The plot is \\"been there, done that numerous times\\", and extremely weak. I swear if I see another movie with the computer brain interface... There are some great individual sequences that would have made some other movie really great, but not this one. So if you take those sequences and put them together what you have is a great trailer. Acting wise, nobody really outdoes him or herself in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"**yawn.....**","review":"ok i have to be honest here......this movie was a complete and utter yawn factory..... the movie starts off good but it just seemed to go down one big downward spiral from the point at which they find the killer. The only reason they actually caught this guy is cause he dropped into a coma on his kitchen floor. And after than point the film just goes into one big boring physcological battle. The film tries to compare its self to other great horror/thriller films such as \\"seven\\" and \\"silence of the lambs\\" trust me its no where near as good as either of those films So in conclusion if you want a cheap effective way of falling asleep very fast without the means of drugs....rent this film"},{"rating":"1","title":"anyone else freaked out?","review":"I am!

I kept waiting for the Hellraiser cube to show up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I credit \\"The Cell\\" as the first example of a new genre...","review":"I really give Tarsem Singh and Mark Protosevich credit for a truly unique approach to filmmaking. It's really a great idea - borrow elements from several films in multiple genres! It's cost-effective, and it should allow focus groups to truly maximize revenue from the lowest common denominator of audiences.The trouble is, most of the previous films did it better the first time around. Let's see, how many films does \\"The Cell\\" resemble? Let's list them!1. Dreamscape 2. Brainstorm 3. Silence of the Lambs 4. Se7en 5. The Matrix 6.

All these machines that give people the ability to enter the minds of the sick has been done before and the only movie that reminded me of it was \\"Exorcist II\\". All the weird imagery and music and labyrinth mind trip was there. It seems now that Hollywood can not even try to think up an original story.

Vincent D.'s character is pretty cool but really doesn't match the movie or maybe it was just the script, who knows...it's worth seeing just to say, \\"oh, i saw the cell\\", but not worth buying or anything....really i just saw it for Vince V. and this wasn't his best role either...this movie.just.sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The Cell is a freaky movie. Very bizarre. I did not care for it and I think it is because I was disappointed.

The movie did not deliver all the suspense and drama and intensity that it promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID! VIOLENT! POINTLESS!","review":"I hate this movie. Me and my dad rented it on DVD. It was not worth the money. The visual effects are really nowhere near the complexity of Dinosaur or Gladiator. The story is nothing and the \\"rituals\\" the killer commits with the bodies, that is sick. THANK GOD I did not see this in theatres. It saved us having to leave during the middle of the show, which most people probably did. The violence is unnessassary( As in Carl Stargher's demented mind-self playing with somebody's intestines) unnessassary . Why do they take a potentially good movie and ruin it with that. You don't see that in Gladiator even though that is pretty violent( But the battle cam is so jerky you can't really see it. The nastier scenes were left out.) The Cell ( To sum it all up) is STUPID! So I would leave it well enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cell Review","review":"While the visuals are impressive,the film itself is extremely nonsensical and its nature is confusing. It's like watching a WCW Nirto or TNA Impact show. We also get a total lack of character development from Vincent D'Onofrio: The Killer.

The acting for the most part is uniformly BAD. Jennifer Lopez and her whisper are growing mighty tiresome, And what happened to Vince Vaughn?.......

But the movie is great. The acting is supurb. The storyline is extremely origanal, and the graphics are jaw-dropping. The film is about a child psychologist (Jenifer Lopez) who must go inside a killer's mind (Vincent D'Onofrano) to rescue his latest victom before the clock stops ticking. The movie is disturbing, but it makes you think. As I listen to those who say how much they hate the movie, I realize that you must not just watch this movie for what it is worth. You must watch this movie for everything. For subtext, for character development... not just for enjoyment. The people who do these things love this movie. The people who don't, hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually amazing..otherwise lacking","review":"I remember seeing the first couple of previews for this movie and just being absolutely amazed and counting the days until is theatrical release. I went to the movie's website thinking \\"Wow, this is cool\\" and then the big night came and boy was I let down.Visualy this moving is spectacular, amazing, awe inspiring, sometime disturbing, brilliant and any other similar adjective you can think of. Too bad the movie wasn't a silent film. Jennifer Lopez's acting left much to be desired, and the script was just not that good (I am trying to be a little nice here).This movie had a lot of potential and could have been shelved right next to \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" if they would have just got some better writing and acting.I will probably end up purchasing this on DVD just because visually this movie was so spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"A visually stunning film","review":"Ok, so Jennifer Lopez could stand a few acting lessons. So what? You still saw the Matrix didnt you? Keanu Reaves aint exactly Carey Grant either. This movie emerses the audience in its ambience. The colors, the subtexts, and the movie-within-a-movie feel are what make this movie the neat flick it is. I dont think it was ever meant to be the next Wizard Of Oz. It was meant to simply entertain, maybe give some chills along the way, and it does just that. One reviewer must have spouted off every multi-syllable word he could think of to put the movie down. Hint to that person: This movie isnt supposed to be realistic! Its simply a visual feast for the eye. Hat's off to first time (well, first major movie) director Singh.

Just because there are some off the wall colors and sets, it doesn't make a movie \\"wierd\\", \\"scary\\", or, most of all, GOOD! What a joke. And all the reviewers calling this \\"gruesome\\". Huh? A movie that combines gruesome S&M visuals, good plot points, dialogue, acting, and story is Hellraiser or Hellraiser II. This is like Hollywoods glossing over of those flicks. The plot seems a bit similar to Hellraiser II (i.e. heroine gets lost in killers world, must find way out of bizarre landscape of macabre images).

Not even those who enjoy senseless entertainment will walk away happy. It commits the cardinal sin of trying to purchase an audience through hitting the right moralistic buttons. When you've got nothing else, get preachy. This film suggests pathological killers are the product of abusive, perversely religious fathers, and merit our sympathy. Yea right, the problem in our society is people take their religion too seriously. What world is Mr. Singh living in? Can't these post-mod lefty Hollywood sophists conger up a plot without taking a gratuitous stab at organized religion? The predictable plot, poor acting and vapid dialogue were difficult enough to take. But the sappy moralizing put the movie over the top.

Jennifer lopez is wonderful and the other characters are terrific in thier roles as well, this film is simply put a drama with suspense thrown in for good measure. The special f/x were considered highly over plot and story but that doesn't mean the film didn't work, in fact it worked wonderfully and if your reading this you should think about seeing The Cell purely for the satisfaction of experiencing Ms. Lopez's acting and great range of emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful vision of horror","review":"When this film was first released at the theatres and previous reviews of the film by critics I saw it and was amazed by the visuals and brutality of the film. To me it is one of the best films about a serial killer. Part sci-fi, part horror, part detective, and all amazing. Tarsem Sing is a great director but with only three major films under his belt I hope he directs more of this type. To me this is his masterpiece so far. This film is one of a kind visuallistically and a great one of a kind film. One of my favorite films of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Redefines Lame. Don't Waste Your Money.","review":"The trailers for this film are very short because they used every good clip there is in this movie. It could have been a great film, but they blew it. The plot is weak, poorly structured, clumsily advanced and horribly contrived. The character development is non-existent and if the characters were any flatter they would be invisible. The underlying imagery is derivative, with no apparent originality and owes more to high-end corporate advertising than any storytelling. Parts of the movie are so bad, they are hilarious, like where for some weird reason the art director cheaped out and used the body armor from Coppola's Bram Stroker's Dracula as the encounter suits... If there was a way to give a movie no stars, this one deserves it. This movie is not even worth renting, much less buying. In fact, it is sooo lame, it isn't even worth more comments..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ...","review":"You know, I cannot put it more bluntly than that. The storytelling was ridiculous, the acting (except for Vincent D'Nofrio and Vince Vaughn) was mediocre. The only reson I give it a two is for the special effects. I feel embarrased to have this movie on my shelves, and I would not recommend it to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!","review":"How many more movies must be made showing women the victim of a sexual deviant? How many more times does the excuse need to be given that the men that do this are victims in their childhood? How many more movies must be made about the physical abuse inflicted upon kids?After watching this movie, I felt violated. THIS MOVIE DID NOT NEED TO BE MADE. Sure it looks nice, but if you want a nice looking movie then get \\"What Dreams May Come.\\" Sure it has some action scenes, but if you want action then get the \\"Matrix.\\" Do not waste your time or money on this movie.

Don't think about this movie ,its waste for time and money also its a silly story ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surface, Surface, Surface","review":"I can not in good conscience even give this film good marks for being \\"visually stunning\\" as others have done before me. Just about everything that can be said has been said about the horrible plot so I won't bother restating any of it.But on the DVD (which I rented and still felt like I spent too much money on it) director Tarsem muses about how much the dream sequences were inspired by those of David Lynch. He talks about how real dreams are \\"visceral\\" and that they make intuitive sense to us precisely because they speak to us at such an unselfconscious level.Sorry Tarsem. If your intention was to get under our skin you failed. All the extremely self-conscious camera angles, elaborate lighting, and baroquely outlandish S&M costumes managed to do was to be so distracting that the dream sequences seemed hollow and bloodless. Very surface oriented film both from a plot standpoint and a visual standpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Music Video","review":"A very disappointing film. I am afraid that once again we are handed art direction and special effects instead of story and character developement. I really am begining to believe that there are no original ideas in Hollywood. Shades of Silence of the Lambs meets MTV with a pinch of Matrix thrown in. Just who told Jennifer Lopez she could act anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cell isn't even worth the time spent reviewing it","review":"This movie is terrible.

The story was dry and the plot was unfounded. However, in the cinematography catagory I would be a liar if I said that this flick was anything other than eye candy! For that I have to give UNO star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Bad - Bordering on Obscene","review":"Visual imagery doesn't mean a thing if the plot is predictable and the dialogue bad. To the \\"enlightened\\", we DO get it, that's the problem. If Van Gogh had painted a picture of a pile of dog poop, howerver visually stunning, it would still be a painting of dog poop. Our companions at the theater had to leave they were so sickened. Once again, lacking any quality, Hollywood goes for shock and gore."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS MOVIE . . .","review":"It's a horribly acted, underdeveloped story masked by some of the most interesting and charged visuals. Need I say more?Besides being pretty, Ms. Lopez has no redeeming qualities as an actress. She's a deadfish on screen with no depth beyond the layer of makeup she wears . . .And Vincent D'Onofrio, dressed in a miriad of shocking costumes, chewed any bit of scenery in his path. At one time, he was a wonderful actor but it seems he has moved into the John Malcovich school of acting: THE BIGGER THE BETTER. Where are the textured performance of the past?I'll give some credit to Vince Vaughn who attempted to breathe some life into his thinly written character (he was far better than what this movie deserved).Enough is enough . . . if you insist on watching this movie, turn off your brain. You're in for a less than wild, sporadic ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"She should have stayed a fly-girl...","review":"This movie may have had a chance to be good, not great but good..but to do that they would have had to hire a real actress...Jennifer turns in a completely flat performance...she's nice to look at but that's it...the rest of it was nice eye candy but as far as a \\"psychological thriller\\" it doesn't come close....this movie is definetely not in the same league as Altered States, Kiss the Girls and especially not Silence of the Lambs as some have likened it too...those movies will be remembered for a long time(Altered States already has been) but this drivel will be put on the back shelf within 6 months and be forgotten...and hopefully ex fly-girl Jennifer's acting will improve or she'll look for another occupation"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie minus the extras","review":"I was gambling that this dvd would have the extras on the non-blu ray disk i had.

Jennifer Lopez (Catharine Deane), outstanding visual effects, and Vincent D'Onofrio(Yes, that is Gomer Pyle from Full Metal Jacket as Carl Stargher). WOW! EYE CANDY!! The story line does have its lulls (If you've watched it five times like myself), but Vincent D'Onofrio's creepy performance makes up for it.

There was no point to it at all. You see, one night I was supposed to be going out with a bunch of mates but that fell through so we went to our second home (the video store) and we rented \\"Chopper\\" (which was a fantastically gritty film, 5 stars). We also rented \\"The Cell\\" since it looked cool and none of us got round to seeing it during its cinema release. We watched \\"Chopper\\" first and loved it, had a break, had some Chinese take-out, had some drinks, then we watched \\"The Cell\\"...and fell asleep! It was so boring! Nothing interesting really happened. We fast forwarded most of it cause it was \\"that bad\\". And every time the stupid, fat, murderer Carl guy changed into one of those weird Demon Carls he didn't look scary...he looked like Boy George!!! Also, Vince Vaughn is a pretty good actor so what was he doing in this piece of horse..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repellent and Distasteful","review":"\\"The Cell\\" is a disturbing film that is extremely violent and exploitive against women.The plot is minimal, the characters not developed, and the dialouge stilted and dull. Jennifer Lopez's talents clearly lie elsewhere, and Vaughn is mediocre as ever.The film is unnecesarily graphic and brutal, and has no humor whatsoever.The psychological aspects of this lurid trash are ludicrous, and apparently we are to believe that smiling excessively and meaningfully speaking the name of your client is the key to unlocking the secrets of the insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visuals a good movie do not make.","review":"While films are a visual medium, the look of a movie needs to be placed within a set context for it to be effective. The Cell does nothing of the sort. A friend and I sat laughing through most of it, jokingly putting forth stupid plot twists and inane, cliched dialog only to bust out into braying laughter when the movie actually did what we had been mercilessly ragging it for. Do not waste your time or money with this garbage, see The Silence of the Lambs instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Horrible movie.

The dark costumes and deep images help maintain the storyline. You would be a fool not to buy this dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"psychos, meat puppets and J-Lo!","review":"The Cell is a portrait of a twisted mind. The plot has a weak arc and it does not create a catharsis for the viewer - that is, the film does not suck the viewer into the story's world but instead crams the story's world down the viewers throat. Much of the screen time was spent just torturing the audience with twisted imagery rather than moving the story forward. About a half an hour of screen time is spent showcasing puppets made out of dead people and flashbacks of the killer's sadistic childhood memories of his father. After 10 minutes you get the point and you are just waiting for the film to move forward. Get on with it already! If I wanted a dose of mindless twisted imagery, I'd go to a high school and stare at the disturbing paintings and sculptures of restrained teengers suffering from raging hormones. If I could give it 0 stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this ...?","review":"Why does she keep doing stories taht have been done? This is a ...

And even then, there are better ways to torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesecake for my eyes...","review":"I hate Jennifer Lopez, and I really dislike Vince Vaughn, but even they couldn't mess up this visually stunning film. I didn't even need a story- I'd watch hours of the luscious Dali-esque landscapes, flowing ethereal fabric, and twisted Kevorkian-esque creations that make up this film. Plot-wise, it was reminiscent of Silence of the Lambs and serial killer movies in general, with the quintessential devoted cop and house raid scenes. But Vincent D'Onofrio was very good as the creepy villain \\"Carl\\". Also, the duel personality of the psycho serial killer was painted in such a way that you found yourself siding with him, then hating him, torn between your heart and head at times. A feeling achieved only better in that John Cusack film Identity. I would have liked to have grown more attached to the victim- I didn't really care about her at all, but could stomach her because at least she was smart. But like I said, in a film this palpably visual, you almost don't need a plot..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't that great, but it was pretty.","review":"I think 2 stars might be a little too harsh, but 3 stars was just too close to 5. This was a relatively decent movie, although some of the acting wasn't all that wonderful. It had some really great effects, and was visually pleasing, however the tone of the movie was pretty dark. It almost reminds me of the movie, \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" if you've ever seen it.There were some great parts (the horse scene!) but I would be leary of who I would recommend it to. The plot was ok too.

My opinion you can't go wrong purchasing a set of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to bad","review":"As never trying any hifonics products in the past I was skeptical of these speakers. I've owned alpine, infinity, clarion, top name brands in the past that everyone is familiar with. This time I decided to go a different route with my system, and for the price I paid for these I can't complain at all. The mids are a little lacking in punch but they definitely make up for it with the crisp clean highs. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good speaker at a great price. I am very happy with them and I am pushing them with a fosgate 75x2 rms amp. For the mids I've decided to install 8\\" subs in the doors. Don't get me wrong there not completely lacking but just not quite what I'm used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get What You Pay For","review":"Replaced stock speakers in my Silverado with these.

You'll have to go to your local Radioshack to buy a power line with a inline fuse to power the LED's and a rocker switch to turn on and off. The sound out of these is GREAT, you'll get awesome highs and nice bass. Although I have sub in the back and don't have much bass coming through the speakers if you don't have a sub youll still do great.

The thoughts of the main character,Lou Colfax,are overstretched and unintentionally humerous. I almost felt sorry for Knowles at one point in the book.

No mention of this error in the lengthy manual. Thought it might just be a firmware issue, so I checked the Panasonic web site. Downloaded a new firmware version, but when I powered the unit on it was not even able to display its on-screen menus, only a distorted, twisted display.

After enterring the channel, data, and time, the list would show \\"OK\\" or a date or most of the time \\"--\\". The \\"--\\"'s do not record, and there is no indication of why it is not \\"OK\\".The unit will not copy finalized DVD's to tape, even if it is your personal home movies.If you set up the DVD for progressive scan, the VCR output is doubled and cannot be used.I tried to call the tech support but got the run around and finally gave up.Stay away from this machine and this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I felt that it was not as comprehensive as it could have been.

Since this remote learns (via bottom IR port), I was able to program the few commands that were not recognized.I understand there will be problems with refurbished remotes, but you get the same warranty as a brand new one.

As other reviewers noted, they took more and more pressure/time to register until they stop responding altogether. That's pretty unacceptable in a $30 keyboard and outrageous in a $200 remote control.The software that came with the remote was a general PITA to use. It took me a half dozen hours to setup the remote; adding my devices, patching the software, teaching it some devices one button at a time, and then finally programming activities. Despite forum posts on the topic, it was never able to switch to the HDMI input on my television, so I was forced to change the tv input manually whenever I wanted to watch a DVD.Otherwise the remote has worked well.

I thought I'd save a few dollars by buying a refurbished unit to replace it. Bad idea. It took a while to figure out what the problem was, but a single button would send its command anytime the unit was simply picked up. It even happened sometimes when the remote was resting unused on a tabletop (!).

More importantly the charger stopped charging my remote. After a while the remote's charge was gone and a bunch of lines came up on the screen now my $90 remote is a paper weight.

My biggest issue with this remote was the fact that I could NOT access certain menus on my Sony Receiver. All of the advanced settings were a mystery. I was able to press the menu button, but unable to scroll up, down, left, or right. I phoned Logitech and all they could do was refer me to their department that wrote the remote codes. Useless.

When I click help and it takes me thru the on/off cycle repeatedly, eventually things work, but it's a giant pain and should not be this way. I've talked to other people ( at least 5!) who have had similar problems with their refurbished Harmony remotes. I had a new 520 that worked fine. Not so this refurb 880.

The 880 is much more stable than the 510 (Less flexible case) and has an easier to read screen. I like the button layout of the 880 and the overall shape of the case makes it very usable -- it is a peanut shape similar to the Tivo remote control. I like having a remote with a rechargeable battery and a charging base. I find that I can go the better part of a week before it requires an overnight recharge. The web browser based programming makes this simple as with other Harmony remotes. In my case, since I had already set up the older remote, I simply had to connect up the 880 and it picked up the devices and functions seamlessly. A few of the buttons directly under the display are a bit small and easy to miss, but overall this is a very nice remote.

I really liked the older model and found this a great deal for a newer device with a few more bells and whistles.The Harmony works as advertised but the software for setting up your system is, as always, clunky. It's not particularly intuitive and can be a long, involved process to set up even one device. I happen to have about 8 different setups and even then it's not quite right. (It doesn't like how my TV changes inputs and so misses the right input when switching to/from certain setups.)All in all, though - great bang for buck.

Programming was extremely easy. Anyone with a little bit of computer experience can figure it out. I've only encountered two drawbacks. 1. There is a slight delay with respect to the functionality of the remote (i.e. turning down the sound) upon initial startup of the TV. This is only an issue if the previous person had the sound turned up and you have kids you don't want to wake up at night. 2. Some of the controls from your remotes such as a DVD player might not be avaialable. I am not able to get one of the \\"menu\\" features to work yet. I'll be honest though, I haven't contacted the customer service on this yet.

I've been through 3, and Amazon has said \\"enough\\" ... no more replacements - the product has too high of a failure rate. When it works, it's the coolest thing on the planet, but these refurbs have just been quirky. They have repeatedly taken the programming (which is pretty easy and cool) and worked for a while (which is VERY cool), but inevitably, each has failed and had to be reprogrammed at least once in the 2 short months that I've owned them, and 1 just finally flat-out puked and wouldn't do anything (1 had to be returned because of the LCD screen and not quirkiness).

Some of the buttons are too flat such that you cannot locate and press a button by feel. I find that I need to look at the remote more than I should. This can be difficult in the dark.2. The exterior of the remote is too slippery and when operating the remote with one hand, the whole thing twists against the pressure of your finger. Your hand doesn't create enough friction against the remote for it not to slip and slide.3. Something about the configuration of the buttons on this remote makes it really easy to accidentally hit one of the macro buttons.

That's why the fact that the buttons on this remote just stop working after a short period of time (rendering the device useless) is incredible annoying. And the fact that Logitech won't stand behind its products, or the problem on future versions, is just offensive.It's too bad, because I really liked this remote while it was working.I will never buy a Logitech product with buttons until it has been on the market long enough for guinea pigs to determine the longevity of the buttons.If you don't believe me, search \\"Logitech Harmony buttons stop working.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not completely refurbished","review":"The performance of this unit to date has been sketchy.

It was still necessary to go to the television or use the TV remote to switch inputs to switch from TV or VCR to DVD. However, with this item it turns on all the correct equipment, switches to the correct inputs or settings, and then asks if everything is correct. Pushing the help button usually fixes any problems. The color display screen is small but adequate if your eyesight is good.On the negative side:There is limited ability to edit titles.The buttons are small and plastic, giving a relatively cheap overall appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Harmony 880 Remote Control - Refurbished","review":"The Harmony does everything I would like it to, plus more.

It controls every device in my arsenal without issue, and updating via USB is a snap.My only gripe with it is the inability to set quick buttons for XM channels. My XM device tied in with my stereo works well with the remote, but I can't set a picture and 1 click option to head right to the channel I desire. It seems this function is only available for TV channels.Aside from that, the Harmony does everything I need it to do, plus more. The functionality and intelligence of the device makes me a believer.

Now we just have the one. I tried an inexpensive universal remote that did not even come close. Set up was not difficult. The huge online database did the job. This is the first time any remote has recognized our Onkyo receiver. I really like the \\"Help\\" function. When functions get out of sync (TV off with Cable Box and Receiver on}, \\"Help\\" steps the user through getting them back on the same cycle. After a lot of research, the Harmony 880 appeared to offer the best value of functionality, cost and ease of use.

Personally I think the product is great and the problems my parents had should really not reflect too harshly on it.While everyone has told me it is easy to set-up, my folks still had problems. Their cable box is a Motorola and was listed under a different category than they were orginally looking at so it was an easy fix once I looked at it.

I customized the controls to include the functions I want where I want them. Every one of my components had complete menus download from the Logitech remote programming system. From there, I was able to customize each item's control however I want. There has been no problem (in four months) of the remote losing its programming or being unable to recharge properly (i think those bugs might be fixed now). Only problem I have with it is that the buttons to the side of the display are too small. That doesn't even drop the review to four stars, though, as in every other way this thing has exceeded my expectations. One thing I will say, though, is that full price is WAY to high. Get a refurb like I did, which is a still-pricey 60-70% less than full price. This thing is not cheap no matter which way you look at it, but OH BOY is it great to have. I've retired all the other remotes (5 of them) to a cabinet under the TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but a little hard to operate by feel","review":"I just upgraded from a Harmony 659.

Customer service doesn't know much about the product they sell. Not good!

This band has frequently shifting guitar melodies, and driving, but not abrasive, drum beats.I'd say that as a very early band, these songs are stripped of almost everything except their emotional power. The singer's voice is sometimes sung, and sometimes a powerfully frantic wail. Often times he speaks instead of singing which, I think, gives the album a feel of a poetry reading, especially since the lyrics are based so much on personal feeling. This cd also contains the epic song \\"Tangled\\" which goes through various tempo/mood changes in its six minutes. It's probably also one of the most dramatic songs I've heard to date. All in all, the majority of these songs are examples of fine writing, and the listener feels exactly what the band wants them to feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential \\"Emo\\"","review":"This CD, along with \\"End on End\\" by Rites of Spring and \\"Analphabetapolothology\\" by Cap'n Jazz, composes what I like to call the Holy Trinity of Emo.Native Nod best exemplifies the genre during it's middle period. Arpeggiated guitars, shifting tempos and dynamics, driving rhythms, and frantic vocals. You couldn't ask for more.Standouts include \\"Bread\\", \\"High Tide in Alaska\\", \\"Tangled\\" (If you listen closely during the break, you can hear lead singer Chris Leo verge on tears), and \\"Lower GI Bleed\\".The only thing that prevents this from earning a perfect score are the tracks \\"Mr. President\\" and \\"Runner\\".

It covers the essentials and will help you become a better trader. A lot of the information is not duplicated elsewhere.

Not Worth Your Money!!!","review":"Very unprofessional DVD!!!! When I first saw the item, I thought there was a mistake, and I accidentally ordered a compilation CD, because the DVD is in a CD case. I was so disappointed, at the picture and sound quality!!!! It looked as if someone taped it from different sources (TV, Rhino Compilation VHS, etc.), and edited them, but in such a lousy way!!!! Many video's are cut in the end. The sequence is also horrible!!! Whenever you skip to go to another track you get half of the video from the previous track you skipped!!!! I am so certain I would have done such a better job taping the music video's from TV (i.e., VH1 Classics), editing them, and making them look more professional than this garbage!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"I didn't find this book helpful at all. The author talks of general prinicples and things like always having fresh flowers on the dinner table. Nice, but not everyone can afford to do this. Nowhere does she give any real information about how to implement her principles, which is my pet peeve about these kinds of books. That's nice that these things are generally outlined, but what next? There has to be a happy medium between of \\"high ideals outline\\" and \\"how-to\\", this book never gets close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"Please save your sanity and money. I have a high tolerance for loud toys, repetitive sounds, etc., etc. BUT this game has tested my patience. The game is not fun for my daughter and thus offers no educational value. She does enjoy the bus and the music it plays over and over and over. We had to give this game away. There are so many other games that are more fun for your child and offer more family fun...most of which cost a fraction of the price of Wheels on the Bus. I suggest Hi-Ho-Cherry-O."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother....","review":"This game was a waste of time.

My 6 year old daughter became very frustrated because there wasn't enough room the move the bus on the board and she also wanted to know what the \\"little people\\" were supposed to do. She was trying to make the game seem fun for her little brother (3) but suddenly stopped in the middle of the game and said it didn't make sense to her. I felt the same way when I played. The objective to the game is not clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"From the commercial, we thought that was going to be a fun game that was based on the song that my 2.5yr old daughter loved so much. I have to say that not even she enjoys playing it! All the game involves is pushing the bus from player to player, while playing a \\"memory type\\" matching game. Get Memory instead, serves the same purpose but a lot more fun and no ANNOYING music! The only reedeming quality of this game for us was that my 9 month old enjoyed zooming the bus around on the carpet.As for the batteries issue, we are still on the first set of batteries 4 months later, but I think we have only played it about 4 times total."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first or second board game","review":"My almost 3 year old loves this game. We play it at night before bed according to the 'simple play' rules in the instruction manual. He thinks it's great and gets so excited to sing the song at the end of the game. I think it's a great first or second board game. It teaches taking turns and being a good sport about winning. As compared with some other board games, Candyland is too long for him to sit thru. Before this we started with Lucky Ducks which is also a fantastic first board game.I almost returned it after seeing some of the reviews on Amazon, so glad that we didn't"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Game","review":"I cannot believe you'all, where is your inner child at?? Yes I wish the bus had a on off switch but other than that my almost 3 yr old loves this game and no she is not just interested in the bus. If you read the instructions it says to roll it on the floor, it also says to sing the song and do the motions. The song is not that annoying it's a childs song and it's a childs game. I can't believe some people won't play this game with their child because of the bus being annoying, play for your kids not you."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY ANNOYING","review":"This game is very annoying.

A much better game and quieter!!!","review":"This game is just a scaled down version of memory with bad sound effects. The bus goes off singing at the slightest provocation and it is loud!!!

You'll get more use out of your game, save some money, and your ears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for weak nerves","review":"In a word: annoying. Although benign enough for small kids, the insessant electronic \\"Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round\\" song is too irritating to endure.

It is so annoying! The music on the school bus is so loud and there is no on/off switch. When we put it up and something bumps it, it goes off with the music. I finally just took the batteries off. My son played with it a little and now he is tired of it. I would save your money and buy a better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and irritating!","review":"The bus is extremely difficult to turn off. My 2-year-old likes its non-stop singing of \\"The Wheels on the Bus,\\" but it irritates the rest of the family. The board game itself quickly bored even my 2-year-old, leaving us with the bus itself as a play toy that everyone in the family except my 2-year-old wants to throw away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price of Glory DVD","review":"Excellent Chicano Studies movie. It shows the struggle of the Hispanic American in the US. It also shows discrimination towards Mexican American minorities. This movie is about a boxer trying to make it to the top of his sport.

The key is that all parties to the proceedings (leader John Handy, alto sax; Pndit Prakash Maharaj, tabla; Vikash Haharaj, sarod; Gunther Paust, tanpura; and David Friesen, Oregon bass) have wide experience in both East Indian and jazz stylings. Thus, they have no trouble combining the sensibilities of these related but quite different musics and coming up with, not just a patched together tapestry, but a genuinely new-sounding soundscape that both retains and expands the best of each sensibility while at the same time staking out virgin territory. ****1/2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video CD recording of studio performance","review":"This is not a DVD.

They really should have thought up a new name as well. This is not Mott the Hoople. Shortening the band's name to simply Mott, the new group was a group without a soul. Mindless boogie excursions were not the forte of Mott the Hoople; there was always more to their manic music than that. Here are a collection of mind-numbing, cliche-ridden numbers, written by Overend Watts primarily, and he's no Ian Hunter.

To get the full value of this great book, you really have to read, or at least skim, all of it. But, if you do, you'll know enough to start building all kinds of things that would be hard or impossible without a router. And, unlike many of the how-to woodworking books I've read, Spielman doesn't seem to have any quirky personal interests that dominate the text. This book is written well, covers the right ground, has good illustrations, and goes just a bit beyond basics to let you know what's waiting when you've mastered the first set of skills you'll need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This might be the least useful book I have ever purchased on any subject. While there is a heavy emphasis on router hardware, the book has a 1993 copywright and most of the referenced hardware is no longer in production; and of course, current hardware is not mentioned. For information on jigs, there are far better sources which include plans and specs for actually building the jig--see the Nov. 2004 issue of Wood magazine, for example. And the author stops short of providing sufficient information to actually accomplish a task, such as making dovetail joints. I've gone through the book from front to back, and back to the front again, and have yet to find anything of value beyond a few insignificant tidbits. A more useful and up to date book is \\"Router Joinery Woorkshop\\" by Carol Reed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for beginner or advanced","review":"Bought this book yesterday and have already read 1/2 way through.

However, the book does not convey that knowledge in a way that is easy to make use of for a novice like me. I did not find it easier to select a router after reading the book and I do not think I will be referring to it much once I have purchased my router.As I read the book, I found myself looking forward to the next section, where I would hopefully find step-by-step instructions, with photos or illustrations, on how to accomplish a particular task.

All the functions I wanted, at very reasonable price. Unit smaller than expected (good), but still easy to read (without my usual plus 2 readers).

I've only used mine a few times, but I have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely acceptable","review":"I bought this unit because I wanted a temperature read out, and I didn't want to spend a bundle for a wireless cyclometer -- I found no other choices meeting these requirements. I think this bike computer has some serious drawbacks. 1. Don't get caught out in the rain. When the computer gets wet, the display disappears, it stops working and doesn't return to normal for hours. 2. To switch between screens you press the unit from the bottom, but if held for a second, this zeros out the current ride data. I found the computer sometimes zeroed out the data, when I only wanted to switch screens -- most annoying. 3. After about a year the display faded, and after I put in a new battery, many of the segments in the numerals never recovered properly and remained dim.If, like me, you want temperature information on your rides it appears this the best available at the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use with good information","review":"I really like the speed comparator function of this computer. I've found that I always try to keep my speed above my average speed which has significantly increased how fast I ride.The installation was easy, though I had to read the instructions twice to figure out how to set the wheel circumference. I didn't have any problem getting the magnet to work and the included shims fit my handlebars perfectly.The display shows a lot of information and what isn't shown can be accessed very easily by simply pressing on the unit. As other reviews have mentioned, there is no backlight, so you can't use it in the dark, but it is very easy to read in any other lighting condition I've tried.The only complaint that I have is that the average and max speed functions are ride data which means that they get zeroed out when you reset the computer.

I really like the way that the computer stops everything when I stop and retains all info until I reset it but the clock continues to display.

Some say the thermometer is not accurate. Duh. If your are in direct sunlight it won't be. The only things I don't like are: 1) it seems to reset the trip odometer if you stop for fifteen to twenty minutes (ex: long stop on a century ride). Not sure why. 2) it sometimes jiggles loose from the mounting. I dropped it once while going over rough pavement. Fortunately I turned around, picked it up and shoved it back on the mount and it worked fine. 3) can't figure out how to mount it to my handlebar stem instead of the bar. Other manufacturers give the option to mount the speedometer out of the way on the stem.Would I buy it again or recommend it to a friend.

It mounted easily (Cannondale M800 stock handlebar) and came with several rubber pieces of varying thickness to allow for a snug fit. The wire has plenty of length and the sensor mounted easily to both the fork and the wheel spoke. The information on the screen is very easy to read and I have not had any glare issues. I like that it displays temperature. It is easy to put the computer on and take it off and it fits very snugly. Pushing the computer forward a little bit toggles the display between the different screens - great concept since there is no fumbling for buttons and it is easy with gloves on. I only have one bike right now, but since I used to own two I like that it has settings for two different tire sizes and maintains odometers for each.

When I got off of work, I checked it and was working great! I had bike tire issues (note to self, don't air up the tires to the maximum p.s.i that is on the tire) so I haven't really gotten to test it out much. One tip is you push it from the bottom to the top to reset it. I was trying to push down and then up at first and couldn't figure out why it wasn't changing. To reset it, just keep pushing until completely 0's out. I don't think it was very hard to install on my mountain bike.

The temperature is reasonably accurate in the shade. I have never seen a thermometer that didn't read high in direct sunlight.You have to hold the button for 2 seconds before the data is zeroed out.

I have had this since 2007 and it is still going on its original battery!

Not that I wouldn't of bought it anyway, since I like having all the tapes, but I could of asked for it for my birthday, I suppose, instead of going out and spending $ on it myself! *Bangs head on table* So, if you like Sorcerer Hunters a smuch as me go ahead and buy it, just BEWARE, it's NOT their best performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff.

Ethan Hawke succeeds in making an urban atmosphere in which that is not necessary. The only modern (after 1945) authors who made me feel like that were J.D. Salinger, Jack Kerouac, James Baldwin, Chaim Potok, John Irving and Tom Wolfe. Don't get cynical, I am not saying Hawke is as good as them. To be fair: I read the book because I know him as an actor. That's why I was interested and I was like \\"Let's see if he can do this, too\\". The book is a small pearl. Like Uhlman's 'Reunion' the story doesn't need much action and explanation, since Hawke succeeds in explaining feelings and happenings in a decent and sober way. Hawke doesn't need pretentious big words, big action or bearded jokes to make his point. It's never grotesque. Some authors could use this book as an example. I truly hope Hawke will have the time to write more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was skeptical as I started reading, but it surprised me...","review":"I must admit, I'm a fan of Ethan's acting. I bought this book just cause I was curious. Yeah yeah, he probably just got the book deal right? Well, much to my delight - this is an excellent book. I normally can't stand to read at all. I couldn't put this book down, to the point I ended up staying up all night reading it. Finished within the day.. Recommended, definately.

I would go so far to say that this is the worst book ever published, but it's pretty bad. The book is plotless and riddled with clichés. There isn't a doubt in my mind that this book would not be published if it wasn't written by \\"movie star\\" Ethan Hawke.(...)Worse still is his character Sarah, who is more two-dimensional than the page Hawke's words are printed on. Women can either be good little domestic angels or evil temptresses like Sarah in this book. It's downright heartbreaking to see that Victorian views of women still flourish."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do u want me to say? It's a great book!","review":"I like it a lot.

All William does is sit around and break household appliances.

This is my first published novel.\\" The plot of pretentious know-it-all narrator meets and falls for annoying-shallowly-written girl will be familiar to anyone whose ever taken a freshman creative writing course. At last estimate, there are about 20,000 aspiring writers out there so in all probability, there are indeed worst books than this. However, most of those books don't get published because most of those authors haven't appeared on the cover of Premiere. As I read this book, all I could think about were all the aspiring writers out there who don't have the luxury of getting their first drafts published."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie.","review":"The editorial review and the publishers weekley review are very poorly made. Publishers w. talks about when william returns from Paris, when its Mexico. Did they see the movie? I don't think so.The story is very human and sincere, there is very good music.

It will entertain you the whole way through even if it seems to be a rather stagnant life that William lives.

And if you liked Reality Bites, then this book is also for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real!!!","review":"The only credit that this book might be able to mustre up from me is the fact that one individual living in Hollywood has proved he is actually literate! The plotline is slow and has no substance. I am throughoughly sick of these GEN X plotlines which consist solely of brooding and moaping. Once again the publisher of America have insulted us in thinking that simply because you place an actor's name on the cover of a book that we will be dully impressed. This book was aimed towards the general public but is only suitable for the teeny-bobbers of our society, who probably are accountable for the majority of its sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is delicious","review":"this is one of my fave books! i just love the way he writes. at first, of course, i was skeptical of an actor/writer, but art is art. and this book is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air!","review":"I wish I had found a book like the Hottest State when I felt 'dowdy', 'overweight' and generally full of imperfections like Hawke's main character, Sarah, is described. How endearing it is to see a young American male considered a sex symbol profess such unwavering love and admiration for a 'real woman' who does not give in to society's demands. I believe this is the first time in my life I've encountered a book where the taut, T&A babe loses to anyone less physically perfect. Who could not adore this author? I want dozens more books of this sort with real characters I can relate to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"uh oh","review":"Noted novelist and essayist Gore Vidal was given a sizable role in the Ethan Hawke movie GATTACA, so I suppose it's only fair to let an actor try his hand at writing a novel. But, good God, don't expect me to like it. I mean, it's not as if Ethan Hawke has a rich literary background like a lot of actors such as Peter O'Toole and the self-educated Jack Nicholson (Lord knows, O'Toole's autobiography shows writing talent). If they wrote novels, they might be worth something. But, Holy Mohican, Ethan Hawke? He can barely act, much less write!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so dissapointed...","review":"I rushed and ordered this book after seeing Actor Ethan Hawke on \\"In The Actor's Studio\\" with James Lipton on \\"Bravo\\". I enjoy watching Ethan in movies but his writing style is not to my taste. The phrases were short and plain. The author assumes that we should know why the characters do what they do...They get on a plane to Paris and spend most of their time in a Hotel...he is suppose to be shooting a movie there, yet it is never mentioned. The girl leaves him and the reader doesn't have a clear reason why? the charactors are stereo typed... I mean the starving artists in NYC story has been done many times before. I think his editor could have done a better job! the book was flat...the words too simple not creative at all...and when I was done, I was not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"welcome to life kiddies","review":"Hawke accuately captures the emotions we go though when we are just gaining our independence from our parents and experimenting in serious romantic relationships. He doesn't cut the embarrassing elements from the main character, but still manages to allow the reader to root for them. And he avoid the cliche ending, but rather give us a real ending. He just shows us that a non-Hollywood ending is ok. I was surprised by how good a book this was, and actually read it again recently after many years and still found it enjoyable. His second book was a disappointment, but based on The Hottest State I'd probably give other works of his a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great!!!","review":"Like many people, I didn't expect much because he's, y'know, an actor, but I read the first page and liked it, and then...wow, it's actually a very deep, quirky, well-written novel that clearly took thought, work and talent - and it's not pretentious. It's a good post-college novel just like Benjamin Kunkel's highly-praised ouevre. If Hawke wasn't an actor, he might be getting the same kind of literary attention Kunkel got. Anyway, he obviously doesn't need the literary success, but this book moves swiftly, has wonderful description, and is a great New York gen-x love story for all ages to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethan Hawkes, The Hottest State lacked any real insight.","review":"This story was dissapointing but to be expected from a first time author. A friend recommended this book to me but I failed to see the emotion and the passion I was hoping it would include. I thought that the characters were shallow. The author could have made a much better story it the characters could have been explored deeper in order to make their actions more understood. It was a sketchy story with a very basic plot. (boy meets girl, boy falls in love, girl dumps boy, boy sulks). The story was too simple for me and too cliche to hold my interest. The only thing Ethan has going for him is that this is his first novel and he can only get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing spectacular, but a good read","review":"wel, what can i say? i read this book in the course of 3 hours, in a lawn chair in my backyard. while it can not be heralded as a literary gem or anything, it is a cute story, and helpful to read if your heart has been recently broken. thanks ethan, for letting me forget about my own problems, at least for a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"An addictive read....very passionate and emotional","review":"I read \\"The Hottest State\\" in one day!

Ballads are harder than anything else in jazz. The slow tempi and complex chords leave the soloist with little to hide behind, and require the greatest sensitivity and taste to approach correctly. Getz was one of the masters of this elusive and sadly, overlooked facet of jazz music. The performances here; esp. People Time, Soul Eyes, I Remember Clifford and Song for Ruth, can be compared to Cannonball Adderley's Star's Fell Over Alabama, or Miles Davis' Blue in Green and Flamenco Sketches in terms of their artistic beauty and perfection.

Currently I am off all medications, save one, and the problem is so much better, though it still exists to some extent, but NOT like it was. I feel the puffiness has receded due to the cessation of the medications ,but your product could have had some input, also. Hard to rate when you have more than one variable. I used other products, far more expensive, that did nothing. It is too bad a different terminology isn't used, versus, I hate it. That seems so harsh. I still have the product and even used some today. I feel badly that under the first star it says that I hate it. In fact, I don't. When off this medication, if ever, I may even order more, so it is hard to use the \\"star\\" rating. It may work very well with routine puffiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"just another .99 cent cream","review":"I used this for over 2 months and saw no changes in my dark under eye circles. I know it's hereditary and there is probably no cream in the world that can change that so i blame myself for even thinking a cream could work."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this stuff","review":"I have had very dark circles since I was a child. I was always embarrassed about the way I looked. I have been using this product for over 2 yrs now and it has been a Godsend. It hasn't gotten rid of them totally, but enough where I'm not mortified if I have to leave the house w/o concealer. I still do use concealer, but much less than before. I don't understand why it doesn't work for some people. Must be luck of the draw. I think it took a good 2-3 months to start working for me. I do wish they sold it in stores though."},{"rating":"2","title":"EyeByten.","review":"Originally a good product; since making this purchase I haven't seen the same results yet.

After reading mixed reviews, I decided to, but while it works great as a moisturizer, it doesn't remove any puffiness or darkness under the eyes. I used as directed, morning and eve and after showering, for about a month now, and no real results. It goes on great, feels great, wonderful texture and goes on well under makeup, but then so does my other products. I really wanted something to help diminish the darkness forming under my eyes with age, and this doesn't help. I'll use the rest of the product for moisturizing, but I am disappointed in the product's other claims. I am beginning to wonder if anything out there with a reasonable price works at all. Does anyone know anything that does?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does it help?","review":"I did not notice an improvement with this product. I have been using it as per directions, I guess I am just one of those people that this product will not help. Yes, I am disappointed, but Eyebryten may work for somebody else. I would not discount the manufacturer claims...I just may have a genetic trend that does not respond to this treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under eye dark circles","review":"Under Eye Bryten was not as good as I had expected it to be - quite disappointing in fact! It did very little to reduce eye puffiness and no change to dark circles has been witnessed, however I am not certain this product was produced for black skin so that could be the reason why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work.","review":"Plain and simple...it did nothing. I have tried many other dark circle eye creams that state \\"amazing results\\".Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OOh! So much better!","review":"I have been plagued with dark under eye circles since high school. The only thing that really made a difference was TATTOO CONCEALER - the ultra-high pigment concealer that covers up tattoos. After about a month of using Under Eye Bryten, they're fading! Significantly! Probably 2/3s better. I now use just a light, water-based foundation to cover the remaining circles. I'm a fan. No other eye cream has ever given me visible results before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under EyeBryten Severe Dark Circles and Under-Eye Puffiness Formula, 1 oz (30 ml)","review":"Did not work for me that much. Puffiness did go away significantly, maybe just a little, that is all. Dark circles are still there after using the product for almost a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical but be Forewarned","review":"There are two versions of this movie, one rated and one unrated. For children and the young at heart the rated version is a sweet fairy tale, with the charming and and singularly gorgeous Ami Dolenz at the story's center. She is a well-meaning but not so good genie who is on her last chance to help a hapless human. He is rather a simpleton, wanting to use her powers to help him land his fantasy girl, a self-absored TV advertising model. But causing a person to fall in love is the one power genies cannot provide. Along the way, our genie falls in love with the goofy but earnest young man. And he, at last, finally realizes this, providing the classic happy ending. BUT BE FOREWARNED, the unrated version adds numerous gratuitous scenes of topless and g-string babes, turning the film into yet another of that genre and definitely not for those under 18 even with parents present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"I first saw this movie when I was in high school. I remember it being better than it was. The bright spot throughout this movie is Ami Dolenz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I just wanted to say that I hope you guys make this movie on DVD. Or at least make more on VHS. I love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some B-movies just have that special something.","review":"And that something is Ami Dolenz. This is a charming movie about a guy who is down on his luck and was never that cool to begin with... who gets blessed with a sweet and beautiful gift... funny, charming, and the ending is absolutely perfect... I wish for a girl like Ami (or \\"Jeanie\\" as it were) every day of my life... tough to find in suburban Pennsylvania. One of my all-time favorite films, and if you're reading this... yours, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a good workout for me","review":"This workout was actually fun. The time flew by. I'm old and lazy, so if I can get motivation from this, any one can.If you're young, fit, and very active, I wouldn't bother because this workout will be a piece of cake. It's not going to get you ready to lower your time in the next triathlon.On the other hand, if you are ready to move beyond walking your dog, taking leisurely bike rides, playing a little tennis, and pumping some iron in your basement a few times a week, this will take your fitness level up a couple of notches, guaranteed. Not bad at all for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service!","review":"I received the DVD in a few days. The service was quick and the product was in perfect condition.I can't personally rate the DVD because it was a gift. However, my friend says it's a great total body workout and GSP really pushes you to do your best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze...","review":"I thought this was boring and not too challenging. I was surprised it wasn't more difficult. I expected to be sweating buckets. I found it slow and almost annoying. I think what was annoying was the trainer kept talking and fast. I felt like he would make an excellent sales person. John St. Pierre was not too motivating and appeared to struggle with some moves that I found not too complicated. He was also quite negative. The trainer kept asking him how an excercise was for him and he repeatedly said terrible. It's not a workout dvd that I plan on using again in the near future. Although, maybe for a change every two to three months I might toss it in the dvd player. I will probably quickly realize why it has dust on it after a few minutes into the workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall workout","review":"This is actually a pretty good workout... good core and explosiveness training, i tend to do it on off days from regular weight lifing to get a good full body training session. i would highly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in home work out","review":"Good in home work out with GSP. Gets your heart pumping and you in shape. Great item for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous skin product","review":"This skin cream is wonderful! I have very dry skin on my hands and around my nails. Cetaphil Therapeutic Hand Cream is the best cream I've found to solve this problem, and I've tried dozens of different products. My dermatologist highly recommended Cetaphil and I'm very satisfied with the results I've had. Although I can't find it in the retail stores in the area where I live, I can order it online easily and quickly and even get free shipping!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"Watched this DVD with great interest having a bit of knowledge of the old story it was based on. I know it is an old movie and Greeks had a great pride in their conquests but for this movie, it's better with the Greeks left out of it and don't bother buying this movie. I would rate it as less than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as listed","review":"Beware. This album is a later release from the National Lampoon and does not feature Belushi, Chase or Chris Guest. The comic artists are unknowns. You may still find it funny. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book disgusted me.","review":"I cannot say enough bad things about this book. It is disgusting, and I hated both of the characters. The heroine is a weak-minded fool who falls in love with her rapist, and the hero IS her rapist. And no, the time and the era does NOT justify what he did to her. The definition of rape is when one of the partners is unwilling - and I can remember Heather very clearly protesting. And when she becomes pregnant, Brandon actually has the gall to be upset with her. And not only that, but after they are married and Heather is too traumatized to make love due to her horrible first sexual encounter, Brandon tells himself that he will have her anyway - even if it comes to rape. So there you have it. The man is a rapist and a disgusting person in general. Certainly not a guy to fall in love with, or even like."},{"rating":"1","title":"counselor in CA","review":"This is one of the worst romances I've read. I could only read about 50 pages. Brandon rapes her ( a few times) and she's supposed to fall in love with him. After she tells him she's not a streetwalker (after the intial rape scene), he tells her he will make her his mistress againest her will. This man has no morals, conscience, or any redeming qualities that I could see. Women DO NOT fall in love with men who rape them and treat them so poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad it Borders on Criminal","review":"Ditto what other reviewers wrote about how horrible this book is. For those reviewers who liked this book, most cite the time period in which the book was written, the 1970s, as justifying it. It's like, \\"Oh, they liked bodice-rippers back then.\\" Maybe it's just me, but I don't get it. Are they saying that repeated rape was not only ok buy desirable in the 70s? (We're not talking seduction, but forcible, brutal rape over and over.) I was so turned off by this behavior on the part of the \\"hero\\" I was sickened. But the heroine falls in love with him?! How may women whose first introduction to sex was forcible rape suddenly fall in love with and sexually desire the rapist? I don't know how this author could conceive and pass off such horror as romance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"This book was, in a word, horrible. I had heard really great things about it--that it was a classic, one of the best romances ever written. It's not. This book is really about abuse of a woman by a man. I could buy that as a premise for a romance, maybe, if something changes by the end. Maybe if there was some character development. But the only thing that happens is that the heroine and hero somehow discover that they love each other. He still treats her badly and apparently she is able to overlook that. He never feels the least bit remorseful or ever realizes that his poor and abusive treatment of his wife is wrong. And for the life of me, I can't figure out why he loves her either, because she's so boring and blah. Stay away from this book. It's worse than just bad. I came away from it with the negative, vaguely queasy feeling that I had somehow contributed to the degradation of women just by reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Brandon is an angry, selfish, almost abusive man for much of the book. Heather is not just naive, she's cowardly and foolish. By the end of the book, I liked them okay, but it took a very long time, and they'll never be anything close to my favorite characters.The multiple rapes at the beginning of the book just got the whole thing off on the wrong foot. Even 2/3 of the way through the book, Brandon had few qualms about possibly repeating the act. And Heather, by the time the villain showed up, should have trusted Brandon to protect, but oh, no. And the reader is never convinved of her reasoning.The book is too long, the dialogue often ridiculously flowery, and the exposition generally a drag on the movement of the plot. In a way, I'd like to read the sequel, That Elusive Flame, but I'm not sure I can handle it. This book has its moments, but I find the writing to be very uneven. It's just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape is Romantic?","review":"Rape is rape no matter how you put it, whether it be wrapped up in a gorgeous wealthy sea captain or in gutter swine. I read this book because it is considered to be such a classic in romance. I don't get it. I felt nothing but sorry for Heather the entire book and hated Brandon. The ending was awful when they laugh about how it all ended well even if it started with a rape. Since when did rape become romantic? This book was not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is what started it all","review":"i read this book in seventh grade and would reread it all through middle and high school. along the way, i lost my infatuation with romance novels. just rediscovered this on my kindle and still, 30 plus years later, could not put it down. i loved this novel for the character development and the way the romance built with time.i am unsure why the initial sequence of events bothers so many women. the author clearly implies that it was a mistake and misunderstanding on both character's parts. you never get a sense beyond those initial scenes that brandon is anything less than honourable.i look at this book as escapist fiction and beautifully written escapist fiction, at that.one of my all time favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious to say the least","review":"Wow this book was a drag to read. The characters barley spoke to each other. No witty banter, hardly any conversation at all. Absolutely no chemistry...I skimmed most the book b/c it was so boring. Never reading another book from this author"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is on my top ten list!","review":"Brandon and Heather's story kept me turning the pages. I recommend this book to anyone. I still read this book all the time. Brandon's brother's story is just as good. His brother's story is in the book Three Weddings and a Kiss and the continuation of his story is in the book Married at Midnight. All her books are great."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dissapointed","review":"Usually, I am not a picky reader, but this book was unbearable. The forced dialogue, the language, and the imagery made it impossible to connect with the characters. Woodwiss, instead of using \\"naught\\" to mean nothing, decided to use it to mean \\"not\\". This, among other things, made me put down the book without finishing it. I could not bring myself to waste anymore time reading its useless, shallow text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time period is no excuse . . .","review":"for being a rapist. The hero is so uncaring, so cruel, so downright evil that this novel falls firmly in the \\"Did Not Finish\\" category for me. You tell me he's redeemed at the end? I'd rather see him drawn and quartered. Heather should kill the bastard in his sleep--now THAT would be a happy ending. He \\"stole\\" her virginity, so he \\"pays\\" for it by marrying her, so now they're even? Oh goody, her reward for being raped is having the privilege of being his property for as long as they both shall live. At least whores can choose their johns. This isn't a romance, it's horror. Thank heavens that romances aren't (for the most part) like this anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"What is the matter with you people? Does no one understand what rape is? I was thinking of reading this book, but I am appalled at how women are blowing off \\"the rape scene.\\" Is no one else a survivor, or known a survivor? Every romance book I've read has had at least one rape or implied rape, and I am about to write off this genre, even though I love steamy hot consensual sex scenes! No Flame and Flower for me, thank you very much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Outdated","review":"Maybe people liked this stodgy kind of writing in the early 70's, but it doesn't age well at all. Woodiwiss' prose is a perversion of the English language. This book is shallow, but the main characters are even more shallow. I couldn't see what redeeming qualities the characters had that would merit them a happy ending. Don't believe the hype. This is romance from an era, not literature for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow O__o","review":"Read in 2005:It was a page turner, but not in a good way. I wanted to see just how more jaw-droppingly offensive it could get. Still, I kept in mind that it was Exhibit A of the old skool bodice-ripper genre with a dirtbag Alpha Male hero & a Too Stupid To Live doormat heroine. It was...interesting. I'll give it that. But not arousing or romantic in the slightest.However, I was laid up in bed with massive back pain and the agony was transferred to the eyes & brain while reading it, so it was beneficial in a way.ETA 2/22/10: This was my first reacquaintance with the true bodice-ripping genre in quite a few years. I have since read more in the last couple months and found them very enjoyable, if not superior to many modern romances. TF&TF; is going back on the TBR and I'm sure that my opinion will change. So no negative votes, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Romance Novel!","review":"This was the first romance novel I read long ago and I still believe it to be one of Kathleen Woodiwiss' bests. I even named my 2nd son Brandon after the main male character - I love this book! Was shipped quickly - would recommend seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Woodiwiss!","review":"I bought this book when it first came out. I LOVE it and have re-read it many times. Brandon is no rapist, he was inebriated and believed George had brought him a \\"woman of the streets\\". Heather may be cowardly but she is actually very strong - the type that endures no matter the circumstances they are in. She escapted from Brandon the first chance she had, back to Aunt Fanny & Uncle John. I wanted to take a switch to Aunt Fanny and Uncle John for treating Heather like they did. It's fun to watch Brandon & Heather falling in love even when they don't recognize it, until after the baby is born. All the loose ends are tied up - Louisa, Mr. Hint - so Brandon & Heather's love story can continue. A wonderful read. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A groundbreaker!","review":"KEW's first book, The Flame & The Flower was a groundbreaker in terms of the historical romance genre. It is set between England and Charleston, South Carolina. Heather is not the strongest KEW heroine, but neither is she the weakest. Brandon is one of KEW's more hard-hearted heroes, but he comes around as love thaws the confirmed bachelor's iciness. If you like this, be sure to read The Elusive Flame for more Birmingham drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Romance Novel Read.","review":"I frist read this book when I was seventeen, and I hated to read any thing much less a book. I quickly devoured the book and wanted more. Over the last 29 years I've read this book about ten times and every time I finished it I didn't want it to end. Some how I lost my old copy and came Amazon to see if I could find it for sail. Much to my surprise it was, and not only that but I found out Ms. Woodwiss had written a seaqual to this book. I'm hopping it will live up to my expetations and I will want to go back to read it again and again. As I have this book, and I'm sure that this won't be my last visit to The Flame and The Flower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"I was absolutely taken away with _The Flame and the Flower_! I was so intrigued by her specific detail of the characters. Also, with romance, mystery, and murder combined into one novel, what more could one ask for? Page turing, heart warming, and truly unforgettable! I wanted, so desperately, for the story to continue with Brandon and Heather's love. Don't miss this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"It feels a little sacrilegious to not like the Flame and the Flower, since it set the bar for so many romance readers back in the '70s. What can I say? I just didn't like it. I thought the heroine was just another wimpy goody goody. The hero was a little too father-figure for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't stomach reading past page 150...","review":"I am astonished by all the 5 star reviews for this book. I'm generally of fan of K. Woodiwiss, but I couldn't get past the first 150 pages or so of this book. What I did read left me feeling sick and anxious. As many of the other reviewers have mentioned, the male \\"hero\\" of the story rapes this 17 year old girl 3 or 4 times (despite her loud protestations and the fact that she was violently shaking all over) and he merely laughs and makes fun of her and tells her \\"she'll like it eventually.\\" And we're supposed to cheer this couple on? The \\"hero\\"continues to threaten her after the wedding until the point I stopped reading. I just couldn't continue reading this for entertainment. The most violent storyline of any \\"romance\\" I have ever read. I'd recommend A Rose in Winter instead..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"This is the first romance I read and it launched me into the genre. I have not found another book as wonderful as this or a writer as good as Woodiwiss."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Read This 4 Times","review":"The first time I read this book was about 35 years ago when I was in my early 20's. Although a romance, it's what kicked me into reading on a regular basis...and not just romance. I've now read it 4 times. The writer does an excellent job with the facts of the time period as well as the language and descriptions. And of course, it's a typical romance full of misunderstanding. This is one of three favorite books I have. Definitly worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I was never a reader of romance novels. That all changed when I read The Flame and the Flower! I was looking for historical fiction, and this book filled that desire while offering up a tantalizing love story, as well. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable but Intriguing","review":"Being a teenager of 17 myself, I could understand Heather to a certain degree. Being scared, running for your life, and having no one to turn to could make anyone scared. Heather was a child, like me in a lot of ways. She was terrified and being ravaged by a 35 year old man made it no better. I cried along with her. Brandon was infuriating, much like my own paramour (even though he is my age!) always teasing her. Heather was at times though, over sensitive. At least, a good part of the time, she was not afraid to be herself with Brandon. That I had to admire. And when he saw her with baby Beau, that melted my heart. He grew in the novel, and like many of us, he decided that while pride may last for a few years, true love lasts for ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"That's what I would give this one if the rating system permitted. The so-called \\"hero\\" repeatedly rapes the heroine, even after he figures out she was an innocent, not a prostitute (not that I think raping a prostitute is ok either, but you get my drift here). Then she ends up falling in love with him? Yeah, so he's a real SOB and brutalizes her, but hey, he's \\"handsome\\". Give me a break! I failed to find the \\"romance\\" in this piece of trash. DON'T waste your time on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needed some re-working!","review":"Alright, here are my complaints: The main characters are never fleshed out. Heather is unbelivably gorgeous and unbelivabely BORING!!! There was nothing going on above her bodice! She never comes back with a witty retort or interesting comment.The \\"misunderstanding\\" love scene in the beginning makes no sense. Then the hero goes from being a complete cad to a wonderful guy(???) There are only two \\"love\\" scenes in the whole book, one at the beginning and one at the end because the whole middle of the book has the main characters at odds.Not good, need I say more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of admission","review":"I never read the book, but listened to the abridged audiotape - it had no depth - I would not buy another of her abridged audiotapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good down time book","review":"This was a good book for down time. By that I mean it was good to read and come back to. It was predictable and a bit redundant at the end, but all in all I liked it. I was read it because of the controversial reviews and I definitely agree more with the high ratings than the low. Yes, there is forced seduction, but many like to read that. I don't think I will rush out for the sequel, but I found this worth my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is truly the best book I have ever read!

This was one of the first books that I bought that began my book collection years ago, and I have been hooked on Kathleen Woodiwiss ever since! I love all of the Birmingham stories and have bought them all and read them over and over. The Birmingham men are hilarious and as different as day and night! That's what makes them so great to read. Brandon, while a little pushy(let's face it, what man isnt!), truly loves Heather and takes care of her. He brings her to a whole new life and gives her a family. My favorite part of the book is when Brandon defends Heather against her aunt. Gotta love a nice, strong man!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and frustrating","review":"I had read The Elusive Flame first and then this book and I agree with a lot of other readers. The villans were portrayed as ugly, and the main characters only seemed to love each other for their looks. brandon was not nice and i cannot see how Heather fell in love with him, however, abused people usually do fall in love with people that will or do abuse them - no offense to anyone.The murder plot at the end of the book came too late also and after reading this book, the sequel The Elusive Flame was exactly the same, apart from without the rape scene. What's with the possessiveness also?? I really loved the Elusive Flame and Shanna, a Rose in Winter was good, Petals on the River not good at all and i'm now reading Wolf and the Dove which is turning out to really captivate me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to read it, check it out from the library!","review":"Woodiwiss has produced a well-written book with a disturbing plot line. After reading the \\"rape\\" scene, I found myself thinking there is no difference between Brandon's character and her aunt's brother, except looks and the fact that Brandon was able to rape her first.Throughout the book, Brandon continues to treat Heather badly. Woodiwiss does not build enough justification for how Heather could possibly fall in love with Brandon, since he treats her poorly.If an author wishes to write a rape scene in a novel, she must be careful how she carries it off. When Woodiwiss wishes to do so next, she should look at Judith McNaught's book, Whitney My Love for an example."},{"rating":"1","title":"What romance is not!","review":"I am a romance writter, myself, and I have to say that if I wrote this peice of garbage, I would hang my head in shame! The idea that this book is still being published as a romance disgusts me.To all the ladies who have reviewed this book and given it a two star rating or higher, I have to ask you, what would you do if Brandon did this to YOUR 17 year old daughter?It's a sad day when women give good reviews to books that promote violence against women. And I don't give a darn that this was written in a time where 'bodice rippers' were the thing. We are living in an 'enlightned' age now, 2003 even, and there are still women out there that are saying that this is the best romance they had ever read! To those women I have one peace of advice: Go to a book store and get another book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a true classic!","review":"I loved reading about this family's beginning. The struggles of life between a Heather and Brandon are so close to being real. I can not wait to continue reading about their family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am still reading this","review":"Im Still reading this book also. Since I am a fan of Kathleen woodiwiss I know I will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a first time reader","review":"As a first time reader the book was well written. I love historical romance and the issues it entails. I liked how possessive Brandon was with Heather from the beginning. His loyalty and faithfulness to Heather was refreshing considering he only slept with her one night. Their nemesis Louisa which was Brandon 's ex-fiancee spiteful comments were believable. However, I gave it a 4 star because was way to meek and shy for my taste. She needs backbone to handle a handsome rugged hunk like Brandon. Although, I'll give Heather credit for getting one in the end. Also, I think Kew could of expanded on the sex scenes instead of starting with he kissed her neck with heart beating fast then ending it there. So for you reader's out there if your into romance with a plot and adventure this will be a good read. But if you looking dreamy love scenes forget it look some where else."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my opinion-this book is very entertaining","review":"I completely understand some of the other opinions on this book that I have read. I wasn't real impressed with the way the 2 main characters met, but I fell in love with the rest of the book as soon as they were reunited. He threatens Heather with a horrible life, but is unable to keep his threats. Brandon becomes a thoughtful man who is desperately in love and Heather is completely blind to his feelings. I love this story. I have read many books by Kathleen Woodiwiss and this one ranks right up there with Ashes in the Wind. I finished reading this book one night and starting reading it again the very next day. I can honestly say that it is just a GOOD story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, captivating love story.....","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It captured my interest from the very beginning and as the story developed, I had more and more difficulty putting it down. It is one of those books that you just don't want to end because you get so caught up in the characters. I am excited to read the sequel, \\"The Elusive Flame.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This WAS a Parody? Right?","review":"This had better be a script from \\"Saturday Night Live\\" or somebody needs to get a grip. I concur completely with the reviewer who calls this \\"vomit-inducing\\". Rape as a romantic sport? What a concept. Maybe Ms. Woodiwiss should write a lovely romantic novel about Ted Bundy.The writing style? Stilted and stupid. This book would be a good argument to bring back book burning (hey, anyone who thinks rape is a romantic interlude ought not get offended with an attack on the First Amendment). I doubt Ms. Woodiwiss will be invited to speak at the next \\"Victim's Rights\\" convention. I can't believe any woman would write this. She's got to be a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"This was one of the first romance novels that I ever read and it immediately became one of my favorites. I reread it recently and found that it did not age well. The rape scene in the beginning is extremely disturbing, as is the fact that the hero never acknowledges how horrible his actions were. The vast age difference between the characters is also troublesome.The book is well written, but be warned that it is full of 70's romance purple prose. If you want to read a Woodiwiss, I would suggest The Wolf and the Dove and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape and the Rapist","review":"I read this for a class and found it to be horrendous. How many times was the main character nearly raped? I think about 5 and the one guy who is a handsome rapist, actually succeeds in raping her, but we are supposed to like him because he is handsome, rich, and marries her after getting her pregnant. He was still a rapist! This book was the first romance genre book I have ever read and it is a good assumption that it will be my last.RAPE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST THING I HAVE EVER READ! TOTAL TURN-OFF","review":"If you think that an abuduction leading to a flat out rape (no not even heavy seduction here) followed by an extended period of abuse and negligance is romantic, then you will love this book. Personally, it makes me want to wretch. The heroine never fights back. She merely accepts the horrific treatment from the abuser (Oops!) I mean hero Bast-(Oops again!) Brandon. She never even yells! Not to mention that virtually every man, save her brother in law, attempts to rape her. Nice, really. No really. This is exactly what my daydreams are filled with! Please this is disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"When did Raping a woman become romantic!","review":"This book is utterly disturbing and disgusting not only does the \\"hero\\" of the novel rape her, he is emotionally abusive and likes to see her cower... not only does the author make this seem OK she romanticizes it and glorifies it! UGH!If I could give lower than one star I would!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If Brandon Birmingham is your knight in shining armor...","review":"...I would hate to see what kind of man you consider abrute! This was by far the worst book I have ever read.Thank God the romance genre has advanced as it has over thepast twenty years or so. That is, I believe it has evolvedinto a form of literature from the simple stringing togetherof nouns (usually breasts, in this case) and modifiers."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT!","review":"I'm not sure what madness drove me to pick up this book in the first place. About all I can say is that Woodiwiss had me laughing all the way through with her prentious style and play at literature. A snivelling heroine and a stuck-up hero do not electricity generate. I know my opinion won't be real popular around here, and that's fine. Someone needs to be the voice of dissent."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRASH.","review":"Woodiwiss manages to be both offensive and boring with a predictable story and characters so trite they are farcical. The hero and the villain have a lot in common. Both are selfish, cruel and attempt to rape the heroine. The only difference is that the hero succeeds and continues to mentally abuse the heroine for most of the novel. The use of rape as a romantic plot device is disturbing and misguided. a rapist is NOT a hero. The rest of the characters are so trite and stereotypical there is no need for them to ever talk for the reader to guess how the story will unfold. We have the evil, ugly villain; the jealous spurned rival (who is, of course, not as pretty as the heroine); and the wronged, passive, damsel in distress. If you value your time, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit-Inducing","review":"My constant mockery of romance novels prompted someone to recommend this one. Let me get this straight. The \\"hero\\" is a man who rapes a 17-year-old girl and then tells her it's her fault she was hurt? He informs her that she will be his mistress, regardless of her will; later he is enraged that she took away his free choice when she married him? People use this novel as a model for love and look upon this individual as a knight in shining armor, a paragon for all men? Ten pages after meeting him I wanted to jump into the novel and kill him. The fact that a woman wrote this horribly offensive trash just kills me. If you're into the genre at least find a novel whose hero is remotely tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peel pads","review":"This product was opened when I received it..

Unfortunately i was not pleased. The product caused excessive dryness and after I used the product for about 50 days, there was no improvement in my complexion.

The color is vibrant.This DVD is a much more affordable version than the very pricely Criterion edition. Yes, the Criterion edition has commentary by Martin Scorcese as well as bonus special feature documentaries.However, at $39.95, it has priced itself out of the market.

The title comes from a perfume worn by Sabu, a sartorially splendid local prince, and perfectly sums up the richness of your experience watching this movie. One of the scenes that won it the best cinematography Oscar in 1948 is a flashback to Deborah Kerr's character as she fishes as a teen on a Scottish lake. The camera is shooting into the sunlit reflection on the lake and Kerr is lit with a strong spotlight for balance.

Unfortunately I am sorry that I spent time reading his newest title, Crying Wolf. By the middle of this book, I was tired of the innocence of the freshman and left cold by the twins. I found myself seriously skimming to get to the end and be finished with it.If you still are interested in reading a good novel set on a college campus which is a good psychological thriller, then pick up Paullina Simons title from a few years ago called Red Leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"My first Peter Abrahams Book.","review":"I wasn't sure I was going to pick this book, but, when I saw \\"My favorite American suspense novelist\\" -Stephen King on the cover, I decided to give it a try. The only reason I finished the book was because I took the time to start it. If I had to describe the book in one word, I would say, shallow. Don't waste your time or money. There are so many wonderful books out there. This does not happen to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book really was not that exceptional, even from the beginning. But heck, I paid (price) for it, so I thought I would go ahead and finish it. That was a mistake. The ending was absolutely stupid. It was as if the author came up with 5 possible endings, wrote them on slips of paper, and stuck them in a hat. This ending was on the slip of paper he pulled out. Too bad that it was the worst ending out of the five. I could think of 10 more satisfying and intelligent endings than this.Apart from the ending, everything else about this book fails. The suspense (well, what little of it there is) really doesn't lead up to anything. It just kind of fizzles out when you think it's going somewhere.The characters aren't that interesting. Freedy made me chuckle a couple of times, but he wasn't any more memorable than a character anyone else could have created.All in all, it's a bad book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomores will like this...","review":"...if they are still in high school, that is, but h.s. juniors will laugh out loud at how naive and pretentious this book is. Too bad; it had a strong finish, the fell apart rapidly. Only gets two stars because it is well written in parts and moves smartly along. Far too many coincidences, a cariacature philosophy professor (reads like a bad term paper on Nietzche in places) and a cliche-riden middle-aged leftover hippie townie, full of a nice middle-class boy's wholly imaginary idea of how rich people live (buy a copy of \\"Town and Country\\" if you really want to know). A silly book, much worse than his earlier \\"The Fan\\" which was great. A major disappointment. Omit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Got Thru It","review":"I got thru the book which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The writing was not polished, very fragmented.

For shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dissapointing","review":"I have read most of Peter Abrahams' books and was so excited to have this newest work to read.

Crying Wolf is not a good book. Abrahams stumbles through the story almost as though he has put the first draft out there! At times it is almost painful to battle through. He continues to ask me questions and then answers them for me in the next sentence or paragraph. Mr. Abrahams, please please, let me, the reader, ask my own questions! The characters, especially Freedy, are terribly inconsistent and poorly brought together. Like 95% of you out there I don't want to waste time and I'm sorry I did on this book. With hesitation and much less patience I will try some of Abrahams others, they can't be worse than Crying Wolf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but is it genuine?","review":"I received the item and had no problem on shortening the rope with a small tool I had.

If the snow is heavy and wet, you'll have a difficult time with this, as it's more work than you'll want to do.

Because the pot is insulated, you have to run warm water through it to heat it up.Most importantly, it makes an inconsistent cup of coffee.

When I reached page 140 and realized that, despite some hanging plot threads, that I really didn't give a damn what happened to any of the characters, I forced myself to return \\"Biggest Elvis\\" to the library.I don't know if any \\"Father Ted\\" fans will read this review, but if there are, I'll say that I had a vague hope that \\"Biggest Elvis\\" was the inspiration for the \\"Three Stages of Elvis\\" episode of the Father Ted TV series. Having read nearly half of \\"Biggest Elvis,\\" I can't say I see anything in this book that could have led to the Father Ted show, other than the notion of Elvis appearing on stage in each phase of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incisive, insightful and amusing","review":"For the best reason to read this book, refer to \\"mlbasquiat\\"'s review and you will be rewarded by seeing just how incisive the book can be. Nothing triggers a response like that as well as truth. The thinly disguised narrative of that review speaks of the reverse racism peddled by a few with massive inferiority complexes, but is not representative of the many fine people who struggle daily to understand each other in Micronesia and the Philippine Islands. There are moments in the book which both flatter America and defame it, so if you have such biases you may miss the balance.Yes \\"Biggest Elvis\\" is written from Kluge's perspective, but that is of course what the book is about: His struggle to understand the people around him. It did not impress me as a bible of Pacific culture any more than Kluge impressed me as a philanthropist of infinite wisdom. But it did strike me as a random slice of \\"in your face\\" reality with a few powerful messages... a solid read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Men will love it...","review":"To be brief, this is in a class with Mustang Sally which makes it one of the funniest books ever written.

The only big problem (and the reason I stopped buying this product) is that the seasoning does NOT BREAK DOWN into the water no matter how much you mash it with the spoon (and all the Knorr soups I've tried have this problem). All it does is make lots of clumps of seasoning in your pot of water. I really like the taste of this soup, but it's pretty frustrating when the seasoning just clumps up and you end up eating a mixture of bland water and very sour-tasting lumps of bouillion. If only the Knorr people would figure out how to make the seasoning mix with the soup water properly, I might be willing to try this soup again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!!","review":"I had never heard of this book until Doc.

By the time you get to the end if you do not feel like hitting your knees and praying for our ailing nation, then you need to get saved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very limited in scope","review":"While there are quite a few instances of revival recounted in this book, it appears to include only certain \\"approved\\" accounts of revival which have been sanitized for your protection. George Whitefield and Charles Finney are there, of course, along with many others throughout the world up to recent times. Interestingly enough, there is no mention of the Azusa street revival, or any of leaders of the healing revival in the 1940's. Even the account of the revival in Andrew Murray's church neglects to mention that the outburst of prayer happened to be praying in tongues... it would certainly seem as though this book's author does not approve of THAT kind of revival. There are some good revival stories in this book, but the limited definition of revival makes it very redundant and after a while, the stories becoming boring in their similarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea but a mediocre book","review":"Vandana Shiva writes on a worthwhile topic, namely the fact that the dominant economic and legal systems are totally unequipped to deal with environmental reality and have a wildly destructive tendency to impose themselves on the rest of the world. However, this book is sadly too incoherent and poorly written to properly convey the immediacy of this issue. Her arguments are totally lacking in structure and are prone to rediculous, hyperbolic rants about the colonization of the womb and other paranoid fantasies. She cites plenty of sound evidence throughout, but in an equally haphazard fashion. All in all, I guess it is worthwhile to read this book simply because there aren't really any others on the subject, but don't let the fact that Shiva writes like one of those borderline schizo activists turn you off to the importance of the issue of biopiracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the weak willed and easily fooled","review":"If your IQ is less than your age, you might actually like this book. I was forced to read this as an assignment for a college course, and I lost all respect for anyone stupid enough to be swayed by such a weak argument. Shiva uses only fear and hyperbole to convince the reader that corporate America is out to destroy everything, much like all the other pieces we read in that course.

To begin with, at the time of the civil war, William was married to Elizabeth Seton, he did not marry Anne until 1654. The most glaring inaccuracy was the appearance of William's son Robert, the fact is William Keith had NO male heirs. In 1638 Elizabeth did give birth to a boy (also named William) but he died as an infant. I do realize that this is a piece of fiction, but for the most part, the most base facts should be accurate.

But after reading the book and browsing all the CD-ROM, I am not very satisfied that this book doesn't teach me how to build a simple game or guide me to make something more complicated than a symbol! As a beginner, I call these things stimulus. When I browse websites like Eye4u's, I want to do something like that.

This book is far from organized. They spend too much time talking about things instead of doing them. Self-help books should have tons of visuals and tutorials, this lacks in both areas.

One more thing, and this is to all authors of self-help books in any area and that is put your books in a spiral notebook form, its a real pain trying to keep the book open and do the tutorials at the same time.

No such warning on the mfg web site. It will work, but not as intended. Lag bolts supplied are too large.

Getting the TV on the thing is a not-so-simple one-man job, but it can be done without requiring hospitalization if the neighbors are busy. 52\\" inches is my new limit, though.The shipping was fast and without damage to the box.The OmniMount turned out to be the least stressful part of our home theatre upgrade..."},{"rating":"2","title":"plasma mount","review":"This tv mount took my husband and I the better part of a day to install partly due to the fact that I wanted to make sure it was done right, so we went over the instructions very detailed and discussed all the aspects of the installation to make sure there would be no mistakes. We have a 42\\" Sony that we mounted and this thing is going nowhere! There is plenty of hardware included and it is definitely a two person job. My only complaint is that the box arrived pretty torn and beaten but everything was there, nothing missing.

It is a very high quality product, was easy to mount (though it definitely takes two people), the instructions were clear, and the manufacturer included all the necessary hardware and then some. Once mounted, it is very stable and easy to adjust, and adjusts in many dimensions (left to right, tilt, pan, roll, in and out). The wishbone extension can hold the TV as close to the wall as 5\\", or as far as 28\\".

Its probably one of the best one's out there because of the multi-functional viewing options.It goes left and right, it tilts up and down, and pulls straight out for closer viewing. This product is made real strong and if mounted corrected in the studs,it won't be falling off your wall. The unit is heavy, but you need the good construction to hold your TV in place.I recommend anyone that has a 40\\" or more TV to use this multi-function wall mount made by OMNIMOUNT. Excellent product but little expensive.I paid $340.00 from Ritz Camera thru Amazon site, it was the cheapest merchant out there and offered free delivery.

Installation was very easy and adjustment of hight, tilt and horizontal orientation can be done with the standard key provided. If you like flexibility and convenience, this is the product. Comes with six screws and very strong mount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This is definitely not a do-it-yourself installation, however if you've been impatiently waiting to mount your beast of a television on copious amounts of steel and are really excited to start drilling, then this can be a one man job. I received the product, which arrives in an enormous box, with a set of instructions in more languages the the United Nations could even comprehend. However, the install was acutally fairly uneventful and reasonably facile. If you're mounting to steel beams, then beware, because most likely you will need washers, as the bolts provided have threads which stop about 1.5 cm from the top.When it comes time to mount the television, and you're feeling like Lou Ferrigno circa 1978, then you'll be able to lift that LCD (probably not a plasma) up onto the bolts and BAM!!! You're done. Overall, easy install, great looking product and perfect for those situations when a table top tv is so last season."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"Using this to mount a Samsung 46\\" LCD TV. It is awesome! Very easy to move TV - the 2 arm design makes positioning it in any direction a snap. I was able to install the mount, hide all the cables, and get the TV mounted all by myself. After you mount the brace to the TV, it has you partially install 2 bolts - these hang on the stand, so you can put the TV to the stand, then attach with 2 more bolts. Actually easy to put the TV on and off. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great - and you can't beat this price!","review":"I bought this for a friend of mine, and he loves it.

This thing looks like it belongs on the front suspension of a European sports car. Unfortunately the mounting plate was too small to cover the distance between my off center studs. I had to create an additional 3/4\\" plywood plate to distribute the weight across three studs so my 115 lbs TV didn't rip from the wall. I tested it by hanging my 175 lbs full body weight from it.

It's a lot of money for the average hobbyist and you have to decide between IS, no IS, and the f/2.8 versions as well. First, I tried to justify to myself that I didn't need IS but all of my lenses except my 50mm f/1.8 have IS and I love having the luxury and comfort of it. Secondly, have you held an f/2.8 version of this lens? It's heavy and if your going to be carrying it around take some vitamins that morning. As a hobbyist, do you really need f/2.8 on a 70-200? Even on a crop frame?The Image Quality is phenomenal. I have no regrets and I still smile when I take photos with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now my favorite L lens.","review":"All the good praise given for this lens is deserved. This is my 7th L lens, and it immediately has become my favorite. I like it much more than my f2.8 28-300L IS, which requires a tripod for me to use. I thought that the extra stop in the 2.8 version of this lens might be useful enough to warrent the extra expense, but after reading the reviews of the f4, I gave it a try. I am glad that I did not spend the extra money for a feature that does not seem to be needed. The quality of the pictures taken by this lens is just wonderful. My only regret is that I did not make this my first L lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMAGE STABILIZER IS WORTH THE HIGH PRICE.","review":"AT FIRST I BOUGHT THE NON IS VERSION, I TRIED IT OUT FOR 2 WEEKS AND DECIDED TO RETURNED IT BECAUSE SOME OF THE PICTURES IN LOW LIGHT WERE BLURRIED AND EVEN THOUGH I USED A HIGH SPEED SHUTTER OR ISO, I WAS NOT VERY PLEASED. DECIDED TO PAY THE HIGH PRICE OF THE IMAGE STABILIZER VERSION AND I DO NOT REGRET IT BECAUSE THE PICTURES ARE MUCH SHARPER AND THE COLOR CONTRAST IS JUST FANTASTIC.I WAS A LITTLE DESAPOINTED WITH THE HIGH NOISE OF THIS LENS WHILE IT IS ON. I ALSO HAVE OTHER CANON LENS EF-S WITH IMAGE STABILIZER BUT THEY ARE VERY QUIET BUT DO NOT TAKE SHARP PICTURES AS THIS ONE.THIS IS A VERY FAST LENS, AUTO FOCUS IS EXCELLENT, THE IMAGE STABILIZER IS JUST FANTASTIC SPECIALLY IN THE PANING MODE AND THE COLORS AND CONTRAST ARE VERY NICE. I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS LENS AND I CERTAINLY RECOMMEND IT TO ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO HAVE REALLY NICE SHARP PHOTOS.

Owned it for about a month now and I cannot be happier with it. Size, weight, build quality, optics, speed, clarity of images, everything is top notch. I recommend buying an inexpensive tripod collar ring mount instead of mounting the camera to the tripod. I bought the Rainbowimaging one and it is made very well. I was in the same situation as everyone else, deciding between this and the f2.8. I bought this because it is lighter, sharper, newer, and weather and dust sealed.

Hard to beat the build quality and image quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best lens ever","review":"I had this lens for about a month. The image quality is just amazing. It is so sharp that I can crop almost any sizes I want and still remain good quality prints. The contrast and saturation are just perfect. I do not regret to have F4 version. It is lighter than F2.8 and $500 cheaper. F4 is just good with IS. In low light condition, I use either flash or higher ISO, making perfect pictures. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful lens","review":"It is portable enough, feels great in the hand, and produces stunningly beautiful images with my Canon Rebel XSi. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the IS","review":"The IS makes this lens at the full zoom as if you had it on a tripod. It is noisy though. The quality of the pictures is very good.

I returned it and the 2nd copy has been perfect. Having spoken with other enthusiasts, this doesn't seem to be an uncommon experience, and Canon may have some quality control issues, which is why this is rated a 4 instead of a 5.The new lens is wonderful, tack sharp, good build and focuses quickly. I use it to do dog photography and it is great outdoors. Indoors for action shots in low light, I would go with the 2.8 over the f/4 to get those really crisp photos in low light conditions. Otherwise great all around zoom lens at a good price. Image stabilization has really come in handy too."},{"rating":"2","title":"L lens I could afford!","review":"In my view it rates 5 stars!

I've used it for a daytime football game and it performed excellently ... pictures were sharp, captured the action perfectly ... handheld. I've used it indoors with an external flash, and it takes wonderful pictures indoors. I've used it on landscapes, wildlife, and portrait ... all very excellent pictures. Birds photos need to be cropped to enlarge the view. I wish the 70 was 50 ... the little extra width would be perfect ... using it on my XTI. However, I am not really complaining ... the quality of pictures are perfect. I do not notice the weight, which really isn't that bad for this kind of quality zoom lens. I probably could have gotten by without the IS, but it is great to be able to handhold and take very sharp, focused pictures. I am pleased with my purchase and the performance of this lens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not work with my Canon","review":"This lenses has good reviews but for some reason it would not work with my Canon D7!

I was totally dissatisfied with the tele-zoom lens it came with. So much so I had given up on getting any wildlife shots. However, my passion over-rode my resolve and I decided to give a good zoom lens a try. The lighter weight of this lens and the f/4 are the two factors that made me decide to get this lens. I absolutely love it - I surely see the difference between a $200 lens and an L lens. We went out this weekend and got some stunning pictures of hawks and deer (my very first time out with the lens). I look forward to learning this lens and even better results. So I guess it is worth it to have one really fantastic lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second best zoom lens in Canon's lineup","review":"Excellent contrast, color, and sharpness. The f/4L IS offers a much more pleasing bokeh than the non-IS version, which I've used, due to the newer shape and positioning of the blades. This lens is only second to the 70-200mm f/2.8L IS mkII, and it's not far behind. Given the price and weight difference between this lens and the mkII, I'd say this is definitely the way to go unless you're shooting indoor sports or need super-bokeh."},{"rating":"2","title":"speechless, amazing","review":"This is so far the best lens I have used and I was speechless to look at the quality of pics it produced with my 5D mark III will learn to take more pics with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of information but poorly written.","review":"This could have been a 5 star book.

This is good news; this movie is a real find.Stanley is a ukelele player who takes his art seriously; he takes a \\"gig\\" playing for old folks at a nursing home. Eventually he gets more and more involved with the patrons andthe result is a pleasant, life affirming story in the vein of \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\".I don't know the names of the principal actors besides Ms. Dunaway, but Stanley is played by the guy from the 2nd Bob Newhart series (the one with two brothers Darryl) and the other main character used to be Florence from the Jeffersons. Excellent portrayals, a happy/sad and sensitive movie you will enjoy time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Total Joy","review":"My now deceased mom bought me a ukelele when I was a boy, but I wasn't the least bit interested. Yet, Stanley brings more than his ukelele to the nursing home ... he brings a loving heart and patiently helps a former jazz singer out of a deep depression to sing once again. The music in the film is superb and the acting never once overshadows the story. In an age when people seem to only want action, sex and violence, it's wonderful to watch a movie that focuses on what really counts in life: genuine kindness and selflessness. I am now a fan of the ukelele and have understood why mom wanted me to learn to play; she would have truly loved this film.

I found that I had to \\"digest\\" one chapter at a time. The writer's story made me feel uncomfortable at times. Perhaps because it reminded me of things I had experienced and would rather forget. I do believe her personal discovery has important messages for the reader. And the exercises or meditations at the end of each chapter are very helpful to someone on the road to recovery/discovery.

And it was not very soft at all. I found a much better one for only $5 more at Costco."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I realize this wasn't a very expensive mattress pad BUT I bought it to use in a guest room. I chose this particular one because it had the deep pockets. I washed it as directed ONE time and when I made the bed up the sides began to split where the elastic ribbing is sewn into the fabric. The top portion of the mattress pad seems to be fine but I'm sure I won't be able to wash this again without it now falling apart since it is already torn in two spots and I will need to tug on it to make the bed up again. I wouldn't suggest it. I'll be looking for another one that I can see & feel before I purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pad is just too Darn SMALL","review":"The cotton pad doesn't cover the entirety of my standard mattress and the elastic is so springy that it take two people to put it on and I got a blood blister trying to get it over the corner because it was too small.Add the sheets and then get in bed and the corners pop off. No bueno. so so so annoying. I hope I can still return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"cotton top full mattress pad","review":"I ordered and received a mattress pad manufactured by Louiseville Bedding Co. This product is so inferior that I cannot believe that Amazon.com promotes the sale of it under their super saver shipping program. Considering that I can buy the same product at Walmart for around $18 but paid $30 from Amazon.com, I cannot help but feel that Amazon.com is charging for the shipping and perpetuating fraud. The pad shrank so bad that I am unable to get it onto the bed. Considering that the standard sizing for a full bed is 54X75 and this pad was 53X75 it started out smaller. I do not feel that it is fair to expect me to pay money to ship this back to Amazon.com and therefore I expect Amazon.com to send me a prepaid shipping label. Then when Amazon.com receives the pad I expect to get a full refund on my charge account."},{"rating":"1","title":"It ripped the first time I fit it on the mattress","review":"I purchased this mattress pad cover as it was made in USA and the cover stated it was cotton. However, only the top on the mattress was cotton. The sides, filling and the back were all polyester. Since I could use it in on our travel trailer queen bed, I decided to keep it. Today, I put it on the mattress and it fit just fine. However, when I went to straighten it on the bed, the skirt ripped along the one of the elastic stitched lines. Since there are several rows of elastic on the side skirt, I expect that the cover will continue to rip. This was not what I expected and I will be very cautious about purchasing anything like this on line again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mattress Pad EVER","review":"I had high hopes when I purchased this mattress pad; previous reviews were decent. Sadly, its not constructed 100%of real material. The part that holds it onto the mattress is made out of the plasticy material that reusable shopping cart bags are made of. It tore the first time I put it on the mattress. Still, I needed it so I didn't immediately send it back. Upon use, it comes off ALL the time - and our mattress isn't as thick as the 15\\" the pad is advertised to fit. Not suprisingly, it tore one of the times I put it back on. Worst yet, is that upon trying to remove the pad from my bed, it tore again. So now, 3 out of 4 corners are tore and I have no clue if it will actually go back on the bed now. This pad was a huge disappointment. If you need a pad, keep looking. This pad is not worth the investment. It didn't last us two months before being 100% destroyed, compared to the pad we were replacing that lasted 7 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good piece of material","review":"This mattress cover is so poorly made that as soon as I opened it and went to put one corner on the bed, my hand went right through the fabric.

Natura says this product is washable in their ads--which is why I chose it. The tag says to wash on cool and dry on low heat. That's what I did. Smell didn't come out, so I repeated the process. When I put it on the bed, it had shrunk 8 inches in length and 6 inches in width. Now it looks like it fits a double bed, not a Queen. I have contacted Natura, and they say that from the photos I sent them showing a shrunken pad on my big bed, I must have exposed it to \\"heat\\". I followed their instructions on the product (dry on low heat), and they respond by saying that \\"it must have been exposed to heat.\\" Therefore, \\"it is not covered by warranty.\\" I do not recommend buying products from Natura."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Mattress Cover","review":"I am very pleased with the Queen Mattress Cover. I especially like the deep, gathered sides that hold the cover in place.

When I tried to put a pad on the mattress, the fabric on the sides of the pad kept ripping apart forming holes.I had to return this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fit","review":"I buy a mattress pad primarily for protection, not for additional padding. That said, this is my all-time favorite pad--and I've bought several over the years. Most pads have flimsy, inadequate elastic; after a little ware and a few washings, they slip, shift, pull-up, or shrink. Not this pad. It has a very ample elastic skirt that fits well over the sides and deep underneath the mattress. The pad has been through several washings and still fits perfectly and never shifts or rides up.In my experience, the more thickly padded pads get too hot. The simple, cotton, not-too-thick composition of this pad is perfect for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough mattress pad","review":"I bought the twin for my daughter's new mattress set. The #1 reason I bought it was because it has the elastic bands all the way around, so it fits the sides of the mattress better. It holds snug. I am happy with the product. I bought a better pad for my bed, but it's good enough for a child's bed. I've washed it quite a bit and it's held up pretty well. It did shrink a bit, but I wanted it to because then it fits the bed better. It is not waterproof, but I didn't want that at all. Good product. Just put another one in my cart for my son, who just went into a twin bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after a few months","review":"Good mattress pad, and I was happy to find a non-plastic option for a reasonable price.The sides are as thin and easy to puncture as the other reviews indicate. Would definitely be a five-star pad were it not for that factor.It fits my 11\\" memory foam bed well and helps my sheets stay on better.UPDATE: After 3 months, the sides ripped so badly I had to throw the pad out because it wouldn't stay on the mattress anymore. Wasted money, and it shredded too late to return the item.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I purchased this for a teens new bed,did not want to spend a fortune, but I expected this to be better quality than something from Walmart. Wrong, I pulled this out of the package and did not even attempt to put it on the bed. The elastic sides are made from something not much better than a PAPER Tablecloth! The description says Cotton Top but it is very rough and has very little fiberfill. Better to spend a little more and get something that will last longer and protect the mattress better."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I need","review":"I bought this in my freshman year in college.

Moreover, the bag had absolutely no identification stating it was made by Louisville Bedding. There was no writing of any kind on the plastic bag, and it was not sealed!

He said that,in less than two weeks of putting it on their bed,the edge fabric tore in two places in big strips, which caused the mattress pad and the sheets to continually come off the bed. He said that the edge fabric that stretches over the sides of the mattress is a paper like fabric and not very durable. I reread the reviews of all the mattress pads that I had looked at, being careful to notice the ones that had actually used them for a period of time. I ordered another one, a little more expensive, and they really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed!!!!","review":"I am very unimpressed with this product. The first time I put it on my mattress, the sides ripped in 3 places. The accordian sides are not held together well at all.

Very poorly made and sides stretched out just by taking it out and did not spring back into shape. This has been the first item I had to send back."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap pad","review":"Cotton top is fine. This pad has a side material that is plastic or paper, not fabric. This is very cheap and flimsy. It ripped in three places while I was putting it on the bed for the first time. Does not easily fit the large size it claims to fit. Cheap product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Cheap","review":"I purchased this thinking that it was inexpensive and cotton. When I received and opened it, I was surprised that the pad was \\"crunchy\\" feeling (not like 100% cotton). I thought it might go away with a wash, but it didn't. My new mattress is a pillowtop, so it's quite thick. The pad is slippery and I found it was difficult to get on. When I pulled tight on the baffled sides to get a tight fit, I ripped holes in the pad in more than one place. I guess this falls into the category of \\"disposable mattress pad\\" since it's unlikely given the flimsiness, that it will last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Piece of Garbage","review":"I got this mattress cover based upon the price and some of the positive reviews. I always look at the one star reviews but take them with a grain of salt, because you are always going to have the occasional faulty product or dissatisfied customer. You can't please everyone all the time. But if the vast majority of the reviews are five and four stars, I will consider buying it based on price and how closely it meets my needs.But this time the people giving one stars were totally correct. I bought it, washed it and put it over the mattress. Time to wash it a second time, and THE SECOND TIME I PUT IT OVER THE MATTRESS IT RIPPED! I threw it away today after it started to rip more in different places (its past the return date). The mattress pad I had before this one lasted me about 8 years. Go ahead and buy it, just be aware that you have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Good Quality Pad","review":"This is a simple product. Pad is made from natural fibers, fits easily over the mattress, and looks as though it will wash well. Good quality at a great price. The pad itself is soft and comfortable, but remember that this product is not really designed to provide a substantial amount of extra padding to the mattress. The reviewers who seem dissatisfied with the amount of comfort added should be in the market for a mattress topper not a mattress pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's already falling to bits","review":"Really bad quality and its already falling to bits.

The authors caution that those who pursue a glittering opportunity often wind up in a golden mess. Thus, it makes sense to at least try to improve your job before seeking another one that, ultimately, may be even worse. The book's format offers one item of advice for each letter of the alphabet. At times, the formula wears a bit thin (X for \\"X-ers and Other Generations\\"), but the advice itself is sound. It primarily consists of encouraging you to decide what you want and go get it. We recommend this book to currently employed malcontents (you know who you are!) and to those who need help mustering the nerve to discuss job satisfaction with their employers. Perhaps the best piece of advice is to only approach your supervisors for a favor when you understand their WIIFT: \\"What's In It For Them.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Faye is the best, greatest female voice you can find.","review":"What can I say, take one listen and you'll fall in love with her and her voice.

If, however, you've read The Bighead and can still eat solid food, why haven't you bought this yet?This is a high quality chapbook with stories by two masters of the gross out. I laughed my way through the book, finding it more hilarious than horrorific, but always enjoyable. Since it's a book of two short stories rather than a novel, I won't give anything away plotwise. Suffice it to say that if you're a fan of either of these guys, don't miss out on this book.

The album has a lot of different styles involved, goin' from pop (sometimes even slightly Aussie-country influenced), rock over soft-house which has sometimes some trip-hop elements incorporated. My personal faves are \\"Some kind of bliss\\" and \\"Breathe\\". Plus \\"Did it again\\" (which has a clever videoclip!). Since \\"Spinning around\\" the first single released from Kylie's new album \\"Light Years\\" became a hit, it'd be very nice to see if some people would discover \\"Impossible Princess\\" afterwards. \\"Impossible Princess\\" had much too less promotion even if it's greatly entertaining stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop princess in power!","review":"After signing with the Deconstruction label in 1994, Kylie Mingoue embarked on a creative venture for her second set. Recorded between 1995 and 1997, IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS was her most experimental (if not, ambitious) album, to date! Just listen to the intensity within \\"Too Far\\" and \\"Limbo\\", the rock flair of \\"Some Kind of Bliss\\", and the 60's inspired \\"I Don't Need Anyone\\". IMPOSSIBLE PRINCESS is an eclectic piece of work. ONE of the Best albums to emerge within the past ten years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Dissappointment","review":"I have two other Kylie CD's which I love (\\"Greatest Hits\\" and \\"Enjoy It\\")and use in my aerobics class.

I read it when I was sixteen and it was my second book on philosophy. I had to keep a dictionary beside me as I read it because the vocabulary was esoteric, but it made me want to read it more. It changed the way I thought about things and helped me see relationships between events and ideas that at first glance might seem unrelated. In seeking to understand this book, I exposed myself to a way of thinking very alien to my experience up until that point. It was very rewarding. I highly recommend it if you want to glimpse something greater of yourself. Doing nothing else unusual except reading 2/3 of this book and praying, my SAT scores leaped from 1150 to 1350. It is the best book of its kind. Truly. After reading it, most autobiographical works of modern WEstern Zen practitioners will seem flat and trite.

With a nasty after-taste. I then shook the bottle up well and tried again. No difference.I thought it might taste better if chilled and put on ice cream. So I tried that a few days later. Ugh! That was awful too. Couldn't finish eating the ice cream.Had my wife try it and she hated it. So I poured the remaining 95% of the contents down the drain and recycled the bottle.

I had to add splenda or truvia to make it halfway palatable. My husband saw this in this store and bought it.

If you are not on a low carb diet and you consume sugar regularly, this will not taste very good to you.

I found Larger Than Death enjoyable because of the liveliness and clarity of the writing. This book is easy to read, and entertaining. The characters are all a bit odd, which is to say that they are portrayed honestly, and it is their humanity and idiosynchrasies which provide most of the amusement. I appreciated the references to religious cults and body acceptance. The murder mystery kept me guessing, but what kept me reading were the little subcultures: the philanthropy foundation, the apartment house, the religious group, the diet guru and his followers.

Sadly Ms. Murray's book is more about the fat and less about the mystery. Skinny people are depicted as evil and psychotic whereas the \\"large\\" folks are all loveable, kind, moral and good.

The First Four Years is a wonderful and delightfully entertaining book. It's amazing all of the hardships that the Wilders suffered, yet they struggled through with an abundance of love. I love the new addition of baby Rose. In conclusion, The First Four Years is a great ending, and great tie-in, though not originally intended to be, to the Rose Years.

It's a great book and a great ending to the Laura Years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First Four Years","review":"I first read this set of books in the fifth grade. Years ago.

However, this book is just awful and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, quite different","review":"I agree with most other reviewers who gave this book two or three stars; it lacked the warmth and charm of the original eight. I missed detailed descriptions of beautiful rooms, homecooked food, and calico-patterned dresses. I missed the quandaries and lessons learned as a part of growing up, the excitement of migrating ever westward, the intimate conversations between Laura and members of her family. I was bored by the financial aspects of her adult life, but loved reading about little Rose's activities and about the farm animals. I felt Laura's first pregnancy and childbirth were handled in a nice respectable way. While I was so dismayed and creeped out by Mr. and Mrs. Boast's proposal, I felt it said something frank about the dark side of human nature. I would recommend The First Four Years for anyone over the age of ten- not because of mature subject matter, but because younger kids might not fully comprehend what they're reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry and bitter","review":"I'm a fan of the Wilder series, but this book makes for a sad and bitter postscript to that hopeful and optimistic work. It may be realistic, and, worse, it may authentically reflect Wilder's thoughts, but boy is it a bitter, sad and frustrated rejection of what is most appealing in the earlier books. I guess you have to read it if you are a Wilder completist, but unless you are willing to darken your rosy memories of the early books, I would avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"obviously not by the same hand","review":"I set out to read all the books in order during the hot weeks of July. Really enjoyed all the others having read them many years ago. Just a few pages in, I could tell the book was not written by the same hand. Too many cliches in the text. Laura didn't write like that. The richness of the descriptions was missing. Laura never complained so much about work in all the other books combined!! After a few more pages, I googled the book and saw that it was published after Laura's death!!! Not sure why the publishers list Laura as the author. It might be based on Laura's diary, but the voice is in no way Laura's. A guess would be an unknown writer used the short blurbs in the diary as the story outline. A question would be why the diary wasn't destroyed when the house burned??? It would not be the item laura would try to save. It reads like a mediocre children's fiction series written in the 1950's. I am not sure if I will even finish it. what a shame........"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first four years","review":"Once I understood that reading put pictures in my head, I love reading about Laura her first home, how loss can bring families together.

The manuscript was not prepared for publication by Laura, because it was not found until after her death. Therefore, the book is not as well-written or detailed as the previous Little House books. However, if you enjoy Laura's other books, this book will be of interest. I found out things about Laura's life that I never knew until I read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Different","review":"I really agree with the other reviews. This book is different from the others.There is an introduction in the beginning of the book (by the person who personally knew Rose Wilder Lane and wrote the Rose books)that tells us that this book is different from the first books.

I tried wiping my monitor with the product and it quickly dried and left horrible visible streaks. I discarded the first \\"wipe\\" and tried again with the second one. It also left streaks. I tried wiping vertically instead of horizonatally. It left streaks. I tried wiping in circles. It left streaks.I tried inquiring about my problem by visiting the manufacturer's web page. My inital thought was that perhaps I had received a bad batch of product. I filled out a form and never received a response.

She seemed able to follow most of the instructions although I think it goes a little fast. When we went to play with the toy the following day, the beetle had gone crazy! It kept spinning and giving nonsense directions and basically saying everything it had programmed into it. I did what the directions said to do in case of malfunction and replaced the batteries, but it still would not work properly. I had actually ordered 2 of the beetles to give one as a gift and I took the second one out of the box and tried it as well. The second one did not work either.

Then, some minutes after the movie ends you suddenly ask yourself: \\"What the heck...?\\" The next affirmative is: \\"This is the new champion of plot holes\\".

This is one of those Blair Witch Project movies that you wait 1 or 2 hours for something to happen but at the end the whole movie goes down the drain. A guy cuts his arm off (and doesn't bleed to death). A very young girl is gagged and the camera insists on her cries and suffering (which is so wrong), and at the end the killer gets away (who by the way didn't have any reasons to do what he did). This movie is so DUMB I couldn't believe my eyes. If you are a horror fan like me, try: Hellraiser (all of them) the entire Nightmare on Elm Street collection, Jaws (1&2), the original Exorcist, the original The Fog, The Ring (1&2) and the Scream trilogy - stay away from SAW; or watch it to see how bad it sucks"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONE THAT","review":"SAW 2 IS COMING OUT..

For starters, the Asian cop who was killed in that house of horrors. You would think there would be a major criminal investigation in that place. But no. Nothing. And why did they go alone instead of calling for backup? That didn't make sense. Another thing, we're to believe these people are being put through all this because of something bad they've done in their lives but the two main characters in the film who are chained up have done nothing wrong. The doctor was going to have an affair but he didn't. The other guy who works at the hospital...well there weren't any questions answered about him.

However, if you want to see a good made Horror movie, I'm afraid Saw's not for you. The acting is bad (That Adam guy - God bless him, I laughed my head off every time he opened his mouth), the plot doesn't make sense and there's nothing psychological in it or whatsover. It's here where Saw fails and makes you laugh insted of being scared. It's not that is a horrible movie, but watching it, you just don't care much. Well, I didn't anyway. The story wasn't shown in a credible way so you could have the chance to sympathize with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have to say that I am very disappointed with the way Saw turned out. I have been waiting for a long time for this movie to come out and I was let down. For one the acting was horrible, the screen play wasn't great and it just wasn't scary, at all. The whole movie looked low budget, which it was, but they could have done a better job with it. The only redeeming things about the movie are the premise, which is great, and the ending, which had a twist.

I've been hard-pressed to find a truly horrifying horror movie over the last few years, and finally they give us Saw. It was worth the wait. It's mentally thrilling as well as full of gore, particularly if you get the uncut version, which I wish I'd waited for but I'm just too impatient. The uncut version has a cooler cover but it also has more gore to it. After viewing the uncut version (which my best friend has) it was easy to see why they cut some of those scenes to make it more movie-friendly for those who are too squeamish. You'll have a lot of fun trying to figure out the game in this movie, and when the ending comes you'll be quite surprised. At least I was. I made my best friend check all my closets after this one, but if I told you why it would give away the ending.

But the interest is soon forgotten as you take more care in find out if some blood has splitted over you.And this is not the only bad thing. It is very annoying to see Danny Glover in such an awful role. When actors are getting older they must have a decent job. It is simple: look at what \\"Lethal Weapon\\" was.

It is pseudo-Harrision, tedious, and the writers obviously did not dwell in the research department for long while writing the script. The plot is outlandish, unbelievable, and ultimately retarded. Not only would a person not go to the great lengths and means to achieve his ends depicted in the film, but a person could not plausibly do any of the exaggerated actions depicted in the film.

It left me guessing who did it all the way to the very end, and then it will leave you with your mouth hanging open in amazement. Very satisfying suspense movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"So classic and so creative.","review":"This movie is a classic horror movie because it has a lot of blood, suspense, sick and nasty stuff.But it is so creative too because dang, all the clues that have been showed throughout the movie have something to do with the KILLER, yet, it is hard to find out who is him. At the end of the movie, every single clue comes alive and We understand everything, which is why this has creativity, it is simple, the acting is great IMO, DR. Gordon is one of the best actors.This is one of my top favorites for sure along with the A nightmare on Elm Street Series, and The Omen Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXTREMELY VIOLENT YET MORALISTIC AT THE VERY SAME TIME","review":"TWO MEN [CARY ELWES AND LEIGH WANNELL] BOTH WAKE UP IN A MYSTERIOUS ROOM WITH A MAN WHO'S KILLED HIMSELF.

A must for anyone!","review":"This movie is absolutely incredible. I loved this movie so much that I went out about an hour after I watched this movie and bought it. This movie will keep you guessing throught the movie. Once you think you have everything figured out, you don't have the least bit of clue to what is happening. I have shown this movie to a few of my friends, who are very tough on their movie ratings, all of them immediately told me that it was a great movie. I have the supreme confidence to tell anyone and everyone that this film is definetely guranteed for you to want to watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary!","review":"A few of the reviews pretty much say it all. I kept my eyes closed half of the time, but after seeing it, it's really not all that scary.A \\"murderer\\" does not actually kill any of his victims. Instead, he makes them kill themselves by putting them in, basically, self-torture chambers. In every one of his devices, he somehow watches the victims kill themselves. Two of his victims are put in a bathroom together and chained to separate pipes.The point of this movie is to learn how grateful we should be for our lives. Definately VERY bloody, but once you see it and know what happens, you can really enjoy it (unless, of course, you like these types of movies)."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 [........] Star's","review":"Wow, what [.....] and [....] what a piece of[....], this [.....]poor, [.......].

First this is not a movie that is supposed to be like \\"The Grudge\\" or \\"The Ring\\" . This movie is not supposed to be a horror movie instead it is VERY SHOCKING AND DISTURBING. But that's exactly the filmmakers planned to do. I am not going to say anything about the story because then I will ruin the plot. All I can say is that I have now another favorite film director. James Wan who seems to be a very young and fresh director brings amazing twists to this movie. All I can say is I can hardly wait till I see his next master piece. I was completely surprised by the movie. From the beginning till the bitter surprising ending. The entire movie is done in a awesome camera work and cutscenes. It is loaded with fresh and shocking ideas. If you cannot handle blood in the fim you should not watch this movie at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"bad acting by main character, but excellent story makes up","review":"you have to realize this was a very low budget movie. so they could not afford a great actor for dr. gordon. for what they spent on this, it is an excellent movie. the ending was the best part. when you go and see this, just set aside criticisms for the acting and you will really enjoy this one. it should not be compared to seven or phone booth. the people comparing it are obviously one-minded goons who can't appreciate movies for what they are. also, if you like hapy endings, you may not like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This was probably one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched, especially with all the hype surrounding it. My friends insisted that this was a horrifying movie, and they were right- just not in the way I expected. The only horrifying thing about this movie is the acting done by a tired and bloated looking Cary Elwes. Past that, the movie just doesn't make any sense. And so far as the plot twists that so impressed my friend, they're juvenile and easy to guess or just silly. Wait for this one to come out on a premium cable channel and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The movie starts out kinda good (first 1/2 hour). Gets lost in the middle with Danny Glover running around for no reason. His character in the movie seemed pointless and reminded me in a small way of Glover in Predator 2 (sweaty and bloody, but not in as good of shape). Anyway, the acting was horrible (Cary was the WORST) and the ending was VERY predictable. If you bought this before DO NOT buy it again! If you didn't buy the first release do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this one either. Severed thumbs way down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad","review":"This movie is horrible.Its not even worth 1 star.This plot is so overused, I mean if you like this at least watch Seven you might view Saw differently, I could tell a couple college kids wrote it in 2 weeks its a simple formula for money which is a big part what the movie industry is about, but comon now.But I am going to give it a star, not as a horror movie but a comedic attempt at a horror movie, some of the scenes are friggin hillarious in retrospect, recommended for a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"u offered the saw blood cover with pics and all of it said u had it than sent the one with reg cover dont like the way your company does biz."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is it about? I don't care to know, so don't tell me","review":"this film is doesn't make sense, so it starts where two guys are locked up, it's doesn't build up at all, there already there at the beginning. I like certain things to build up, not cut to chase that soon, but I don't like certain things to build up too long, it's got to be just right. terrible ending, worse than \\"War of the Worlds\\" Ed Wood probably made better thrillers than this bloodbath crap. how does movie even in a genre, it's not horror nor suspense, it's bloodbath crap. Cary Elwes what happened to great lines like \\"hey great gift dad\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed (2.5 Stars)","review":"I thought the story itself was really good and really interesting, however, I thought the acting was lacking. It did have some intense and suspenseful moments, but not as many as I was hopping for. I also wasn't scared at all, which really suprised me seeing as how the commercials looked really spooky. All in all I was very disappointed!I did like how the movie ended, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Horrible Picture Quality","review":"This movie has a great plot but as it was one of the first released titles on Blu-Ray it has poor picture quality. If you want to show off your new blu-ray player try to get some of the more recently released titles as they have much better picture quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Creepy movie for sure but not creepy enough... The film begins out with promise and then falls apart miserably in the final 1/3 of the movie. The ridiculous sub-plot with Danny Glover was embarassing to watch. The 'who dunnit' becomes weak and fails as the writers seemingly ran out of ideas and just slapped together some mess of an ending. At times there was good suspense and some scenes were scary - but in the end, the film falls short of its goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing Thriller!","review":"Saw is a mindblowing story that really gets your mind thnking, instead of just watching teenagers get slashed up by a masked killer. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys the horror genre and enjoys and critical thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw","review":"This movie was a real mind trip to me! I love these kinds of movies. I, for one really cared about the characters which made it even better. I wanted both of them to get out alive. With all the CG **** out there now, this movie is a real treat! It kept me interested, and I like the way it all unfolded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"This movie was very run of the mill. Unless you still think speeding up the camera and fast editing are cutting edge, It reminds me of recent MTV videos. The worst part was the acting, I love the princess bride guy (Cary Elwes) but man was he bad, to his credit some of the lines he was given were absurd. The Writer of the movie (who played opposite him) was actually pretty good, but i guess its becuase i knew he wasnt a real actor so i gave him some slack.The movie starts out good enough, but it never ever hit the stride that told me it was going to be a hit, or even a cult hit. Maybe i should have given it 3 stars but i gave it 2 because i had to counter all those people who gave it 5 stars (The Godfather deserves 5 stars, not SAW!)Morgan Freeman and Ashley Judd could easily have been cast.Oh, And i do get the point of the movie, although it still does not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"This movie had very little plot and definitely was not scary.

The ideas that were put into this movie can only be thought up by a mad man, yet I believe he deserves an award.

This movie is very original and the ways the writter has Jigsaw torture these people is cool and very disturbing. Personally, I didn't see the twist at the end coming and was blown away, I think that is why this is my favorite of the Saw series. Highly recommending, but be forewarned; it's demented."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Horror Flick","review":"I'm not exactly sure why, but I hate to admit I liked this movie. It was blood, guts and gore at its very best. Halloween sets the standard in horror, as far as I'm concerned, and this is in no way on par with that movie, but it kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat. It's a simple plot filled with a lot of elaborate killings scenes. I liked it enough to rent two and three, and if a Saw four comes out, I'll rent it to. If you like horror with gore, you can't miss this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I agree with the first poster, the quality is not much better than a standard DVD.

A great thriller in every sense of the word!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good but it's not bad but the acting is just horriable","review":"This movie was not bad but it wasnet good either it's just there. The acting was really bad and I mean bad it's funny to watch them act becouse you dont believe them at parts and you want to tell them to get acting lessons. The story is ok about two men changed to the wall and they have to saw there arms or legs off to survive. The film has lots of pointless charactors and the film i found draged on at times. The film did have some disterbing and scary moments and the ending was pretty good. Overall it;s worth to watch once but it's not great or good and not as good as people where saying it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT,GREAT SCRIP AND WAS SCARY!!!","review":"I just bought & watched this movie I received this weekend, was scary, suspense, and great movie, scrip was real good.

Figure it takes 30 min to make money at a job to rent this but it takes 100 min to watch it, now you have totally wasted 130 min of your life. Watch the Exorcist or even Barney instead you will be more pleased with the end result. Only thing it had going for it was the last 4 minutes which I will not give away. But it was the best minutes out of the whole experience. Maybe they could just rent a dvd with 4 minutes on it of the ending?? I might have been more willing to pay for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc is loose in case","review":"We haven't watched the movie and I'm hoping it isn't scratched. It's loose in the case.

It delivers scares,laughter,and gore.What more can you ask for.Saw is sort of falls under the category that the exciting thriller Seven is under.The film is less phsycological than Seven and fast paced. Saw is nasty,dark,gritty,and it doesn't get any better than this. The films suspence will have you on the edge of your seat. This film is totally unpredictable and will satisy you by the end of the film. If you love horror and mystery this is the film to go see. Live or die its your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooooooooooo!!!","review":"Not entertaining in the least. I was upset I payed full price to see this movie. It will probably make it to some cult stardom, but come on. This was not scary in the least, no drama whatsoever. Somebody better look up intense in the dictionary. I probably would have fell asleep if it wasn't for fear of snoring. Any reference to Seven or Silence of the Lambs is a slap in the face to both movies. I love movies and usually really enjoy, and give credit to potential, but this had none in my eyes. You might giggle a bit but even that's streching it. Hopefully the DVD is loaded or I wont be checking this out again."},{"rating":"1","title":"too gory","review":"i usually like slasher movies, but not this gory and intense. danny glover is a better actor in the field of comedy, while the dark-haired guy has no business acting, period. other than that, the movie was pretty origional and well- thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"See \\"Saw\\"","review":"Sociopath movies usually aren't my bag but this film came recommended to me by a few unlikely sources so I checked it out. When the film started out it was suspenseful but the inevitable comparisons to \\"Seven\\" started to float through my mind. About the midway point the film kicked into second gear and delivered some twists that are superior to \\"Seven\\". Outside of an above average script for this genre type there is superb direction by James Wan. Wan really has a sense for establishing mood and paces his film well. About the only really qualm I have with the film is that the characters aren't really fully developed. For those who are a little squeamish, the film does contain some intense and grisly scenes but on the whole it doesn't go over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"gag me, kill me, do something to put me out of this misery","review":"OK! i'll be the 1st to say i wanted to see this movie more than anyone and me and about 8 friends went opening night all worked up into a frenzy over this supposidly horrorfying movie...it did absolutely NOTHING for me.

After viewing 'Saw' I came to the conclusion that it was one of the silliest movies, horror or otherwise, that I had seen in quite some time. Firstly, it's not scary in the slightest. Gory does not equal scary in my book. Also there were several unintentionally funny scenes in the movie. The silly mask that 'Jigsaw' wears was just one thing that made me laugh.

For that alone, it deserves credit.An earlier reviewer mentioned, \\"The Usual Suspects,\\" and I think that's a somewhat apt one to use. This film has no lack of possibilities as to who could be the \\"Jigsaw Killer,\\" and it really does keep you guessing until the end. There are a number of violent scenes that I wouldn't recommend for anyone who may be squeamish, but the movie doesn't get by simply on its horror.As for the ending, it's definitely interesting.

Instead of making the serial killer into something believable, he ends up being something like a Jason or a Freddie.Based on how this movie ended, you can almost guarantee they'll be a sequel that I'll be sure to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God It Isn't PG-13!!!","review":"First of all, I can't complain enough about all of the PG-13 \\"scary\\" movies coming out. Even Wes Craven's new flick has been slated PG-13. It almost sickens me. Even if Saw was completely horrible, which it isn't, it would still get points in my book for at least being R. Saw proves to be a great reminder of why scary movies need to be R.Saw is an uncomfortable psychological thriller that follows in the footsteps of David Fincher. Think of the savagery and bloodiness of Seven with the atmosphere and puzzlement of The Game. Saw is extremely well-paced, has some great visiual (often disturbing) imagery, and has an awesome ending you won't see coming for a thousand miles. And I can't stress the fact that it is rated R enough. What more do you want?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very frustrating","review":"This has got to be one of the most frustrating movies that I've seen in a long time. What mother would let a man put a gun to her child's head and then hesitate to kill him when she finally gets the gun in her possession? I found myself yelling at her to shoot him a million times and I don't even have to tell you what happened next because it was far too predictable. I was still angry after watching it because I know in real life that nobody could be so stupid. There are far better suspense thrillers out there to watch and I'm upset that I had wasted my money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"This was a great performence, shocking, thrilling, touture, enjoyment i really enjoyed it. I liked all the saws but part3 was not that good but theothers were, so this was a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful","review":"I rented this one to see if it was actually as bad as the premise would suggest. It was. Not only did I feel sick while watching this movie, I felt nauseous for the rest of the day.I'm not talking about a squeamish kind of nausea; my stomach is a strong as they come. I felt disgusted with myself for actually having watched and sat through this dog.Sadly, there was a time in my teens when I would have absolutely loved this flick.PS-- I also felt cheated by the image of a rotary saw blade on the dvd, when all they used were cheap hacksaws... big difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw","review":"Sorry but Despite it's Drama and it's So-called Horror, I don't mind gore when necessary in a Horror movie to get it's point across. but The Saw Series which By the way I have only seen up to 3 I think. Is plain torture porn, I don't like torture to such extremes, It's all it is,that and Hostel . there is no value in such a movie. And then the guy come on? oh well. maybe my bias would make others think I am crazy for not liking the movie, but I apologize it's not my type of movie, watch/rent it and see if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close....","review":"A pointless plot, bad acting and the typical Hollywood formula for teeny-bopper horror movies. The ending made the movie go from crap to MAJOR crap. This movie is very scary and disturbing - for 3rd graders....You want disturbing? You want to be freaked out for weeks after a movie? Try out some of the best, most disturbing work anywhere - look up director Takashi Miike on Amazon, then try out Audition, Gozu, Ichi, etc.But for all those who thought SAW was scary and disturbing, then forget it - you couldn't handle Miike. Try Sesame Street."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't deliver","review":"How does anyone say the Saw movies are better than Hostel,these movies don't deliver anywhere near the amoount of carnage that movies like Hostel and Wolf Creek do. These movies are soft enough for elementary kids to watch. The gore doesn't match up to Hostel and the story doesn't match up to Seven. This movie doesn't deliver on either level its suppose to."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie/bad ending","review":"I saw this movie with a friend of mine the other night and I have to admit I was really looking forward to it. I was told that it was a bit gory but it had a good plot and the ending was good as well. WRONG!!!This movie had poor acting as well as a very dark plot. There is nothing happy or satisfying in this movie. In the end, you feel very cheated and wish you had the last 100 minutes of your life back. If you are looking for a good thriller, do not see saw!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO Stupid!","review":"This movie works for about 45 minutes, then takes a horrible nose dive with some truly ridiculous plot twists. AND I was SO happy when Danny Glover got massacred in this movie. I actually stood up and clapped. Any detective who has his gun on the killer and doesn't get him, then loses him AGAIN after obsessing over the crime to the point of insanity, deserves to die. This movie was really dumb. Bad writing, bad acting (now we know where has-been actors like Cary Eiwes go to die). What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"One of the worst movies i have ever seen! I saw this movie in theaters, and almost walked out. If I hadnt had payed for the ticket, I would have. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen and the script doesnt help at all. Most of the \\"scary\\" parts will just make you laugh, because you do not develop even the slightest connection to any of the characters whatsoever. The methods of killing are mediocre at best, and, like most horror movies, the intelligence level of the lead characters is very low. The one redeeming factor of this movie is the ending, which is the only part I enjoyed. I expeced better. Thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAW is more \\"comedy\\" than \\"Horror\\"","review":"It is tradition that every year a slough of \\"horror\\" movies come out just in time for Halloween. More than not, I believe this is marketing designed to take advantage of Halloween as a tool to sell these movies. Surely there have been horror films worthy of debuting on Halloween, but SAW is not one of these.This movie had some of the worst acting I have ever seen. (I know, I know, im getting alittle ambitious for a horror flick) Some of the most ridiculous gun handling skills ever. And just plain corny!!! Dont waste your time & money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly horrifying.","review":"\\"Saw\\" appears to be a variation of the movie \\"Seven\\" or at least something like that. Neither movie is \\"pure\\" horror, but are rather thriller-based movies designed more for shock value than anything else. Sure, there is plenty of blood and gore, but big deal! I want a movie to at least try to scare me, and \\"Saw\\" didn't cut it! I found \\"Saw\\" to be rather boring and disappointing because it wasn't horrifying at all, but was in fact a rather lackluster so-called horror movie completely devoid of scares. In short, \\"Saw\\" doesn't have what it takes to be a good horror movie. It is entertaining as a thriller with some suspense, but it lacks the requisite atmosphere and style to be anything more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst movie I will ever see","review":"If you enjoy plot holes, a killer with a seemingly endless suppy of time and money to spend on torture devices and surveillance equipment and a plot twist at the end where it is discovered that the identity of the killer was not some well thought-out clever surprise, but rather some guy just pulled out of the writer's buttocks - then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst hyped film ever","review":"Ever rented a scary movie, expecting to be on the edge of your seat in fear, and instead ended up howling in laughter at each and every stupid turn of the plot? This movie had so many opportunities to impress and actually scare the viewer. I feel like Saw tried to follow Se7en's incredibly fascinating psychological theme, but failed miserably in doing so. I was terribly disappointed in the lack of analysis and plot structure surrounding the psychology of the killer. The beginning scenes tease the viewer into thinking that this is a psychological thriller; believe me, it is far from that.I didn't understand, or care, why any of the characters were acting the way they did; or what was going to happen to them. What was Adam's lesson that he was supposed to learn? Yes, the doctor needed to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I just missed something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...Just terrible!!","review":"What can I say about such a dumb movie! The whole movie is about 2 guys in a disgusting bathroom who have to save their lives...or die! It makes NO sense!!! Many times a cop will have a gun pointed at the killer, but WON'T SHOOT! I would not recommend this movie, and I'll never watch it again because it's just plain stupid! The ending is really weird and nasty..but the one word to describe the movie is DUMB!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Tessa Crigger's book, I Hear Gaea's Tears, is an extension of her own love for nature.

You describe the various words that pop up on your screen without saying it to your fellow team member, and you should see the look on people's faces when they try to pinpoint the word. It's comical - and the shouting never stops. But unlike the old pyramid game, you can get a lot of people to join in on the fun, by dividing it up into two teams.There's a really loud beeping noise that accompanies the game - and it grows more intense minute by minute, until the device buzzes, and the person left holding the unit is the one who gets the 'raspberry' sound. (There's no volume control by the way, but if you're playing this with a lot of people, and there's tons of noise, you'll have a hard time even hearing the beeping)Great party game, and good fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More phrases, please!","review":"I wouldn't be asking for MORE if I didn't love this game and find it totally addictive.

The most fun part (to me) is watching different people's thought processes and interactions throughout the game. Superb. Hilarious!That said, I wish they sold additional phrase cards, downloads, or something, or would at least come out with a \\"genus II\\" edition like Trivial Pursuit did when people started memorizing the answers to the first edition's questions. I would be perfectly happy buying an additional unit to get more phrases.Also, the scoring, reset, and power buttons aren't intuitive for new users or people who have consumed a bottle of wine.I hope the product engineers at Hasbro are reading this. Hey, that's what you get for creating a game that appeals to intelligent, inquisitive people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow! you'd think with an electronic version there'd be more clues!","review":"We used to play the card version and there were way more clues then this new version, and they come out in the same order every time if you can believe that. If they are going to take the time to make it electronic, I think they should have put a lot more clues and they should be randomized. 1000 may sound like a lot, but two rounds through each category and you've been through them all. Great game while it lasts, but c'mon Parker Brothers, don't skimp next time!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"My family really loves playing this game. First off, we don't play hot-potato style only because we kept dropping the game. Instead we split up into teams and each person on the team takes a turn doing all the phrases until time runs out then we pass it off to the next team. We keep score based on how many phrases are correctly guessed by the team vs. who is still holding the game when the timer goes off. This game is a lot of fun, but does have it's flaws. As many other reviewers have pointed out, there's no \\"off\\" switch, which would help out when traveling with it. Also, Hasbro would make a lot more money if they had a version that could be updated with new phrases (like on a memory card). After a while the phrases start to repeat.My last recommendation is to buy it at Wal-Mart for the lowest price. I have no idea why Amazon has it priced so high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough catch phrases!","review":"Compared to the original (non-electronic) game, this is a ripoff. We brought the game to a ski trip weekend. After a few hours of playing on the first night, we realized we'd \\"beat\\" the game, because we kept getting all the same phrases from the machine. I was so disappointed. Compared to the original version, there just aren't very many options. I feel like an electronic version should last just about forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"The first version of this game is one of my very favorites. I thought I was upgrading by buying the electronic version. Boy, was I mistaken. Four of us playing in one evening - less than two hours - went through ALL the words and phrases. What do we do now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game for Large Groups","review":"This game is great! We all played it at our family reunion...and it was just a BLAST!

We now use it often when we have family fun night. My children are grown with spouses, but come over and we have dinner and play this game. It's a great way to spend time together (without the TV) and have a lot of laughs. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This is a VERY fun game, my family and I all play it everytime we have a party.

I definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun for Kids of all ages","review":"I have a 9 year old and a 6 year old and they love this game. The words or phrases that come up are not too hard and have taught them additional vocabulary. The other nice thing is the game is very interactive and the kids really enjoy playing with the older kids (parents). Many games are not built for enjoyment for several age groups but this one is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all","review":"I bought this for my grandson who is 12 years old.

It is great for all age ranges (as long as they are old enough to know how to read.) This game comes in two versions - electronic and manual. I actually prefer the manual version where you have to hit the side of the game to get the word to advance (it is hilarious watching people beating on the game as the timer starts to beep faster) but most people I know like this (the electronic) version where you only have to push a button to advance the word. The electronic version is nice since you can pick a category of play (i.e., food/drink, entertainment, etc.) I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quickly Becoming Classic","review":"Catch Phrase is easily my favorite party game (and we play a lot of games!). We have been playing this since the analog days and it never gets old; I have never heard anyone say \\"I don't want to play it AGAIN!\\"If you like word games like Taboo, Outburst, or Password odds are you will enjoy Catch Phrase. It is fast paced, simple, low maintenance, can be played with large or small groups of people, and has a beeping timer (who doesn't love that?)To be fair, there are drawbacks. This kind of game is not for people who fast-paced and stressful games (chessplayers and scrabblers need not apply-ok that's probably not fair). It is also not the greatest game for kids. Other drawbacks are you have to have an even number of players, if you play it enough you get familiar with some of the words (although it has taken us 3 years of frequent play to get to this point).Fast paced and fun (teenage-adult) game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fun Game","review":"Our family loves this game. Sometimes after supper we will play a few rounds. It's great for a lot of laughs. We've played it at parties as well and it is a big hit with the guests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!","review":"I fell in love with this game ever since I saw my parents and their friends playing it at a New Years Eve party. The game is great for both kids and adults. There's even a 'Family' category, which gives easier words to guess. No matter how old you are, you're bound to love it!The only annoying thing about it is the sound, which you can't turn off or down. But if you lay it flat on the table or put your hand over the speaker while you play, then it's more than bearable.Probably the best thing about this game is that you can bring it anywhere. It's just one little electronic game. No cards, game pieces, or anything else.I would definitely recommend it for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST FUN FOR TEENS AND ADULTS","review":"This game requires you to think fast.... If you want a game that keeps everyone quiet, this is not for you...It gets very exciting and very loud....It's the most fun I've had in a long time....

Tori Amos is my big exception, I'm trying to buy all her music. I bought this because I thought I'd enjoy \\"Home On the Range\\", \\"All the Girls Hate Her\\", and \\"Over It.\\" I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the last two songs were just instrumental and there was no singing at all. Tori played very well and all, but I buy her music because I like her voice and lyrics. Home On the Range was nice, but it's just that--the song \\"Home on the Range.\\" Nothing spectacular. So, this was not Tori's best display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, I found it!","review":"I picked up this single at a used bookstore and kept my mouth shut while paying $3.95 for it. Since I had never seen this single anywhere, I figured $3.95 was probably pretty cheap for something that seemed to be quite rare. I've checked around on Ebay to see if anyone else was selling this one (just to get a feel for how many copies are out there), and I have yet to find it there. Finally, I decided to check the Tori back catalogue on Amazon and here it is! Now I know that it is an import single, though I sorta figured that's what it was anyway.This single features the original version of \\"God\\" plus three remixes. The remixes are of higher quality than some of the later remixes that came out (how many remixes of Jackie's Strength do we need?). They almost give a feeling of early Delerium work.If you don't know Tori's work, I wouldn't start with this, but for you Toriphiles out there, this is a great single to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good space opera","review":"Lost, pursued by hostile aliens, his ship disabled, Commodore Abraham Briggs has one last hope.

Hope this was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 1/2 year old son loves this bridge!","review":"I've noticed my son's favorite Thomas pieces are the bridges. He plays with this bridge more than any of the others. He's still young so the up and down of the bridge is perfect for his age. We did have a problem with the bridge not staying on the risers, but we easily fixed it. We used superglue to glue the bridge to the risers. We didn't glue the ascending pieces so that we could change the layout if we wanted. Just position the risers in the middle of the connecting pieces of track and superglue. That way the track stays connected to the bridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 year old son loves this covered bridge!","review":"I hear what the first reviewer is saying about the covered bridge falling from the supports easily, however my son absolutely loves this bridge and plays with it constantly. He loves how the trains pass through the bridge, but you can still see them through the windows. If we get tired of setting it up on the supports over and over, we just set it up so it sits flat on the table and it's still alot of fun for him. I'm recommending this covered bridge because it's a simple, fun piece for your collection.

I will wear them, but I don't care for them. (I hate returning products. Just do not like to return.)

Im very hard on watches do to Im an Auto Mechanic. I also swim allot and fish allot wich exposes watches to uv rays. Rubber watch bands end up cracking ,uv rays. Metal Bands get caught on about anything they end up breaking or the snap wears out. If you are hard on a Velcro band watch you will wear the paint off the watch face first.The reason they are hard to start is its a safety catch as a last resort in case you undo the velcro . The worst thing for a velcro band is taking it on and off. One month ago velcro band broke it ripped away from the connection to the rubber ...........I replaced it with oversized rubber band It looks way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"second rate","review":"The watch seems second rate as the strap broke after one week and the coating on the face of the watch is peeling off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Order It","review":"There is a tab on the end of the strap that prevents it from going through the buckle with out great effort.

That's unacceptable!Not sure what happened to the Timex Ironman watch brand. Too cheap to use a quality manufacturer, or they over stretched the model line and have no idea how to QA their product anymore. Probably it's both. My first Ironman watch lasted about 4 years, or until I got really bored with it, and gave it to my dad. Then he kept it for 3 more years! (Two Battery changes) The last few I have had, last about a year and began to fall apart. I am done with Timex. They have destroyed their brand with inferior product offerings.*** Kudos to Amazon's return policy! The one bright spot, was the very easy and pain free exchange process"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch, though band was short-lived.","review":"I could not be more pleased with the watch. The display is exactly what I wanted, and all of the features are really nice as well. I don't use the Flix feature. The band did begin unraveling after only six months of normal wear. I wear the watch maybe five days a week and it is hardly abused. Luckily you can change the band out for another with a spring bar that is 11/16\\" (18mm)wide. My previous watch was a cheaper Timex Ironman and it lasted about seven years- with about seven new bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it claimed to be","review":"This watch was a real disappointment. It claims to be a watch built for the active lifestyle but fails to perform. The screen is great and it displays the time pretty well too, I'll give it that, but the watch itself is built for someone with a desk job. The band literally snapped off the watch within 2 days of receiving it, and it never stays on the time either. With any wrist movement it will start shuffling through the modes and then snap off your wrist. It looks to be sturdy in the picture but watch band tie-in is a joke.Horrible watch for $50.00. My advice is take your money elsewhere. This watch is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pulp Noir radio serial in a book !","review":"Pistolwhip has an excellent use of the serial format, and the fact that it is in the preferred format of original graphic novel makes this point even better. The twists and turns of the various characters (are they characters or are they actors ?) was delightfully constructed along the lines of a serial with an ensemble cast where the characters change but the cast remain the same.We find out how the femme became fatale,how the stooge was set up for a hit job,and just who is writing the script.And how he ran away from the circus.The production of the book, as a facsimile radio/ radio manual is superb. VERY enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"So many of the topics taught in this book are the very topics my husband and I have been teaching our 3 year old daughter...looking at adults in the eye when spoken to, sharing, mealtime manners, using kind words, etc. The author has done a great job of explaning the importance of good manners.

I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading what the blurb and introduction claimed it was -- a balanced academic history that presents for the first time an unbiased account of Jerusalem's history.Unfortunately, it is anything but that. All of the \\"scholars\\" come from one perspective and many of the \\"facts\\" presented are at best misrepresentations of facts. What makes this book so insidious, however, is its very claims to balance and even-handedness. But simply claiming that you are unbiased and balanced does NOT make you such. And just because your scholars come from different countries does not mean that their views are diverse or more universal.If a KKK member wrote a book describing in academic-sounding terms how blacks were inferior, and then wrote a description of the book that described it as well-researched, balanced and even-handed, it would not cease to be a racist book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerusalem in History","review":"This book is the best book I have read about Jerusalem and its history since ancient times to the Twenty Century; one of the best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a band CD","review":"This is a pretty good pop-punk CD.

It's not as common, but girlfriends do pressure their boyfriends to have sex too. It's not completely unheard of, people.

Along with the obvious jazz influence, there is a strong R&B dynamic, including covers of Brenda Russell (\\"Piano in The Dark\\") and Gap Band (\\"Yaerning for Your Love\\") songs. For the most part, the songs are beautifully crafted and don't drag on past their usefulness like many of the pop-jazz albums that followed this release.Granted, everything on this album did not age well (\\"Magie Noir\\" and \\"Going Out\\" bookend this CD, and are as insipid as anything you would hear in a department store elevator) but it still is highly worthwhile.

It has general advice on visiting Hawaii, how to get the best deals, etc., followed by a chapter on each of the major islands. It does not cover islands a new visitor is less likely to visit, such as Lanai and Molokai. The specific chapters on each island give useful coverage of major attractions or activities, and very detailed commentary on a limited number of hotels/resorts/B&Bs. I highly recommend the book, but once you have decided to visit, I recommend that you buy specific books covering the island(s) you want to visit. If you want to spend more than a few days on a given island, you will probably want more detailed coverage than given in this book.

With this formation, Iron Maiden couldn't get anywhere. It's not their fault, only. The compositions by Harris, with Mi, Re and Do major all the time, are outclassed and boring.

A great family game or for when friends get together."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm finally in the target market segment!","review":"The first edition of Trivial Pursuit (early 80s?) was a great game that contributed to the emergence of the whole social games genre. But as a young teenager, I knew nothing about JFK's cabinet members, the rat pack, or dead movie stars, and this made the game impossibly difficult (and unbearably long). Between then and now, the questions have been modernized AND we've all gotten older and more experienced. Genus 5 is perfectly targeted at the 30ish crowd, and more playable than the original for those younger or older. The questions are fairly balanced and reasonable.As always, the metagame of Trivial Pursuit (the board part) is, well, trivial and adds little of interest to the game play. It's really just a framework for asking each other trivia questions and there is no significant strategy involved. The artwork is pretty uninspired as well.Overall, Trivial Pursuit Genus 5 Edition is a solid, more playable version of a classic game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasbro Doesn't Cut It!","review":"Parker Brothers sold the Trivial Pursuit rights over to Hasbro and they can't make a board game to save their life!

My husband who thinks he knows everything, even admitted that this game was just too hard. We found the questions to be written poorly and often misunderstood by the phrasing.

If your looking for a road to a 'good' game - then go get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for beginners","review":"Being a newcomer to the game development industry, I found this book to be very informative. The elements of game design covered in the book are pretty straightfoward, and it gives the reader a good understanding of the basics of game design documents and so on.The down side to this book is that it covers a lot of programs that you can't/won't use for making a commercial product, like GameMaker. These programs are good to learn to get an idea of how things work and link together, which is important knowledge for scripting a game, but little else can be acquired from learning them.The other bad thing about this book is that even though this is the 2nd edition, not all the files on the CD match up with the files reffered to in the book. This is a bit of a letdown, as I was hoping to see a sample of a more involved game design document.Ultimately, its a good starting point, but you'll need more books after this one for certain."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Six-year olds (with pixelated guns)","review":"Elementary graphics stuff.

Second time, today, I am looking at the watch and there is water in the chrystal and the the display has all but disappeared. Unusable! Horrible watch. I didn't even put it under water--some rain just happened to hit it while I was walking my dogs. Timex is obviously not the quality brand that it once was.

The stories go together so well, they all seem to be written by the same regency novel, so there's no jarring inconsistencies. The stories are all intertwined, and the characters see each other at the skating party, theatre, ball, as they are all ton, so you get to see the same event from several viewpoints. Lady Whistledown is wry and sly as ever. I liked them all, each stood out with very different plots and relationships. Highly recommended, and well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Julia Quinn should have written all the stories.","review":"Plot descriptions on this book's Amazon.com page.

Well I was wrong and glad that I was this was great. As you see above its four stories that kinda go together. My only problem was that maybe the forth story should have been one of the first ones. The reason was because the second story pretty much tells you how the last story turns out.

Hardly any research seems to have been done on the customs of the regency before the author(s) decided to ambitiously embark on writing about it. For all the propriety of the period, Ms Enoch's hero and herione seem to have none.Very poor writing that reminds one more of the steamy novels that are a dime a dozen.

Only imagine that in a stiff and formal era these novels are supposed to be set in, the main male and female charecters manage to have sex while they are courting (sheesh!). Georgette Heyer would turn in her grave!Perhaps these esteemed(..?) writers should devote some time to studying the era they claim to be writing about.

It is a deep well from which many of the worlds great espionage and mystery writers have drawn. What makes Goerges Simenon's Maigret so special is that he is a contemporary.

Since then, Columbia has been remastering their Greatest Hits line (B,S&T, Byrds, Donovan, etc) adding bonus tracks to boot.Chicago Records has to date failed to do the same.

Blood Sweat & Tears. Chase. They all brought brass to rock and roll of the early 70's. The longest lasting of the groups, Chicago, was also the most adventurous in their albums. While this greatest hits collection contains the singles versions, the band's talent still shines through. All these songs are well crafted and well delivered. And all of them are a welcome reminder of why Chicago was an important rock band of the early 70's.And that's the key. In the band's later albums, the horn section is irrelevant to the music. In these songs, the brass and sax are not only critical -- they rock.The only downside to this CD is you will miss out on the long versions of the songs. Otherwise, it's a treat for long time fans and a terrific introduction for those wanting a sample of the 'old' Chicago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Essential","review":"Unlike Volume Two, which is a pastiche of hits and flops, this CD contains pure gold (and platinum).

He always laughs when Treelow is listening to the radio in the first episode. Since my little guy likes to dance it's cute to watch him wiggle with the different styles of music they play. Mom & Dad enjoy it too. Not near as annoying as Barney or the Teletubbies. If you were to buy only one video get this volume. I've gotten some others at the library that he doesn't find as entertaining. When bear zooms in and sniffs him at the beginning of the shows he does the same to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages","review":"Bear in the Big Blue House is just about the best kids' program out there, and this video contains one of the best episodes! My 20-month-old son stares and dances during the \\"rap\\" song performed by Pip and Pop (the otters). The show is very fun and clever, and I often find myself watching the show as intently as my son.

My 10 month old claps when I put it on. The first story is all about dancing and the songs and music are GREAT! The second story is all about different kinds of sounds and it is also very well done.

New character names don't make a new book. Actually, there was one difference. The heroine was way more annoying in this book.

There was another title, and the blurb described a story exactly like the only one of hers I'd read. I bought it out of insatiable curiosity, and -- it *was* almost the same book. The names had been changed, situations tweaked, but the same story. Like something built from the same blueprint, just given different shutters.This one sounds like another variation on the same blueprint -- heroine in impossible predicament, becomes a prostitute for the noble cause of rescuing a parent... I won't waste any more money on anything by Bianchin. She needs to buy a new blueprint.

Once again, this group delivered! I honestly can't think of a single song that isn't pretty good. But by far, the standout songs are \\"Savin' Me\\", \\"Photograph\\", \\"Far Away\\", and \\"Animals\\". I predict that \\"Savin' Me\\" may be just as big of a hit as \\"Photograph\\". The song is slammin'! The guys are all in rare form, and as is usual, Chad Kroeger's voice is amazing. I give this CD 5 stars! Get it! You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better still...","review":"As the amount of decent songs on albums goes, this one is on the upper end. Even though the hard rock edgyness appears to have mellowed, the ballads and lyrics on this album shows a progressive maturity associated with guitar licks and drum beats to match that is reminders of a great rock time gone by...one to definately add to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good album by a pretty good band..","review":"I bought this CD off of Amazon a few months ago, listened to it, and figured it was worth the money. There are some really great songs on here, such as the hit \\"Photograph\\", \\"Far Away\\", \\"If Everyone Cared\\", and \\"Someone that You're With\\", and \\"Savin' Me\\". I really like the closing track, \\"Rockstar\\" - it's a humorous look at how people will do anything to be famous, and how selfish people can be. \\"Animals\\" is also a good song, and is probably the fastest song on here. The other songs I don't really care for; they're mostly loud and full of lyrics about voilence, etc. Overall, I think this is a good CD and worth the money, even though it's not one you'll be playing over and over again non-stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"was a great cd!

First off, they sound like a total rip off of Creed, which already gives them 2 Strikes, second off, the musicanship is horrid, and the only good thing is there is a solo done by \\"Dimebag Darell\\" which was sent in by Vinnie Paul, for the band to use. Even though I will admit, they do write some catchy tunes, its something that we have all heard a million times before, and like most of these flash in the pan bands, they will be long forgot in a few years. I really cant recomend this band to anyone, except maybe to teens and younger, that want some real simple rock, otherwise its just awful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rock Album in Awhile","review":"Although there are many other good artists out there, this is one of the best albums to come out in a long time. It is more of a popish/alternative type of music as opposed to hard rock like metallica or a more alternative linkin park. If you are not afraid to like popular music than this is a great album. I know a lot of people shun popular bands in the rock and roll industry, but these guys are good. You won't waste your money and you can still rock out to it with your kids around, but it's okay to go with your windows down with it as well. I give it 5 stars. Go buy it!

The addition of a Dimebag solo on this album is rock blasphemy. It would be the same if a Hendrix solo was featured on a Hanson album. Send these lame tw*ts back to Canada.

At this point I would be shocked to see them put out anything that wasn't top. My favorite song on the album would have to be \\"Fight for All the Wrong Reasons\\". \\"Photograph\\" is amazing as well as \\"If Everyone Cared\\". \\"Rock Star\\" is hilarious and so true. \\"Animals\\" gets me totally worked up and so does \\"Follow you Home\\".

Chad's voice is really cool and strong, and I enjoy the mix of piano that is in a few of the songs. Interesting change and mix up on their work.But the other tracks just don't do it for me, too much \\"screeching\\" guitar or \\"yelling\\", not singing from Chad. Yes I know...you diehard Nickleback fans will be up in arms with that last statement. But that is just my take on it, if you like \\"Someday\\", \\"Hero\\" and now \\"Savin' Me\\", you will probably love this album too...just perhaps not the whole thing.But thanks to Chad and the rest of Nickelback, it is a pretty creative album, that really soars when it tries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"pure talent","review":"if you love classic rock you will love this band these guys are a great rock and roll group . i will probably have to buy a second cd because i play this so much.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent and diversified","review":"For those who enjoy the style of Nickelback's music and lyrics, this album will not disappoint.

Variety is something that I look for in a band and the band certainly lacks this on this album. Dont get me wrong, I am a Nickelback fan, just not of this album. One of the songs sounded like country to me(Rockstar), what in the world?? Some of their songs off their new cd are cool but yet they sound like songs off the previous album; this isnt good at all. So if you like listening to the same thing over and over by a band then go ahead and buy this cd.

Let's face it, the beloved songs, \\"How You remind Me,\\" \\"Someday\\", and \\"Photograph,\\" all sound exactly the same. There newest album seems like they didnt put any effort into it at all. I just dont understand why a band chooses not to mature their sound and lyrics. Front man Chad Kroeger still uses his cheesy, uninspired lyrics. Nickelback isnt the only band that does this. Other bands that do this are, Trapt, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, and Theory of a Deadman. I dont even need to describe the album, fans who own Silver Side Up will know what the album sounds like."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Guys Have Become Way Too Big","review":"Nickelback churn out release after release of poor derived pop rock dribble. There is nothing new from the band, no new angle, no change. It's precisely the same monotonous punchy chord guitar playing, grainy whiney vocals and horribly clichéd lyrics that featured on the previous four albums.What makes Nickelback all the more insulting is the undeserved popularity. I was over in Canada a little while ago and on one of their rock stations a poll took place, their \`rock world cup', this match up was Nickelback vs Pearl Jam, and you guessed it, Nickelback stormed it. Such an insult to Pearl Jam, an original band that Nickelback completely rip the sh*t off.Quite simply Nickelback's music is mediocre, theres nothing worth listening to. Do yourself a favour and listen to some original guitar driven rock, par example \`Soundgarden' or \`Alice In Chains'."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Photograph\\" is good, but the rest: pretty awful for the most part","review":"Wow-I can't believe I am the only one not impressed with this CD-but from the looks of the other reviews, I seem to be! With the exception of a few songs, I think this CD is really weak. I forced myself to listen to it in its entirety, and when I got to the song about his stripper girlfriend being groped by other people, I was overcome by the urge to return the CD for a refund. If I hadn't been suckered into buying the CD it would have been funny. Some of these songs are absolutely awful and suffice it to say, I am NOT impressed.I would say about half the songs are ok, but the other half are horrendous. And sorry, but that's not good enough, especially when the songs that are bad are laughably, ridiculously terrible. When I spend my money on a CD, I expect better than this, and it seems like Nickelback should be able to deliver, but they certainly didn't this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst band out of canada...in fact worst band i have ever heard period...","review":"This album is terrible from beginning to end. The lyrics are extremely shallow and cheesy. The music is over produced and predictable. This album is full of pop hooks that are way over used and once again predictable. Chad Kroegers voice makes me want to hurl. All in all there is nothing good to attribute to this album. To sum it up it is boring, shallow, poppy, predictable, instrumentally weak, and it truly gives rock music a terrible name. Thanks a lot Nickelback. Thanks for ruining rock music. Terrible album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is horrible!!!!","review":"Wish they broke up like Creed did.I think nickleback are the worst \\"rock\\" band right now.

This type of meaningless boring music should be played at the prison camps in Quatanama Bay to inmates for punishment, but it would end up punishing the soldiers way too much plus it would be more inhumane than just about any other tactic.

Same recycled ideas, same generic songs, same gravelly-sounding lead vocals. When are they going to come up with something new? \\"Photograph\\" is already one of the most overplayed songs in the U.S.Why does Nickelback get so much airplay in this country? What makes this band or this lead singer any more distinctive than any other band that's out there right now? Can there be that many actual requests for Nickelback songs?I think this band gets a lot of airplay in the U.S. because its \\"safe\\" music - it stays inside the bounds.

It is not fair. Where has the talent gone? Everytime I turn on the radio I hear this band. The lead singer sounds like he is constantly constipated and the guitar licks are pitiful. Maybe they need to spend time with Eric Clapton or Neil Young to find out how to write a decent rock song.

Even though their newest catalog release has more of a pop essence than their previous attempts, they have managed to do something else: ride the new pop-metal wave. Pop-metal, first created by newer alternative bands such as Seether or Evanescence, has seen it's share of ups and downs. This is most definitely an up. It has amazing riffs, powerful vocals, and an arsenal of great radio tunes. Normally, I don't condone the pop revolution, but in the case of pop-metal, these guys have given it a decent name in recent years. Granted, you eventually get a little worn out by constant airplay, but it never stops me from occasionally popping this disc in my drives and just rocking out. Even the over-played \\"Rockstar\\" has it's kicks. Other than that sad attempt known as \\"Photograph,\\" I can honestly say that every track on this album is worth hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Album","review":"How is the cd ranked a 4 out of 5 stars? I must be the only person that notices that all of their songs sound exactly alike. These guys used to be good and have an edge to them, that is the first two albums of theirs.Now I cant stand it when they come on the radio. Photograph, Rock Star and Saving Me, all are pop songs. Anyone could write those lyrics. Chad Kroeger's voice is also getting really irritating on every album and the guitar playing isnt that great either.I wish they would go back to their old ways and start singing the darker songs they used to be known for. Their last 3 or 4 albums have all been dumbed down radio friendly efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new to offer","review":"The nu-metal genre has long overstayed its welcome.Nickelback's new album has nothing new to offer.Instead of buying this new album, you could simply take any other Nickelback album and listen to it (or not...) and you would experience the exact same thing.

I regret the fact that I had to sell it, it was part of my CD collection, but what I particularly regret is that it was God awful nasty to begin with.

I can just about decide for myself that this album is just like their other 4-5 albums before (released and unreleased). It all sounds alike, and the lyrics are about the same things generally (with the same words), so if I bought this cd I'd probably just archive it and never listen to it. I could be wrong, you never know. ONE of their songs might be totally revolutionary, but considering their past albums I find that VERY hard to believe.Don't waste your money on this cd, borrow it from a friend and make a copy if you're that much of a NB fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Compared to thier other C.D's this one is barely worth listening to. The lyrics you could find being sung by any other band and it appears as if Nickelback has lost all of thier originality.

Perhaps thier next C.D will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"all the right reasons","review":"What can u say about nickelback there is so many different things.

Have you ever ventured out beyond the music of your radio stations and found music with real meaning? Music which doesn't take direct aim at the pockets of the average joe. This by no means should come under the category of hard-rock or metal. This is pop all the way baby.There is so much to hate about this band - Kroeger's voice is akin to the noise you make when you scratch your nails down a blackboard, word has it his voice is put through a synthesizer as well to make it sound decent (not that a synthesizer will do the job). The three chord songs which all sound the same. With lyrics like \\"I like your pants around your feet\\" and that song about having a house on mtv cribs. I actually feel compelled to buy a ticket to Canada so I can punch Kroeger in the face.The music industry is going downhill at a rate of knots, and as long as bands like Nickleback are around, it will continue to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corporate generic subaverage CD filler, with no substance","review":"I don't care for these guys, but I never knew why until I realized that the \\"singer\\" is using some kind of VoCoder on his vocals. Yep, the singer's voice is as fake as Ashlee Simpson. Don't believe me? Listen to the vocals really careful. Doesn't it strike you that he NEVER misses pitch or timbre. It sounds really like he's running his voice through a keyboard or something to bring it up to pitch.Hey, that's OK. Music SUCKS these days, and Nickleback is just another example of corporate record companies MANUFACTURING the product at any cost. \\"Let's make these boys BIG even if we have to enhance the sound for them.\\" Gawd, why does music SUCK so bad these days? two words; Nickel and Back."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Chords + Radio Contracts + Big Label Promotion = Big $$$$$","review":"That must be what the record companies were thinking.

The rest of the songs are the same whether you look at them from teh 4/4 or teh same 5 chords.Peace.P.S.

I recommend acquiring their 1st single (Photograph) and leaving the whole album on the shelf. I love Nickelback, and I'll purchase their next album. That being said, this one is horrible. Photograph is one of the only decent tracks (\\"Rock Star\\" is fun, and \\"Fight For All The Wrong Reasons\\" is cool musically). Unacceptably simple lyrics and boring music characterize this cd. I am very let down. Better luck next time, guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music to my ears!","review":"This particular CD of Nickelback I really enjoyed.

It physically pains me to know that this unholy garbage has received 5 star reviews. 1 star is WAY to many stars. If the lead \\"singer\\" was standing here right now, I'd kick his ass.

Leave this one for the casual radio listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...","review":"FM radio introduced me to Nickelback, thus my reluctance to purchase any of their discs. After their 3rd or so hit, I succumbed and bought Curb and The Long Road. I was still unimpressed. It seems like Chad Kroeger has stumbled onto a \\"formula\\" for hook-ey three and a half minute songs that will be hits.But this album changed my mind. Yeah, I know-the \\"hooks\\" are still there, but so is the musicality. This is probably their heaviest album, and that's why I'm enjoying it.Vinnie donating a Dimebag solo didn't hurt either (Side of a Bullet had me googling and discovering Pantera and Nickelback were solid friends).So....If you're the 2 star reviewers complaining about redundant formulaic rock...yeah-it's still there BUT it's a bit heavier and more musical.I gave it 5 stars because I can't get 3 of the songs out of my head. That's an achievement in itself with my listening habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step backwards","review":"After Three Solid Records (all of which seemingly better than the last) Nickelback have finally met their match and put out a record that did not fully meet my expectations. That isn't to say that \\"All The Right Reasons\\" isn't enjoyable, because it is, but after \\"The Long Road\\", I expected better. A couple of fillers (side of a bullet, follow you home) do little to hinder the overall flow of 'reasons', and the standouts (far away, photograph) more than make up for them anyway. So all in all, 'reasons' is a solid record. Just don't expect it to be as good their older records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Consistent Effort","review":"Of all the post-grunge rock bands, Nickelback is the one I seem to always come back to. I couldn't stand Creed and Nickelback at least seems to be able to take over the throne that Creed once sat on. On one hand, if you're a Nickelback fan, you'll love this album. Kroeger is very talented at writing consistently catchy rock songs. Some folks either love or hate his voice, but it's something I can get into pretty easily. Lyrically, these guys aren't breaking any new ground. Every album they've released has some juvenile wordplay and you wonder if Kroeger actually ever slaps his inner child back into maturity. That flaw aside, if you're a fan of their last major releases (Silver Side Up and The Long Road) you'll probably be as happy with this as I have been. Catchy and upbeat? Definitely. Though-provoking and ground-breaking? Try System of a Down.

Who goes around blasting Creed, Poison, Cinderella, Ratt, or C&C; Music Factory? This band will be forgotten just like these others.It's textbook rock ballad garbage with no thought or feeling put into the song writing.

That and \\"side of a bullet\\" (which has a touch of Shinedown and Seether's styles) prompted my purchase and I knew I could throw \\"Photograph\\" and the other slow songs on my ipod's easy listening setting.

There was every song, different names, different lengths.I listened to the first song, and all was well. I then moved on to the second song.It was the exact same song? I knew I couldn't be mistaken. Surely every song would have its own unique attributes to differentiate from the others. I went on to the next song, and then the next...but every single one was the exact same.I called my friend who had suggested the CD, but she said her CD was fine and that maybe something was wrong with mine.

Black Mirror is about a girl named Frances who was a resiprient of a scolarship program. But after her brother Daniel commits suicide, she just can't get over it. She feels that it's some how her fault. But all isin't quite what it seemes: something deeper is going on here.All in all this was a pretty good book. I've read better, but also much much worse. It's a some what dark book about a depressed young women trying to find her way. Black Mirror has a well thought of plot, though it can be somewhat confusing at times. This may be a good book to try just for the sake of trying it. Hope you like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Werlin is in a class by herself!","review":"Ms. Werlin has a sure hand with psychological suspense and for creating and relating to teenaged characters.

The author would often jump from one time period to another, and after about four or five chapters I would get so confused. Also the author didn't use much detail and its hard to understand whats going on when theres not a clear picture in your head. The plot was thought out very well, but would often not stay on track.

Walden Farms is really a hit and miss operation.I think this stuff is probably my least favorite of their products I've tasted so far. What makes no sense is that the ingredients that might add alfredo-esque taste, if they would choose to employ them in the recipe, aren't caloric. Spices and salt would go a long way toward making this stuff edible.I will add that though the sauce is also as thin as h-e-double-hockey-sticks, I can deal with that in a zero-cal food. That's a sacrifice I can live with. But it's the sickly-sweet flavor and the lack of any sort of savory component that makes this stuff such a startlingly-awful flop. I suspect there's a whole lotta Splenda goin' on in this stuff. Give it a pass and just thin out some other bottled \\"lite\\" alfredo sauce using fat-free milk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleck!!!","review":"I'm afraid I have to agree with all the other negative reviews here. Maybe if I added my own Parmesan and butter to this sauce it would be at least tolerable. But if I have to do that then whats the point.

I cut it with sour cream and it didn't help matters, and adding extra seasoning (a lot of extra seasoning) did help for as long as the sauce was kept near boiling, but as soon as it cooled down any, it went back to smelling and tasting disgusting. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walden Farms Alfredo Sauce","review":"This was terrible! Don't buy it. I would rather eat air! I can't even describe how it tasted.

Instead of the signature nicely crafted testino shoots that he's known for, we got tons of over-blown blurred cityscape snap shots that wouldn't even fit the wall of a DKNY shop! If this is another publication that is supposed to show \\"the other side\\" of the testino spectrum, like his previous books. Then it only shows that even a god can be mortal if he doesn't try.completely overpriced with a un-necessarily large format to round up the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Testino","review":"This a one of the books that I find disappointing.

A lot of the sentences are tortured and long winded, with lots of extra adjectives and adverbs, etc.The other problem I had is that there was very little about designing women and its making. Major parts are about her childhood, etc. which was of no interest to me. Much of the book are her opinions on things that are of little importance, and her ideas on everything are very old fashioned. My guess is that the only women who will like this book are in the 65 plus range.The one part of the book I liked was that she copped to having 2 facial cosmetic surgeries to be on Designing Women.You would do better to just talk to any older woman over 60 and ask what her childhood was like, and save your money on this book.If you are interested in Designing Women stuff, the Delta Burke book has more info on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite so far","review":"It's a cute series.

I'm not big on tribute cover collections but I was blown away by a few of the selections here.I have no idea who Hederos and Hellberg are, but they have created a heartbreakingly beautiful rendition of It Ain't Me Babe. Hear a snipet of it on fye dot com. It's just mesmerizing. And It Ain't Me is not even one of my favorite Dylan songs. Neither is Spanish Harlem Incident, but there's an amazing take on it here. And that's the joy of these 2 CDs. Shot of Love is another example -- with a hoe-down flavor treatment that's a lot fun. Another stand out is the hymn-like Dark Eyes. Eight of the tracks here were recorded excusively for this compilation.Well worth checking out if only for a few amazing cuts and a bunch of fun ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the brand, watch is great - but not perfect","review":"I am a big fan of the Locman brand and this watch was a great price.

It takes place beginning with Alexander's capture and sacking of Thebes. The mystery was who killed the commander of the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea prior to the attack, and who keeps on killing after the battle. There's also a side mystery about a crown of Oedipus in a shrine.This is good, but I think that A Murder in Macedon was better. The subplot about the crown was there to make the great king look bad, IMHO.All-in-all, not a bad mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I would have liked to give this book a 2.5, but that option is not available & it's not good enough for a 3. That said, I am an enormous fan of Paul Doherty, but not of this particular series. His more recent series with Alexander is far, far better. There are just too many historical inaccuracies and too much license taken with actual historical facts. Miriam (the detective) is a dreary, drab, unbelievable little squab of a character (Jews at the court of Philip? Female at that? I doubt it!!).However, Paul Doherty is a wonderful writer and I would give everything else I have read by him a 4.5 or 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mental alertness without caffeine, HOOAH!","review":"I love this taste even better than the punch:tropical.

He loves to see my face crinkle up and laughs when I say, \\"How can you drink that stuff?\\" There was no funny face when I tried this one. This drink tastes like lemon water. It doesn't have that \\"thick syrup-y\\" texture that many others have and there is no bitter after taste. After tasting it, I read the label. No Caffeine, 45% of the daily value of vitamin C--Hooah. You can bet that these will be in my fridge next to the milk and OJ. I have finally found an Energy Drink that I can confidently pack in the motocross and cheerleading gear bags.

It's also quite normal to want to do it. In my opinion, all CDs until Terry's death (after Chicago XI) are really great, each in their own way. I cannot really \\"compare\\" III with V, etc. It would be like comparing Jennifer (my ex-girlfriend) with Michelle (or with Laura). They are all women, but each one has her own unique intriguing style.Chicago V is excellent and recommended. Almost every song is an absolute gem.

With that said, Power was my 1st introduction to Steve Morse's guitar playing and he was phenominal with this band. I thought his style worked perfectly. I never missed the violins.

I paid $5 for my copy, and that was $5 too much. The pictures are simply ugly..dim colors, and poor quality photographs. The tapestries bear little resemblance to anything related to tarot symbology. There are needlessly huge white borders around the photographs on each card, which makes the deck look even worse. The card stock quality is poor, and the cards are awkwardly sized...large and square, with square corners instead of rounded off corners as most decks have. It is nearly impossible to shuffle these cards. I tried to use this deck a few times but quickly grew to hate the sight of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its an experience","review":"I am a tarot reader and enthusiast and have been for a long time. I have never found a deck that actually repulsed me. I opened the box and the feeling of revulsion to these was incredible. It's definitely not a deck I can use--and most of the people I have shown have had the same reaction. Some of the cards are downright creepy. The tapestry theme is a great idea and the cards do look like mini-tapestries done as a collage--colors are vivid and clear but its not a \\"friendly\\" deck to me. I can't even do a reading with them to try them out how they feel in that manner. I wish others better luck than me."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I hear global capitalism one more time...","review":"I approached this book with some hope that it would yield help in understanding the great truths of \\"Christ in you, the hope of glory\\", the \\"new self\\"; and many of the other profound distinctives of this letter. I was even open, as a stalwart conservative evangelical, to stretch my orthodoxy to make it more generous, but what I got was an effort to make every word of Colossians fit the neo-liberation theology agenda of its authors. Let the book say what it says, not what you had hoped it would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described.","review":"I buy used books often based on how well their condition is in the listing.

Quite frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Marxist","review":"I was excited to read this book as it is on the reading list for a theology course at Wheaton College. It didn't take me long to figure out Walsh and Keesmaat are theologians who like to write from a \\"new perspective\\" that is really the same old political liberalism of the left. They just don't get it. After reading their views on 9/11, the US Military, their praise of food coops, and their negative comments about coroporate America I am surprised they do not teach at Berkeley on the left coast. The Gospel really is simple; they make it synonymous with the liberal agenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed My Life","review":"I have always loved the book of Colossians, now I know why. Brian Walsh has written a most excellent book on what it means to live in a subversive way that embraces the cross of christ and speaking prophetically against the culture that we are living in. I can not recommend this book enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Empire\\" equals capitalism?","review":"Brian Walsh and Sylvia Keesmaat would have us believe that the empire of the 1st century is the equivalent of capitalism in the 21'st century. I give them their due as biblical scholars, but neither has a working knowledge of the industrial revolution nor capitalism. There exists in this book too much mindless railing against the \\"empire\\" of post modern times. There is no effort to compare and contrast the Roman empire and the democracies of today (as it would not serve their arguments).

My 5 year old son got it for Christmas from someone and also got the regular Bop-it. He likes them both, but the Heads Up Game doesn't frustrate him and gives him some confidence. It gets challenging because it speeds up the better you do, but it gives you a good trial period before it does. My 2 year old also likes it and picks it up a lot, but can't really manage to play it without help. I've had other 5 years olds to the house who couldn't put it down. The regular Bop-it does frustrate younger kids a bit, this game is better for the young ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Every Xmas season, it seems there is one big flop of a toy... the award this year goes to this toy.

Short, light rock songs that you'll forget in a day or so. I do like the hit, \\"If You Leave Me Now\\".Maybe it was because I didn't grow up during this album but I find it and XI pretty boring. Hot Streets was a improvement probably because I like the glossier production better and the disco/funk. Their creative ways were behind them but thankfully this slump didn't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stank.","review":"This book succeeded in being weird while at the same time remaining completely pointless throughout. To make matters worse, it had pretensions of contributing to the serious and well established genre of the ghost story. Of course, how good could any novel be in which the main character is a part time Hollywood producer part-time adventurer named \\"Richard Storm\\"? Or sentences such as: \\"He clasped Sophia against him, felt the warmth of her body there, drank the warmth of her body in with his.\\" This book has \\"pulp\\" written all over it. None of this would be so bad if this book were more fun and not so gross and violent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book did not have much of a plot to it. It was also a downer for a reason I shouldn't divulge but it has to do with the circumstances of the hero which made a happy ending out of the question (there goes suspense). Klavan cannot compete with Dan Simmons, Dean Koontz, or Peter Straub. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately, Who Cares?","review":"I finished \\"The Uncanny\\" last night. After a promising start the book became long, mysterious (not in a good way), muddled, and boring. Although there were flashes of good descriptive writing, I didn't feel that the story held together. The characters were vague and uninteresting people. And no final, acceptable explanation of the \\"why\\" behind the mystery emerged. Who was Iago? How/why did Storm's movie create him? How did he react when the triptych burned?? Who--or what--was \\"the Uncanny?\\" I was left feeling like I'd walked into a private conversation and was never included in what was going on, and ultimately I grew tired of reading and didn't care. Klavan needs to be a little less mysterious in future efforts to hold me as a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than its reputation here....","review":"I'd like to preface this by saying that this is the first of anything that I've read by Andrew Klavan; thus, I'm not burdened by Klavan's other novels. Hey, \\"True Crime\\" may be a masterpiece, and \\"Animal Hour\\" could be fantastic, I don't know. I did read this novel, \\"The Uncanny\\", however, and I was very pleased with it.I profess a weakness (like Storm in the novel) for English ghost stories, so perhaps the novel spoke to me more so than my fellow reviewers here. Overall, I found the book to be well-written and very interesting. It wasn't scary, as some of the others have pointed out, but I don't think Klavan was trying to upstage King here. What he's written is an interesting and entertaining thriller, filled with some clever supernatural / occult additives, and the result is entirely pleasing.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pale Ghost","review":"Andrew Klavan is a talented writer who has given us two really exceptional books: \\"True Crime\\" and \\"The Animal Hour.\\" In those books, Klavan created characters and situations that were complex, puzzling, interesting, and original. With \\"The Uncanny,\\" Klavan attempts to revamp the traditional ghost story by setting it in modern times and giving us \\"hip\\" characters like Richard Storm and Sophia Eberling. Somehow, for me, it just didn't work. The setting at the \\"Bizarre\\" magazine was novel, but not all that interesting. The ghost story itself was lame and poorly conceived. Although the book has flashes of brilliance, they are far too few, and overall, you're left with a rather unsatisfying ghost story.

Christina Amphlett howls viciously and cooes sweetly from one breath to the next and doesn't miss a beat.For rock historians, The Divinyls pay tribute to AC/DC svengalis, Vanda & Young on this album by covering their Easybeats classic, I'll Make You Happy, in a tough and thumping rendition.If you only buy one Divinyls album make sure its this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desperately Dull","review":"Bland pop in the style of Roxette, the band is best know for the novelty hit \`I Touch Myself', which is NOT on this album.

The stories seemed shallow and what depth there seemed to be was only because the author used the same phrases over and over again in several stories. How many ways can you say the same thing? Also, the stories were great if you're from Seattle or that area...they would have a broader appeal if she picked some areas outside of Washington. But overall, the writing was not up to her usual par and despite the interesting subject matter, they fell flat.Maybe Number 7 will be better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for Ann Rule fans","review":"I became an avid reader of Ann Rule's true crime, but her case files seem to be thinning out. Worse yet, she seems to have been distracted while writing this paperback. The name of it suggests that the major story within is called \\"A Rage to Kill\\" but there is no such story in the book. She has some minor gaffs in the writing (pleading guilty by reason of insanity?) that make you wonder if she proofread it. The Bus to Nowhere could have been called The Story to Nowhere, because she didn't go any further into the killer's motives than pointing out that he was a sloppy housekeeper with no job (I fit one of those qualities). While her earlier works were derived from more sensational stories, these are little more than cleaning out the closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"Ann Rule is great in her manner of writng. She keeps it simple, but gets deep into the subject matter. Just wish she had more books out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"As a lifelong resident of Washington State, I feel like Ann Rule is our criminal Historian. This book deals with several crimes that happened either before I was born, or when I was very young (consequently, when my father was a Seattle Police Officer). It's very interesting how Rule helps to show how the victims were real people, with real family and friends and real lives....she shows that crime can happen to anyone. This was definitely hard to put down until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chakra Clearing gone wrong . . .","review":"I agree with the writer from Arizona. This CD could be much better. The concepts are wonderful I would've just liked more clearer guided visualizations with pauses. Doreen Virtue seemed to breeze through the exercises and talk so much that I found it difficult to relax and visualize what she was saying. True, her need to properly enunciate every syllable in every word was distracting and her voice is not the soothest, unfortunately. A more relaxed approach would've been great instead of her reading off her script. I think I'm going to go with the other writer and possibly just make my own tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"The content is fine. But the music, if you can call it that, is just terrible. It sounds like it's warped or something. Doreen's voice does not soothe or flow.

This tape is very strong with guidance and energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok For Very Basic Intro","review":"Having listened to this CD I was not impressed at all.

I became uneasy listening to this meditation after one listen.May I strongly suggest Colette Baron Reids CD \\"Journey Through The Chakras\\".I have found no chakra CD even remotely as superb.Colettes voice is angelic and after many weeks of listening I still find her refreshing. The sound track is heavenly and deeply moving.Her website has many meditations free for listening.You will NOT be disappointed.I guarantee that you will be fulfilled.JG"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and effective","review":"Doreen Virtue explains everything about the chakras, and how to take care of them. She gives several methods to clear them, long or short meditations. Her language is clear, her tips are efficient and she does not talk too much about herself!

It outlines the presence and influence of John Muir, President Teddy Roosevelt and various officials and politicians as the National Parks developed. It also touches on the presence and exiting of the Indians who lived there.It also shows the presence and influence of private business and companies seeking profits from taking the parks natural resources for their own parochial interests.As historically interesting as this is, the DVD set misses the mark as it does not provide as much of the beauty and stunning landscapes of the National Parks as expected.Jon Green"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Concept?","review":"The film makers tell us that the National Parks are 'America's Best Idea' because here, unlike Europe, the parks are established by The People -- not by the wealthy, entitled nobility. Then, they proceed to tell us about how this park or that one was brought into being as the result of the efforts of this or that wealthy, powerful and/or politically connected person. Wow, way to undermine what was supposed to be the central theme of your film, guys.I think fifteen or twenty sepia-toned images of people standing or sitting at the edge of a cliff is sufficient; sadly, the film makers don't seem to agree with me. Weren't we told in the promo piece that ran on PBS prior to the release of the series that these guys filmed in the parks for years?

It seems like any half-talented junior college student could have pieced together this DVD with grainy, archival footage and lousy voice over. How come we see so little of the desert too?

Why? The program that could have been marvelous was completely ruined for me by the incessant background noise, ugly noise, of twanging guitars playing on and on and on and on and on, even when people were speaking. It was so obnoxious and my relief was so great when, for a short while, the noise stopped, that I decided I simply couldn't take it any longer and turned off the TV. If somehow you could keep the narration and get rid of the background noise the program would be fine. But I am sure that can't be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"written picture","review":"It describes so vividly the backstreets of South Korea that you can see the pictures by reading.

This may not be the case with CHICAGO VI, but it does contain 2 of their biggest radio hits, \\"Just You 'N' Me\\" (a song that really pointed in the direction the band would increasingly follow) and \\"Feelin' Stronger Every Day\\" (an incredibly uplifting tune that builds in intensity from its beginning right to its EXPLOSIVE finale). I LOVED these songs when they first came out, and still do! In addition, we have the horn section playing behind wonderfully melodic ballads (\\"Critics Choice\\") love songs (\\"In Terms Of Two\\") and even a political protest song that sounds an awful like like a Temptations tribute, right down to singing in different octaves (\\"What's This World Comin' To\\"). Pretty good for a \\"pop\\" album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bed set","review":"I purchased the entire set along with sheets and decortive pillows. Everythiing came in a timely fashion.

Pretty much you act out in different emotions and people have to guess which emotion you are. What makes it funny is the the types of sentences you have to say with emotion (Imagine having to say your first pet was a gorilla while emoting jealousy). The actual game play isn't too brilliant but it is quick and you'll have fun seeing who in your group is truly the theatrical type. It's not who you think I'd bet. Would be great for a drama class or group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun","review":"I bought this board game 4-5 years age when I was diagnosed with a spacial learning disorder where I had trouble reading facial expressions and tones of voices thinking that it might help me pick up on the subtle differences between things like tension and anger.

What a complete waste of my money and my time. There was absolutely no information in here that an average automotive racing fan wouldn't already know. I suppose for a completely new driver there's some redeeming value, but if you're over age 16 forget it. My favorite part was the five-minute explanation of the importance of fuel quality by a Shell representative (the title sponsor). Wow, thanks, that will really help me at my next track day! Add to that the gratuitous shots every few minutes of a Shell tanker truck parked near the racetrack, and you get the idea. Save yourself the aggravation and the expense. Don't buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money, this DVD only covers very basic things at a very high level and is more like a sales brochure than an actual instructional video.

The teapot holds heat well, it's pretty and makes a great cup of tea. The only drawback if you want to call it that is you don't use the teapot to boil water. If the teapot boils water it is actually a tea kettle. With a teapot the water is boiled somewhere else and then poured over the tea leaves in a basket in the teapot and steep the tea for 3 to 5 minutes. You then remove the tea leaves and basket and enjoy your tea. All news to me as I thought you boiled the water in the teapot. Darn thing is cast iron and weighs a ton so I thought you could boil water in it - Wrong. Fortunately, she still liked the teapot so it wasn't a deal breaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me..I'll keep looking","review":"I am willing to spend the money because I have sensitive skin if it is a good product. . . but this one caused me to break out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"Since Laura Mercier seems to be a respected name in cosmetics, I expected a lot more. The appearance was fine but I found the foundation very difficult to apply. I tried with a sponge, with my fingers and also with and without foundation primer and I found it difficult to apply smoothly. It took a lot longer than my regular foundation (L'Oreal) to apply and the end result looked basically the same~ for a lot more money. I will definitely not buy this or Laura Mercier's primer again.

Their sound is less thrashy and more death metal; the vocals are the gurgly death type, and there are more slow, grindy bits than Vader tends to do, but otherwise they\`re very much alike. It\`s well produced, well written and well played, and superiour to much of what\`s been released lately from the bigger names in the business. In short, if you like Vader, or quality death/thrash, you should probably like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"If you read the product description and are intrested in this movie then I guessing you probaly interested in the potential for titilation. Unless you're someone who thinks spanking is the best thing that can happen in a movie, the you'll be disappointed by this movie. There is no nudity, no S&M, and the acting isn't as good as what you can find in a porn movie.

And I sure can't be mad at them for doing anything to encourage our youth to read.I can however blame myself for plunking down dollars on such a blatantly crass waste of time and dinero. The book has about as much depth as a kiddie pool, and is roughly as entertaining as a Jr. High school newspaper.Then again, that's what was expected. Winston Churchill she ain't. So, it's not Cita's fault, it's mine for somehow expecting better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it takes to read it","review":"If you find the computer animated Cita from the BET show Cita's World offensive then this book won't change your opinion.

For anyone else it's not worth the time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"To The Point","review":"Cita's world is definetly a book that young generation should pick up. Well I take that back. It's a book that men and ladies should read. Cita has always kept it real. She gives it to you straight. Down to earth if you like it or not. Many sista's bashes the brotha's, but the sista's are the ones that have many issues. There are many young females that does not conduct themselves like young ladies, however, it's a turn off for brotha's. We all should carry ourselves in a respectful manner.

Pay the money and get the real thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd, yet interesting","review":"This book is first and foremost of great interest to students of the arts, illustrating the social climate in which German artists between the World Wars worked and its effect on their art. Additionally, it should also interest hard core true crime buffs. There are plenty of interesting tidbits about Peter Kurten and Fritz Haarman, two of Germany's most twisted citizens, and it is fascinating to see how their crimes influenced German attitudes, reflected in the violent art that the region produced. One could draw parallels to modern American society's current attitudes towards serial killers, but that's another book entirely."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great live rock albums","review":"This is my first CD review (usually I write math. articles), but I just had to set things straight after having read some negative reviews. Don't belive it. This triple CD is one of the best live rock recordings ever(on a par with Deep Purple's \\"Live in Japan\\" or Rare Earth's Live album)! It is rough and wild and beautiful, and fortunately not digitally \\"re-mastered\\". There are those superb vocal moments of \\"Does anybody really know what time it is?\\", \\"Color my world\\", \\"I am a man\\", \\"Beginnings\\" and others, great piano, flute, and guitar solos, there are many 10 minute or so intense instrumental passages. Some of those are better than others, but for a 3CD set there are very few weak moments. My personal favorite is the 15 minutes \\"South California Purples\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And you wonder why they fired Guercio?","review":"This album would be perfect if James Guercio spent less time ensuring that every conceivable concert photo were given to the consumer in the original LP box set and spent more time checking that the vocals and horn section were mixed properly. The recording problems detract from what otherwise would be quite a comprehensive collection. Try \\"Live in Japan\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One For The Bargain Bin!","review":"Other than the album art work, there's not much to recommend about this album. For one thing, the brass section is simply awful--Pankow, Parazaider and Loughnane sound like they're playing kazoos! With the exception of Terry Kath's powerful, pyrotechnic guitar solo on \\"South California Purples,\\" the group's performance comes across as lethargic and bland. Even the band members themselves said in a 1978 \\"Rolling Stone\\" interview that this album is junk! Buyer, take note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor, avoid this CD","review":"This CD, while very comprehensive, is woeful to listen to. The recordings sound like papercup and string quality, and the performances on the whole are well below standard. The band itself is ashamed of this set. Buy the \\"Chicago live in Japan\\" CD to enjoy them in a high quality sound, and good perfomance setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD packaging leaves much to be desired","review":"Much of the fun of this release on vinyl has been lost in the transfer to CD. First, the 12-page \\"booklet\\" notes the original album photographs \\"could not be properly reproduced.\\" What a LAME cop-out! I find this impossible to believe. Also, the original ebb-and-flow of the original 8-side set is spread across 3 CDs. There should be at least some note of where the original album breaks were.The actual recording is worthy of 3-stars, but this \\"bad old days\\" CD transfer lowers my feelings about this set to 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHICAGO IS A STUDIO BAND!!","review":"This recording is so disappointing.It reveals the bands weaknesses that are well masked by a good studio mixer. Where do we start?? In the Country is horrible;Fancy Colours ok;Does Anybody Really Know...stinks!Questions 67-68 bites;South Calif.Purples-good actually. Other smelly songs-I don't want your money;Sing a Mean Tune Kid...It just goes on and on.Stay away from this and the live in Japan album. Enjoy their studio work.Their arrangements are very good.I wonder after listening to them play live how they could've have written such good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pomp & Circumstance","review":"After releasing three consecutive double albums, Chicago did the unthinkable by releasing a four record live album. Chicago IV (Live at Carnegie Hall) is the record that Chicago bashers love to point at as the height of the band's bombast. To a degree, the critics are correct in their statement. The album does contain some fine renditions of hits like \\"Beginnings\\", \\"Colour My World\\" & \\"Questions 67 & 68\\" as well as lesser known tracks like \\"Free\\" and \\"Lowdown\\". But mostly it is an overblown affair with no better example of excess than the five movements of \\"It Better End Soon\\". Chicago have been unfair whipping boys for the rock press through the years, but on this release, they help give ammunition to their critics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old fashioned even when it was first published","review":"I was looking for a basic introduction to lapidary work to actually try to cut stones and found the book old-fashioned and outdated. Many of the illustrations, however, were hilarious.

In that spirit, we purchased \\"Welcome to the Episcopal Church.\\" In 133 pages, Webber attempts to cover history, worship, the Bible, theology, spirituality, and the Church. It's waaay too much to cover in that small space. Worse, Webber attempts to be as welcoming and inclusive as he can, in the process saying little with real content. Some parts (history) are flatly incorrect, or, to be generous, inaccurate. Other parts (theology) are a genuine muddle. This book will be on the 10-cent table in our next yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurately Vague","review":"This book shows the basic practices and beliefs of the ECUSA along with the vagueness of why it believes what it does. Main explanation: We believe this because we always have... You can believe what you want whichever way you want. Accurate of the Episcopal Church, which means very wishy-washy. Comparable to Reform Judaism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious, but not overly solemn","review":"WELCOME TO THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH is a realtively short book (less than 150 pp.), but a useful one. It deals with the history of the church going back to the English Reformation, the style of contemporary worship, the importance of the sacraments of Eucharist (communion) and baptism, the significance of the Bible, and the primacy of the 1979 Book of Common Prayer (which, indeed, many Episcopalians simply call \\"the prayer book\\").The intended target for this book and others in the series (WELCOME TO THE BOOK OF COMMON PRAYER, WELCOME TO SUNDAY, and others) is probably a prior Protestant or Roman Catholic getting ready to join the Episcopal Church. This is not the place for in-depth history or theology, nor is it meant to be. I agree with the reviewer below who found the suggestions for further reading a little weak. An index would have been nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Just a Welcome","review":"Since my reception into the Episcopal Church twelve years ago, and even more so during the past three years as I have taught hundreds of others coming into the Episcopal Church, I have been searching for, hoping for, praying for the right book to help in that process. It's here! Written in a rich but unfussy style which is up-to-date without sounding trendy, Webber's engaging and accessible summaries are like Hagen-Daz: \\"just perfect.\\" Every Episcopalian or friend of an Episcopalian will find it a lively and informative read, and any seeker after a contemporary Christianity with ancient roots will discover new insights into this religion of two millenia. The chapter on the Bible is worth the price of the book and could benefit anyone who has grappled with the puzzle of biblical interpretation. There are many similar books but this one is by far the brightest and the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres the OOMPH and the feeling? Not here...","review":"As with many follow ups this year Nonpoint disappoints, straying from their roots of in your face, yet melodic, rap-rock. The only hard song on the album is Excessive Reaction, and is softer than the softest song on Statement (What A Day). Had this been their debut, it could have gotten 3 stars...but I know that they are capable of so much more. Hopefully they can bounce back in 2004 with a new opus"},{"rating":"2","title":"deep","review":"This is a pretty emotional album that will probably make you break up with your girlfriend.... or maybe that's just me.

It's about frogs. That's about it. Other than to say that, at times, it sounds kinda like some throwaway alternative from the late 80's.Gone are the wonderful riffs, melodious hooks and edgy vocals. Gone is any singing in Spanish. Gone is anything with any real punch. Gone is any interest. My head's hung as low as the average beats per minute on this album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to these guys?!!","review":"These guys used to have a pretty heavy sound - they had some killer guitar riffs on their first national release. They were originally a very heavy band, then they softened up a little bit for their major label debut, but now they sound like freakin' Hoobastank. If you appreciated the heaviness of \\"Statement,\\" then do not, I repeat DO NOT waste your money on this album. Pick up the new Soulfly album instead. If, however, your idea of \\"metal\\" is bands like Linkin Park and Papa Roach, maybe this CD is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staement on meds","review":"I got Statement a couple years ago and it has been one of my favorite rock/metal albums in my collection since. I picked up Development when I saw it on sale at a local music shop. What a disappointment. The title track is pretty good but the rest of the disc does anything but rock. It's mostly the lyrics/singing. It doesn't sound like the same singer from Statement (maybe it's not). This album has none of the intensity of their former. There are choruses like \\"Making mountains out of molehills\\". WTF is that?! It apears the singer has been on some type of medication that has taken off the edge. It might be good for his personal life, but the music suffers. If you like Statement (which I would recommend to any hard rock/metal fan) you will most likely feel let down w/ this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest disappointment of the year.","review":"I thought Nonpoint's CD \\"Statement\\" was one of the best CD's in 2000. I rocked non-stop and kept the heavy riffs grinding. But here on \\"Development\\", things are just too slow and mellow, almost as if Nonpoint were trying to be something they're not. Now I know mellow isn't always a bad thing, but doesn't it seem as though too many artists these days are turning to melodic styles to not get labeled as an immature nu-metal band? Nonpoint even said the reason they went mellow was to get exposure. If you are a true Nonpoint fan as I am, you should get it. Otherwise, invest your money in their first CD and hope that this was just a case of sophomore slump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Development doesn't even deserve even 1 star","review":"This CD is a disgrace to all music. I mean the lyrics are very cheesy and the song structures are sorry. I used to like this disgrace of a genre known as nu-metal, but I grew up and started listening to the real stuff. If you want to listen to real metal or anything like it, just listen to bands like Suffocation (I know some of you may not like death metal or any at all), Nothingface, Nevermore (awesome American power metal), or Kataklysm.Edit 9/6/2012: This album fell into the \\"sophomore slump\\" even though at the time I wrote the review I was being pretentious but my overall opinion still stands. Their subsequent albums are a lot better than this one. Please take a look at those and even their debut before looking at this one. This is my least favorite album by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much advice","review":"I was disappointed in this book- not much practical advice, almost nil hair cutting advice. He advises not washing hair every day. Ugh! I see plenty of unwashed hair and it isn't attractive. I don't use shampoo every day, but do use conditioner. Also, he is a big believer in setting hair with rollers. If you ask most males, their opinion is that women in hair rollers are very unattractive-good way to ruin a marriage. The hair styles are unimaginative (and need a set). Often he sends you to a \\"professional stylist\\" rather than helping you take care of hair on your own (Gray hair-difficult to color, go to professional.) Didn't learn anything new-all seems to be common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT MY MONEY BACK!","review":"It was the worst instructional video I have ever seen. The camera used was of the poorest sort, probably a personal handycam. The entire video mostly showed the head Sensei going through forms in rapid succession, that is it!

All in all about the same as watching an Aikido demonstration from a distance.

Little to recommend here, save the cinematography and the breasts of Claudia Cardinale. Robert Ryan has hardly any lines at all. Woody Strode has a demeaning role as an errand boy for the white actors around him. Lee Marvin is so taciturn it's almost like he's imitating himself. Some of the dialogue is laugh-out-loud bad. There's a lengthy, nonsensical standoff between Lancaster and the chief bandito. And the ending will have you scratching your head as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Professionals DVD","review":"This movie arrived in excellent condition however I was annoyed to find that the seller shipped it with a stick on cover label to supposedly convert it into \\" The Most Wanted Westerns Collection.\\" I removed the poorly applied unwanted cover to expose the pristeen condition original movie cover behind the case factory plastic wrap cover The Professionals \\"Special Edition\\" .

My only gripe with it was the blackout of Claudia Cardinale's tatas. But all in all, the casting is perfect--Lee Marvin and Burt Lancaster are the perfect duo of tough guy and suave killer. \\"The Professionals\\" has great, humorous dialog, exciting action, and Robert Ryan. Come on, what more do you want out of a western? Get your hands on this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan and Woody Strode make this flick great. Hired by a train baron to bring back his kidnapped wife, they soon find that all is not what it seems. The acting is terse and intense and, for all the twists and turns, you're still left wondering what happens next when the movie ends. Not a lot of gunfights and explosions, although there's enough to satisfy.

Viewers should be notified of this travesty before deciding whether to purchase an otherwise worthwhile film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooks best effort","review":"This film was just a couple of miscasts short of being a real classic. Why Jack Palance and Claudia Cardinale as the Mexican couple at the center of the plot? There must have been thousands of English-speaking Mexican actors who could have made them more credible. That said, though, writer and director Richard Brooks misses mighty few other beats in this often riveting and fast-paced tale of four hired guns tricked into a morass of extortion and revolutionary politics along the Mexican border. Lee Marvin, Burt Lancaster and Robert Ryan were never better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusual and welcome","review":"As I read more and more about old jazzmen, it is striking just how many died early or unnecessary deaths. \\"Jazz and Death\\"fills an unusual and worthwhile niche.The only complaint I have is that Dr. Spencer tends to editorialize at length on the justifications for marijuana laws, etc. Not that I don't agree completely. He also (in the introduction -and- the conclusion) draws attention to the very tenuous links between the history of jazz and the history of medicine.A wonderful and engrossing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly even better than Volume One?

From the elusive MOONDOG to French electro remixers like JACKSON and OCTET to indie rocks PASTELS and OUT HUD to 80s icons MARTIN GORE (Depeche Mode) to house legends like FRANKIE KNUCKLES, MAURICE FULTON, and CHICKEN LIPS, to lost relics like JOHN FOXX and nu-phunk upstars like SA-RA, this CD delivers sheer taste, class, and dangerous intrigue - all this from a mere CD?

Ordered a case from Amazon the day after trying it for the first time. Makes great bread sticks, a decent french bread loaf, and a pizza crust reminiscent of what we had in Italy. (That's all I've tried so far.) I accidentally added salt twice to the pizza crust, and found it improved the flavor, which I think is a little flat.

I do not recommend this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flavorless!","review":"I looked forward to trying this for pizza crust, as it advertises. First of all, the directions for preparation use WAY too much liquid. Even by cutting the liquid down, I could never get my dough to look like anything other than paste. I'd end up adding a bunch of gluten-free flours to get it to doughy consistency for pizza (or so it, at least, wouldn't stick to my fingers and not the pan.) It had NO flavor either. Disgusting pizza crust. And so I tried it for bread and I couldn't even get my kids to eat it when I disguised it with garlic and cheese and butter. (Kind of defeats the purpose of eating healthy, doesn't it?) I would never buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play dough","review":"My first loaf of this excuse for bread was gooey and baked like a brick.

Not what I anticipated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Gluten Free Bread Mix","review":"This is my favorite type of bread to make.

The mix is milk free - wonderful for those of us who have to avoid milk products. The texture of the bread is very close to traditional white bread made from wheat and does not become \\"grainy\\" even after several days in the freezer.

One of the very few bread mixes I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not french bread - but super tasty","review":"I bought the mix in hopes that I could create a bread for myself to use at Easter dinner. It does not taste like french bread but it does taste better than any gluten free bread that I have bought. It can be sliced thick or thin and it makes great french toast, sandwiches, garlic bread...you get the picture. It was not hard to make, though I did let it rise for too long which meant that it came spilling out of my loaf pan. I did not have time to dig out my breadmaker, but if it has a gluten free setting, I will be ordering this fantastic stuff by the case!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better be hungry for pizza!","review":"Be sure you're hungry for pizza. It will make a large cookie sheet sized crust or 2 round crusts. Directions are very vague. Just use your instincts and it works fine.

I made it in my pre-gf days and have missed it terribly. Not anymore! This mix was easy to follow with few ingredients to add to the mix. I made mine in a regular bread pan and baked it in the oven. Made 2 loaves because I thought I would need that much for the Apple Bake. Did not need both so froze the other. This bread was golden and crisp on the outside and soft and chewy inside! It is the best gf bread I have found in the past 20 yrs! I have tried other brands that baked up ok but had an after taste (it might be the bean flour) or was like a brick.

The nicest thing I can say about this bread is that it has a decent crust when it first comes out of the oven. But seriously, people -- this is not even remotely like true French bread. It's heavy and virtually flavorless. You can do much better. Then again, I have yet to enjoy a gluten-free bread that comes from a mix.

Secrets of Archeology, a six-DVD set, introduces viewers to twenty-seven amazing archeological sites spread over Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.Secrets of Ancient Empires tries to cover too much ground in a very short time. The running time of each DVD is just 50 minutes. The series successively covers the first civilizations, cities, merchants, armies, and beliefs. The computer-generated imagery used is repetitive and does not seem to be state-of-the-art. Some DVDs like The First Cities feature some lousy acting that makes watching it a chore.To summarize, this DVD-set can best be forgotten due to its superficial treatment of key subjects that should allow viewers to better understand what they owe to the ancient empires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice case, but not real durable","review":"This case is a good first case for your little one.

Unfortunately, I haven't seen more than this one and the 48 box for the Hotwheels, which is much larger which makes it less portable.

NOTHING AT ALL is mentioned...as if it didn't even happen. And the funny part is the suggestion that meetings/press conferences take place in Sadaam's palace. Now, first of all, the city was nuked. Secondly, concern for radioactive fallout isn't even mentioned (either regarding the targets of the nukes or the neighboring countries). Nothing along these lines is addressed. If this is a follow-up to \\"The Last Jihad\\", then please refer to the very last page of that book...TWO nuclear bombs are dropped by the US (TLD starts up two weeks later...the Prez is still in a wheelchair from the attack on him in Denver). If we mere citizens can ask these questions, why oh why can't Mr. Rosenberg who is a supposed expert? And why should the US come across as being blatantly cavalier about nuclear devestation?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really shallow","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the review of Scott Gaines below. It's very difficult to stay 'in the book' when you are slapped into the now with such glaring technical errors. If weapons and tactics are going to play a large role in a novel it doesn't take much to do at least some basic research. Rosenberg profusely thanks (name dropping?) a lot of helpful folks at the beginning of the book but I noticed none of them had any experience at the 'blood and guts' level he wants us to think is being experienced by major players in peril.Rosenberg comes across as patronizing his fiction fans. He must have thought that his experience writing non-fiction automatically translates to good fiction. Readers of Clancy, Coonts, Dale Brown, et al will sneer at Rosenberg's naveté in this realm. Only two stars because I found myself rushing to get through it so I would have time left to read a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like his politics, but this is terrible fiction!","review":"I have enjoyed Rosenberg's writing in World Magazine and elsewhere.

It is action-packed in a Clancey-esque style. Laced throughout the storyline is a blooming romance for those who like the softer side. The development of a spiritual comprehension and conversion in a man who lived only for money is subtle and invites readers to think about such matters. The only detractor I found was the author's detailing of modern weaponry, military forces and strategies. When the action is going at a fast pace, I don't like to be slowed down to understand the technicalities that make this book so authentic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The book was very slow, only really keeping my attention the last few chapters.

The charactors are way too shallow for my tastes, and the plot, at least as much of it as I could stand to read, borders on being absurd. What annoyed me more, though, was that the book seems to be written with an eventual movie in mind. The perspective constantly shifts from person to person, and I could imagine the ease with which this tripe could be converted to a screen play. I do admit that I stopped reading the book about a third of the way into it, but that was all I could stand. I only read that far due to the book being a gift.Of course, it could just be me.

The book is not a historical novel, but rather a future (when he wrote it) that didn't happen. As such, I just couldn't get \\"into it\\". I found that it was just a tedious series of imaginary biographies.I doubt that most people reading this book know the bio's of many of our political leaders in the same detail as the numerous characters in this book.

The plot is based on Jon Bennett's attempt to implement the Arab-Israeli peace plan, of which he is the chief architect. While reading this book I felt like I was on a treadmill that was out of control -- going faster and faster the longer I stayed on. While character development isn't Rosenberg's strong suit and some of his dialogue is at times a bit corny, these deficiencies are mostly overcome by his ability to create a very suspenseful and realistic plot -- a plot that is all too plausible and one that I hope we only have to deal with in fiction. Once you start The Last Days be prepared to change your plans for the next few days because you won't want to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author","review":"THis is the second in the series about events in the Middle East leading up to the End Times.

Getting to the Peace talks alive and getting out of them alive are really what this book is about. And while the story is about that it bounces along in fine fashion as Jon Bennett, the President's \\"point man\\" for the Peace Process and Erin McCoy, his CIA protector and love interest endure more perils than Pauline ever imagined.

I picked it up last week because I thoroughly enjoyed his first effort, The Last Jihad. I'm generally a person who enjoys reading 2-3 books over the course of 2-3 weeks, but I read this cover-to-cover over 72 hours. Rosenberg's writing is very clean - he keeps just enough balls in the air - but not too many - to keep the reader focused and hungry for the next shoe to drop. What makes it more intriguing is that as you read it, you're reminded of the latest newspaper headlines re: the Middle East or the evening stories on World News Tonight. If you enjoy reading non-fiction - you'll like The Last Days because of its real time and current event nature. If you enjoy fiction, you'll like this book because it is action packed, thought provoking, complete with twists and subplots, and a serious work of fiction. Write another one, Mr. Rosenberg!

Problem with The Last Days is that it's a longer book... well, that in itself isn't the problem. I suspect the The Last days is a good 50% longer than The Last Jihad, but the problem is the extra space is filled up with more of the good but boring political detail.

This Jim Wynorski film comes complete with poor acting, poor visuals, bad scripting and bed character development. Daniel Baldwin was unrealistic in his role as a military colonel. None of the characters seemed to have the military presence needed for their role in this film except for Stephanie Haiduk and Tim Abell, who occasionally looked genuine. The flying provided some scenic views, but the combat scenes were fake looking. As soon as the pilot presses the button, the target explodes. There is no time in between launch and hit. You weren't even shown the missiles travelling through the air.The movie is roughly 85 minutes and the DVD comes in Pan & Scan format with trailers for other Corman films and includes cast biographies.

A great advantage is that it takes very little force to wind the cork out.In case you're wondering how it works, you put the opener over the top of the bottle, start the thin sharp screw into the cork and then rotate the screw into the cork with the little handle on top.

I might have been able to get more mileage out of the thing by applying some superglue, but my wife quickly bought an old-fashioned metal corkscrew that folds up like a pocketknife -- the kind we've seen many waiters use.Feels solid, and it's easier to use.

Instinctively I knew what to do. Nothing would stop me. I wanted that bottle of 2005 Kendall Jackson Grand Reserve Pinot Noir and this baby wanted to open it.It guided my hands in a way that was strange but felt so natural. The bottle was opened in seconds. The wine was mine for the taking ... and I took it. Now I find myself trying to write this review.This honestly was the easiest cork puller I've ever used.

It's not necessarilly a horrible album, but the Chicago from 6 years before is simply not there. Three songs save this album from being a one star wonder. The first is Mama Take, one of the most underrated Cetera songs during his Chicago tenure. Donnie Dacus's Must Have Been Crazy is his best song from his unremarkable stay with the band. \\"Loser With A Broken Heart\\" is a pretty decent Certera ballad. The other songs fall flat on their faces, and are a disgrace to Chiacgo's legacy, especially the incredibly lame \\"Street Player\\". Chicago can't do disco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different for Chicago, But Excellent for its Time","review":"Chicago 13 comes during a lull for the band--after its massively successful albums in the early to mid 70s and prior to its return to greatness in the early 80s. However, I don't think Chicago 13 is a weak album. \\"Street Player\\" is a heart-pumping, exciting disco song that is thoroughly enjoyable. Songs such as \\"Reruns\\" and \\"Mama Take\\" are fast-paced and brass heavy, and also solid songs. Frankly, not every song is a great hit. However, there are enough decent tracks to warrant 4 stars for the album. Now it's time for \\"Street Player\\" to be transcribed for guitar and piano and be added to future Chicago song book collections. It is a very decent song that does not deserve to be lost forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't they look around to see that disco had just died?","review":"Only Chicago would jump into the disco arena in late 1979 just before disco practicaly vanished as a form of popular music. Although some individual tracks such as \\"Reruns\\", \\"Life is What It Is\\" and \\"Window Dreaming\\" stand out, the remaining tracks leave the listener asking the question, \\"Why?\\" Also, Peter Cetera seems to be doing a strange imitation of Pete Puma on \\"Aloha Mama\\" and \\"Window Dreaming\\". The band sounds tired on the other tracks. Strangely, Chicago 13's disco opus \\"Street Player\\" has been recycled by the rap group \\"The Bucketheads\\" in 1995 and can be heard frequently in dance clubs. Perhaps Chicago was ahead of its time on this album after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horror....o the horror","review":"This is the worst Chicago album you could possibly waste your money on.

So despite the criticism, I tell anybody who's interested, if you want a \\"Different\\" Chicago, this is the one. P.S.

The writer writes it as if he's witnessing the scenes that he writes about. He actually refers to his sources as 'one old woman wrote...'.I think part of the problem is that he's writing from an American Irish perspective and the story has this romantic tinge throughout.

I've never been a huge Robin McAulley fan but his contribution to this project is respectable and probably the only song actually worth listening to more than once.

That's pretty clever, but it doesn't overcome average songwriting.For the Michael Schenker guitar fans, this album will not disappoint. But for those looking for solid tunes, this album is pretty weak. Not surprisingly, the Robin McAuley tune is the stand-out on this offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Guitar Players Are Just That...","review":"& shouldn't be confused with anything else. All the songs on here are OK, but nowhere near his early stuff w/UFO. Some of the reviews are way too long & too in-depth of this record. Graham Bonnet's tunes are probably the best, but Schenker offers nothing unique or Schenker-esque on this thing. The solos on the endless \\"Thank You\\" albums are better than these. Re-connect w/UFO (which probably won't happen) or re-form a solid band... w/ either Logan or Bonnet & get a good song-writing partner & do what you do best--play unflattering, mind-bending songs with lyrics that take you places. This record really doesn't do that-----in my opinion.

Make sure you don't get any dust on the sticky side of the screen protector as you apply it, because if you do, bubbles will definitely result and it doesn't look very good. I had to take the screen protector off and wash it in water about three times in order to get it clean enough to put on. The good thing is, you can wash it and it will stick again.

When I read this book description, I was excited since it indicated that Perl would be taught from the ground up and from the bioinformatics perspective. While the perspective is as advertised, this is still a terrible book. Unless you know something about Perl (and programming in general) before you begin, you will be lost. The authors organize some material well, but often relevant items are completely missing. They almost completely abandon Windows users when it would only take a few more sentences to address the difference between Unix and Windows. The end of chapter exercises are poorly thought out and do not provide sufficient practice for the novice. Frequently I found myself referring to \\"Beginning Perl for Bioinformatics\\" to make sense of the Moorhouse and Barry book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun!","review":"Superboy was onf my favorites when I was a kid.

OK, so why am I drawn to this material? Well, in the late 60s, I was a huge comics fan, particularly of DC's \\"Super\\" franchise. Plus, the theme song....while fairly cheesy...was so thrilling!

The book upon which the fun movie \\"The Kind and I\\" is based, is only the very jaundiced view by an arrogant Victorian Englishwoman of Thai life in the age of Imperialism and not in the slightest a reflection of the true reality. Her portrayal of King Mongkut (Rama IV) borders on libel. Instead of the ignorant barbarian she portrays he was actually an incredibly cultured and sophisticated and enlightened man who, among other things, saved his country from colonization (only Thailand, Japan, and Ethiopia were not subjected by the imperialist powers in the 19th century) by playing the English off against the French while cultivating good relations with them. For a true portrayal of the kind and the times, read MONGKUT, KING OF SIAM, by A.L.

It includes a sharp original music score. It is the product of mainly 3 people: Boris Pavlovsky, Tomi, and Sava Popovic. The movie centers around a group of college students getting together and having a few drinks. They have some long, boring, almost realistic conversations that fill up too much of the movie, but does give you clues so you can figure out what is going on. It hit me about the third murder. The acting is so-so because the dialouge is written as an attempt to be clever. For many of the actors, this is their only film credit.When they talk about their fears, Tom does more than talk about his fear as his is manifested in a slasher in a Granny's mask. There is plenty of blood, but not much gore. Low budget, a worthy effort, a good film for those who appreciate the indie aspect of the film.Rare F-bomb, no sex, no nudity"},{"rating":"1","title":"granny","review":"This is the worse movie I have ever seen.

However, if you have a desire to be a Database Administrator (DBA) this is an excellent text on the scope of job. Clearly, you can't contain every situation in one book (not even Oracle tries that), but many of the \\"common\\" problems and situations are covered. It also serves as an excellent reference for the newbie DBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"May Not Very Good","review":"I have not been able to complete this book, but I do think that it is rather difficult for a beginner doing self-study.

The first chapter was great but that's all I can say about it. I have a little database experience but was still very confused and frustrated by chapter 3. Haven't even been able to use it as much of a reference, either. I'm going to try to trade it in, probably for a text that comes with a CD. I, too, was VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DBA Material - Binding Awful","review":"I immediately start sending emails about the status of various databases using the scripts the book provided...BUT papers were falling from the book.

I don't think the author put any real effort in to helping newbies learn Oracle. I am very disappointed with this book. Don't wast your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this if you're brand new to Oracle!","review":"I chose this book because it claimed to be written for complete beginners. It lulls you into feeling completely comfortable with chapters on how the authors really want to help others through the rough early stages and then, pardon the language, all hell breaks loose. Almost as soon as it starts into the technical aspects, it will jump way over your head. Although I finally understood the first several chapters, I tossed the book aside when I realized I had to read and reread most of it, which, as an overworked Systems Engineer, I just don't have time for. Now that I've gleaned some knowledge of Oracle, I use it as a secondary reference for commands and such. Please do yourself a favor and look for another book if you need to get up to speed quickly and easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to Oracle? Skip this book!!!","review":"I'm totally new to Oracle and have purchased this book after reading all of the reviews at Amozon.com. Unfortunately, this isn't the book you need if you have no idea about Oracle. As someone mentioned already, first two chapters were OK, but that's all. Starting from the third chapter, everything gets very confusing and has very little explanation. The language used in this book is way far from being easy to understand, and is very hard to follow for the newbie."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"This book is horrible. For example, the section on imp and exp simply have a screen shot showing the output of \\"help=y\\". Great, thanks... I could have done that myself. How about going over some typical scenarios like backing up a tablespace and loading it to a test server? Want to see how full your tablespace is? You won't find anything about that in this book. Hmmm, maybe your archive logs are filling up your disk? Can you safely delete them? You won't find the answer here. There is a chapter on tuning the server. Why you'd put this in a \\"101\\" book is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic to be really useful","review":"The text is too basic to be a realy useful reference. If you've got any Oracle experience, you'll probably skim through most of the text. Sure, you'll pick up a pointer here and there--but that'd be the case with nearly any book.I guess if you're not an Oracle user but want some familiarity (say, you're a technical Project Manager, or you're an experienced SQL Server DBA moving to Oracle)--maybe then this would be a good review. But otherwise, it's too simple for even a \\"101\\" rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"If I had stopped at this book, I'd have never gotten interested in databases. Pick up Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes by Ben Forta (there's a 2nd edition out now) and also SQL for Dummies by Allen Taylor. It's the best Dummies book ever done and Taylor is creative, thoughtful and not afraid to show it. Avoid the other TY books on SQL other than Forta's. Once you learn about SQL you can start getting into the particulars of Oracle, but not with these awful Oracle Press doorstops. Plus, with good SQL knowledge, the particular DBMS seems less important. I really don't care if it's DB2, Oracle, Sybase or SQL Server as long as I can talk to it. As for this book, yawn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Concepts, not details","review":"This book explains Oracle concepts very clearly and conversationally. But it doesn't actually tell you how to *do* much. It tells you what some of the steps of creating a database are (for example), but not what the commands to do them are. It reminds you what parameters you need to set to appropriate values, but doesn't tell you how to determine what an appropriate value might be. Examples are erratic -- sometimes it gives you a script and doesn't show you what the output will be, or shows you a table and doesn't explain what it means.This might be a useful companion to a syntax-oriented class, or for a junior DBA who's been performing steps by rote for a few months and wants to understand what's really going on. It's a pleasant read, very friendly, uses lots of analogies (some of which are not really useful enough). But it will *not* help you get started actually doing Oracle DBA work, nor would it make a good reference book in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"cooking","review":"This is a good cookbook with recipes for a beginner cook such as myself.

What little there was on this manufacturer was from pre-World War II, nothing from the latter part of the 20th century.

This album remains the band's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, lousy remaster","review":"I agree with everyone else here that this album is extraordinary. My complaint is with Rhino's remastering job, which is simply atrocious for this album. \\"Introduction\\" begins almost a semitone flat, and is seriously distorted at times. \\"Beginnings\\" is distorted during the big climax. So is \\"Questions 67 & 68.\\" Etc. The mastering engineer cranked the average levels WAY up to make the album louder, and the results are often unlistenable.The original two-CD version is dated but okay. The one to get, alas, is the gold-CD MasterSound issue, now out of print. You can, however, get almost 2/3 of the album in the \\"Group Portrait\\" box, which is remastered very well by Mark Wilder.Again, my single star rating applies to this remaster, NOT to the music, which earns five stars. Rhino should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt the best of the best","review":"This is without a doubt Chicago's best work. I fell for this album when it first came out and just recently got it on CD. What a pleasure to hear them again on a great sounding stereo without pops and other nefarious noise.

I remember as a kid being baffled after listening to this album and then comparing it to the weak pop albums that came later on.The sound on the Chicago Records release is worlds better than the Chicago II CD. Still not great, but quite listenable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hard driving rock with some vibrant horns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good... but not Chicago II","review":"Chicago is one of the best alternate rock bands ever to grace the vast and exciting ocean of rock'n'roll. Their musical style, a blend of rock, classical, and jazz is... of course unique, but its also very energetic. This, the bands first album is good...really good, though its not quite as good as there second album.

I saw their Christmas concert and wanted to wave my candle and help some young lovely body-surf the audience. I had a few of their albums and didn't think I could go wrong with their first two. I was wrong!This CD is pretentious and self-indulgent. Titles like \\"Poem\\", \\"Free Form Guitar\\" (hey, look, I can play, let me show you), and \\"Prologue\\" should have tipped me off. \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\\" is the only cut on the CD that is indicative of things to come.

This album is essentially Jimi Hendrix with horns, rounded out by Steve Winwood on organs. That's the basic feel. Both the songs and the playing are better than the Allman Brothers' Live at the Fillmore. There are 3 great lead singers---the Jimi-meets-Ray-meets-Greg Allman: Terry Kath. The smooth, Sinatra-esque Robert Lamm, and the high, piercing rock of Peter Cetera. Something for everyone. This is progressive, jazz-infused, 60s acid rock. They should've played at Woodstock. Do not expect this to resemble Chicago during the 1980s (i.e. You're the Inspiration)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago Transit Authority","review":"Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) at one time went by the group name \\"the BIG THING\\".

If you're a fan of Chicago, well written lyrics, and the fusion of traditional rock instruments with brass, then this album is for you. Take a nostalgic trip back to the infancy of a band who would later simplify their name to \\"Chicago.\\" Chicago Transit Authority--and its namesake album title--is chock full of memorable hits that will often conjure memories of where you were and what you were doing the first time you heard them. Besides outstanding hits such as \\"Does Anybody Know What Time It Is?\\" and \\"Beginnings\\", the album draws its strength from supporting songs such as \\"Listen\\", \\"Question 67 and 68\\", \\"I'm a Man\\", as well as the others.

I think it is pretty good, but then I heard their albums from the 60's and 70's. I was blown away. The 80's hits don't even come close to being equals to songs like 25 or 6 to 4, or Beginnings. I just bought this album recently, having already heard most of the songs. I bleiev this is one of Chicagos greatest a;bums, if not the best. The two biggies, Does anybody really know what time it is, and Beginnings are undoubtedly two of their greatst songs. Listen, Question 67 and 68, and Poem 58 are all great examples of Terry Katgh's great skills at guitar. His only song Im not found of is free form guitar, which I find to be annoying with the high pitches and such. Also, I love Liberation, and I'm a man.

The beautiful trumpets, killer guitar riffs and piano sounded as good or better than I remembered. The words and the voices all as vivid as ever.Every song on this set is a gem, absolutely 100% Chicago!Whether you are a fan or simply want to hear what really well written, feel good, fully orchestrated, syncopated music USED to sound like, you really need to get this cd.

The first part is exactly as advertised: interesting, informational, basic details and protocols for her work in London as a WG, or working girl. This follow's the book's synopsis, and was really what I wanted to read about. Just enough of the way into the book for me to feel obligated to finish it, about 10% in, the book changes to details about her many exes and how she is a perfect ex and all of their other exes are horrible. I quickly grew sick of the many descriptions of going to the gym so she could look at sweat on people's necks. She's vapid, shallow, and uninteresting. I really wanted this to be a femmepowering story of \\"I work in the sex trade and I don't have self esteem issues and no one should slut shame me,\\" but instead, you receive too much information about all the heart's she's broken and complaints about why she's still single.

Lets face it, this is the oldest profession in the world and Belle de Jour seems to take to it with a relish. It is written in colloquial English.

The author bounces back and forth from phrases that are skeptical to those that seem conclusive that the creature exists.

All that the scientists and \\"monster hunters\\" have are casts of the giant footprints the creature has left in the mountain snow.Note how the paragraph starts out skeptical and then ends with a statement that sounds factual.

While some reviewers here complain about this new addition, I feel that they are blended seamlessly into the mix and actually add more intensity to the overall effect. While some bands seem to be making huge changes on their latest albums (Poison The Well, Slipknot), DH has managed to change just enough to keep each album unique without disappointing their fans with a complete overhaul.

I had high hopes for this item when I purchased it, but it turned out just to be a meditation CD basically with the author talking through it. Big disappointment considering the other items the author has produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INSIDE VIEW OF THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM","review":"As an attorney with years of litigation experience, I can safely say that the Lodmell's have taken a long, honest and soul-searching looking at the American court system and how it has been corrupted by unscrupulous attorneys. As for the Lodmell's solutions, they are one of the country's leading asset proetction firms for a reason, their planning goes far beyong mere family limited partnerships, and they have literally thousands of clients who have benefitted from their expertise in this field. This is a fascinating read for the lay man and should be required ethics reading for every lawyer in America.The Lodmell's have really hit the nail on the head here, SharkDiverK's review was way off base,he obviously does not have the oxygen mix right in his tanks, or perhaps he has not really read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Published Hysteria and Hyperbole","review":"Seems like the goal of this obviously self-published work is to scare you into using the Lodmell's asset protection services by talking at great length about the ligitation problem in America (in case you somehow missed it).The problem is that the Lodmell's don't seem to have any solutions other than the ordinary family limited partnership stuff that thousands of lawyers do anyway. The descriptions of techniques in here are readily found all over the internet; really, what was so disappointing is that in all of those pages there wasn't a single new idea. So, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ordered one for a an inteded purpose, but the wife liked it even more so I had to purchase another one to make a pair","review":"I originally wanted to use the item with a Santa Hat, found it was too big fr that purpose.

I called to inquire about my refund but they said it was up to Amazon not Luxury Lane to refund my order. Am I being taken? I don't know. I will call again today. It seems to m e they should call Amazon to see my returned item should be credited to my account."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing reading","review":"Most of the articles in this book are highly differentiated in their argumentation. It becomes apparent how difficult it is to reconstruct issues such as sexuality or eroticism or certain emotional forms of bonding on the basis of archaeological material or ancient written sources. Particularly creditableable is that the authors don't cover the uncertainties in the possible interpretations of the material with the great gesture of \\"we are sure\\" etc. Very intersting reading for specialists in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Critic's Choice","review":"A hits album hastily thrown together.

It did the job well but I discovered the \\"tank in tank\\" system was leaking. The dirty waste water mixed with the cleaning solution. I called Bissell and they are shipping a replacement tank free. The cost of a cleaning service to come to my house and clean 2 rooms cost more than the reconditioned Bissell price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal & works well!","review":"I was amazed at how well this cleaned our disgusting stained carpet in the house we just bought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent as a gritty drama on the lives of prostitutes, not quite as strong as a thriller","review":"Intelligent if slightly awkward melding of a gritty, sad drama of life of the street for working classprostitutes in the UK, and a somewhat more melodramatic and soapy (if sometimes quite tense)serial killer thriller.Unlike \`Klute' where the world of hustling and thriller melded seamlessly, here there is a bit moreschizophrenia between the elements. For me, the crime sections, while sometimes effective, werealso quite familiar, and felt like TV and movies I'd seen many times before, whereas the portrait ofthe day to day lives of hustlers felt like much more interesting and less often explored in anon-exploitive way. The killings and investigation feel oddly grafted on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice collection of the mysterious happenings of West TX","review":"This book is an interesting collection of mysteries of west Texas, some well known, such as the Marfa Lights, and others not as well known. There are a variety of haunted houses, hotels, schools etc mentioned as well as old forts, scenes of murders, ambushes and the like. This is a wonderful book for reading on a stormy night, or as a source for campfire stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainy-day Synth-pop PERFECTION","review":"The Newcastle trio of Dubstar created THE synth-pop Masterpiece with their debut album \\"disgraceful.\\" Lead Singer Sarah Blackwood's ethereal voice takes quides us through tales of lost love, longing and insecurity, all delivered in her emotionally dead pan performances. Lead single \\"stars\\" is by far the best known track with its sweeping keyboards and memorable lyrics (\\"lets take our hearts outside, leave our lives behind, I'll watch the stars go out\\"). However all the tracks our excellent in particular the gorgeous and achingly beautiful \\"The day I see you again.\\" I cant recommend this album enough for fans of synth-pop songs that make you laugh and cry. Inagine the cocteau twins produced by the pet shop boys. Yes, Its that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on its own.","review":"I use this product under my eyes to lessen the dark circles. However, by itself, I don't see a difference. I still have to use the secret concealer for any type of coverage/lightening of the eye area. Also, the packaging for this product is very bad.

In Ad Faciem, there is a woman singing what I thought was meant to be a tenor solo--but these things are generally somewhat flexible in music performance.The music itself is crisp, clear, precise, and--above all--beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured","review":"A friend of mine has this game, so I already knew I loved it when I added it to my wish list. My sister saw it on my wish list and bought it for me. Cool, right? Yay Amazon.Well, unfortunately, it's not as pictured. My friend has the version that's pictured: a solid black base made of wood, aluminum dividers, birch squares and actual marble playing pieces. It's a pleasure to handle all of the pieces and parts.The game I received is all plastic, as shown here:[...]The four rotating square sections are mechanically connected to the base, and the mechanism sticks, which is annoying.Honestly, I find the lower-quality \\"toy\\" aspect displeasing and will probably not play Pentago very much as a result. I'm disappointed that the high-quality item I wished for (and that my sister paid for) is not what I received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Fun","review":"Good and simple strategy game.

Dyke jones cant rap, he repeats his lyrics, he's not lyrical, He doesnt rep for Texas like he suppose to.

I'm starting to think maybe these rock fans are right. Maybe rap really is mindless garbage. I mean I'm not counting the good rappers, like Nas, 2pac, Outkast, etc. But, I AM talking about dumb ones like Lil' Jon, and all the other ones with \\"Lil'\\" in their name. They all suck c*ck.

I hated it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Oddest CD's of 2005","review":"I try to give every artist a honest listen, but Mike Jones, cares more about self promotion than rapping.

Mike we know who you are now. So get back in the studio, and do the damn thing...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Dyke Jones??????","review":"Chamillionaire destroys this dude.

I thought they were going to throw the old version on there and call it a day. I give this album 1 star alone( yeah 3 stars originally) due to addition of the screwed up version.
