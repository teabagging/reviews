However, it is very entertaining, well written, well plotted, and has interesting characters. Some people expecting a straight hetero romance/suspense tale might be a bit put off by the gay relationships in the book; personally, I think they added depth and breadth to the novel. There are enough twists and turns in the plot to keep the reader engaged until the end, so this novel is definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"New fan","review":"This was my first Brockmann book, so I have nothing from her past to compare it to.

I can't really say why, other than that she seemed rather shallow and self-centered (maybe she was just too Hollywood).

That worked fine for about the first 1/5 of the spices, but it was gradually grinding less & less. I put those spices in this mill, and it grinds them great; not to a powder, and no chunks, just the right amount. It takes a bit more force to turn it, but that's because it's grinding so much more, and more quickly. So far, the teeth are still working like they did on the first day. I highly recommend it. The only thing is that the cap doesn't hinge, it just pops off, but I guess then it's not in the way of the falling spices, so that's probably for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable","review":"We have several of these pepper mills (various family members, different locations) and they are unfailingly reliable.

For me, the fine mill works perfectly. The coarse couldn't get the peppercorns into the grinding teeth (the peppercorns were too big to fit).Luckily, the fine mill does not have the same problem. While not super easy to turn, the mill is easy enough to use with large gripping surfaces. I have purchased a second fine mill to use as a sea salt grinder (and it works perfectly in that role as well).The only negative I've found is that the grinding lid takes a bit of effort to remove from the glass jar for refilling.

The songs are varied and pretty peculariar, actually. the album starts off with a cool synth dirge, Obscured by Clouds. then it kicks into an annoying instrumental, When You're In. i hate this song, it's one generic riff over and over. then again, it was just meant to accompany a movie, so it's understandable. Burning Bridges is Meddle-esque, mellow and soothing. Waters and Gilmore exchange vox and it turns out to be one of the better tracks. The Gold It's In the... is a straightforward rock song with a ripping Gilmore solo. Mudmen turns out to be my favorite track on the whole cd. Mason uses a simple, driving beat to propell an introspective, melancholy tune that's great for reflection. Childhood's end is one of the Floyd's best songs ever, a testament to Gilmore's abilities. This album is essential for the hardcore PF fan. It's pretty relaxing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack Floyd is Better Than More","review":"There are enough cuts on this film soundtrack album(La Vallee) to justify it a higher rating than that other soundtrack they did(MORE).Title track kicks, Mudmen is awesome, Free Four is reminiscent of the Barret days.Stay is a light, mellow tune.Some people complain about Absolutely Curtains, but this one is trippy."},{"rating":"2","title":"obscured by clouds","review":"One day I heard this song that the dj said was by Pink Floyd.

I had never heard this song before nor did I ever hear of the album \\"Obscured By Clouds\\". Curious, I bought the cd and was quite impressed. Especially since I learned that they took around two weeks to write and record the album. Wow! This album is a revelation. I had only been familiar with their later material (\\"Dark Side...\\" and beyond)so I really enjoyed listening to their earlier material. This is a lovely album. Gorgeous guitar work from Gilmour.

Those of you who are familiar with that one know that it is a bit melancholy and very emotional. Obscured is a huge switch -- very upbeat and music that you can bob your head to.

If you have not heard this album, you do not know Pink Floyd well. DSoTM and The Wall are both great albums, but this album is a personal album that hits home. The album has excellent flow, which means you can listen to it from beginning to end every time. The music is so rich that even though you haven't seen the movie, a movie of your own experiences will conjure in your mind. I've seen the movie and it isn't so great. The scenery is nice, but this sound track is something else. Some of the songs have a lot of energy in them though they aren't hard or fast. Others are dreamy and mellow.

Yet, Floyd's fifth greatest is greatly superior to almost anything that any other band can come up with. This album is fresh, from the Pink Floyd before Dark Side's success. Every member of the band made greater contributions, and it shows. Childhood's End, Wots . . . uh the deal, Free Four, Burning Bridges, The Gold its in the . . ., and the rest are absolute classics of Gilmour. The only thing I can complain about is that Gilmour's voice sounds a bit airy and light, but not much. The songwriting is incredible and the songs themselves very catchy and lighthearted for Floyd.

Wish You Were Here, Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon and most of their other work you can't put in for backround music. They demand listening attention in a dark room with surround sound or a great pair of headphones. This album on the other hand can be backround music, there's nothing bold or expiriemental about it. Its a fantastic listen, every song is great, just not as thought provoking as the rest of the Pink Floyd catalogue.

McCartney and Lennon try to build from their admiration of Bob Dylan. Additionally, Lennon crafts some pleasant little pieces of self-loathing (see especially \\"I'm a Loser\\").

I adore the Beatles version of \\"Words of Love\\", and have always though \\"Baby's In Black\\" was an underrated gem. Hearing those voices again made me happy and sad at the same time. Knowing how quickly this was \\"patched\\" together, and how tired and frazzled they were at the time, it is an amazing achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine album showing the Beatles's roots. Underrated.","review":"This album, even with the originals, shows the Beatles's early influnces. I think they all did a great job, even if they were rushed. Some truly great gems here. I think it's a little weird that John Lennon was a millionaire, had women chasing him, and wrote \\"Im A Loser.\\" Also, the medley just rocks. Very bluesy. I also like \\"8 Days A Week\\" and the classic \\"Honey Don't.\\" I seem to like any Beatles song with Ringo singing. \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\" is a nice ballad, yet I have to cringe when John yells out ...[\\"MISTER MOONLIGHT...!\\"] in an untuned fashion... The rest of the song's cool, though. Every song's a keeper. Very nice work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexplicably underrated--one of their best","review":"Routinely named as the Beatles' worst album, this is in fact one of my favorites, and I believe one of their best. The Beatles put aside the sound of their first three albums and instead go for a sort of country-rock sound, a few years before Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, and Dylan do it. How can you go wrong with an album that includes \\"No Reply\\", \\"I'm A Loser\\", \\"Eight Days A Week\\", \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\"? The covers are more numerous and not as good as on other albums, perhaps, but hey, \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" and \\"Words Of Love\\" do it for me. Give this album a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best before \\"Rubber Soul\\"","review":"Before I got this CD, I assumed from the reviews I had read that this was one of the weakest Beatles albums. Well, now that I have it, I realize how wrong I was. This, to me, is the first Beatles album that hints at, even more so than their next one \\"Help\\", the greatness they would achieve on \\"Rubber Soul\\" and everything after that. The sound of this album is a noticeable improvement over \\"Hard Day's Night\\", and for the first time we have John writing more personal lyrics. I really like all eight Lennon/McCartney compositions here, and some of the covers are quite fun as well (I expecially enjoy Ringo on \\"Honey Don't\\", which contrary to Amazon's track listing, is track 10. Also, in case anyone doesn't know, \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\" is track 14. They really ought to show the full track listing.) Anyway, this is my favorite Beatles CD of their first five."},{"rating":"1","title":"but only in mono!","review":"the bad standard band's album was recorded after a hard days night in that same year 64. This one is recorded in mono only not stereo!!! their albums from 1967 - 1970 were good.....but this one is absolutely tame & weak!Check out other better rock bands albums like deep purple live and studio albums, they are much much better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little digging is required, but there are some good songs","review":"\\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm a Loser,\\" and \\"What You're Doing\\" and the best of the originals on this album, in that order.\\"Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey,\\" \\"Rock 'n Roll Music,\\" and \\"Everybody's Trying to be My Baby,\\" are the best of the covers, also in that order.This album was made during a time when the Beatles were exhausted, and is one of the Beatles worst albums.However, the album artwork on the cover is fantastic; very honest and gritty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Beatles Album?","review":"I don't actually own this album in my colection but with compilation disks, mp3 etc I have heard nearly all the songs. I have to say this is the worst beatles album ever, sorry. I'm not saying It's bad, it's just the Beatles are the best group in the world ever and this realy doesn't do justice to them. I am a fan of all beatles songs, but there first songs are no-where near as good as there later, more mature albums. There are quite a few more maturer songs on this album than on A hard days night, but I find them a little boring and not as easy to listen over and over a hundered times (like I do with all other beatles songs). Unlike old Albums such as Please Please Me, Beatles For sale's songs arn't catchy enough - BFS is an attemt at being more mature but the songs just do not work. If you have all the other Beatles albums and you need to complete your collection, get this, all BIG beatles fans should have it. But get Please Please Me and Anything after Revolver First..."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh god ! the whole set sound the same!","review":"the whole set sound the same, every little thing, words of love sounded very romantic but boring, crying!this one is an easy listening album, for led zeppelin and deep purple fan like me, my ears can't easily take the beatles songs at all.....Im so sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"beatle mania","review":"This is an album I didnt have when i was young. This is a good sing along album. :) I am so happy I got my beatle collection from amazon. This could be one of my faves though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A product of the Beatles' separate and group interests","review":"If you look at the cuts on this CD, you find 7 versions of some of their favorite artists (i.e., the ones they were brought up on, loved and respected, learned from and were formed by): Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, and Carl Perkins were high on the Beatles' list of respected songwriters, and the Beatles' versions of their songs reflect a feeling and appreciation for them. Getting back to their roots, they even chose Kansas City, Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey, and I'm a Loser to perform on TV (Shindig). Listen to the spirit they put into Kansas City and Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey; it's rousing. The harmonies and the varied rhythmic schemes of almost all of the other cuts give a good sampling and helping of some of the richness the Beatles were/are known for. This CD is a pleasure to listen to, and is well worth investing in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Album","review":"I have the old Capitol record, Beatles 65, which is the same album basically and every song is brilliant. I'm a Loser is a pure classic, and Eight Days a Week is even more terrific. To that user who said the song was boring, is that why it was number 1 for so many weeks? Every Little Thing is a great song. Nothing bad to say about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fave","review":"This is my favourite beatle album. I had the American version of these songs when they first came out, and loved them, and then discovered they were originally together on one album in Britain. Does it get any better than that? This is the Beatles B side album (they famously loved to consider B sides) and their real homage to the C&W world (others were devoted to the girl groups, etc.). This should be listened to with the Beatles on the BBC album. It is totally quirky, and full of songs that are not originally great (Mr. Moonlight?) but who had ever heard them until the Beatles went after them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I nearly died...\\"","review":"Beatles for Sale by The Beatles is considered their worst album but I truly enjoyed this clever mix of country influenced, blues rocking disc. Mr. Moonlight is not their best cover but the way John Lennon sings and belts this song sure as hell makes up for it. No Reply is my favorite and best track, even the band Garbage stole a line and the hook from this song. Other songs I cannot get enough of are: I'm A Loser, Baby's In Black, Rock and Roll Music, I'll Follow the Sun, Eight Days A Week, and Every Little Thing. Ringo sounds absoutely adorable on the track, Honey Don't. George gets a chance to shine as well on the closing track, Everybody's Trying to be my Baby. I love the way George attacks this song both vocally and performance wise, and Paul continues to grow with his song writing ablities. Beatles for Sale is defintely an album every new Beatles fan should have. Have a ball with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rushed, maybe, but still absolutely brilliant","review":"No doubt this LP came out at a time when Beatlemania was at its height and the pace was hectic. But by summer-'64, when most of this album was recorded, they were used to that pace. They wrote the Hard Day's Night LP under tremendous pressure. The originals on this LP are gems all, including \\"I'll Follow the Sun\\" which WAS primarily written when Macca was 16. So what? It's a beautiful, transcendent song. As for the covers, I'll stack Words of Love, Honey Don't, Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby, and Kansas City up against any of their eariler covers. And there's not a damn thing wrong with Mr. Moonlight (GREAT Lennon vocal)and Rock & Roll Music, either. Critics & fans alike are WAY too hard on this LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT THE BEATLES BEST, BUT STILL GREAT.","review":"At the time this album was made The Beatles were between tours and totally exhausted. This did not stop them producing a good album. However, Beatles for Sale is not the best of the Beatles. After A Hard Day's Night, which contained all original songs, this one only manages 8. But one cannot criticise the Beatles for that, as this was at a time when many artists couldn't even compete that number of originals! Some of the cover songs (particularly \\"Mr. Moonlight\\") are rather poor (by Beatles standards) but the album is worth purchasing just for the superb rendition of Chuck Berry's \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" which was recorded in one excellent spontaneous take.So, not the Beatles' best, but it has to be taken into consideration that for any other group, this album would be excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fab Five","review":"I say \\"five\\" to include George Martin, truly the fifth Beatle, for without his genious, the Beatles would never have been as wonderful as they were. The cd is, of course, simply fab!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weakest Beatle Album","review":"This is The Beatles weakest album (except for Yellow Submarine which I don't regard as a real album).It could have been improved dramatically by dumping \\"Mr.Moonlight\\" - their worst ever cover and replacing it with \\"Leave My Kitten Alone\\" a great cover recorded during the same sessions but left unreleased until the Anthology project."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great Beatles masterpieces","review":"Awesome. Baby's in Black rules, love the harmonica in I'm a Loser, Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey keeps your head boppin, Words of love is a very sweet song written be the very late Buddy Holly. All in all the album rocks and for you who say it isnt a Beatles masterpiece, YOU ARE WRONG! Vote this album 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They could have went further","review":"Sounds great, but they could have went further. These remasters are very inconsistent.

Though Microsoft provide templates, hardly anyone uses more than two of the default set. The presentations start to have the same feel as Charlie Brown's teacher: \\"Wa wawa wa, wawawa wa...\\"Jim Edwards' approach is going to light up your presentation and help it stand out in the crowd. These days, that's an edge you need.Each time I do this, people ask me where I got the background that was a custom fit to my presentation theme.

Otherwise, there are better instructional videos out there. The technique and style demonstrated are not of professional calibre. Also, the course claims to demonstrate 30 patterns. The number is nowhere near that, and is closer to 15, total (almost 5 basic patterns per dance). I say almost, because in one of the patterns, he calls the exit of the step by another pattern name. Sadly, the pattern name he uses is nothing like the pattern known in most dance circles. However, the audio CD which is included is quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding production and instructional quality","review":"This DVD is head and shoulders above most other ballroom dancing instructional videos.

The ballads are VERY romantic and the \\"pop\\" style songs are very upbeat without being clubby.I've listened to more than a few Latin artists (Sin Bandera included), and a lot of them are good at 1 or 2 styles of songs, but there's something about how Martin comes across on both ballads and the \\"pop\\" style songs. You can hear the feeling in his voice! I seriously can't say there's a bad song here!Interestingly enough, when I heard the Spanish/English version of Jaleo it really sounds awkward. The words don't seem to mesh as well as when he sings it all in Spanish.I have Martin's english albums and I like some of the songs on them, but he seems to put more feeling into his Spanish songs, and it comes across.I've ordered the rest of his Spanish albums, and can only guess how good they'll be!

As I would later regret, I scarcely read on my free time back then; I do not understand why I did not read more frequently, considering that those books that I did read (this and Stephen King's Eyes of the Dragon come to mind) I found delightful. Anyway... The White Mountains was probably written for a younger audience, but I recommend this for science fiction aficionados of all ages. In contrast to most pieces from the genre, the future is depicted as technologically-backwards. (This is reminiscent of Ayn Rand's Anthem. In both literary works the primitiveness relates to a lack of individualism, except that in White Mountains the population is enslaved to the tripods, instead of their \\"brothers.\\") The protagonists of this novel are children fleeing the sovereign tripods, lest they be \\"capped\\" and thereby surrender control of their minds to the huge machines.

Nancy Holder was the ghost writer and didn't put her name anywhere on it, even in the intro. I'm not surprised, because this is an embarassment to the fandom.Ultimately, this is a simple rehashing of season seven with no character development or special insight, published quickly and carelessly to capitalize on fans' desire for more of our favorite series.

I gave up trying to count the typos, but there had to have been hundreds of them. I realize media tie-in books aren't high literature, but I don't think expecting a little bit of effort is so unrealistic. The only things this book had going for it are the original scripts by Joss Whedon and the other writers of the show. The author's supposed insights into the minds of the characters when they spoke these lines of dialogue are frequently trite and irksome. To me, this was a stop-gap measure until the seventh season comes out on DVD. I didn't get into the series until it was nearly over, so it was at least useful in finding out what happened during the first half. It can get one star for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing \\"novelization.\\"","review":"...The book appears to have been slapped together by someone working from the scripts without any real understanding of the characters or story.

Entire scenes are condensed into a single line of exposition, or completely missing, and the author appears to be writing to a much lower age level than the material is designed for....

Most dialougues are exactly the same from the tv except that there are some missing or slightly different speech from the original scenes from the tv as the tv scenes are being revised. One thing I do not like is the monologue or the point of view of each character that is written to fit into the author imagination. The worst part of all is the Angel and Buffy kissage. I understand that it is a hello but the author turned it into a super romance scene between the two characters that are almost extinct now because of Buffy feeling for Spike and the history that Buffy spending with Spike is longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't think ANYONE edited this book.....","review":"I don't think ANYONE edited this book..... but the story was accurate to the season. In the novelization, you get more insight to what's going on in the character's minds. Reading this explained a lot of nagging questions that just watching the seventh season left. I truely enjoyed the story, however, the typos were obnoxious. It's like someone spell checked it and sent it directly off to be published.

My best friend got it as a birthday present, and as I was looking through it- I too noticed many errors not only in quotage but in continuity and just general following of the last season of my beloved show. Now I never missed an episode in all 7 years, so I pride myself on knowing my Slayer stuff. I emailed Nancy Holder and asked her about it and she informed me that she had nothing to do with the book. True, she was going to write it, but had a prior commitment and had to back out of the project. Those who credit Nancy Holder with writing the book, should disregard the information because she didn't write it. In fact, if you look at the book itself, it has no author at all. I'm glad to be able to clear up this matter and hopefully, have restored a little confidence on N.H's behalf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author! Author?","review":"I agree with the previous reviews!

I have to admit though the spelling errors are annoying. Although a true Buffy fan(like myself :> ) wouldn't let that bother them. The author did a great job of summing up the seventh season. But I wished they would of added more dialogue between the characters.The whole Spike/amulet thing at the end of \\"Chosen\\" was sweet and sad. Spike was great but I think Angel is better for Buffy in my own opinion. I love Spike but I really don't think he's best for her. One thing I do hope though is that they do a novel for every season. That would be great! All in all, it was a great book and it definitely should be added to your collection.PS: Did anyone noticed that the author messed up the title of an episode? She had two \\"End of Days\\". The 1st one I believe is supposed to be \\"Touched\\".

Just as a hint, I have read at least a book a day for over 20 years of my life and this is the absolute worst book I have ever read. Don't get me wrong, this was not about the storyline. I am a devoted Buffy fan and the 7th Season was wonderful; I loved watching it and had eagerly anticipated the book. Trying to read the book however was HORRIBLE. Words were mispelled, misused and just plain missing, often during the climax or crucial interaction of the scene/chapter. Portions of dialogue and action were gone, sentences stopped in the middle and if I had not watched the season so many times (bless you VHS) I would have been completely lost more than once. If someone would have just read through this book once before publishing it all of these issues could have been avoided and I would not have wasted [$$] and 6 hours of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have \\"Chosen\\" a different book","review":"Some points have already been made: Horrible editing, typos, great quotes, and moments taken out of the book: For instance in Beneath You, a bit of the Nancy story is gone, such as her line \\"Any one here not sleep with each other\\" something to take effect, it's been awhile since I've seen the episodeDon't know if it's just my copy, but during \\"Conversations with Dead People\\" it jumps from page 120 to 521 which terminates that episode novelization.

It started off good, but then I started to notice all the typos in it. I mean, the author would just spell names wrong. For example: Harbingers would be spelled Harbringers. The author would also capitilize \\"The First\\" in every instance that it was used in. Even if it had nothing to do with the character. Overall I think the story was good and the book was well spoken. But I think they were in such a hurry to get the book out on shelves that they did a very poor job on editing it. If you are a Buffy fan, read it. If not, you might get frustrated with all the mistakes in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I loved this book that spanned the entire seventh season of BUFFY.

This CD is designed to cash in on their 80's success. The video hits are here, but if you really want something that represents this band, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good greatest hits CD.","review":"I was dissapointed in this CD cause they had to edit out parts of Come Back (which was shortened from 5:09 to 3:34) and they only chose 10 songs, if you're a casual fan of J.

Also it has previously unreleased track WILD MAN.Legendary vocalist Peter Wolf departed the band around 1984 and released a solo LIGHTS OUT. Naturally this compilation tries to stress the aura of Peter Wolf rathar than simply showing the band's hits. As some of the tracks introduced here such as LOVE STINKS, FLAME THROWER, and COME BACK show J Geils. Band is the straight rock band rivaling the legend Billy Squire. Then since late 70s they took power pop approach and huge hits such as FREEZE-FRAME and CENTERFOLD were made. 10-track compilation is a bit too short to introduce their music but generally enjoyable.Verdict: Centered on late 70s to 80s hits but enjoyable.Rating: 82 out of 100. Maybe makes us want to listen to their songs more.Recommended for late 70s to early 80s power pop fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"I love J Geils but not this.

Apparently the DJ needed a break so he played the whole thing. The frog sounds are relaxing. The narrator's voice kinda destroyed the whole frog-vibe I had going. It would have been better to use the narration as liner notes. However, this is a very old recording, done in the days of vinyl, and with so many (short) tracks it would have been difficult to visually see which track was playing and match it up with the appropriate frog on the track listing. So the narrator was needed to identify the frogs on the LP.

As a new reader in the Jury series I was quite disappointed. No more. You have to know all about the characters before you read page one, which is too much for a novice.

To throw an international assassin/art thief into the company of Jury, Melrose et. al. is a little like Miss Marple finding her way into a Tom Clancy techno-thriller. The juxtaposition is jarring to say the least, and Grimes never convincingly pulls it off. In addition she blatantly copies the London and Broadway play \\"Art,\\" as well as Dorothy L. Sayers' \\"The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.\\" Homage or rip-off? In addition, I personally am getting a little tired of finding a little girl and a cat in every single Jury mystery. When does a trademark become a tiresome repitition? I think about now. On the whole, the book is as nonsensical and strained as the title itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I bought this for a plane ride and was disappointed to say the least.

You only have five days, or there is a big financial penalty. I was lucky in that the Apricorn EZ Upgrade worked beautifully. Their software cloned my old drive with no problems. Initially, I wasn't getting the new hard drive totally connected in the Apricorn enclosure as I was afraid of breaking something.

I am using this as a companion to a book on regression analysis by Douglas Montgomery (another excellent text). The best part is that the data and computer programs in SAS, R etc. are available on the UCLA website. All in all, a great resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible toy","review":"As everyone has already mentioned, it's nearly impossible for my two year old to spin anywhere on this thing, and it takes altogether too much effort. It was interesting for about 5 seconds. And yes, it's WAY too loud, with no volume control, and the audio is extremely annoying. The funny thing is, I only got this because my son enjoyed spinning on his father's electrical wire spool so much. Now I think I'll just buy another wire spool and modify it myself. Total, utter, waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the old one","review":"We bought this for our 3 year old daughter b/c my hubby and I both remember how much we loved having one when we were growning up. This new version is just not the same! The base is barely big enough for her to sit on (and she's VERY petite) and it does not spin as \\"freely\\" as the old ones did (probably b/c of all the electronics). The \\"talking\\" is pointless...she just wants to try to spin on it, not follow the \\"Simon Says\\" directions.

Catchy tunes, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sit and Spin no longer what is used to be","review":"This Sit and Spin took several months of waiting before my daughter and son could use it. Unlike the Sit and Spins from the 80's that spun VERY easily and made you ill, this one lacks fun. It's slow and ackward. Both of my kids need us to help spin them, which gets old.

I would love to return it, but we got it as a christmas present and I don't have the box or receipt. This definitely should be recalled. Who builds this stuff?

He actually enjoyed the music but the base is shaped like an oval so when he would try to \\"spin the other way\\" how Simon would tell him to the sit and spin would get all off balance and actually tipped over a few times.

The center post is made of a semi-flexible plastic, which makes spinning difficult, at best. When grabbing the top plate, you expect the toy to resist and in turn have your strength propel you forward into a spinning motion. That doesn't happen. Instead, when you pull on the top plate, it bends toward you and there is minimal resistance to use for spinning. Also, the base is not round, it's elliptical, which just adds to this product's awkwardness.The \\"interactive voice\\" says, \\"spin faster,\\" or \\"spin slowly.\\" Instead, you good buy a better quality sit n spin, and at the very least, you could interact with the child yourself and call out such lame commands while doing dishes or laundry from another room.Overall, this is an inferior product.

I don't know if the original Sit n' Spin's center handle came in two pieces and snapped into place on the base unit but this one does. The Playskool version seems as if it's going to break off with one good tug. It hasn't been broken yet but then again it's hardly ever played with. My son's interest lies more in using this as a prop for his Power Rangers. I'm just glad that I bought this on sale with money that someone else gave him for his birthday.

She tried to play with it every once in a while but got so frustrated we have now just put it the attic because she won't touch it and it was in the way. It doesn't spin very well at all (possibly due to the oval shape??) no matter where my daughter sits on it. Also the audio is very loud and annoying with no volume control. Also it seems much cheaper made than the older style she plays with at daycare. I would say DON'T waste your money on the Simon Says Sit n Spin - try to find an older one at a second hand store or garage sale.

I am glad we did, it works wonderfully! It is strange that the shape is now oval but when he sits on the seat where it shows him to he can spin like crazy! It does not work on carpet but put it on the tile and it spins easily. we have not had any problems with it tipping over.The music is LOUD and it is not made of the same heavy duty plastic that were made when I was young.I was disappointed when i went to buy this as I noticed that there was a purple Dora sit n spin for girls but there was nothing specifically for boys.All in all for the money I spen on it I am pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandkids love it!","review":"Smaller in size than what I remember the one my adult children had some 30 years ago. Grandkids love the interactive game option. 33 year old daughter admitted that her Sit'n Spin was one of her favorite toys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Toy. Ever.","review":"We bought this gadget for our 2-year old. To risk sounding like a broken record--or faulty spinning plastic toy, in this case--I'll just add my vote to the design flaws:1. Volume. Not only is the volume loud, it's unbearably so. Even my daughter grabs her ears when she's playing on it. The voice is a bit garbled as well, so when the command 'Ready..Spin!' sounds more like 'Wordy...SPEW!' I prefer to spare my daughter's hearing loss for live concerts in her teenage years, so I've disabled the on/off switch.2. Spin quality. A Sit n' Spin should have a fluid, effortless motion (like a lazy susan). This toy requires enormous effort to turn. To add to my daughter's frustation, the handle's base gives a bit (even with screws tightly fastened), making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved as kids.Spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this thing in the garbage can on collection day--buy an easel and finger paint kit instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO FUN!","review":"I bought this for my 2yr old. It is way too hard to spin and barely spins at all!

It's hard to sum this album up...every song on it is great. \\"My Kind Of Lover\\" and \\"In the Dark\\" are my favorite tracks.

Every song on this album is good! My favorites are In The Dark (great vocals), My Kinda Lover, Too Daze Gone, Lonely Is The Night (classic riff), The Stroke (a bit sleazy but crankin guitar), and Nobody Knows (nice ballad). Billy's next album, Emotions In Motion, had a couple classic songs (Everybody Wants You and Learn How To Live) but I think things started to go downhill with Sings Of Life (and the video for Rock Me Tonite). Mind you he did continue to write some good songs. Get this classic from 1981!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Steady","review":"This is one of the more honest records of the eighties. Billy's distnictive guitar and vocal stylings are direct and to the point. Whereas the songs are not overly complex, they are foucsed enough to make this record a pleasant experience. It is loaded with many great radio friendly songs like Lonely Is The Night, The Stroke and In The Dark. Many of the lesser known songs also stand strong like Two Daze Gone, What Do You Want From Me and the passionate Nobody Knows. Very guitar oriented but some nice keyboard touches here and there. Truly a gem from the early 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This cd sounds great for a while but does not wear well over time. I found myself finding too many parts from other bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Squier Rocks","review":"Billy Squier doesn't make music with any messages, he makes plain old-fashioned, straight-ahead rock 'n' roll. Don't Say No has alot of raw power and energy and Mr. Squier plays and sings with a reckless abandon. Everybody is probably familiar with \\"The Stroke\\", but the album has many other great songs including \\"In The Dark\\", \\"My Kinda Of Lover\\", \\"Too Daze Gone\\" and the title track. The songs are mostly guitar driven songs with a splash of syntheseir but it also has the required power ballad, \\"Nobody Knows\\". If you want an album to rock out to, Don't Say No fits the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, engaging, contemporary music...","review":"This great CD makes you sit up and listen! I am a jazz fan of long standing, preferring Miles, Trane, Monk, Rollins, etc..but I like to keep my ears open for new interpretations. This is a fascinating blend of great drum licks, keyboard and reed improvs, combined with beautiful, spacy, delicate mood pieces. Even the rap tunes, and I have not been much of a rap fan (until now) are extraordinary! I can hear Miles saying \\"yeah, man!!\\" Go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Optometry","review":"This is a very interesting album. Most hip hop/jazz projects fail to be ingaging, but optometry is different. It combines the talents of such great avant-garde jazz musicians as Matt Shipp and William Parker, as well as the interesting effects Spooky adds to the mix. Although this album lacks in some places, There are tunes, especially tracks 4 and 5, that bring the piece to another level. Track 4 features intense spoken word over a nice combination of sax and cuts from spooky, and the title track is an insane mix that samples herbie hancock that goes on for over 9 minutes. It's interesting how spooky sampled playing from shipp's nu bop, which actually fits in quite nicely. although spooky adds nice effects, his beats aren't exactly spectacular. This may be a good thing though, as there is already so much going on. More of these types of projects are expected to be released on thirsty ear, including matt shipp's collabs with anti pop consortium and el-p, which should be exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleeting feeling","review":"Spooky seems to blow any original techno-jazz goodwill mapped out on an excess of attempted artsy electro focused on mumbled atmosphere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Time with Oleta is Fantastic","review":"For those of us who love the fantastic voice of Oleta Adams this CD will not disappoint you. As with all of her music she delivers a song like no one else can. It is a MUST have for your Christmas music collection. Once you hear her delivery on these songs you will feel like you have received a true blessing, especially from the song entitled \\"Breath of Heaven\\". ENJOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had bad luck with these","review":"I've had bad luck with these reman window regulators. I've ordered two, and each arrived with a different problem - one malfunctioned 100% of the time; the other worked perfectly, then ceased to function altogether after about a week. I'm going to try buying from another distributor, but I have have to go ahead and buy a brand new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I do not recommend this product! After ignoring previous reviews on amazon, I went ahead and ordered my window motor...what a mistake! For starters, after recieving my motor I took apart my door panel so that I could install it, only to find out that I was sent the passenger side motor instead of the driver side motor that I needed. After a quick and worthless convo with a amazon rep I decided to have another motor sent via overnight deliver. The next motor worked like a charm.... For a week! After taking apart my door panel for the third time, it turns out that this window motor fell apart. There was a metal cover by the reset botton that fell off and a plastic gear inside fell out. If you own a 350z and have the window problem like many of us, I would strongly recommend spending the extra money and buying the window motor at the dealership. I have learned my lesson in buying remanufactured parts and buying from amazon as this is not the first time I had problems with thier vendors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This reman part has lasted only 11 months. That's not good enough for me. My G35 coupe is 6 years old with 60K and now I'm on my third window lift motor. Why is it a US car can have a window lift that lasts 80-100K and Nissan can't? So I'm looking for another part manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"another one bites the dust","review":"My cardone replacement died after 3 years. I purchased it from amazon.I went to oreilly and purchased another one as they offer a lifetime warranty for the same part.

I hope it lasts as this is an annoying and expensive issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. Avoid Cardone- they make terrible window motors.","review":"This is the second Cardone window motor I've owned, and it's already dead.

I have read almost all of them over and over starting at age 12. Fortunately my sweet Mother thought he was a genius and always bought the hardcover editions when they were published so I inherited a treasure trove of all 16. I feel sorry for all the readers who haven't had the opportunity to enjoy these gems of witty dialogue and keen character study. Patrick Dennis is a social commentator on the manners and morals of our generation of the first order. These are without doubt the funniest novels ever written in the English language. There are 16 different novels written under a variety of pseudonyms. All are a delight.

But this definitely earns its stars. I started and finished the book in one day--I couldn't put it down, it was just so good! This book depicts that Manhattanite mid-century lifestyle to perfection and with much hilarity. It is rare to find a book told from the perspective of a child that is believeable and wise. A little reminiscent of some of my favorites: \\"Harriet the Spy,\\" \\"Metropolitan\\" and \\"Tadpole\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"Patrick Dennis weaves a hilarious tale of two young children going through their parent's divorce.

I'm telling you this camera barely shows anything in anything but full light conditions. Horrible. If there is light though, it does ok, hence the 2 star rating. But low light conditions, 0 star. This camera also has buggy software and will not accept your router configuration completely. You must not disable SSID transmission (like I had for security reasons)otherwise the camera doesn't transmit to your router either. Now this is a basic security issue with wireless routers, you should not have to transmit your SSID to everyone in the world, not good for security. So if you only need to have this operational in the day and don't care about details, then it will work. But I personally regret buying it, too expensive for its performance. Very weak in low light, almost ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dlink repair","review":"I have a DCS1000W network camera that stopped working about a year after I bought it.

Unfortunately, that one is not available on a regular basis, so at this point best features of the Fly Pen are inaccessible.We've tried contacting support both via Phone and E-mail and had no success.Having said all that, if the LeapFrog people can iron out the technical problems, this is a great toy.

From other reviews you can easily see that you have to constantly stock up on the \\"Fly paper\\" and other accessories.Any child or teens' best bet at this toy is to discuss it with their parents and not get their hopes up. If you talk to your parents about the Fly pen then they will have a better chance at knowing how much you would like the Fly pen. Of course, only make a big deal if it really is at the top of your Wish List.Hopefully, your parents and you can comprimse and even if they say no, maybe Santa Claus will surprise you!Besides, if all hope is lost, you can always save up and buy it yourself!

So, my mom let me open the pentop computer and try it out. It was kinda cool at first, but after the first five minutes, i was dead bored with it. So, I tried the flyware journal and even the algebra and games expansions, and, trust me, they are nothing special. I immedietely felt horrible that my mom wasted her money on this. I finally told her what a waste it was, and since i had written in the instruction manual book, i was doubtful that Target would take it back. So i went, and fortunately, with the help of some scotch tape, they never noticed and gave us a full refund. I was lucky though, as i saw some other reviews where people couldnt take them back.

We think the fly pen stinks! It doesn't respond well, it is kinda hard to understand how to use. When we learned how to use it we thought it was boring and wasted alot of paper trying to get it to work. It sounded way cool at first but once we got it and tried it out it was a TERRIBLE, AWFUL, HORRIBLE present! Not fun like we thought it would be.

Like if you draw an M and circle it you can get the pen to go to the menu.But it's very expensive, for all the accessaries put together you could buy a real game system or upgrade a computer. Mine ran out of batteries alot, which kinda sucks, but good thing is i have lots for other toys.also i think like there are lots of fake reviews here, it's so obious. like when some kid review tells you to buy it for you child age 8-13 or something.

What about an iPOD or Xbox?","review":"[...]In any event, I read the comments and many of them say how expensive it is. Well, I bought one for my son and let me tell you, it is not nearly as expensive as the iPOD he wants or the Xbox he wants. It ranks up there in terms of top gifts for kids. So, if you are worried about spending too much, buy the pen instead of the iPOD people!!!!The games and things are fun, but what I found really valuable is the spelling module. I spend a lot of time working with my son on spelling for school spelling tests and the FLY pen makes it fun and uses his words for his class.So, in summary:Fun - YESExpensive - No, have you seen the XBOX prices and what about the prices for add'l games.Cheap - Also NoEducational - DefinitelyI have to give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never heard of it","review":"This looks like a different cool toy but I realy dont know what to think of it.

It takes a little time to get used to. Once that is done though you can sit back and enjoy the technology.

Donna Summer was the Queen of Disco. Diana Ross and Barbra Streisand are iconic for much more than just music. However, Helen Reddy was the Queen of 70's Pop, pure and simple. No one has an angelic voice quite like hers. This collection is a good starter for the new fan.

This overhyped teen-ager lacks the life experience to imbue these songs with anything special. For example, the classic cabaret song ''Flight'' is basically about a man going through a midlife crisis (''I don't care if the checks don't clear''); Mr. Draxl lacks the maturity or the emotions or the vocals to fill it. His voice should be soaring into the skies, but here it barely gets off the ground. Also, Mr. Draxl has trouble sustaining notes, especially when they come at the end of his songs, notably ''Ordinary Miracles.'' If Mr. Draxl could choose better material that's more age appropriate (like ''No One Is Alone'') and get to a good vocal coach, he'd make a much better impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful debut album","review":"I was fortunate to be in the audience at Tim Draxl's New York debut and am delighted that this recording catches the lovely vocal quality of his young voice. This has become one of my favourite CD's for relaxing with. I especially enjoy the mixture of old standards with newer material. He is at his best in songs such as \\"Pure Imagination\\" and \\"Where or when\\" where voice and melody meld to create a quiet mood. Elsewhere, as in \\"Ordinary Miracles\\", the voice lacks the strength yet to sustain the emotion in occasional louder passages. But this shouldn't deter anyone from enjoying this first album from a future star of cabaret."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Promising Debut from a Star in the Making","review":"Passionate from an early age about the American Song genre, Draxl was 'discovered' in a masterclass here in Australia. Critically-acclaimed performances in the 'Oak Room', and other Cabart venues followed, and he landed a five record deal with Sony. The album covers many of the standards, with especially touching performances of 'Pure Imagination', 'Ordinary Miracles', 'No One is Alone' and a new song from Craig Carnelia, 'Flight'.Cabaret is not dead - it lives on in the voice of this passionate young 18-year with the world at his feet. If you are passionate about the American song, see what the best of emerging Australian talent has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true delight","review":"Although still young, Tim Draxl pours emotion and passion into these classic songs, infusing his smooth voice with power and character. He brings a fresh approach to \\"Someone to Watch Over Me\\" and \\"As Time Goes By,\\" while introducing lesser-known songs such as the inspirational \\"Flight\\" and often forgotten \\"My Buddy.\\" I find this CD both relaxing and invigorating, and am anticipating his next release!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young guy makes good","review":"Well. Sit back and relax to a collection of standards sung by a casual stylist with a fine range and masculine delivery of some of the sweetest songs around.

These are NOT microwave safe, regardless of what it says. The black areas of the plates, mugs heat up incredibly hot (we've had several people burned warming up items on these) Even dishwasher use has caused deep cracks in the plates...maybe the glaze isn't watertight. (?) The shape is great, BUT they chip and crack so easily just with moderate use. I have service for 12, and its the same thing with all of the sets. Very breakable. Okay if you want to hand wash and use occasional. Definitely Not for everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We purchased this set about 6 months ago. While the style is very nice, we found the quality to be awful. One of the cups broke within a week when put in the microwave. It was not long before we lost a couple plates in the microwave as well. To make things worse, the corners on the plates (both the large plates and the small plates) break off very easily. If you even slightly bang them against something, the corners have a tendency to crack. At this point, we have one large plate left and 3 small plates. The remaining large plate has a crack and all but one of the small plates have chipped or broken corners. I recommend not buying this set as it will just end up in a land fill without ever being extensively used. The box they came in stated the set is microwave safe. THIS IS NOT TRUE. As I already mentioned, these pieces will break in the microwave. Purchase at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galaxy Jade Moon Dinnerware Seet","review":"This is a beautiful dinnerware set.

If you take proper care of this dinnerware set, it will hold up fine. I absolutely love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful when new but not for long","review":"These are gorgeous when they are new and so we made the mistake of buying a few sets. That way, as we slowly brake a few of them (who doesn't)we could replace them and keep a full set. We do this with everything we like especially glasses. BIG MISTAKE! I have had Mikasa and other porcelain and stoneware brands for decades, which still looked new (if they weren't chipped). These have a very poor short lasting finish. As someone who does pottery, I have no idea how they got such a short lasting finish on these plates. In under a year the black started getting whiter and whiter and now the plates we use the most often look sick compared to the new ones. If Amazon had a way to post a photo, I would love show you the difrference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot . . .","review":"When my husband and I bought a new house we bought this new plateware set from our local Target store. That was about a year ago and we only have 1 of the large plates left and one of the small plates broke. This was not all due to dropping or anything like that. I was under the impression that they were microwave/dishwasher safe. Two of the large plates cracked. One of them I had food on and was cutting meat and it broke right in two. One of the large plates I just pulled out of the dishwasher to dry off and put in our cabinet, but noticed that it too was cracked, so I just tossed it. I'm very glad that we didn't buy two sets as we had originially planned or that would have been a big waste of money.

The corners of the dishes just kept breaking off. The mugs held up ok, but i have never put them in the microwave, but i did put the plates in the microwave, so I know that they fell apart. The only thing that has held up are the bowls, but they are square and does not hold a lot of salad or cereal. Overall, I think these plates suck, and arent worth the money.

The songs remind me of Enigma (obviously), but also with traces of Pink Floyd, Sarah McLaughlin, and Alan Parsons Project. \\"Misere Mani\\" was featured on the first album, and is remixed here. I find this album to be slightly more mellow (gone are the electric guitar solos), but what it lacks in hard rock, it makes up for in composition. The songs are more beautiful, and the whole thing seems to have matured overall. Plus, there aren't multiple versions of songs on this one, so it is far less repetitive. If you are familiar with the first album, get this one! If you're looking for an album to be introduced to the band with, this is the one! The whole experience with this album for me has been like listening to Adiemus (Songs of Sanctuary) for the first time.

It is such an interesting combination of quiet village who-dunnit and the diary of a frantic psycho-killer. The story is told from 2 points of view which makes it twice as involving and twice as difficult to put down. The atmosphere is so thick and engrossing.

This is a well-crafted, suspenseful police procedural with a human interest tale underlying it. The author shows familiarity with the worst battle of World War I, the Somme, in 1916, which cost a million lives. I greatly enjoy the Scotland Yard political angle Mr. Airth explores, and the psychological tangle which lies beneath the criminal mind. A tremendously successful beginning for the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Put it Down if the Kettle Boils","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Although it did not evoke the sense or fabric of the period (one always wondered when the hell this took place) fortunately there was a description of the odd car that helped. I would not have read this book had not Pat Barker (Regeneration, Eye in the Door, Ghost Road ..Booker Prize) suggested it. I can understand why. It is a real thriller and a joy to rush through. Airth does not have the depth of Pat Barker nor the expereince but given time I think Airth will go beyond the watery fare of Patricia Cornwall and her ilk and provide us with the option I think we need. It is not the cookie cutter thriller that gets served up by Grisham and Cornwall.

Radio range is usually not important as a theatre is small (geographically speaking) but I could see value in privacy codes and more range , especially for an outdoor venue.The cord is long (makes it easier to tuck into a shirt to get it out of the way. All in all great value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO... SO...","review":"The boom is too short,they do not match the picture and are not adjustable.

I mounted this in his helmet under the liner and the earpiece fit nicely in the ear hole spot and then the mic was right next to his mouth behind the chin guard. This has been perfect because now I can talk to him while he's riding (slow down is the most common thing I say LOL)When he's out of sight he radios me about every 2-3 min. to tell me where he his and check in. Without these he couldn't always hear me over the sound of his exhaust. Now he hears me every time! I mounted the other in my helmet and the sound quality is great and the mic picks up well. The only bad thing is that my son broke the clip that holds the wire to your shirt.

It presented the stories in simplified form, though not always true to the Wagner version. For example, at the end of the book, Siegfried and Brunnhilde return the ring to the Rhine maidens and, it is implied, live happily ever after. She loved the book, and read it cover to cover.

I absolutely love the Descendents. I downloaded 'Cool to be You' and was a little concerned and excited, Milo didn't sound the same. I downloaded 'Nothing with You' and was a little more optimistic. I bought the 'Merican EP and thought it was alright, but a little mediocore for a Descendents CD. This CD came, I put it in and after a short time, it came back out. Something vital to the Descendents is missing on this CD. I've listened to it more and am not satisfied. I was at least hoping for a CD as good as Everything Sucks, if not better. I'm just hoping they will tour and these songs will be proven to be good live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool To Own This CD","review":"If you're a new Descendents fan, I suggest \\"Milo Goes To College\\" for your first CD, but this is a really good CD. \\"Talking\\" is the 1st song, and it's a good way to start an album. \\"Nothing With You\\", pop-punky, still good. \\"She Don't Care\\", really good. \\"'Merican\\", the absolute best song on the album. \\"Dog & Pony Show\\"'s pretty cool. \\"Blast Off\\" is really good. \\"Dreams\\", well, not the best. \\"Cool to Be You\\" is a good song. \\"Maddie\\" is good. \\"Mass Nerder\\" is good. \\"One More Day\\" made me cry. \\"Tack\\" is an awesome song. \\"Anchor Grill\\" and \\" Dry Spell\\" aren't the best. Buy this CD, unless if \\"Somery\\" or \\"Milo Goes To College\\" is there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Ok..first off....I've always been a huge Descendents fan. I bought everything they ever put out when it came out...(im old). This is by far the worst record they have ever done. I can't even believe it's them. Very uninspired and uncreative. The lyrics, riffs, energy, and excitement is just not on this record. Why couldn't they be that band that put out the \\"ALL\\" album? You can argue all you want...but I would bet money that if you like this record you are way under 25 years old. I'll give it two stars only because they are still actually putting up the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk rock legends, nerd rock at it's best.","review":"This is real So-Cal punk, not what MTV calls So-Cal. Their first album in 7 years, on a new label (Fat Wreck). This album is phenomenal, more political than their earlier works, which appeals to me quite a bit. They've refined their sound. Some people might call it poppy, I'd call it catchy. Remember, there's nothing wrong with pop music, only manufactured pop. If you doubt that statement, just remember The Beatles were a pop band too. 'nuff said.The title track of the album is honestly reason enough to buy this album, you won't be able to get it out of your head for weeks. If you're into Bad Religion, you'll love this disc. These guys are definitely more on the Bad Religion end of the spectrum than the NOFX end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must be pretty cool","review":"This album represents, to me, a big culmination point in the Descendents long-lived yet sporadic career. The songwriting seems to be top notch, as well as the variety of song styles and moods. I love the pop-punk-love songs such as Anchor Grill, One More Day, etc.. As well as the slightly bitter tongue-in-cheek tunes Cool to be You, 'Merican, and Dog and Pony Show. Milo's voice always fits the mood, and the lyrics never become melodramatic or overly self-pitying. Perhaps the greatest improvement, however, on their past material is the much more technical and mature songwriting, with mind-boggling key changes and transitions galore (Maddie, Anchor Grill, Tack). Sound production is also at top notch quality.While perhaps not the classic that Milo Goes to College is, in pretty much every respect Cool to be You is an improvement on every other Descendents album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best punk-rock CD of the new millenium!","review":"This is the [***]!

Of course, it's much better than what poses as punk rock nowadays, but this is certainly the Descendents' worst album. I tried really hard to like it, but it's just not happening. I am a big fan of the Ramones, Misfits, Necros, Damned, etc. and have been a Descendents fan for almost 10 years, so I know what I'm talking about. I'm just hoping that they release another album to make up for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"There are a few good tracks on this CD but by far my least favorite All/Descendents CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have stopped at \\"Everything Sucks\\".","review":"I love the Descendents and thier work. Lets just say that I was very disappionted with this album. It didn't even sound like something Milo would sing. It sounded more like them trying to sound like an unoriginal punk POP (not Milo) band. This album does not give the Descendents justice to what an awesome band they really are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I would give this cd a 4 1/2 stars if there were such a rating. I'm not a huge fan of the Descendents cause, I actually perfer ALL. I guess thats why people either like or hate this album cause it doesn't have a classic Descendents sound. It really sounds like their late ALL years with Chad. Just cause I'm not a huge descendents fan don't at all think I hate them I love the songs old songs Sour Grapes, We, This Place, Thank You,When I Get Old,I'm The One, This Place, Everything Suxs and Van. Awesome CD if you like semi nerd rock, I just bought Everything Suxs hope it is as good or better than this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moralistic Claptrap!!! Total Nonsense!!!","review":"This book focuses on how immoral is it to use steroids since they effect the \\"fairness\\" of sporting events. There is an obvious anti-steroid bias that throws doubt on all of the authors' research and motivations.If you want to have the simplistic \\"it's illegal, so it must be immoral\\" line regurgitated repeatedly to you, then this book is for you.If you were looking for an objective book on the benefits (and more importantly) the dangers of steroid use, look somewhere else.Ironically, I've concluded (partial from this book) that the worst dangers in using steroids are due to the fact that you can only get them from illegal sources.

Wonderfully written. Rick was overcome with grief and guilt over losing his unborn child and we learned his thinking, and felt his emotions,as he coped. But I ask you, Mr. Lott, did he have to get in bed naked with another woman and very nearly make love to her in order figure out that he still loved his wife? How do you think this made the other woman, who was a fine person, feel? I would think Rick would be even more guilt-ridden because, at the end of the book, he lists the things he will now talk with his wife about, and this other woman isn't on the list! Great writing but I'm not so sure about the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Oprah!","review":"Once again Oprah turned me onto a great author. Having read Jewel and being impressed, I looked into Lott's other works. This is the first on my list. I enjoyed the book, even though reading something from 1987 can often be disapppointing. I enjoyed the characters of Rick, his friends and Paige. The only thing I'd change is add a little more rememberences of Rick's and Paige's relationship. I'd like to get to know Paige a little better.

Vocabulary words are used in a variety of phrases so that you can learn the transitions from one tone to another. Useful phrases are grouped to teach some basic sentence structures which makes it more likely that you will be able to make independent phrases or sentences of your own rather than just memorizing some fixed phrases. The program suggests that you repeat lessons several times. I needed to repeat many times. I found the printed transcription of each lesson a useful supplement to the repeat after me tapes. As with any auditory program, there is less opportunity to develop comprehension. The booklet refers to the possibility of turning off the English prompts. That would help comprehension but I can't make it work on my conventional car CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This video is more of a marshal arts form than Qigong.

The authors discuss the general background and elements that went into the text and make a number of clear observations about the structures of some charms.Although this book is quite interesting, it suffers greatly from modernist and Romanocentric tendencies. The author is quite scornful of the manuscript and the tradition that produced it, suggesting that it is nothing more than a text of superstitious nonsense.However, this text also discusses the grammar of the Lacnunga, which should be of interest to other scholars of Old English.

Even though this material is on most of their 67-73 releases its still worth having to pop it in and kick back especially with the rare \\"embroyo\\" track available only here. I happen to prefer early Pink floyd up until DSOTM so this and Relics are some of my favorites. I recommend Piper at the gates of dawn -Saucerful of secrets- *Obscured by clouds and *More.

One reason for this is that the band over the years has developed such strong concept albums that taking songs out of context generally did more harm than good. \\"Shine On\\" gets a pass from me because the material was remastered and the packaging absolutely superb. \\"Echoes\\" used that classic PF tool, the segue, to create a compelling mix of songs from the band's career. And \\"Oh, by the Way\\" collects all the Floyd's 14 studio albums for completists and newbies.\\"Works\\" is a better collection of songs than that found on \\"A Collection of Great Dance Songs, and possibly even \\"Relics.\\" But overall, it's a yawner.

Helena's family members are active in resolving these cases, so it appears that we readers will have the pleasure of seeing more of them in future books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"One of Davis' most complicated and subtle mysteries in the Falco series yet. Her writing just gets better and I never get tired of reading about Roman life and it's long history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Because the writing is literate, I would have rated this book a \\"3\\" but for my high expectations when I began reading it. I've reviewed Lindsey Davis' FALCO mysteries before, and always rated them highly--something they deserved--for local color, human interest, scholarship, wit, and unusually good writing.This one goes nowhere. It's plodding, devoid of Falco's usual mental and physical exertions. There's little if any character development except that Helena's brother Aelianus seems to be maturing and mellowing. Falco is acted upon, rather than being his usual competent and courageous self, someone who controls the denouement of the plot. He makes an inordinate number of errors and bad judgments. His actions turn to dust, and at the end nothing really has changed except that a sour widow has unnecessarily died.The humor in all the others is missing here; instead there's a deep cynicism. I'm sure Davis will hit her stride again, but this is the least important novel in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"Package came quickly and it was great to have this blast from our past.

It brought back memories from when we were dating."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Available Translation Of This Toaist Classic","review":"Though Burton Watson's translation comes a close second, this version is the absolute best English translation I have found. Mair includes the \\"rhyming prose\\" the poetry and lots of the zaniness that somehow gets passed over in other translations. For those wishing to have more notes Mair generously refers them to his writings in the Sino-Platonic Papers. Mair is second to none in his understanding of archaic Chinese and takes us back to the truly revolutionary collection of writings that Chuang Tzu really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"No relation to the original work","review":"Having been very familiar with Jacobs' work in humorous \\"interviews\\" with fictitious celebrities, I was very excited about this CD. It turned out to be things that never were initially worthy of release: odd sound effects and early fascination with synthisizers and a few (very few) of the things originally released on the \\"Wide Weird World\\" album of the past. Mark Myers' mention of this on JazzWax alongside the original implied a connection (as does the title)....but there is very little of that here on this overpriced collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"wycliffe","review":"The book arrived before the promised delivery date in excellent condition.

The only thing better would be a teacher to check it, as I believe that there's probably more than one way to arrange the words, but at least you know that what is there is a good example. Otherwise, a really great way to really reinforce!I was a bit overwhelmed in one chapter that suddenly introduced about 40 new verbs all at once, but once I got through that I was up and running again. And fortunatley, the verbs were continued to be used in the next sections. The glossary in the back is pretty good too.I liked this so much that I bought the other two books in the series and will be doing them next.My only pet peeve is a bit of leaning toward castillian over latino, but it's just a few words here and there, so I'm able to substitute for my goals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"This is one in a great series of Spanish study books. Lots of exercises so you can really practice. Also the organization makes for a great reference. My English grammar is terrible so I have a hard time figuring out what tense I want to use. The beginning of each section has an explanation of how the tenses translate. The pronouns and prepositions book is also great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book to improve Spanish","review":"This book is really helpful for people who has middle knowledge of Spanish. The exercises are great and the Spanish is the good Spanish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for logical minds.","review":"This book is one of the few which provides a learning experience based on logical flow of info. So many books try to teach a language through random immersion of the reader. The wookbook exercises provide excellent practice of not just the verbs, but also their formation into sentences. For me this is the only way to learn. A must have resource at a ridiculously cheap price. I already bought a second copy to continue my practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spanglish Speaker Can Learn From This Book","review":"I've tried for years to grasp Spanish without success. Now I'm taking Beginning Spanish at the local college. The second class I was ready to drop, because it didn't seem like beginner level to me. The instructor convinced me to continue. The textbook is so difficult that I decided to buy some other help. This book saved me from dropping a class that had already cost me nearly $200. This was the best $10 I spent on supplies. If I can learn from this book, ANYONE can learn from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful addition to Rosetta Stone","review":"I bought Rosetta Stone and have enjoyed it, but found I needed more instruction on Spanish grammer. This book has helped tremendously. The text is well-presented and to the point. The written exercises reinforce the lessons in ways I just can't do with a computer program. I would buy the same book again just to repeat the excercises when I get rusty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book and PMP Pronouns & Prepositions are my most valuable Spanish texts.

But ... Needs a Supplement","review":"Spanish Verb Tenses is unquestionably good at presenting and explaining the proper context and sequence of verb tenses. Used only as a reference, this guide may be considered 'self-sufficient'.If your goal is conversational ability and eventual fluency however, you will never reach that goal with Spanish Verb Tenses alone.I have been using Behind the Wheel Spanish 8 CDs and Text to actually learn how to speak the language. The text that comes with Behind the Wheel is surprisingly complete, and even includes large verb sections (complete with illustrations no less) that break down the verbs (conjugation in a way).The method used is non-grammatical so a grammar guide such asSpanish Verb Tenses is ideal for use in conjunction with Behind the Wheel Spanish.I am very satisfied with my progress in Spanish using these twoapproaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource for getting over the hump of verbs and tenses","review":"I have taken 4 years of spanish in high school but I hadn't taken a class in over 4 years and had lost most of what I had learned. This is a great resource that introduces (or reintroduces) you to spanish verb forms and tenses. Memorizing verbs and conjugations is probably the most difficult thing to master in the Spanish language but this book makes it easy to comprhend. This is not an instant thing though. Learning any language takes time and practice but this book is exactly what you need to get you over that hump. I would reccomend pairing this book with an audio tape that teaches conversational spanish through dialogues. It allows you to put to use what you learn in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY HELPFUL","review":"I HAVE FOUND IT EASY WORKING ON THIS BOOK EVERSINCE I BOUGHT ITIT HAS EXPLAINED ALMOST EVERTHING TO ME ON HOW TO CONJUGATE THEVERBS UNLIKE ANY OTHER BOOKS, IT HAS VARIOUS OF EXERCISES THAT WOULD LET YOU PRACTICE IN SPEAKING AND WRITING SPANISH IN ANY SITUATION.

In fact, the entire 'Pratice Makes Perfect' series is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"hands down.....the best!","review":"This book really gave me confidence with my spanish. It's simple to follow and you will notice the improvement in your grammar almost immediately. It was even easy to follow when it got down to the subjunctive tense and we all know how daunting that can be. I've bought it for friends, and recommend it whenever I can. If you need help with grammar, this is the book for you. And look how cheap it is!!Too bad it doesn't come in Portuguese and Italian."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"This book by far is one of the most complete and easy to use books I have found. First the concept is explained, and several sets of exercises follow, starting fairly easy and becoming fairly complicated. Answers are in the back (of course!) for those who would like to check their work for accuracy. This verb book and the pronoun/preposition book by the same author are indespensible in my classroom and at home. I highly recommend it to teachers and students!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spanish Book","review":"This is a great book for, well, practicing Spanish Verbs. LOTS of exercises! Lots of verbs. It's probably for the advanced beginner, you need to know some Spanish vocabulary.

No audio, of course, but there are other products for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books are great","review":"The whole series of Spanish Practice Makes Perfect books are great (and cheap).

So why get the strategy guide? Because \\"The World\\", where most of the plot in the game comes from, is vast. So vast that a strategy guide 4 time this size might be able to hold all the maps, items and everything. So why is it missing so much? Because it focuses on only the plot related zones and boasts that it has a \\"secret\\" zone. The fact is the combination of servers and keywords is unfathomable! And after the end of the game, every last one should be available. You might as the question, why would I want to go back to level 3 zones? Well, for completionists, that is very important because the Ryu Books of 1000 log so very much, and most importantly, how many zones you have completed (unlocked all the monster portals).Perhaps I have just been spoiled by books like Star Ocean's strategy guide, but I find this guide to be a joke, because much more \\"complete\\" information about .hack is available online for FREE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"I discovered it on my yahoo radio, and had been looking for it for over a year...as far as I know, it was never released for air play in the United States.

You have to press really hard to get the pony to make the sucking sounds with the bottle, it frustrated them both. I really thought it would do more! It only has a couple of sayings and it just doesn't interact much at all. I think for the price it was a rip off I can't believe it cost so much I truly expected more than this.

Like others have stated here, the speakers are very quiet and can barely be heard even with the ATV shut off.

They may work for some riders/bikes but are definetely not the solution for sport bikes! I recently bought a couple of midlands AVPH8 headsets with throat mics and am hoping that those will work much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected!","review":"This was easy to install, and is easy to use. Using this setup instead of a bluetooth helmet-only product is great because you can use the walkie-talkies independently at other times. Have not used in the rain yet, so I don't know how that will impact the push-button. I will caution that, at full highway speed, my Icon helmet has a lot of wind noise. It makes clear communication difficult due to the noise interference and my husband's voice is not understandable inside the helmet. However, at slower speeds and intersections, this is great. For the price, you can't beat it! Overall, we are extremely satisfied with this setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I ordered a set of the headsets and they didn't work.

The installation was relatively easy and generally I liked the setup. The ear pieces did cause my helmet (HJC CL-SP) to press against my ears but I think my helmet might actually have been the problem.All that became irrelevant though when we discovered that it was difficult to hear each other at 40 mph and impossible by 60. The problem was not wind noise or poor sound quality, it was (like some other reviews have pointed out) that the volume simply did not go loud enough. It even sounded too quiet when we were sitting right next to each other with our bikes idling. Since we spent most of our time at 70 mph the radios were almost useless to us.I noticed that many of the positive reviews mentioned using them with ATVs. Perhaps for low speed use these would be acceptable, but if you are looking for something to use on the highway, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to your walkie-talkie when ATVing","review":"My wife and I use these with our Midland radios when ATVing and are a great investment for closed faced helmets.

The volume is extremely low when a headset is attached and I have to stop my motorcycle to hear. I compared the old and new radio and the volume is approximately 30% lower. I contacted Midland technical support they said that the volume was intentionally set lower on the newer radios when a headset is attached. So, Don't buy any new Midland radios if you intend to use with a helmet headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long wires and low volume","review":"We bought these to communicate on our snow machines. The long wires can be dealt with using velcro wire ties. The low sound volume can't be helped. When we bought these we also bought Midland 30 mile water proof radios. Regardless of the channel the volume in the helmet is to low to be heard over the sound of motorcycle, atv or snowmachine (ours are 4 cycle engined, much quieter)unless they are idling. We are going to try removing one of the headsets to see if that lowers the load on the system to allow full volume. Either that or the speakers and wires have far to much impedance to allow high enough volume. We will be sending three sets back if our mod doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you believe life will present all the opportunities","review":"If you believe in taking things as they come, that opportunities will present themselves, then this book may provide inspiration.

While there are alot of successful people profiled with Ivy league degrees-the core of the message about making a choice with how you live your life personally and professionally really made an impact with me.As with any book, you extract and interpret what is meaningful for you.I've read this book 3 times and each time I get something more from it.I now live the life I imagined and my priorities are synced.Mark's book will give you insight, profiles interesting people and makes you think-that's what I look for in a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"making a life making a living","review":"I found Mark's work to be insightful and courageous.

I was looking for a book that would really show how people make hard choices and focus their lives in alternative paths.I was disappointed and actually could not even finish the book.It lacked depth. Albion could have probed its subjects, could have tried to question them. Instead, he chose to almost worships them.Life is full of difficult choices. I personally have looked for books that open my eyes to new ways of looking at things, for in that I may find \\"my truth\\". This book tries to sell us \\"one truth\\" almost as a one-size-fits-all solution. I don't buy that.For a book of this type, with life-stories examples, I suggest Po Bronson's \\"What should I do with my life\\".

[insert touching story of how we met or some incident about our relationship.] I had all the opportunities in the world. Nevertheless, I decided to devote my life to helping others because I'm just that kind of guy. It's been rough but wonderful because of the inherent rewards of sacrificing myself for others. Sure, my company is slowly sliding into bankrupcy, yet I'm proud of what I've done because I am helping others. You should too. \\" I'm glad I got it at the library and didn't buy it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letdown","review":"Having enjoyed \\"Mr. Darcy's Daughters\\" written by Elizabeth Ashton it was with great anticipation that I began this book. I ended the book with great letdown. While I will not dispute that \\"flagellants and sodomites\\" existed during this era, I know it as something that Jane Austin did not dwell on in her writings. I wish that Ms. Ashton had \\"kept a good thing going\\" and continued on more in the keeping of her first book and those of Jane Austin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, long, and I skipped about half of it","review":"Although I admit I wasn't expecting much when I bought this book, I was very disappointed. I rather enjoyed Mr. Darcy's Daughters, but this sequel, which involes Mr. Darcy's (Of Pride and Prejudice fame) daughter, Alethea, was not only boring but at times so silly the reader is almost reduced to laughter.Alethea leaves he abusive husband under the guise os a young man with ony her maid, Figgins, with her. They meet a dashing English gentleman who immediately recognizes Alethea and keeps an eye on her as she runs around the European continent in search of her elder sister Camillia, who was the heroine of the last book.Alethea is not only an unlikable heroine, but she is silly, and the reader loses interest in her quickly. The book was salvagable only for its lush description of Italian countryside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying","review":"It's well handled, a good approximation to the literary style of the period....finished it saying \\"Well that was surprisingly good, I'll have to read the prequel.\\" Then I unfortunately turned the page and saw the \\"Discussion group questions.\\" How pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is boring and lifeless","review":"The book is boring! The characters are boring. I'm one half way through it and ready to toss it out! The characters have no personality and with the exception of the main character and her servant (so far) each one is immoral in one way or another . . . . also the dialogue is seriously lacking. It's a thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Exploits & Adventures of Miss Alethea Darcy : A Novel","review":"Well, I expected more romance and a little more detail into each others lives, but over all it was good. Goes into a little more detail at times than needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A frothy tale of manners, morals and an obvious love story","review":"Ok, no one can equal Austen with her own characters, and one of the beauties of this book is that Elizabeth Aston doesn't really try. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. What is more pleasing in a light read, after all, than a dilemma, a daring young woman defying convention, implications of breaking those tiresome conventions discussed in some terrifying detail, a journey of some discomfort and danger, death, opera, romance and rescue? I would think that most Jane Austen fans would enjoy this novel, and I abhor most sequels to the beloved Pride and Prejudice. They try too hard and put words in Elizabeth Bennett Darcy's mouth, and Aston does not presume to do this. She creates the world of Elizabeth's children in a way that is both a tribute to the original, and uniquely her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyed","review":"Pride and Prejudice is my all time favorite novel and I love to read sequels to it. I really enjoyed Mr. Darcy's Daughter's and went straight into this book after finishing it. I like Aston's style and both books are very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is kinda awful","review":"While this recording has some wonderfully talented people included it's just a mess. I love Jennifer Hudson but her rendition of \\"Easy to Be Hard\\" is painful to listen to at points because she's over singing. Over singing seems to be a theme because several songs are just shrill and could have done with the singers toning it down a bit. Norm Lewis is great starting off \\"The Flesh Failures/Let the Sunshine In\\" and the second guy is really strong but around the time the song breaks into the chorus of let the sun shine in things get lost and the ending is a total mess. The high point is probably Adam Pascal's performance on \\"I Got Life\\" with Raúl Esparza's \\"Hair\\" coming in a close second. I'd suggest saving some money and buying another recording and downloading a few individual songs from this album if you just want to hear them for fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This recording is very disappointing.....","review":"After reading the below reviews, I decided to purchase this CD. I am a huge fan of the play, movie, and their respective recordings- BUT, this CD is terrible. The songs are very oversung- some of them even sound like they have a choir in the background! There is no continuity to the singers, and wonderful classic songs like \\"Where do I go\\" are sung by the opposite gender?!? I have never written one of these reviews before, but I hope you consider carefully before purchasing this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for Broadway fans!","review":"I wasn't at the live concert this recording was based on, but it must have been a night to remember! And while I usually prefer to hear live recordings, in this case the studio definitely has the advantage. It's much more fun to add your own applause and woo-hoos to each show-stopping number as you listen to these beautifully engineered tracks. The incredibly talented Seth Rudetsky is the Music Director, presiding over a who's who of the brightest lights on Broadway today. Hard to pick out highlights, but Shoshana Bean's high A-flat over high C is already worth the price of the disc. Ditto Harvey Fierstein's take on \\"Air.\\" Buy this disc for anyone who doesn't think we're living in a Golden Age of talent on Broadway!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this CD made in 2002 or 1996?","review":"Peter Rauhofer is T-I-R-E-D. This cd is so completely uninnovative I'm at a complete loss for words. OK, well not a complete loss...Let me try to explain it to you...The song selection is weak. We've heard all of this before. It all sounds the same. His transitions last a maximum of 30 seconds, compared to the 1:30-2:00 famous-dj standard. Mixed CDs are supposed to be about the art of MIXING, right? This one fails. Besides mixing, its about a great selection of songs...It seems here that he's uncapable of even that! If you like emotionless, repetetive non-progressive, non-impressive CIRCUIT music (yawn), then this cd is for you. For the rest of us who have higher standards of our Djs, I suggest overlooking this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A snapshot of Peter Rauhofer in his prime","review":"This mix cd, released 3(!!!)years ago, still sounds fresh and interesting as ever. As noted previously, this CD is especially hot for many unreleased, very hard to find tracks: Javith's \\"Workin'\\", \\"Must Be Love\\", \\"Samba Nation\\", my favorite - \\"Kiss My Way\\", and \\"Work it to The Bone\\" and \\"Shake\\" - two AMAZING tribal tracks included here. I think that this collection shows Rauhofer in a genuine and creative light; his passion and aesthetic for the sound is fervently illustrated in every 4/4 bass line."},{"rating":"1","title":"i shoulda spent the money on asprin","review":"this cd gives me a headache. if this is what i was to expect im glad he didnt show up for that party in LA last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"More soulless circuit cheese from the Borg of house music","review":"Listening to Peter Rauhofer at the Roxy is like listening to the Borg spin. Sure, his flawless tehcnicality is admirable, but house music is supposed to have a soul. All technique, no feeling. You leave the club feeling tired and empty. This CD caputres that feeling well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be impressive?","review":"I recently purchased both this CD and Rauhofer's Essential mix. I heard a few of his remixes for other artists that sounded pretty good, so it seemed reasonable to take a risk on something more substantial. In this case it was a mistake. Listened to both CDs here and I was very unimpressed. There's not a whole lot of range in his selections. Not much rise and fall, and not a single standout track. This is all mediocre club sh-t. I bought this used for a decent price, so I can't complain too much, but had I paid full price for a new copy, I would be REALLY mad right now. Live @ Roxy 1 will hopefully make a decent beverage coaster, because I doubt I'll ever listen to it again. Unless you like wasting money, or you worship at the altar of mediocrity, skip this and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some girls all bitter","review":"I think you girls who dislike Rauhofer have been out TOO much and are all bitter. It's not that bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CDs, but its not him live","review":"Peter Rauhofer is my favorite DJ and I have heard him live on numerous occasions...this CD compilation is close to Peter Rauhofer live, but not quite...he is much darker live and plays a lot less lyrical songs when he is \\"Live At Roxy\\"...however these CDs are still pretty close to a great night out in NYC or Washington DC, and I listen to them constantly...great work Peter, you never fail to impress!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lon Po Po: My Idea.","review":"I think it is a good book for ages 8 and up. Because I read it to my two little siblings; Jessica, age 7 and Brendan, age 4; and they thought it was to scary for them.It was interesting because: it was kind of a backwards story of Little Red Riding Hood which I thought was something new instead of the same old story; I liked how the children in the story out-smarted the wolf by tricking him into allowing them to pull him up in a basket in a tall tree and that's how they captured him and killed him; and I thought it was neat that other countries have this story also, their story, though, is different in some ways but a lot a like in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever girls defeat the wolf","review":"This is a rare childrens book about how three little girls defeat the wolf.

Contemporary (published in it original form in 1929), analytical, and ahead of its time, Cru's insightful ideas and monumental research point by comparison to a great gap in the English speaking historiography of Great War literary memory. His themes are more akin to criticism written in the 1970s than that of the 1930s, and his comment on men at war unparalled in scope and depth. Controversial, to be sure, but Cru has built an argument that is difficult to assail and essential to incorporate in any account of the First World War."},{"rating":"2","title":"90 Degree Clips","review":"Very easy to handle much better than the regular clips that come with the Traxxas bodies.

These clips are about the same thickness as the universal clips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative with Lovely Illustrations","review":"I read this book with my 8-yr. old daughter and she and I both enjoyed it. I had planned to read only a little, but it was so interesting she kept begging to read \\"one more century\\" and I was happy to oblige. The book is well written and informative. The illustrations are beautiful and really bring the text to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I guess that I must not be a jazz expert because I find this CD to be a big dissapointment. The songs that are to be uptempo aren't and the ballads are boring. Perhaps I am have been accustomed to listening to the Oscar Peterson's and Roy Hargrove's of this world. These guys know how to put together a good CD. By the end of this Cd, I was bored. I guess they won't let me send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is awesome","review":"Joshua Redman's music has truly been an inspiration. He is one of the sole reasons that I LOVE and listen to jazz and this CD is a testimonial to the AWE that is J. Redman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and beyond.","review":"I cannot imagine a more graceful blending of two often contradictory trends, a spirit of improvisation that remains unabashed in its delight for the beautiful. I think Trane would be pleased to see his spiit so reverently sustained. Almost every cut evolves into something greater than the sum of its parts. This has a nicely balanced supporting cast, and I will continue to look for big things for pianist Aaron Goldberg. In short, both tasteful and tasty. This would be a great disc to use to introduce improvisational, free jazz to a neophyte, working backwards towards his spiritual and aesthetic forebears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might even be a tribute to the saxophone itself.","review":"What I liked about this album, perhaps the most enjoyable from this artist, was the complete ease his playing conveys throughout. Whether lyrical as on \\"Courage\\" or upbeat as on \\"Stoic\\" or sensuous and melodic almost Ben Websterish on \\"Twilight ...and beyond\\" Mr Redman is completely at ease, with nothing to prove. If Mr Charles Parker was right when he said \\"If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn\\" then Mr Redman is one contended human with Peace in his heart. I loved the tongueing - slapping a la early Hawk on \\"Last Rites of Rock and Roll\\" which was a real hoot. Overall, a very well conceived and well played album worthy of many many listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set - love the scissors","review":"I have had 1 set of these for about 5 years. They have been very good and I love the scissors. The handles quickly snap apart for easy washing. I like how the set comes with the basics and they leave a few slots open for adding any others you may want. I find this is the perfect amount and the block size is not super huge on my counter.

Natalie candidly talks about her drug abuse, negligence as a mother, two failed marriages, finding God, and many tribulations and triumphs in her 25 year recording career. I truly admire Ms. Cole for having the courage to write her story and share it with us. This is a truly inspiring book that I got alot out of through Ms. Coles wisdom to get her life in order. God Bless you Natalie, much love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. I was hooked from the first page. I think it took a lot of guts to write about some of the things Natalie experienced while growing up and during her career. She was brutally honest & candid about her drug use and I'm glad that she's been able to stay clean. The book was very riveting and yet humorous at times. I can only hope that Natalie can someday mend the rift between her and her Mom.I graduated the same year that \\"This Will Be\\" became a hit. That's the Natalie Cole that I remember. I wasn't aware of her father's legacy nor the big shoes that she had to fill. I too saw the movie but it doesn't do the book justice!After reading this book it makes you want to listen to all of her CD's. Thank you Natalie for never giving up.

Then one of the extensions broke off and I ordered another one. It was flimsier and the sizing was different than the original. So I ordered a different size and it too was flimsy and now way too big (the 1st was too small) and my dog weighed the same. So I don't know what happened to the quality of the product, but whatever happened took a great product to one I don't ever use. I was hugely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"So far, so good on this harness. I have a 60 lb hound that I bought a med harness for (I do not consider 55 lbs a big dog). It was too small so I reordered a large. The large fits him fine & does seem to do the trick, making him pull less. So far I am liking this one. All the other harnesses I bought loosened up on him on walks; not to mention he still pulled. If you watch the size it's a good harness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't stop him from pulling","review":"I have a 70lb. mixed breed dog that loves to pull on the leash. When I first put this harness on him it seemed to be working. The pulling wasn't as bad. However, as soon as he got used to the feeling of having it on, his pulling was as bad as ever. Also, it is a pain to put off and on, the straps are so thin that if I tried to leave it on him he could chew through them in no time. A friend of mine has the same harness and said it works pretty well on her dog; maybe it just depends on the dog, but it wasn't successful with mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is not a script of the movie.

Current research is much more advanced than it was in 1940! (For those of you who aare like me - remember the English Bodice!)Dates were very general and any portraits or art were undated.If you are a generalist, than this book mught be OK, but if you are someone looking to interpret a time period accurately, I'd recommend Linda Baumgarten, Sharon Burnston or Aileen Ribiero instead.As for me, I'm returning the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful reference...","review":"A terrific resource for anyone interested in fashion accessories throughout the ages.

Perhaps he should go live in the Utopia of real world Cuba?? They recently just jailed more 'journalists', that can't be good??? Now we see Gore and Obama wanting us to move to cities to stop urban sprawl, eat less, drive cars they deem 'good for us' while POTUS Obama flies a pizza chef 850 miles to prepare him the 'best pizza' in the world.

The Dharma approach is great for the subject matter because I think a lot of us lose sight of our individuality when we partner with someone - this loss of autonomy and neglect of personal accountablity is the death knell for many great partnerships. The book also provides a lot of common sense for navigating the world of dating and the growing pains of a new relationship - and of course, how to break it off well and with dignity.This is a must have for anyone in a relationship or thinking about re-entering the dating scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on love, relationships and life...","review":"because Arthur Jeon writes of LIVING. Teaching that it is best to live - and, more importantly, love - in the present applies to every aspect of life. Though there is much wisdom in these pages on how to deal with love relationships at every stage, the most important is how one lives as an individual.

Jeon's writing style leaves a lot to be desired-he often presents rambling, confusing ideas through antecdotes from his own life. Usually these stories involve him setting his friends straight with the wisdom he's acquired. This wisdom has come to him through the many relationships he keeps reminding us he's had. When I got to the part where he counsels a friend who just discovered his girlfriend's breasts are fake I had to throw the book down.

If you are even a passing Amon Tobin Fan, this CD is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"AK47..","review":"This CD is spine chillingly brilliant. Relighting memories of hiding in the shadows, and lurching out at your unsuspecting enemies. It's only once you have heard Amon Tobin's work, without being chased by an AK47, that you can really start to appreciate every aspect of this masterpiece. It makes you feel emotions that would never see the light of day in normal music. Simply outstanding! A must buy for a Splinter Cell fan, or for someone that has never played the game. You can't go wrong, in feeling something for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"I really enjoyed this soundtrack.

But now that I have found Bakery On Main granola, I can enjoy it as a topping on my yogurt or just with milk for breakfast.

I would rate most of them ***** for the most part. But to me, this initial set for Blue Note doesn't quite measure up to their later contributions. Being a musician myself I can understand what went down on this date and empathize with trying to make a good first impression. But I sense a case of jitters here.Several selections are over worked and sound forced and \\"Bobby\\" is downright frantic. I kept saying to myself \\"Relax guys, relax!!\\" But those observations aside, this is still a good album and worth a listen or two. But if you are a first time listener to this legendary trio please check out such albums as \\"Moods\\", \\"Here We Come!\\" or \\"Feelin' Good\\" first. With these and others, the Sounds got their groove and confidence and proved they were as good as any such trio jazz has ever produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst game ever played","review":"i bought this game thinking that as it is based on space and aliens, it must be a great entertainment. i was shocked to find that it was so under the grade and i think if there had been stars for negative marking then i would have given it 5 stars for the worst game. don't buy this game, it is so boring and so bad, u will be very upset that you have spent money on such a bad game like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to their high standard","review":"you want great songs like Paninaro or in the night, get their Altenative album (those versions are shorter but otherwise pretty much the same). this remix of Love comes quickly is better than the original but, let's face it, it is not that great. Making West End Girls longer and changing its beat does not really make it considerably better. Anyway, this Cd is for huge fans only and even they should get it used.

I've always considered him one of the greatest voices in music today. He is not afraid to touch todays material, and in doing so does a very credible job. Can anyone imagine him doing Iggy's \\"Lust For Life\\"? There is a duet with Van Morrison that to my mind doesn't come off completely right. That is because the two voices aren't as compatible as one might think. Tom overpowersVan's vocals. The Talking Heads \\"Burning Down The House\\" has a flame just as high as the original. This is proof that Tom Jones should still be contemporary music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and Featherweight!","review":"My first titanium watch was a Skagen 105LTX (a classy all-Ti watch with a link band), and this is my second Skagen. Whereas the former served well with a button-down shirt, the 360LTMRB with the rubber band is perfect for daily wear. This watch comes from Skagen's Performance collection, so it is built to be more rugged than a typical Skagen: 100M water resistance (versus 30M typical), durable all-weather rubber band (which is very comfortable compared to rubber bands from Swiss Army), a screw-down adjustment knob, and I noticed on the backplate that the mineral crystal is 'super hardened'. The 360LTMRB also sports a nice chronograph, and I love the uniquely numbered dial which references minutes instead of hours. Like a typical Skagen, this model has a slim case, employs Japanese movement, and is featherweight because of the titanium case and components (so light I often don't realize I am wearing a watch). I highly recommend this model!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome watch!","review":"This is my favorite watch so far. It looks very cool and it works great. This watch is very light, which is nice because I forget that I have it on my hand. This watch definitely turns heads and draws compliments from people with its all black design and sleek case. I had this watch with me in Cancun for 10 days where it was in salty water most of the time and it worked flawlessly!

Its argument is tendentious and its scholarship trashy. To mention a random example, Welsh points out Freud's habit of never having discussions after reading papers, quoting Jones (his only source) for support. Now, I would advise Professor Welsh to do a little bit of research on this subject--5 minutes of research and careful reading would suffice to prove the contrary. It seems to be a recent trend to believe Jones whenever he writes something stupid, and ignore everything else. Professor Welsh is just another one of those trendy academics who are ready to jump on Freud whenever they see a chance. His strategy of calling Freud a product of the 19th century is old, really old, as if our malicious professor hasn't read much of the anti-Freudian literature either.

The author does a superb job of seamlessly weaving together the many colorful strands of the social and scientific fabric that served as backdrop to Darlington's life. With Harman as a guide, the reader gains a unique first-hand appreciation for Darlington's days, reliving them as heady times for genetics in particular and for society as a whole.A must-read for all those in the know.

Evil men, etc. \\"Sin City\\" makes \\"Goldfish\\" look like a \\"Garfield\\" episode. There wasn't much violence at all and there was of course a stupid Mexican stand off in the end. Also, the main character is about as appealing as a booger on a public hand rail: weasely, ugly, wimpy, stupid, whiny, a horrible parent in need of a good barber. I have not read Torso or Jinx and, in truth, they do sound much more entertaining in aspect, BUT \\"Goldfish\\" was so unenjoyable I may not buy either of them.

Certainly too this album is no Enigma. These album felt very short from the album \\"Behavior\\" or from Enigma albums. Don't allow this album to make a wrong impression about Red Flag.

We HAD originally tried the 'doggie daycare' sets but they were VERY flimsy. They broke immediately though the dogs were adorable and it was a cute idea. This pet shop line is much more sturdy and great to play with. The little tree top swing actually moves- you wind it up and place one of the magnetic animals on top and it turns in circles. GREAT TOY, would reccommend to parents of little girls and boys who like animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Bass Players! Buy this book! Excellent!","review":"If you play bass, this is the best book I have seen for learning chords.

This book is the ultimate private tutor for bass players, new, intermediate, and the most advanced. Perhaps the only drawback is that the book should be available in a spiral-bound edition for the music stand. I strongly recommend this classic with Chord Progressions for Songwriters by Richard J.

The sheer beauty in her voice can only be measure with that of a goddess. La Lune is perfection her voice quality and technique improve with every cd. Her coloratura is better than ever and her lyric voice is astonishing. She has done almost everything there can be done in the singing world. She did heavenly in opera pop and broadway.Even though she went through alot of critisism from those opera picky people that said her voice wasnt powerful enough just so she can prove them wrong. She did great in La Wally as well as O mio babbino caro. Not to mention her recent duet with Church (pie jesu) was also great which is not opera. Her contribution to music has been great and vast. We can never get tired of her singing or of this Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I have all of Sarah's CD's and this is by far the best. The title song \\"La Luna\\" is mesmerizing --- it seems Dvorak wrote it with her in mind (if that were somehow possible). I sometimes find myself wishing she would sing only classical pieces but then when I hear songs like \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" and \\"Heaven is Here\\", I'm glad she doesn't. I can listen to her voice forever and never get tired of it. And that's what an artist is all about, is it not? Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4.5 stars...","review":"This CD combines the diverse voice of Sarah Brightman with amazing music to create a CD that you won't want to take out of your CD player. While you might be hesitant about buying an opera singer's CD, you will be amazed by how many different types of songs Sarah Bringtman can perform. Some are pop and others alternative, some mellow and others uplifting. I won't lie to you, a few are opera-ish, but even non opera lovers, like myself, will find this CD extremly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely pretty, but not innovative","review":"La Luna is beautiful throughout, but I did miss the hip hop/classical amalgamations she is so good at doing. There are no surprises like Anytime Anywhere off of Eden. Even her earlier effort \\"Fly\\" had more innovative tunes. I would've loved to have given this CD 5 stars, but I feel it's a slight step backwards in terms of adventurousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced garbage!","review":"I generally love Sarah Brightman, but I think this CD is an overly slick, over produced piece of garbage.

WOW. And Eden was even better. How much better can she get? So, I read some very much positive reviews about La Luna and bought it thinking this must really be good. What a disappointment. Scarbourough Fair? Hated it then. Hate it now. I think the song selections are unfortunate in that the songs in themselves are unremarkable for the most part but also prevent her from displaying her remarkable voice like In Pace did or O Mio Babbino Caro on GoodBye and just about everything on Eden. La Luna...might as well go bark at the moon than waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"La Looney","review":"Most tracks are just wrong. Maybe she could tone down on the special effects. The ones where she's singin like she's in \\"heaven\\" are okay..like serenade. Focus on those maybe.

Classical entusiasts will appreciate her Beethoven rendtion, jazz enthusiats should listen to her Gloomy Sunday track (just excellent), and pop enthusiats will find Hijo de la Luna terrific (I find I listen to that one over and over...). Sarah Brightman has topped herself with this...wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Keeps Getting Better","review":"I ran across this import on holiday in Washington DC. Just one listen to the 1st track, through borrowed walkman speakers, made me realise I'd have paid triple the amount for this album. I was moved to tears. I found myself having to explain to companions how compelling Ms. Brightman's voice & phrasing is so they'd stop asking what was wrong. I too would have thought she couldn't out do \\"Eden\\", how wrong I was! \\"La Luna\\" is expertly crafted from beginning to end; from classical to light pop she returns to the style she is now known for pioneering. If you can wait for the US release, do, it will contain tracks not on the European release ( according to her website ) or do what I plan to do, buy both! What ever your plan, DO pick this up, you're sure to be like me, playing it over & over enjoying this superb recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Luna is a masterpiece","review":"Being a longtime Sarah Brightman fan, I rushed out to the local CD store the day this came out. I listened to it during the drive home, and once I finished I was amazed at how beautiful this disc is. Like Eden, another amazing album, she mixes various styles together to make a gorgeous listen. She does everything from classical to jazz on this album, and they all sound fantastic. The theme centered around this CD is the moon, and all the songs have something to do with the moon (I think they're stretching it on a few however), which also enhances this album. One of my favorites is the cover of Dido's Here With Me. Sarah can take any song and give it her own personal touch. This is a must have for longtime fans, and a great starting place for new ones. I wish Sarah the best of luck with the rest of her career, and cannot wait for her next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new album by Sarah...it's a MIRACLE!","review":"Actually, this is the UK version of her new album. (It'll hit America in September, from what I've heard.) Sarah, as did Andrea Bocelli, changed the look of classical music once and for all with \\"Time To Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Eden\\", which could mean she might do the same with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely album & voice","review":"I have only recently started listening to Sarah Brightman but her albums and voice are absolutely beautiful.I can't understand the critics that say she is not a true operatic singer - who cares? She has never said she was and I like her music for what it is. Personally, I far prefer her way of singing to the true operatic singers anyway. Her voices goes from pop to classical so easily and she sounds wonderful. I also don't hear the breathy, weedy sound they have complained of either - her voice sounds strong to my ears and so far I love every song on the albums I have bought. I still have to try Harem and Eden and I am sure they are as good.If you like these type of 'crossover' singers another British one to try out is Russel Watson - he is the male version of Sarah Brightman. Also Katherine Jenkins although I much prefer Sarah Brightman to Katherine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sterile","review":"I loved Eden, but La Luna pales in comparison, suffering both from a cringe-inducing rendition of \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" and rather bland orchestration through every other song. Her attempt to out-Dido Dido (on \\"Here With Me\\") is not outright embarassing, but shows how a passionate song can be dragged down to muzak-level (or not quite) when the re-invention is given generic production. Who is to blame? Frank Peterson, the producer, should have realized the whole album was taking on a quaalude-in-Southern-California ambience and tried to bring some real life back into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A different opinion","review":"I love SB, but I don't love this CD! To me it is totally boring, with every song sounding the same. I have several of her CD's and love them all. This one is a disappointment. There is no excitement to it, just boring songs. She has a marvelous voice and I prefer her other CD's to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atmospheric Nonsense","review":"This CD has a string of mostly unknown tracks loosely hung together by the \\"Moon\\" theme. It is well recorded and orchestrated and therefore has some nice \\"tone colors\\" but unfortunately thats all thats good about this CD. It consists of mostly atmospheric nonsense. If you like a good melody, like me you wont' like this one. Harmonically speaking it's pretty boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"The newest CD put out by classical diva Sarah Brightman. It includes several songs not included on the European Import Version. The best one in my opinion is The First Love, a soft but defined pop song. There are alot of Opera pieces here, but Sarah delivers them in her graceful manner as usual. I would highly recommend La Luna, all the way to the moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"music CD","review":"I have always liked Sarah Brightman since she starred in Phantom of the Opera.

She is an excellent soprano singer and is versitle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice like fine wine","review":"Sarah's voice has become even more delectable since I first time heard her ten years ago. And just like fine wine Sarah is either an acquired taste or something that you have always loved ever since the first moment you heard her sing. She is a woman who cannot be categorized. I do recommend this album, especially to those who enjoyed her sing ''Time to Say Goodbye''. The strength and sweetness of her voice is like no other, that sounds the same if not better in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job!","review":"La Luna was the hardest cd for me to find. her mystical lyrics truly amaze me. her remake of dido's here with me is much better than dido's version!(sorry, Dido!) I especially love Hijo de la Luna and winter in July. Overall, a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing new release","review":"This is a very disappointing new release from Sarah Brightman. Her vocal mannerisms have become more and more exaggerated in recent years and they have become quite off-putting here. More importantly, all the songs, and indeed every note, is sung in the same style, and is full of unnecessary affectation. It makes really tiresome listening! If she continues to turn up such poor and shoddily put together recordings, I'm afraid this will be the last time I buy her recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems...","review":"There is a problem with La Luna.... It's too boring!! It's far more boring than her other works. And as usual, Sarah's weak voice doesn't help her out at all.Winter In July - A good song, but it gets boring...Figlio Perduto - One of the two songs that's not boring. The only song that's worth hearing.A Whiter Shade of Pale - I didn't like this at all.He Doesn't See Me - BORINGHow Fair This Place - Again, this shows off Sarah's weak voice.Hijo De La Luna - great song. not boring at all.Solo Con Te - AWFUL!!! I have heard lots of sopranos sing this song, but Sarah's is the worst!! Wagnerian singer Kirsten Flagstad's version is really beautiful, I recommend that recording, but not this. This was simply a torture to my ears!!La Luna - I have written something about this in my rewiew for \\"Classics\\". Sarah's voice is too weak to sing this. Listen to Renee Fleming's Moon Song and compare it with Sarah's. Fleming's version has more power and emotion. It brang tears to my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disspointing, too produced, too much technology","review":"I am highly dissapointed in this album, especially Sarah Brightman's cover photo which in my opinion is full of vanity. I find this album to represent no personal talent. Everything is technological and spacy feeling. I dislike greatly how it makes me feel. \\"Here with Me\\" is terribly weak. What is \\"This Love\\" about anyway? Such poor lyrics. This album proves only to be full of tease and vanity. Sarah is full of guile and I see no innocence nor wisdom in her as I do in other female artists such as Lisa Gerrard. Now that woman needs to make it big! Not this barbie doll who pretends she is an angel. This is a very poor, immature album! I wanted to be honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I was shopping at Virgin-Mega Store in NYC when this CD came on over the store's sound system. It absolutely stopped me in my tracks - Sarah's voice and the music are absolutely entrancing. Once I recovered my wits I made my way to the front of the store to find out what was playing. Don't make the mistake of assuming that \\"Classical\\" isn't your style without listening to this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting better all the time","review":"Another great thematic outing. Like an all-star pitcher who toys with you, showing you a slow curve, then a change-up, then an off-speed slider, just before knocking your socks off with that legendary 100+ mile-an-hour fast ball, Sarah Brightman's sweet, fragile, little-girl voice sets you up with a quaint pop ballad just before hitting you with that glass-breaking aria. And that's her charm and allure - the suppressed power always lurking just beneath the surface that can explode at any time to knock the audience out of its seat. She's probably done more for classical music than a thousand symphony charity balls. A unique niche she is carving out for herself in world music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music, sound & art design","review":"Forget about the wonderful music, forget about the wonderful voice.

It was a big disappointment. It was labor to listen to it, whereas with her earlier mentioned CD's it was joyous and effortless to listen to her. After forcing myself to listen to the first 9 songs, I started skipping over the remaining tracks. The songs on this CD don't show off her fabulous vocal range at all. If you want to listen to another CD like Eden or Time to Say Goodbye, save your money and don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I and my wife were very disappointed by this recording. We both are Sarah fans but this recording appears does no justice to her voice at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very UnSarah Brightman","review":"As fans of Ms. Brightman, we anticipated this CD, expecting to hear her extraordinary voice shine throughout the entire CD. We are most disappointed! The selections find her at her best and worst. Although her technical and artistic talents remain intact, her producers attempts to force fit her into more modern renditions failed. She is better served remaining within the music repertoire, upon which she built her splendid career. This attempt at seemingly New Age genre, does her and the listener a grave disservice. It should be also noted that the great virtuoso, Andre Bocelli, sadly discovered the same fate and resolved to abandon the allure of lucrative cross-over sales to protect his stunning legacy. We hope he passes his decision along to his dear friend, Ms. Brightman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Variety of Music","review":"The La Luna Soundtrack CD is a very nice production for Sarah Brightman. The CD is a concert soundtrack comprised of a variety of songs that were collected for a television concert in the year 2000. La Luna is most enjoyable to listen to because Sarah's vocals are absolutely beautiful, capturing, and amazing. If you never heard Sarah's angelic soprano/alto voice you are in for a treat. The actual concert DVD video, from which this soundtrack is taken from, is available through Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing!","review":"La Luna is such a beautiful, classy album.

Despite the title, this book isn't much of a course at all. Most of it is just straight Arabic text for you to read, with no translations, so you don't even know if you're reading correctly. The book does a better job of teaching you (if you know Arabic) about the Middle East than it does teaching Arabic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard arabic review","review":"The most clear definciency of this book, in my opinion, is the lack of a vocubulary list with their meanings and possibly their pronouciations.

She goes much beyond the dry facts to the underlying meaning of these studies and why each is so important in its own unique way.The sections about Rosenhan's \\"On Being Sane in Insane Places\\", Loftus' memory studies, Milgram's obedience studies, and the bystander effect are extremely well written, especially the Rosenhan section.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent account of the great experiements","review":"This book has impressive breadth, and depth, regarding its subject: great psychological experiments. Some, it appears, have quibbled with errors Slater has made -- the misspelling of a chimpanzee's name, for instance, or the number of saints cannonized since the 1980's. These minute errors detract from the fact that all the great experiments are described in terms that are conceptually and thematically accurate; in addition, the author brings these experiements to life so beautifully and vividly that one is left, at the end of the book, with an indelible sense of 20th century psychology and the tremendous journey it has taken. A terrific read; a credible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"in science, truth matters","review":"For heaven's sake, do not assign this to students as part of a \\"psychology\\" course.

Now that would be educational!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent look at major psychological experiments","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I was not dissapointed. Slater does a great job portraying the people behind psychological science while simultaneously explaining that science in ways I think ARE EXCEEDINGLY CREDIBLE. People who have taken issue with this book clearly have some deep seated insecurities regarding the status of psychology and psychiatry as a science, and, in order to compensate for those insecurities, have fastened onto a whole raft of criticisms that are, in fact, simply irrelevant to this book. I am dismayed by how my colleagues have been acting. I suggest you read this book if you wish to gain insight and comprehension into the field. If you wish to gain insight into and comprehension of the politics involved in this field, you don't even need to read the book.

Slater's prose is heated up but the author's viewpoint remains entirely anchored within herself. The most vivid psychological lesson of the book has to do with the author's self-absorption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing Look at Psychology","review":"Lauren Slater is one of the best writers on psychology in America today. This is fitting as Slater herself has experienced her share of psychological trauma.Her latest book, Opening Skinner's Box, is an investigation into 10 of the most infamous psychological experiments in American history. Slater is an excellent popularizer of information generated by academic research. Slater is also judgmental of psychologists who mess things up such as Elizabeth Loftus of the widely discredited False Memory Syndrome.This book is an honest and revealing look at the world of psychology as it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"best psychology book out there","review":"OPENING SKINNERS BOX provides a fascinating journey through 20th century psychology while also illuminating the conflicts and achievements particular to that century. From Eric Kandel's work on memory to Milgram's infamous shock machine, this book tells the tale of each experiment in gripping narrative form. As a psychologist myself I can speak to the accuracy of the text. If I have one complaint it's that Slater has left out of her book several novel experiments. Still, read this book if you want to learn about the core issues in the history of psychology, or just read it for the pleasure of its extraordinary stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I didn't spend money on this.","review":"I don't know enough about the subject to make any kind of criticism based on the facts presented, and I don't think I could even if I did, because the writing in this book is so awful I couldn't read enough of it to find out much about her ideas. The prose is like something out some earnest and terrible romantic novel. I'm writing this review mainly because I was thinking of buying this book, but decided to vet it first by checking it out of the library, best money I ever saved; and I just felt I should let others know that it's a good idea to preview this before purchasing, and the other glowing reviews listed here are very misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be marketed as fiction","review":"Slater is a talented writer but a terrible reporter who ignores facts when they are inconvenient to the story she is spinning. (see articles in the Times of London and the New York Times this month) Her editors have compounded the problem. What actually happened and and what's a product of Slater's imagination? Hard to tell. This edition of the book should be withdrawn from the market and reissued with all its errors corrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction","review":"Although presented as non-fiction, this book is actually fiction, and readers should be cautioned not to take anything in it seriously. Many reviewers have already described the many inaccuracies in the book, so I will not repeat them here. Reading this book is comparable to reading wikipedia - it's all just one person's biased opinion. If you want to know what really happened in the experiments described in this book, all you have to do is read any introductory psychology text, or the original articles. Most people are so lazy they prefer reading dumbed down, fictional versions as presented in books like this. Reading this book will just make you more ignorant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"It is often factually incorrect, has a tendency to unnecessarily jump from present to past tense, and is more dramatized than it should be. I understand that Slater is trying to present her ideas in a interesting way but she takes an eternity to get to the point. I could not even get through the first chapter, to be honest - it is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even garbage can produce energy","review":"Wow! This author received an award fo this book? It is incrdible how a poorly researched book, written by an admitted mentally ill person, is used as a psychology book.I read until I told my son about skinners daughter comitting suicide. My son said \\"Dad Skinners daughter lives in London and is alive.\\" I took this book, ripped it into pieces and threw it in the garbage. I never finished reading it.\\"It is better not to believe 10 truths, than to believe one lie. Lauren Slater should not be allowed to sell anything labeled non-fiction. I am so mad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"But is it True?","review":"Slater is a very talented writer, and she has produced a book that purports to allow non-technical readers in on the most important psychological experiments of the modern era. She has chosen well, and the experiments described are indeed very important ones. Unfortuately the book is filled with errors, distortions, misinterpretations and, probably plain lies. Slater is a self-confessed liar, who has written a memoir about her own pathological lying. Apparently she cannot stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"a revelatory work","review":"Slater's writing is so intense and perceptive it makes people nervous. The psychological establishment has real reasons for trying to blacklist this book; it contains truths that establishment would rather us not know. For instance, Rosenhan's pseudopatient study was, and continues to be, an embarassment to a supposedly scientific field; Alexander's findings challenging the disease model of addiction also present a threat to the substance abuse industry. The only line of defense is to attempt to discredit Slater, and this is shameful. Her book is an important contribution to the field, and its engaging style allows it to be accessible to those outside the field as well. I recommend Opening Skinner's Box without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got to page two...","review":"I made it to page two of the text (page seven of the book) and got disgusted with her style.From this page alone: ka-boom.

I'm very sorry I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent prose, fascinating stories","review":"In response to the reviewer below, I thought Lauren Slater's prose was beautiful and her characters surely got under my skin. Her description of the Milgram experiment, her fantastic chapter on the work of addiction's researcher Bruce Alexander, the last chapter on psychosurgery -- all of it makes for a book you can't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Talent and Time","review":"Slater's engaging prose style is squandered here on a poorly researched, poorly argued look at some famous psychological experiments of the past.

The single biggest problem is that the accounts of famous experiments in psychology, like Rosenhan's and Milgram's, are so full of factual errors that I find it hard to treat ANYTHING else in the book seriously. There are experimental design features detailed in the book that were not part of those studies.

It sheds a horrible light on MI5 by MI6. It's really no secret that there were spies in the UK in the 40's 50's and the 60's, what ridiculous is how little effort was put into catching them. And of course after reading this book you should get \\"The Sword and the Shield\\" and see what the USSR used all this information for, you will be very surprised.There are allocations of a 5th uncaught spy but it would appear that if it were so, they weren't working for the USSR.

Wright was the first scientist to join MI5, the domesticspy-catchers, and led the way for others. The bulk of the book is taken up with the search for the Fifth Man ~ Wright's candidate is Roger Hollis, who was head of MI5 during the early Sixties ~ a well-hidden Soviet mole like Philby and his ilk. Reading it, at times, it appears that Wright considers himself responsible for every innovation in spy technology during the '50s and '60s, but if you can get over his view of himself, the book becomes a fascinating read, on a par with anything Le Carré wrote. As far as the Fifth Man goes, my mind is still open, but Wright gives excellent cause to suspect that Hollis probably was at least bent, if not broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh.","review":"Well, the book is certainly engrossing.

US Navy radios since 1935 were specially designed to avioid this well-known effect. There's absolutely no truth that he informed the CIA about this circa 1960 and they didnt previously know about this.Now some of his stories may be true, but when an average Joe Schmoe like me can poke holes in 35% of them, just out of little tidbits of radio knowledge, how likely are the other stories likely to be true?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy Catcher","review":"great insight into the communist infiltration of British and American intelligence.

The surface story's romance was so tepid and dull that I watched most of the film with the commentary, from which I glean that Parkhill was too much in love with his own script and directing duties to turn a nice concept into a tight thriller.

But as far as HOW to lose it, it's pretty much the same old story: eat less and exercise more, for the rest of your life, with a lot of cutesy-pie jargon thrown in to fool you that there's much that's new in what the author is saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING to MEN: THIS BOOK IS FOR WOMEN!","review":"I have no problem with a book directed to women on this subject and based on research on women. In fact, for women, the book appears to be excellent.HOWEVER, I have a BIG problem with the deceptive marketing of the book: There isn't the faintest clue on the front cover that half the human race is excluded. Every pronoun in the book is \\"she\\" or \\"her\\"; every reference to people is \\"women\\". And all the research on which the book is based is research on women.I don't know if the author had anything to do with this deception. But certainly the publisher, Viking Penguin, ought to be ashamed of itself. I will think twice or thrice before ever buying one of their books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in substance","review":"While the book does offer some helpful eating strategies, there is really nothing new to be learned here. Eating smaller portions & earlier in the day is not exactly rocket science. I expected more & was dissappointed. I have the audio version & the author's voice is grating to my ears, I wish I had gotten the book instead or better yet, waited to get the book from my local library. Aside from the recently confirmed findings that stress does contribute to overeating, there is nothing in this book that hasn't been stated better & in more depth in many other books or articles. Since the author is a doctor, I certainly expected more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much stress!","review":"Peeke puts entirely too much stress on stress. I may have gained the weight from stress, but I am far from the same person who put the weight on. Now my biggest stressor is trying to lose it. Beyond that, her advice is common-sense and the same old stuff we've all heard before. It has nothing to do with age, just avoid refined carbs, avoid the foods that make you binge, breathe through the stress of daily life, exercise, and oh, yeah, cut the calories. Not worth slogging through the whole book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting Fat","review":"This book gives a lot in insight to what older women should be doing, I know that trying to do the same things I did to watch my weight when I was younger just does not work now that I am over 40!!

There is no evidence that supports this author's claims about toxic fat. Also, why is it that many studies have shown that obese people do not differ in personality or stress management skills from non-obese? When people lose weight and keep it off, they do so with lots of exercise, very consistent low fat eating, and by keeping this aspect of their lives as a major priority - despite the stresses and strains of everyday life. Its a difficult and humbling challenge for everyone who undertakes it. This book does not make it easier ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deja View All Over Again","review":"I thought I had already read this book...when I realized it was merely a \\"clip\\" book of other books ( The Glycemic Index, The Menopause Diet, Lauren Hutton's book, The Strong Women Series etc).

From the chorus opening \\"Warning\\", to the perfect thumping rhythm set by Scott Rockenfield in \\"En Force\\", through the drive of \\"Child of Fire\\" to the incredible conclusion with Geoff Tate in \\"Roads of Madness\\", this, to me, was Queensryche's finest release. Operation Mindcrime, Empire, and Rage for Order are also incredible releases, but they're releases by a band that's slightly more aged. The Warning reflects four young, excited, creative musicians whose juices were really flowing throughout this album. If you're only going to buy one Queensryche release (which I'd wonder why you'd do that), it should be this classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing music","review":"Maybe it was that(progressive)label that kept this underrated album an underground hit. Queensryche laid the foundation for later masterpieces such as mindcrime with this weird and thoughful album. It may take a while to get used to it but it will grow on you. Check out some of Queensryches early efforts. They're original and strangely beautiful. Hopefully their music will be appreciated apart from the hair bands of the 80's someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal at Its Best","review":"This is one of Heavy Metals greatest albums, that contains one of the greatest songs ever recorded. \\"Take Hold of the Flame\\" is a truly inspirational song, that will get your heart pumping and have you raising your fist. All songs on this album are very well put together, no throw aways here (or on any Queensryche album). With songs like \\"Warning\\" and \\"Deliverance\\" I overlooked \\"Roads to Madness\\" until I heard it live. It was unbelievable. Geoff's voice carries you up and down, excites you and calms you over and over again in every song, but especially \\"Roads to Madness\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queensryche - Geoff Tate Hittin The High Notes","review":"Queensrryche's first full length release is still a favorite of mine after all these year. They would go on to do better albums, but this one showed that these guys were going to be a force to be reckoned with in the metal world. Geoff Tate's voice was at its peak on this one. Some of the high notes he hits are mind boggling. The album is full of twin guitar histrionics and outstanding drumming. Yea, it all sounds a bit dated today, but for early 80's power metal this is a very nice sampling. The band would have an AOR hit with \\"Take Hold Of The Flame\\" which is still a concert staple to this day. Other highlights include \\"Warning\\", \\"En Force\\", \\"NM 158\\" and the progressive metal finale \\"Roads To Madness\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"Sorry gang, I've lived with this album for 15 years, and I love Queesnryche and everything, but I just can't excited about this recording. The songs are not up to par with those on Rage, Operation, Promised Land, Q2k, and frankly, their sound has improved 1000 fold since their fledgling Iron Maiden-esque years. Other than \\"Take Hold of the Flame\\" and \\"NM 156\\" I cannot really see the point of owning \\"Warning\\", and thankfully those songs are available elsewhere.Only for the most die-hard fan of Geoff Tate's voice, in my opinion, or for people who couldn't get enough of that oh so distinctive 80's metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helloween / Queensryche","review":"Helloween made an indelible impact and a significant contribution to the world of music. They are respected globally and inspired a generation of metal. Their influence is great and their career is prolific, with over a dozen albums. Their talent is unrivaled, not just the obvious killer speed guitar riffs, but their vocalists, especially their first, possess a depth of range (Yes - ask someone knowledgable in metal - and they will tell you that the first vocalist could hit lower and higher notes than even the Queensryche vocalist).I'll employ more efficient diction:Anyone who says Queensryche is of better quality, better sales commercially (especially this point, helloween blows queensryche out of the water here), or longer lived than Helloween - provides ample evidence of their ignorance.Helloween are metal gods in Europe, respected and known everywhere.Where as Queensryche had one good album, operation mindcrime, and then disappeared into obscurity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Power metal,this is totally Weak and Sorry!!!","review":"I totally hate Queensryche!I listened to album's by them just to see why people compare them to Mid career Helloween,my favorite Power Metal band ever(Not to mention,band ever).And all I learned is that Geoff Tate doesn't equal a hair on Michael Kiskes a**!HE SUCKS!!!Beyond belief!His voice just annoy's me,when it's high,it's annoyingly high,and when it's low,it's to stinkin low.although it does match the glammy,rocky,poppy styled cr!p that they play.Only in the fact that it's usually Slow!sorry!and lame, musically,vocally,and Lerically.Although it's not as bad as Operation Mindcrime,the extremely glammy,and badly written album.In short,to compare this earlier band to mid career Helloween is an insult.To compare Geoff Tate to Michael Kiske,\\"is also,a Huge,\\" insult!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible vocal range","review":"Queensryche is a metal masterpiece from the 80\`s. It\`s one of my top ten albums out of my 250 CD collection and my favorite Queensryche album. My favorite songs are: \\"Road to madness, Warning, Child of fire and No sanctuary. Anyway the whole album is great. I highly recommend this album to any hard rock or metal fan of the 80\`s.It\`s just too bad that a person gave a 1 star review to this album. And on top of that, he came back 3 times to give a bad review, criticize and uses bad words. This guy is a real leech and his reviews should be banned from this Web page.

It has lots of good guitar riffs, great drum sound and the vocals and songwriting are just incredible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"If you are a metal fan this CD should definitely be in your collection! Geoff Tate goes all out in this CD. His vocal prowess qualifies him as the most skilled singer in this genre being able to sing up in the stratosphere so naturally without strain. This album tends to have more of a metal edge to it than their later albums. Great profound songwriting, guitar work and superb vocals make this CD a metal classic by all means.

My main purpose for writing this review is in response to those complaining about the included software for putting music on your player: If you have a Zen, you can't function properly without Red Chair Software's Notmad Explorer. It's a breeze to use, and I can't imagine using my Zen without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headphone Jack Defective","review":"I've used my Zen Xtra very little - mostly on long road trips plugged into my car stereo, or on long flights. It's received very, very light use. Even so, the headphone jack on it is totally broken, rendering the player completely useless. This is apparently a common problem with these players - the jack is flimsily attached to the main board of the player. It clearly takes only the lightest use to sever the headphone jack connections, and once it breaks you can't do a thing about it. Bye bye Zen Xtra. Do a web search and you will come up with numerous web sites talking about this issue. It's a well known issue. Creative refuses to fix it even though it is clearly a defect in the product. They want to charge close to one hundred dollars to fix it - half the price of what I originally paid for the unit. Yeah - it costs less than an IPod, but all I can say is you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY, MASSAVELY GINORMOUS","review":"This player is huge! I regret buying it every time i look at the darn thing. I have had it for about a year, and it constantly freezes up, and requires me to remove the battery to get it to turn off.

It's always on low.The iPods are nice, but overpriced. This unit gives you a lot of storage, but creative doesn't put too much thought into their products. Their software always sucks... For example you cant just use windows explorer to copy files, music over. You have to install a large software install which then gives you an explorer \\"like\\" interface. Why didn't these bozos just make this thing plug and play and act as a hard drive? It's not very convenient that way.They do however give you a leather case which apple charges too much for.I wouldn't recomend this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"you are warned!","review":"The OS failed after a very short time (less than a year of use).

I got this for christmas this year and luckly I got the warranty for it because it broke after one month and I didnt do anything to it like drop it or get it wet. I used my warranty and payed the extra money and got the 15GB Ipod and it is worth it for the money. I have even dropped the ipod once and it is still in good working condition.

The first was a 10GB player that I bought in June of 03. It lasted EXACTLY 6 months before freezing up on me. No amount of tech support would bring it back to life. I said, well, I guess i will just spend the extra cash and get an ipod.The low price of the Nomad 30GB seduced me. I picked one up instead of the pod, and I loved it, for about 6 months. Then the headphone jack stopped working.

That would MAYBE be worth 100 bucks.You might as well just spend a little more and invest in a nano or something similar. Ipods are pretty reliable and apple's customer service is excellent.

All three have broken and been fixed under warranty, and now they are out of warranty and are breaking again. Each time the problem is a hard drive failure -- for no reason the drive just stops working, and none of the \\"rescue mode\\" options will fix it. It costs $130 to replace the hard drive and receive only 90 days more warranty, so it's not worth a repair. I don't know whether other Creative Labs products are more reliable, but I think that having all three of mine break is pretty terrible. For $675 I was hoping for better. I wouldn't recommend that others take a chance by buying this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy this...","review":"...you'll probably need to make sure you carry a paper clip in your pocket.

I purchased the 40GB model for less than $250 from Best Buy. Was considering the iPod but couldnt justify the cost. I did have a sligh problem with the headphone jack - about 4 months after purchase. I didnt have my recipt and I had paid in cash. I sent my player into the tech support team with no recipt and they fixed it for free and sent it back to me at no charge in less than a week. Great customer support which would give me great confidence in buying from Creative anytime.I dont particulary like the software that is shiped with the player. I dont think it is as useful as it could be. It will not sort the songs in a particular play list by name.But overall its a very good player and a great company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty Issues","review":"The unit failed after 2 hours. Because it was a gift and I did not have a receipt, I called Creative to ask if it were under warranty. I didn't want to ship it back to have them simply charge me. They assured me it was under warranty. But, after shipping it back, Creative refused to repair it or even send it back without substantial payment. So, if you are going to give it as a gift or receive one, try to maintain the receipt. The warranty is only 90 days (which says something about the quality of the product)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the NOMAD (non) warranty","review":"Before you buy this awful product check out the warranty- it is for only 90 days. NOMAD's business plan is to sell an expensive piece of equipment that will most definitely fail after 90 and usually before 365 days so that the unwary buyer will then pay an exbortitant fee to replace something that should not have broken in the first place and should have been under warranty if it did.Our first NOMAD's drive crashed in one week - the second lasted about 7 months. Our experience here is far from unique. When customer service wanted to charge us $120.00 to repair, we took the high road and bought an IPOD. We also shipped the dead unit to the company's president, who is apparently content with his dupe the consumer program.Caveat Emptor"},{"rating":"1","title":"No accessories","review":"It works fine, I can't compare it to the ipod but I'm very disappointed in the lack of accessories available.I would like to find a car adapter so I can listen to it in the car longer than the short time the battery lasts.

There is no cradle available either.

I knew that dealing with Creative was not going to go well as they had already scammed me on the rebate. The technical service is horrible and unprofessional- Creative does not stand behind its products and treated me with contempt and disrespect. And that's if you can get them to answer the phone. I purchased an Ipod after that and even though there is the battery issue, Apple has a totally different attitude towards its customers and technical support.

The one upside is the price per gigabyte. It's close to the lowest in the industry. The sound is average and the software isn't much buggier than average for an MP3 player.On the downside the dinky 90 day warranty tells all about what Creative Labs thinks of the quality of this product. Mine died after just after the warranty gave out and I won't buy another. The second weakness is the directory structure. Everything goes in the root and is simply sorted by ID3 tags.Finally there is no support for any lossless file formats such as FLAC or APE formats. Lossless music makes all the difference in the world to those that prefer quality over quantity. With all the sleek 1GB flash players on the market, that's really the only reason I can see to have a player this bulky. I think I'm just going to wait and save for a Cowen X5 30 to compliment my iRiver 799t."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra hard disc that plays MP3's !!!!","review":"I bought my Zen X-tra a year ago (2003) and I have never had any problems with it until now when battery died. So I have to buy a new battery - big deal. I have 60GB hard disk in my pocket for storing my data, plus I can listen to the music! The software is very easy to use (Explorer-type drag-n-drop), strips CD's in no time, great sound! Earphones that come with it though are pretty pathetic, but it's a minor detail.I love my Zen, it is not as \\"cool\\" and \\"mainstream\\" as i-pod, and of course it was never on the cover of Newsweek magazine, but it's a great buy nontheless.

I've dropped it a couple of times, but it hasn't missed a note.Two minor points: the included earphones were useless, as I could not get them to stay in my ears. $9 at Wal-Mart bought me a great pair of Sony'sThe other is that I haven't seen the battery actually go for 14 hours without charging. 9 was more like it.Other than that, I have been very happy with my Zen Nomad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well, for however long it works","review":"I'm in college and I don't have enough money for an iPod, but it would have probably been worth the extra money if i had it. I treat my Jukebox like it cost me half a month's pay too. It worked great for a few months, and when the headphone jack broke, I assumed it was just my bad luck. I paid the $20 service charge because it was a few days out of the three month warranty, and went back to rocking when they returned a replacement. Now, just out of warranty again, it stopped working completely. I've sent it back a second time and when this is over, I will have paid at least $300 dollars total for the thing. It works well when it works, even if you hold it while jogging or working out, but you better be prepared to pay if you want to keep it working.

I never owned an MP3 player before, so I was a bit intimidated to say the least. The little bitty earphones they come with just don't work for me, so I use Sony headphones with an extra long cord. The \\"holder\\" for it isn't the best either, but at least it protects the screen from being scratched or damaged. The one major thing I didn't like about this was the non-existence of a paper manual. I'd much rather have a paper manual to look at while I'm working with something than to have to go back and forth on computer screens.

The harddrive crashed. I have read that other people have had the same problems. I'm afraid that I will have the same problem with mine. I have to perform a hard reset about once a week.

The major problem is how it organizes music. You can\`t just have files within files like windows explorer. You HAVE TO sort the music into genres or albums. For me, this is a major problem because, for example, I have about 2000 howard stern files. I wanted to just have something like a folder with howard stern, and then sub-folders with different bits.

I received a replacement unit from Creative and wouldn't you know it, the headphone jack once again failed. Thanks for the previous review from \\"seleniumdream\\". I will be doing my own maintenance on the headphone jack since it is now out of warranty. Bummer that I didn't stumble across these reviews on this unit earlier. Now I only wonder if the hard drive is going to fail like so many other reviewers have experienced. The only good thing that could come from buying this unit is that hopefully it malfunctions within the 90 day warranty. If you want a good MP3 player buy any other unit except this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nomad plays well but has battery issues","review":"The Nomad plays well and contains all the features that are advertised. However, after only 3 charges, I let the battery run down all the way and it wouldn't recharge. Called Creative and they asked me to pay for a new battery. I would not recommend this product because electronics are only as good as their power source. In this case the power sources does not function well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design Flaw in Headphone Adapter - Steer Clear","review":"In comparing the price of this player to others, be sure to factor in having to pay an additional $175 every 60-90 days of use. That's how much it costs to have the headphone jack fixed by Creative. Unless you're good with a soldering iron and don't mind fixing it yourself, this is a product to be avoided. Sad too because it worked great for the first 60 days. Shame on Creative for not fixing this defect free of charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nomad Zen Xtra","review":"I have owned a Zen Xtra since they were first put on the market and have encountered few problems. I still have the original battery and the unit only needs to be reset occasionally. Its 30 gb storage is as much as anyone needs in a mp3.

I tried my very best to take care of this expensive piece of equipment and the headphone jack STILL went out on me. You're lucky if you purchase this and don't have a problem with it. Sure, in my opinion its the best MP3 player out there- that is, when it works. Luckily, I bought a 2 year protection plan on it and I'll get my money back. There's just no reason to take yhour chances on whether you'll buy one that has a faulty headphone jack- you're better off going with the more expensive Ipod, or maybe even the new Sony Network Walkman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries Need UpGrade","review":"This unit is great for meeting storage needs,30GB. This player has huge, unacceptable flaws. The bad news starts with the lithium battery. The battery(fully charged) does not hold charge longer than 70 minutes at a Volume setting of 19 or higher. What's worse, is that you cannot hear audible sounds under a volume setting of 16 through headphones. Even at full volume of 25, it is difficult to hear sound in outside environments. One more thing_If you shutdown the player after a full charge, and leave unit alone for anytime longer than 48 hours:the unit will need to be manually reset.In closing, this MP3 player is definitely not worth the hassle.

I must admit the sound quality was very good. After charging it up initially, there were many preloaded tunes that were inaudible even at max volume. Same thing with tunes I loaded. Tech support was OK, they suggested bringing it back to the store to get a new once since the firmware upgrade didn't help or reformatting the hard drive either. 2nd unit worked ok for about 2 weeks. Went to use it after 4-5 days of no use, and I could power it on and that was it. No response from the wheel, power button etc...nada. Had to remove the battery to shut it off.

American Pie is, in fact, my favorite song of all time. It is fantastic, a timeless masterpiece. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for his album bearing the same name. First off, the album version of American Pie is not the 8-minute version. Instead, it is 2 minutes. This is an outrage, without the full length, the song loses all of its magic. Also, just about every other song is awful. I read reviews of the album and many have said that Vincent is just as good as American Pie. I strongly dissagree. Vincent is possibly my least favorite song of Don's. The lyrics make a great poem, but a [bad] song.

His words are beautifully written - poetic / beautifully rhymed / full of imagery / full of conscience. Now I feel the song might beat Tangled Up in Blue (which I rated the best one in the 20th century before I checked the lyric sheet)(Bob Dylan)when it comes to imagery, clarity, and conscience.

(By the way I heard McLean perform American Pie with the Boston Pops last summer for the Fourth of July and it was awful!! Alas, time changes everything) Several of the other songs, though justly not nearly as famous, are very good as well, my favorite being Till Tomorrow. That said, it is time for a reissue to improve the rather mediocre sound on this CD, and wouldn't it be nice to have some bonus tracks like McLean's lovely single Castles in the Air without having to buy another CD just to hear it, and maybe even a live version of American Pie (surely there must be one out there). With those improvements this would be a five star CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but deep","review":"Holmes packs a lot into a short space. Undergraduate students have found it a bit heavy going, but for those willing to work through the text, it is profoundly insightful.

The book is 17 years old but has a timelessness about it - unlike, say, John Stott's \\"Issues Facing Christians\\".

The Translations used in this book are choppy, inadequate and in many times looses the feel and intensity I've come to love and enjoy from my favorite novelist. I have read almost everything written by Tolstoy from War and Peace to Aloysha the Pot and come to know his style quite well and none of these translations captured what I've come to love.

From what I understand War and Peace and Anna Kerrenina are really his masterpieces, but The Death of Ivan Ilych is also well-known. There may also have been something missing in translation as well as across time and culture.I also read The Devil and The Kreutzer Sonata. Curiously, all three stories all inevitably lead to a death. Cossacks was written 1852-62, while the others were written much later in the mid 1880's. I felt that the later stories had a much more refined writing technique, so I never finished Cossacks.So those of you who want to get a taste of Tolstoy, these short stories may suffice, though I have a feeling that the only way to \\"taste\\" Tolstoy is to take that really big bite and read his major masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last a practical guide","review":"Hilary Dunsterville Branch's guide to Venezuela is the best guide out there in the market.

And all this I discovered during only 2 weeks traveling... Things change fast in Venezuela. The book can be used for general info and to get some clues what you want to visit (therefore I gave the book 2 stars, but only for that) but it's much better to query Internet for this purpose. The book also lacks some very important practical info as for example where to change money on the black market - the only way to get Bolivars (official rate is far too low).The point is the book does contain some information on the country but as travel guide it is almost useless.

Of course, what would you expect from the author of one of my favorite movies, CRIMSON TIDE. If you find yourself w/ some spare time on your hands, pick up this book and give it a try. I guarantee you that it will take you to several places that you've never been before, that being one of my definitions of a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Queen-sized disappointment.","review":"The premise sounded exciting enough, but ultimately the novel proved to be a huge disappointment. The ship doesn't even set sail until Chapter 9, and by then the book is half over! The chapters leading up to that are filled with long, dull set-up and a subplot that goes nowhere. And while the action in the remaining chapters is adequate, the ending feels very rushed. In addition, there are many boring technical descriptions that sound like the author trying to prove he did his homework, and some of the dialogue comes off as nothing more than the author giving the reader some background through the characters, rather than in the narrative. \\"Air Force One\\" is certainly is not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring case","review":"Nice to be organized after all these years and pleased with the construction of this item. Very happy to be organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"All my needs met","review":"I love how all my ring sizes fit, and I love BIG fashion rings. The only \\"problem\\" is that I only have one slot left so I will have to get another one soon. Amazing how my rings look so fancy inside this box. I am also buying one for my friend that sells rings so she can show them around. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Dance Is A Dream Come True","review":"I started out my Dream Dance collection with volume 12, and ever since then I've been buying every other volume. Dream Dance 16 is superb, just like the rest of the series, compared to other trance compilations. If you're just getting into this genre of music, Dream Dance is definately a perfect place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream Dance slowly deteriorating...","review":"Dream Dance 14 and 15 was without a doubt much better than the current volume 16. Volume 16 presents the listener with enormous amounts of electronic music, which is too much to handle. Previewing both house, techno, drum \`n' bass, trance, and hard trance, the album is overloaded with short, un-mixed samples of music. Most of the songs are weak, and cannot even be listened to more than once or twice. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Horrible!","review":"I don't know why there were 3 reviewers said that the Dream Dance 16 was the best they never heard and so I ordered this album and it turned out to be the WORST CD that I ever purchased. There wasn't a single song in this CD that I like. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ALBUM!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like what I expected!","review":"I was expecting something new in the afterlife field and was dissapointed!!! The author rambles on and on, takes you back and forth in time settings sometimes you don't know what's going on. I found myself skipping chapters to see if anything further on interested me enough....but no luck!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doomed romance","review":"Something was off-putting in the tone of this book. Perhaps it comes from lines like \\"I love when working-class people say smart things.\\" Besides that, Allen struggles to understand a tragic romance, but she seems selective about what she reveals of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it, but....","review":"I read this book because it was highly recommended by Jo Ann Beard who wrote an outstanding memoir that I loved. The beginning of \\"The Rooms of Heaven\\" was interesting and even borderline suspenseful, but went downhill from there. The last half of the book was a rambling and pathetic bore. Plus, I found it implausible that, after only six months time, the loss of the relationship (which was overshadowed by drug and alcohol use) could be so devastating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All I Thought It Would Be - Disappointing","review":"As a survivor of three suicides, I was eager to read a book with some substance. The beginning of the book was written very well. Mary is an excellent writer, however, she really missed out on the expression of her gut retching pain emotions that result after a suicide. She sort of skipped over those feelings and lived in this denial world. I have grown extremely in my spiritual realm as the result of the suicides that have touched my life. And I can tell you, the aching, can't get out of bed emotions were definitely not expressed in this book. Perhaps they are still too painful for Mary to write about, thus the jumping from one time period to the next. The gift of spiritual knowlege gained from a suicide was not presented in this book. I was quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad and very open story","review":"Mary Allen has written a very candid account of her love affair with an alcoholic cocaine addict that is, at times, so unguarded as to be embarassing. Why doesn't this intelligent, articulate woman take charge of her life and relationship? Love, and all of the inexplicable things it leads us to do, is the answer. I was engrossed by the first part of the book wherein Mary recounted the love affair and eventual suicide of Jim. The second half of the book, in which she recounts her search for answers rang true to me, as the surviver of a loved one's suicide, but was ultimately (and inevitably) unsatisfying. There are no answers out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like the Beach Boys arranged this collection!","review":"I was there and I can tell you: THIS is a GREAT Beach Boys CD! The mid-sixties belonged to the unusual magic of the Twist, Elvis Presley and Surf Music! Jan and Dean, The Ventures, and the greatest of them all, The Beach Boys. There were good folk music songs back then which also had great harmonies but none better than the Beach Boys! This excellent compilation has just about all of the great sounds of those wonderful years. Thanks, studio guys, for the excellent recording transfer to CD. These songs are correct for a sample of the Beach Boys' dynasty years. I Get Around! Surfin U.S.A! In My Room! Fun Fun Fun! Surfer Girl! Don't Worry Baby! California Girls! Good Vibrations! All originals, all high fidelity! (I would have liked to ride my Honda tonight) If it's been a while, buy this priceless CD and catch a wave!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beach Boys - Endless Summer","review":"Besides \\"Made In U.S.A.\\" this is the second best of the Beach Boys greatest hits albums which there are plenty of. I just think \\"Made In U.S.A.\\" was better because it featured songs from Pet Sounds. This album has a good format though. Having \\"Shut Down\\", \\"Fun Fun Fun\\" and \\"I Get Around\\" back to back to back is a great trio. Ending the album with \\"Good Vibrations\\" was cool but I think ending it with \\"All Summer Long\\" cause the album is \\"Endless Summer\\" and \\"All Summer Long\\" is the end of the summer. The album is over all very good. \\"Warmth of the sun\\" is a great song. The album is really worth it. Any true Beach Boys fan deserves this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless Summer!","review":"In my opinion this is the Best compilation from The Beach Boys. This stands up with the Stones Hot Rocks and the Beatles' red and Blue LPs. Endless Summer reminds me of the 70's when we were wearing cut-offs, riding Scwhinn apple crates, flip flops and partying. This is a Classic and I wish they would remastered this in Stereo because it Kick A%s! One of the Best compilations of All-Time. cheers Ty"},{"rating":"2","title":"No matter how old I get this one is a favorite","review":"The CD release adds \\"Good Vibrations\\" to the LP list.

The album was in good shape but did look vintage and that is OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sidetracked","review":"I've owned several of the Beach Boys compilations and few have been disappointing. This one is. I can't believe that a major record company would put out a product like this and not realize the mistakes involved. \\"Help Me, Rhonda\\" has an entire track missing, and it's blatantly obvious to anyone who has ears. \\"Be True to Your School\\" is an inferior cut. Why this one is included I fail to understand. It too is missing an entire track. There are other excellent compilations of Beach Boys material out there worth your hard earned money. Let this one slide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How dilightful this CD is !","review":"From the first time I heard this CD, I couldn't forget the chorus line of \\"Sirfin' U.S.A\\". Whenever I listen to this CD, I can feel a lot of fun and satisfaction very easily. I recommend every family have this. My favorite song is \\"Be true to your school\\". This song is covered by another surf music band, \\"Trashmen\\". This version is very good,too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beach Boy Greatest Hit Collection !","review":"As we all this collection was released in the summer of 1974 going all the way to No 1 at a time when there was the watergate scandal as well as other economic and political scandals. This album brought us back of the times when it was Fun Fun Fun, Surfin Usa, and Good Vibrations. This Cd is a good springboard to anyone hwo wants to familiarize themselves with the great tunes of the BeachBoys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me wish I could surf.","review":"There are hundreds of Beach Boys greatest hits albums (where do they come from?), but this one basicaly is their greatest hits without all the pet sounds (so pick up Pet Sounds too). The Beach Boys are one of my big favorites. Can't stop digging this. Just listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Keyboard","review":"I have fallen in love with this keyboard over the past six months.

I highly recommend this keyboard and at the current price you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIke slipping into your favorite pair of broken-in shoes","review":".This is Key Tronic model KT800P2.The only reason I rated this a 4 instead of a 5, is because I just received it and therefore don't know how long the nice action and letter paint will last. It looks and feels sturdy though. It reminds me of the old PS/2 keyboards that used to come with IBM PCs back in the old days. The Backslash key is in the upper extreme right, the Enter key is the large L-shape kind, the Shift keys are double width, the lower-row Alt keys flank the space bar; everything is where I'm used to it being.

From the beginning, middle, and end, each element of the novel is explained in very careful detail. Here you can learn about the story question that starts the story and climax the process that resolves the story question and is the beginning of the end. Also the author explains how to move the story along using Motivation-Reaction units (read the book to find out what M-R units are).The author has been dead for many years, but the book is still in print and it is still being recommended. I found out about this book at advancedfictionwriting.com. In my opinion that shows that Dwight Swain's book has stood the test of time and is a necessary addition to any fiction writer's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Title for a Writer Still Getting His Feet Wet","review":"I'm a sucker for writing advice / how-to's, and this book not only does that, but greatly exceeds my expectations. Swain writes very clear copy aimed at all levels of writers and I believe that anyone will find at least a few new or interesting things in each chapter.The whole concept of Motivation-Reaction Units is unique and while it seemed kind of odd at first, now makes a whole lot of sense. And Swain makes sure the reader knows this methodology is merely a tool, not the end all be all of writing good copy.I think this is a book I will keep close to my writing desk and reference on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear concise guide to writing","review":"This book is a must not only for beginners but also for those who are not.Its good for beginners because its comprehensive and clear, and covers the A to Z of creative writing from what to write, the processes of writing (how) and whom to write to.It's a must for those who know how to write because it explains clearly why a writer must sometimes do certain things that he doesn't want to and why he must avoid things he wants to. The book also conceptualises and explains things that many good writers do instinctively. It's important to know why, isn't it?To write books on writing its not enough just to be a writer, its important to be a good teacher. And Dwight V. Swain in an excellent teacher.Overall, this book is value for money because there is a lot in it, and all subjects are covered in detail. I am not saying that this is the only book on writing that you need ever buy but if you want a comprehensive look at the subject of how to write fiction then this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Do-It-Yourself Guide for Fiction Writing","review":"Techniques of the Selling Writer is one of the best guides to fiction writing that I have come across. Unlike a lot of other fancily written and verbose ficiton-reference books out there today, in which authors boast about their own techniques, or give overly complicated advice, this is simple, easy to read and learn from, and very informative.It is an excellent guidebook for any budding author, and I have found it extremely helpful in my own writing. I have re-written my own novel since reading this book by Dwight V Swain, and I am most pleased with the results. Its advice has brought new life to my writing, and I recommend it to anyone who is about to write a novel.Chris"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like getting a PhD","review":"Buy it, study it, apply it and Swain's classic will give you your PhD in fiction craft.

It is not the type of book I, the love and laughter type,normally choose to read. Written in first person it is the story of Lora, a young woman whose dreams have been shattered by tragedy. It is the story of her coming to terms with her grief, facing it, and reestablishing a relationship with her husband Eli who loves her more than his own life. Although not a typical love story, this book left an emotional impact on me like very few do and I ended up finishing it in one tear blurred sitting.

And, Ms. Chance, where's the romance? the love scenes? I'm not sure how the heroine ends up with her answers, by the end of the book.

Johnny plays through nineteen of his songs, with an appearance from his wife June Carter Cash and their son John Carter Cash. The band performs most of Cash's biggest hits and a few surprises. Being from his later time period, the show balances Johnny's ol' time rockabilly days with the 'folkier' songs from his American (Rick Ruben) period. At this point in his career, Cash's voice aged and matured like a fine wine. While a European jazz festival may seem like an odd gig for Johnny Cash, he nonetheless makes it work in style. Voices are difficult to hear during introductions and stage banter, but the musical sound quality is perfect. The video footage is straight forward without bells or whistles -just Johnny Cash and forty years of his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new level of critical thinking","review":"Evans clarifies many inconsistancies in our world view thinking to free us up to be more deliberate.

HIs voice is much better on their later albums. But the album is saved by the Guitar playing of CC Deville. The lyrics on this album are horrible (No wonder, Bret Michaels wrote them), but the drumming and the guitar playing are really good, the latter especially. If you listen closely on a lot of the songs, you can hear some amazing guitarwork in the background. Here are the songs in ascending order as far as how good they are:#10: Blame It On You#9: Let Me Go To The Show#8: #1 Bad Boy#7: Want Some, Need Some#6: Play Dirty#5: I Won't Forget You#4: I Want Action#3: Cry Tough#2: Talk Dirty To Me#1: Look What The Cat Dragged In"},{"rating":"2","title":"I want Rikki","review":"This is Shawn Quick and Matt Seager here lovin' Poison.

The only reason i even gave this album a 1 star rating is because i respect the musicianship of CC Deville. Other than that this album is a stinker!! CC wasted his talent creating disposable pop piffle like this. Hair Metal was truly horrible. It was for simple-minded folk and trendy minions. Thank the heavens for Seattle."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Look What the Cat Dragged in by Poison\\" 3.5 out of 5 stars, classic '80s cheese","review":"Do they look ridiculous? Yes. Is this groundbreaking stuff, are they great musicians? No. I don't care, I like it anyway. The best Poison album in my opinion. Parts of most of the songs kind of sound alike(I think its CC's playing)but I still don't care. This is a fun album to throw in for a '80s flashback. I like it better start to finish than their later albums that followed, the later albums each had some hits but I like the rawness of this one. They do look ridiculous but you know what? It worked. Everyone knows who these guys were. There were hundreds of other bands that were probably better but didn't make it, these guys did."},{"rating":"2","title":"debut album from this kings of glam rock","review":"I love this album. This album has some great cuts like \\"Talk Dirty To Me\\" \\"Cry Tough\\" \\"#1 Bad Boy\\" \\"Want Some, Need Some\\" and \\"I want Action\\" this is probably one of the best glam rock albums of all time. The music is raw, and fun. The image, as silly as it may look today, was great, it was a sign of the times. The lyrics are not going to help you find a cure for cancer, or solve world hunger. But the lyrics are fun, and that is what Poison was about. If you like 80 glam, and you DON'T have this album you need to get it NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Re-release","review":"Great sound quality, and whoever did this one finally got the remixed version correctly on here for \\"I Won't Forget You,\\" which is listed on the recently-released greatest hits but is only the original version. This is not an earlier as one reviewer wrote, but a later remixed version for the video and single when it was released as a single. My only suggestion would have been for them to have included the original version of \\"Cry Tough\\" which if you look at the liner notes, was remixed before the album came out, thus the version many of you have heard is not the original. Coincidentally, the guy who remixed \\"Cry Tough\\" on the album is the same guy who later remixed \\"I Won't Forget You\\" for the video/single, which the reissue doesn't credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIVE ME A BREAK!!!","review":"Ok, so it was popular in the '80's, but let's get real, there is ZERO musical quality. These guys were aimed towards the teenage girls and wimpy guys. If you're into that kind of stuff, then get it. But forget about hearing any interesting music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic party album","review":"While I liked their second album better, Poison's first album from 1986 was a very fun and exciting party album of rock and roll! They have the guitars loaded to excess on all the songs. Talk Dirty to Me is still a catchy, charged up song as well as I Want Action, Let's Go to the Show, the title song and others. But Poison slows it down a bit on the nice and melodic midtempo power ballad I Won't Forget You. Bret Michaels is an energetic showman and lead singer on a lot of the cuts but the true standout is the always humorous C.C. Deville, as his guitar leads and solos give a strong intensity to them. Poison does go a little overboard with the makeup and glam look on the album cover and photos, but their image paired well with the songs and live performances. One of the best arena rock albums of the latter half of the '80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hair metal at its best","review":"The year is 1986 and the music is loud!!

The instructions sounded simple, and the product sounded ideal. However, I discovered that they are not very easy to adhere to the wall. You really have to wet them, and then hold each figure for several minutes (or mine started peeling off right away). I can't comment on the ease of removal, but considering they were so hard to get to stick, I think that they will be easy to come off. Just be warned that you need time and patience to get these on the wall!

On sale for $28.00 you don't really expect much but when you see the original price was over $60.00 you would expect to be able to turn it at least a little past half volume and have the switches work more then once.

All but two of the wine glasses had broken until last night when washing one of the two remaining glasses it shattered IN MY HAND causing numerous deep cuts requiring a trip to the ER to have the cuts SUTURED! Mikasa offers no warranty on these sub-par glasses. I loved the old glasses that were thicker. These glasses are horrible, and went into the trash as soon as I came home from the hospital. We used to joke that one couldn't sneeze in close proximity to these glasses...apparently that is true. They are attractive glasses, but for the price they are absolutely not worth it.

Perhaps the album would sound better live, but right now, the ambiance is lost. The songs fail to create any sense of energy, and are often prolonged, and repetitive, harmonic creations; they lack much in the way of melody.His backing band is a great part of the problem. To begin with, he only has a drummer and a bass player. This works well for Joe Satriani, but Johnson can't pull the double weight of lead and rhythm. Thus, he alternates, and the songs come off too long, and too dull.The album is not a total loss, however. Songs like 'Rain' and 'Enzo Shuffle' have enough creativity and vitality to make a positive impact, and the studio track, 'World of Trouble,' is well produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"Aside from the fact that all the songs run into each other, something I loathe in CDs, the compilation is nothing to write home about.

A great murder mystery story."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is no bare all at the end","review":"I think the author is good at writing stories in both short story and the novel format. He was brilliant in Ichinenhan mattete (Wait for one and half years) and same can be seen in points and lines.This book unlike other mystery books does not cheat you by keeping all the secrets to itself till the end. It is more like a gradual revealation. The feeling was of discovery with the author than by the author.The book deals and magnifies minor nuances of Japanese life like hostess bars, tightly controlled train schedules, intricate politeness in formal situations. All these are brought together in this magnificient tale. It also makes this very locational as it can happen only in Japan. I sincerly thank the translator for bringing this masterpiece to life in English.I was reading this book and missed my train stop, and things like this normally do not happen to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job","review":"This is great for my wide band rings! Outside is like a smooth grain black leather - not sure what material is but it looks like leather-ish material. Inside lining is felt and the foam padded slots allow you to put really wide band rings. I just bought my second one this company (Caddy Bay Collection) and am happy. Only complaint is that I wish they gave the option to have delivered to a PO Box as it is very difficult to get my packages via ups. The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the quality is just fine but not expensive quality and I feel like it is just a bit over-priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great product.","review":"I searched all over for this type of product. I wanted to be able to store all my rings in one place and this works great. It is attractive and has a good closure. You could store it almost anywhere. It is sleek and stylish. A very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I need!","review":"It's very elegantly lined with black velvety material and fits all my rings perfectly. The box itself is very well built. For me this is the perfect size to put my handful of rings in and it easily fits in my drawers. Love it and am looking forward to filling it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ring box","review":"I was very happy with this purchase. The ring box holds all my rings including a big bulky plastic fashion ring. Very good value for the price. Also Amazon.com is a favorite web site, great service and I have never been disappointed with any purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice ring holder","review":"it is nice but I have a couple of bulky rings and they often come out the ring space. other than that it good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Prose, Brilliant Work","review":"This work speaks for itshelf. Richard Rodriguez no question re-invented English prose in the twentieth century. The book must be read at least twice to understand its deep artistic accomplishment that may not be immediately visible to those who have not been socialized to modern literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this book is not worth the price","review":"This book has got to be one of the most random books I have ever read. Maybe you would enjoy this book if you are going into a new world but otherwise do yourself the favor and don't pay for this book! The thoughts are some of the most random books ever. DON'T BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel justified in my actions","review":"This book was the worst piece of garbage I have ever had the misfortune to read. I cut it in half and threw it away after reading it to make sure nobody else in my house stumbled across it and started to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"There is absolutely nothing impressive or interesting in this book. Rodriguez relates to us the story of a boy who rejected the traditionally held values of his family, yet failed to assimilate into the dominant society. It should therefore be very uninteresting that he was a successful student because people who do not assimilate well, are likely to excel in school because they have less distractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I never read a book I despised, until now. This book is boring, redundant, and pointless. Rodriguez tries to make the reader feel sorry for him. At the same time he is acting as if he is the most spectacular thing living. I hope he somehow finds this review, because I wasted I good deal of time struggling thorugh his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"Another \\"required reading\\" book at most inner city schools. This book is not very well written and does not portray your typical hispanic family. It's another \\"poor me/pity me\\" type book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad, and bad","review":"although this book has some potential, it is such a slow boring read, that the actual message is over looked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tio Tomas","review":"Richard shed himself to become a white man. He defines himself by the success standards set by white people. Although I don't disagree with him on everything, he clearly has been white washed and it's really sad. HE rants about himself like his 'ethnic' look is so mesmerizing to people. He's got a big head that I really can't empathize with. He made a choice many people of color make, assimilation in most extreme way. If you need a reason to feel pride in your cultural, read this book and see how you cold turn out if you have no pride in your culture"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like the book really","review":"As a Bilingual teacher, I believe immigrant children should learn the basics of schooling in their home language; that way, they will be able to communicate with their parents, and they will earn self confidence. This book shows the lack of communication and self-esteem immigrant children are suffering from, in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, whine, whine","review":"I read this book as a part of a college class on marginalized/minority writers. Out of a class of eight, I and another girl both thought this fellow was an unmitigated whiner and the book was terrible. The rest of the class thought it was compelling and thought provoking (or else they just wanted a good grade that week.) It seems to me that it is almost forbidden to express dislike of a minority writer in a classroom environment these days for fear of being branded a racist. I did not like this book. I was in the minority--read it and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"SELLOUT","review":"I wont purchase a book by Rodriguez because he is a sellout to himself and his people. The man has consistently come out against affairmative action when he himself is a product of it, and owes his success to it. We all make choices in life and Rodriguez chose to distance himself from his Mexican roots and wants us to validate his choices. Rodriguez is a sucess in the Anglo world but nothing is worth the cost of selling your soul to achieve success at such a high cost. The man is not Mexican he is best described as a pitiful soul that wrote a book trying to find redemption, but you cant have it both ways. Be what you are, take pride in your difference and you can still succeed in this country. I feel contempt not pity for the man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most boring book ever","review":"This book was extremely useless. Richard Rodriguez goes on and on and on about the same things through the whole book. I have no idea why my english teacher made us read this book. This is not an autobiography at all. There is a lot of his life missing from this book. You shouldn't buy this book unless you have to read it for some class."},{"rating":"1","title":"make it stop...","review":"This book could possibly be interesting for minority students, but for anyone else, it is boring beyond belief. His writing style makes me want to find his thesorus and burn it. While he has mastered the art of attempting to make the whole world pity his life, he has completely lost the art of writing a book to be read for enjoyment.I want this book burned. It is a symptom of our overly PC society that an upper middle-class white girl is supposed to read this books and be \\"uplifted\\" by it. I find it drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodriguez explains it all!","review":"Rodriguez introduced opinions to me that at first seemed off the wall. He his essays offer ideas on topics you would never expect him to have in consideration of his racial and cultural background. As he explains his strong controversial views, he exposes the reader to a new way of thinking. He defines ways in how corruption that stems from lack of communication and understanding can destroy any aspects of a good intention. People are all different and life is hard for everyone, sometimes the obstacle is simply acceptance of your situation. Rodriguez's mainly writes to an audience that does not relate to his life experiences, he writes to the world as an identified human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor ME.","review":"If Richard Rodriguez was able to publish this self-pitying, self-congratulatory, self-absorbed drivel because he is a minority, then that aspect of affirmative action is the only thing he and I agree on. Is he unaware of the thousands of Americans who have managed to learn English while maintaining close ties to their native cultures, including preserving their native languages? Is he unaware of how minorities have contributed to our country by being different?Does he think that his experiences with the Catholic church are unique? Does he think his heavy-handed punctuation makes us feel the drama he imagines in his life?I have never read a worse book on the immigrant experience. It may be that I have never read a worse book. Shame on him for his narrow-mindedness. Shame on anyone who gave him money to pass off his own psychosis as a common experience just because he is a minority."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had similar experiences","review":"I'm also Mexican-American and went through similar experiences as the author of this book. I was also the only Mexican student in my classroom at the elementary school that I attended all 8 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"not particularly interesting to me","review":"I believe that this book was not meant for all audiences. I for one did not care for the book. It did not apply to me as a book like this should. In my opinion, I could not get past the fact that he was whining throughout the book. He makes it sound as though he is the only one in this world that had any problems growing up. Although some of us cannot relate to his personal experiences we do have our own problems. I am not totally disregarding his book, it may apply to a lot of people, I just believe that the book does not hit any nerves in me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used for class","review":"I bought this book for a class, I was concerned it might not be the correct one, but it was and I'm glad I found it cheaper here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunger of Memory","review":"Richard Rodriguez's \\"Hunger of Memory\\" is a fantastic read for someone wondering about the topic of mexican integration into American society, and the \\"scholorship boy.\\" Scholars and seasoned readers will find this book very insightful and quite educational. I would not recomend that some with faith other than Catholic/Christianity read this book because it is about Rodriguez's growth in his faith and upholds his religion over other religions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Book","review":"Read this a few years ago for a Cultures class I took at our local college - it's thought provoking and descriptive - item was as described and shipped timely. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"few redeeming qualities","review":"How strange - I read this book some years back and yet, coming across it again today all my old angry, negative impressions came rushing back. I too am Mexican, about the same age as the author, raised in California in a Spanish-speaking household by loving immigrant parents, Catholic grammar, high school and college-educated. Rodriguez and I shared many of the same experiences, positive and negative. In fact, up to a certain point his story could have been the story of my own life. But this book left me cold, worse than cold; it made me angry enough to literally throw it across the room, several times. I had to force myself to finish it. It's infuriating, and worse, tragic that this devious, cold-hearted, whiny, self-serving and self-centered author has become so influential. No tiene corazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rodriguez presents to the reader the power of society","review":"Richard Rodriguez relates his own battle between assimilation and maintaing family tradition. He brings the reader to realize the power that society has, with it's ability to tear apart families and people. This struggle is presented with honesty in a well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Meaning of Education","review":"Looking beyond the criticisms of other reviewers, one can find in this little book many fundamental truths about education -- what it means to be an educated person, even how education might alienate people or divide families. Intensely intellectual and at the same time profoundly personal, Richard Rodriguez's Hunger of Memory eloquently charts the process of education in his own life, uncovering its magic, measuring its costs along the way, but in the end testifying to its great benefits. Students and teachers alike could gain greater understanding of the process of education and what it can mean through reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Movie!","review":"Chuch Norris as I have never seen him. As the Sheriff of a small town he does battle with an indestructible man. This man started the movie as a mental patient who commits murder at an apartment complex. Theman is gunned down by the police. At the hospital he is made indestructible by doctors(mad scientists).He then proceeds to kill everyone who poses a threat to him. Before he and Chuck meet up Chuck whips a motorcycle gang. At the end of the movie he and Sheriff Chuck wage war all over the countryside. Nothing Chuck does to him will kill him. Sheriff Chuck finally throws him in a well. It ends with the mad killer springing out of the water. My only dissapointment was that there wasn't a sequel. A very exciting movie. A bit different for Chuck Norris though."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Just Needed A Hug...","review":"Poor John Kirby (Brian Libby), if only he'd taken his pills, all would have been well. Alas, he dropped them on the floor, leading to a husband and wife massacre by axe. John is then captured by police, escapes, and is gunned down by sheriff Stevens (Chuck Norris). John is revived and kept alive by looney doctors who try their new experimental serum on him. This turns Mr. Kirby into an indestructible juggernaut of death! Meanwhile, the sheriff is busy battling bikers and rekindling a romance w/ his ex-girlfriend. Soon John kills enough people to get the sheriff's attention. I like SILENT RAGE, and that's saying a lot since I'm no Chuck Norris fan. The scene where Kirby stalks and kills his old psychiatrist (Ron Silver) and his wife is fairly creepy. I also enjoyed the whole hospital-holocaust! I even got a kick (pun? what pun??) out of the karate-man vs. zombie-madman finalé! Very entertaining indeed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"INTERESTING IDEA, BUT CHEAP PRODUCTION SINKS THIS CHUCK VS MYERS FLICK!","review":"I saw this film many years ago and I thought it was a cool idea for a movie. Unfortunately, the film is hampered by low budget, bad acting, inane dialogue.....the list goes on and on. I'm not a big Chuck Norris fan, but this film which obviously borrowed some ideas from the film 'Halloween' has some small moments. It's pretty silly, but the killer is menacing and there are a few jolts here and there. I wouldn't buy it, but if you see it on cable..............you might get a few laughs. I rate it 1 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical Chuck Norris movie!","review":"A nice cross between a western, suspense and horror - definately check it out!

I enjoyed this one, but it isn't one of his better efforts. Norris is typically stoic to the point of being wooden, but the butt kicking scenes help redeem what might otherwise be a Grade Z movie. The scene involving bikers in a bar is particularly entertaining.It's a martial arts, scifi, horror movie spiced by some T & A. If that's your cup of tea, grab your popcorn, remote and have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Delight!","review":"Three great artists in their prime, in ravishing live performances. What a treat!

So I bought this book.In the beginning, Kay offers encouragement and advice for families dealing with deployments and the regular career surprises that we should all expect. But the latter half of the book is like an on-going commercial for her other books about how to cut coupons and comb garage sales with seven kids. She also includes way too many personal stories for her \\"hero profiles.\\" It's almost as if she got out her good ideas in the first 40 pages, and scrambled for random material for the rest.The whole book seemed thrown together. There were even one or two typos and grammatical errors that were quite distracting.

Plus whats with all the joints featuring Max B on the hook? Max B is on EVERY OTHER SONG! Dude sounds like he swallowed a rooster. If the first two albums from Jim Jones were bad then this one being bad should be of no surprise. One last note: what is Jigga thinking paying this much attention to Jim Jones? Is he trying to give Jim Jones' career an unwarranted boost? Nobodies in the rap game starting beef with giants is a gimmick that 50 cent used until he was rich!

The single itself is not poppin' so having farther hopes for anything better would be a complete waste and that's exactly what this album is.

I thought these were reviews from recent test takers. I just completed chapter 5 and so far have found this book to be very confusing with lot of errors. This book appear to be written by people who lack the technical depth in Remote Access. Anytime the book tries to explain technical details such as call setup procedure, it gets very confusing. I have had to refer to CCO publications to understand majority of technical explanations so far. I recommend a differnt book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very shallow attempt !! Do not waste your time on this one","review":"For those who wish to 'pass' an exam I guess this serves the purpose. For those who wish to 'understand' and 'deploy' technology - this book is terrible !! The authors have treated major subject areas like Frame Relay and ISDN with such callousness ... its really frustrating !! Do not stop to pick this one up - its not worthy of a place on your shelf !! - Lamelle has done better in his earlier CCNA books - this was a royal let-down !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely adequate","review":"After buying the Support and Switching books from Sybex, I was disappointed in their Remote Access book. It is not up to the same quality. The Authors have a tendency to repeat themselves from one sentence to the next. I found at least a dozen mistakes in both the text and the end-of-chapter quizzes. I did pass the Remote Access exam by using this book and on-the-job training. I can't believe anyone could pass the test by using this book alone. I have not read any other of the CCNP Remote Access books, but I would think there is something better available. I don't even recommend it as a reference book. There is just not enough detail nor is it clearly explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to read, I recommend it.","review":"I took this test as the second of four on the way to my CCNP. I used only this book and a couple of routers in a lab to pass this test. Well, that and a few years experience.This book is well written, and is easy to read. The examples are good, and it convered everything that was on the test. I couldnt ask for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total failure!","review":"If compared to 3 other Remote Access books, this one is a total failure! For my exam preparation I used all 4 books: BCRN (McGraw Hill), CiscoPress book, Remote Access by R.Rossi and this Sybex's \\"masterpiece\\". To my opinion the best is BCRN. CiscoPress is more like a very good manual. And if you want to polish your remote access knowledge - use Rossi's book. But if you want to spend your time filtering info, trying to define, what is useful (like 3 pages of Cisco700 router commands!- who needs to memorize it),filling termilogy gaps and translating in plain English authors attempts to explain some remote access subjects - go with Sybex's newest \\"masterpiece\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a mess","review":"I picked the book, looking at the 5 star rating in Amazon.com. What a mess! Absolutely unreadable, authors use terminology without explaining, what terms or CISCO commands mean. Look at page 219, for example. What is a Channel type, Linecode, Time slot? And it is like this througout the book! Welcome to Sybex's amateur writers club. I exchanged it to Building Cisco Remote Access Networks from Ciscopress ISBN1578700914. This is a beauty! Very solidly written. Has continuous explanation of everything you need for real life and passing paper test. Strongly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is terrible. Those who rated this book 5 stars must have multiple years of on the job experience, becuase that is what you need if you expect this book to help. This is a hard exam, and the level of detail and quality of descriptions within this book are no where near good enough to help you. X25 and PPP especially need much more detail if you hope to pass this test. And don't even bother with the CD. The questions there are so pathetic and off topic compared to the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Error Filled, Poorly Written, Inaccurate Mess","review":"This book stinks. I know that's not high-flown prose, but the book is terrible. Filled with inaccuracies, typos, confusing text and undefined terms, this book has proven to be as much of a stumbling block as it has a study aid. To be honest, I and the five colleagues I am studying with have found so many mistakes that we no longer have any confidence or trust in the accuracy of this book for test preparation.

It is a known fact that there is no single book , which covers the subject both thorough and in an easy to read manner. Every Remote Access book has its cons and pros. BUT why would you buy the worst study guide? I recommend to my students to start with McGraw Hill's BCRAN (very easy and clear explanation) and then use Cisco's Remote Access (more detailed and very good labs, but boring to read) or Remote Access for Cisco Networks by Bill Burton (which is an exellent source, but lacks some basic info) If your goal is to become a good network specialist (not just paper certified), try to avoid Sybex's guides.

I read it and my reaction was less than stellar. If I had not been exposed to other far better writings offered up by say, Koryu Books (ie Koryu Bujutsu) I would have thought it was great and would have been satisfied with my purchase and choice of reading material.

Found out that a \\"Richard Marx\\" sang the song. So, I picked up \\"Repeat Offender\\" and \\"Rush Street\\" in a two pack. Little did I know that I was in for a treat.For a debut album it was awesome...though Bob Dylan is my favorite musical artist ever, not even he did as well during his first album. Songs like \\"Endless Summer Nights,\\" \\"Have Mercy\\" and \\"Heaven Only Knows\\" are absolute gemstones. Though \\"Right Here Waiting\\" is my absolute favorite Richard Marx song, there are plenty of gems right here. Completely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marx The First","review":"Richard Marx's self-titled debut album catapulted the background singer and songwriter from behind the scenes to superstardom. The album featured four top ten singles (he became the second artist after Whitney Houston to have four top three singles from a debut album) and eventually peaked at number eight on the album charts. The first single \\"Don't Mean Nothin'\\" has a late 70's Eagles sound which makes sense since Joe Walsh provided a signature guitar solo and Timothy B. Schmit & Randy Meisner provide background vocals. \\"Should've Known Better\\" has a slicker and more corporate rock sound while \\"Endless Summer Nights\\" is a perfect summer melody and beat. After peaking at number three twice and number two with his first three singles, single number four, \\"Hold On To The Nights\\". The song is a classic 80's power ballad that practically begs for you to pull out a lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cad Worth Keeping","review":"This book had been on my \\"to be read\\" bookcase for 2 or 3 years. Finally I picked it up, and I am so thankful that I did. It is a sweet romance with a hero any woman would welcome into her life. The Cad is a keeper. This is one of those stories that will \\"call\\" to me to re-read for the adventure, the love, the conflict, and a hero who overcomes all to keep the woman he truly loves..Oh My.The lady The Cad chooses had been injured as a child and mistreated as a young woman by her entire family. She never expected a whirlwind romance, much less a marriage for herself as she saw herself as a worthless scared burden to her family.Take the time to savor the romance, and enjoy this story that touched my heart.."},{"rating":"1","title":"what an insipid female!!","review":"I disliked this book and I only picked it up because I like Regencies and of course the reviews here. The female character (definitely not a heroine!) was so weak, and everything I detest in female characters in this genre. Yes she was a victim but the annoying thing was how she went tamely to whatever fate life dealt her. She did everything your mummy told you NOT to do when 'boys talk to you'.Ewen, the male character saved this book for me, just for a while. Unfortunately it was NOT enough. I eventually found him too suave and world-wise for the lead female who constantly came off as she was in way over her head with no backbone. EVERYTHING was decided for her and such a big deal made over her scar.....yes scars are the worst thing to happen!She never questioned, never probed just accepted what he told her. How realistic is that? Just Yuck......this book was never finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Edith Layton is one of my favorite Regency authors, unfortunately this is not one of her better novels. The main characters were uninteresting and the plot was absurd. By the end of the book I simply could have cared less. I am giving this book two stars only because Layton is stylistically a very good writer. The story on its own merits 0 to 1 star. If you want to read some excellent Regencies by this author I highly recommend the Signet Regencies and Super Regencies published in the late 80's and early 90's. Her early novellas in the Signet anthologies are also excellent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"Alder chips are almost impossible to find at a supermarket or large hardware store such as Home Depot or Lowes. These chips do indeed complement salmon very well. The flavor is more mild than hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, maple or any of the fruit woods. The giant 8 pound bag will last for a couple of grilling seasons, and makes it easy to offer some to guests, if they enjoy the flavor. This is a great product, would recommend to anyone who enjoys a smoky flavor, but on the mild side."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISASTER","review":"In all honesty UNk is a disaster to the Hip Hop culture.

I would never buy this album, more less download the \\"songs\\". The only good southern rapper is Luda, and T.I isn't that bad. So far UNK has done nothing to amaze me and I'm pretty sure that he never will... HE JUST SUCKS!!!![This gets no stars from me]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please everybody!

His big hit, \\"Walk It Out\\", might even been less impressive than \\"Laffy Taffy\\" or \\"Lean Wit It\\". I didn't think that was possible, but this is just another example of the 'snap' garbage that is sucking far too many green pieces of paper with pictures of presidents on them out of the wallets of this hip-hop loving audience.Everyone likes to think they were the first catch on to the new revolutionary music trend. That's why people are having this style forced upon them. DJ Unk is the latest disaster in this musically horrifying trend.

This, is awful. The lyrics make me want to pull my hair out, and the beat it just decent. This is another no-talent loser trying to make a quick buck. Please, for the love of Hip Hop, DO NOT BUY THIS CD. Go pick up the new Nas CD, or the new Ludacris cd. Luda remains to be the only superb rapper from the south. TI is in second.

It is incredibly boring and has no lyrical content. The only, good, uptempo song on the entire cd is \\"maybe I'm Amazed\\", which is paul McCartney's best song over his entire carrer. I would have give this album NO STARS if it wasn't for that song. The SIX INSTUMENTALS add to the boredom of this album. The cd does have some musical depth but its way too boring to hold your interest. I recomend this album to anyone who suffers from insomnia.After listening to this you realize that John Lennon really was the talent behind the Beatles, and that \\"McCartney\\" was just a pretender to the throne."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be joking.","review":"McCartney was AT BEST a mediocre album with one or two good songs on it. McCartney needed John Lennon and George Martin. On his own, his work is mostly mediocre. Fragments and bits and pieces of good things - but lacking across the board. Sixty plus bucks for a Special Edition of this record is stupid...obscene. Even if you like the record (and I do, sort of) it's almost all filler. Pleasant, forgettable, humdrum.McCartney II is far worse - somebody wrote along the way that it \\"shipped gold and was returned platinum.\\" The low point of a lot of self-indulgent McCartney crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing affair...","review":"As a devote Beatle fan I've began to expand my collection into the solo works of the Beatles. This album was a complete disappointment. I've listened to this album intently for the fifth time hoping it would grow on me to no avail. Do yourself a favor and skip this album entirely, it comes across as an album of 'B' sides and outakes that are poor at best. If your looking to expand your Beatle horizons start with anything from George or John."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to recommend here","review":"This sounds like it was recorded by a self-indulgent musician in his basement... oh, it was.

When first released, this album was widely panned - seems most folks were awaiting Abbey Road pt II, which this definately wasn't. However, the simplicity of the arrangements and the unassuming song lyrics make this a very listenable experience. This is probably one of the least pretentious album released by any Beatle, and thats certainly a welcome relief. If you haven't listened to \\"Mccartney,\\" give it a whirl. You'll be drawn in by the simple charm of \\"Every Night,\\" \\"That Would Be Something,\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed.\\" So its not Sgt. Pepper or Abbey Road?

This is a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Laid Back","review":"This album is so comforting. I don't know what's up with people who rate this album with 3 stars. The instrumentals are very good. The bass lines was very melodical. Very well played instruments. What struck me about this album what how it's feel and sound was very different than the Beatles. Do this: plug in the white album. And listen..... can't you feel the tension and the pain that is expressed through the music. And Abbey Road....you can still feel it. John's yokoish lyrics and music. McCartney is beatiful. It is so laid back, but not to laid back to filter out the quality of his music. Buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macca's first solo effort is a gem","review":"Have to agree with all the other 4- and 5-star reviews here. Brings back memories for me of the summer of 1970 (I was 13), the Beatles' breakup, and lost innocence. I get a kick out of all the Lennon and Harrison snobs out there -- so full of themselves. Yes, Lennon and Harrison were amazing. McCartney was at least equally as talented and probably the best pop music tunesmith of our time. \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" alone is worth the price of the CD.

It is 28 minutes long. Most of the songs are fragmentary at best. I tried to consider this a reflective album. Can't do it. I tried to think of this as a celebration of domestic/tranquil/simple living. Can't do it. It is just horrible. I can only assume that listening to this POS turned Elvis Costello into a misanthrope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deluxe Editions gone WILD.","review":"So many deluxe editions popping up...and hardly any are worth the money. Paul's debut album was fairly good...but certainly not deserving of the \\"deluxe\\" treatment given here.

This could be seen as clumsy or unfinished, but I think that Paul wanted the album to sound this way purposely. Almost like a vacation from perfection, Paul sings songs of love and happiness using the elemental rock instruments without using many studio effects.Some songs are slightly annoying and repetitive, but overall this recording leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling. Songs like \\"Every Night\\" and \\"Momma Miss America\\" are great fun while \\"Junk\\" and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" stand out as some of Sir Paul's greatest melodies of his career. A must have for true Beatles fans (especially those who are fond of Paul).However, of the 3 post-Beatles albums released in 1970: this, Plastic Ono Band, and All Things Must Pass.... The latter is the only one to come close to the magic that the fab four once had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lowkeyed charm","review":"Sometimes a brilliant first effort can become a millstone around an artist's neck, so that all subsequent work pales in comparison, at least as far as the fans are concerned. Now, I don't know if Paul McCartney had that thought in mind -- certainly he already had his reputation as a Beatle, and he knew he'd carry THAT weight a long time! -- but his first official solo album is a ramshackle joy. I actually like the fact that it has odds 'n' ends, bits 'n' pieces of songs mixed in with some outright gems. \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is worth the price of the album alone, to be honest. But the unfinished fragments have their own small pleasures. Paul sounds relaxed, at ease, simply enjoying himself & his newfound life. And for that very reason, this sometimes maligned first album has grown for me over the years, becoming a hidden treasure of sorts. I often listen to it when I need a respite from everyday life, a reminder of the simple things. Most highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF HIM","review":"ITS A GREAT ALBUM.ONE GOOD SONG IS Oo YOU AND TEDDY BOY WITCH IS A BEATLES SONG.YOU WILL LIKE THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"When I think of this album I'm transported back to freshman year of high school in 1970 and having it playing in the background while doing homework, or harmonizing with my friends at slumber parties.

They expected another \\"Sgt.

There is no \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" politics about this album, but then again, John's solo albums seldom matched Paul's for listenability. This album is simply a man, a cornerstone of the greatest rock band ever, trying to come to terms with his new life, he's seeking a new identity, not as a Beatle, but simply as Paul McCartney, husband to Linda (hence a few simple songs in praise of his beau).At the same time John was 'writing' stuff which though equally 'honest' is saturated with primal screams (thanks to musical 'genius' Yoko Ono)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break-up","review":"This was the album that broke the Beatles up. A true solo album.Some of the songs were being rehearsed in the studio for an upcoming Beatles album titled\\"Let It Be\\" . Think John was psst for a reason? The rest is all history now.

After the studio wizardry of Abbey Road, who'd expect Paul to release a record of tossed-off home recordings with one mike and a four-track in Scotland? The album's a textbook of pop arrangement that culminates in the classic \\"Baby I'm Amazed\\". But it also shows the problems he'd run in to without John and George to say no: pointless prettiness (\\"Junk\\") and good ideas that collapse into syrupy changes (\\"Teddy Boys\\"). For all John's complaints that Paul was too slick, he showed more courage in releasing one-offs than the others, who turned to Phil Spector to make it big and Beatlish. These doodles, caught at Paul's peak, show an intimacy that few other solo works capture. It's Paul as Paul, warts and all. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Songs","review":"\\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" although commercial, is still a heart tugger. The rest of these *silly little love songs* are fun, lighthearted tunes.Great, smooth McCartney vocals.

Though, it has some charm due to its artsy, borderline weirdness and quaint sensitivities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is a fantastic, raw, and intimate disc made during turbulent times for Paul, the rest of the Beatles, and their fans. There are several strong tracks on this such as \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", \\"Every Night\\"(an all too often overlooked McCartney classic), and \\"That Would Be Something\\". I'd also like to point out that the review further down the page from a supposed \\"music fan from New York\\" has a lot of false facts in it-it's perfectly fine to not like an album, but get your facts straight first. This album sold extremely well, as it should have, and eventually knocked \\"Let It Be\\" out of the number one spot on the charts. It's a great Cd and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"bonus material?","review":"I had forgotten that this was mostly him playing with the tape recorder in the studio.

For Paul's first solo effort, you would have expected something closer to the inspiring work on Abbey Road or Let it Be. Instead it sounds rushed and underproduced. There are a few classic songs (\\"Maybe I'm Amazed,\\" \\"That Would be Something\\") but generally, it reveals his weakenesses as a solo artist. His biggest weaknesses are his insistence on playing nearly every instrument by himself, and his tendency towards lyrical superficiality. I love Paul McCartney, but this is a haphazard effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"While \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is great, the rest of the album is beneath Paul's talents and shows that even early on in his solo career, he badly needed an editor and strong willed producer to tell him when he wasn't making the grade. The other songs just aren't very strong and are not performed well on top of that. For example, \\"Teddy Boy\\" sounds much better in the \\"Let It Be\\" outtakes that have surfaced.

A young man who has everything going for him, brains, money, and class, gets seduced by a strange religious cult. Suddenly his life is out of control, and he is forced to submit to the mind control of the cult and its charismatic leader (Peter Fonda) as the cult utterly submerges his individuality. James Woods turns in a particularly compelling performance as the ruthless \\"deprogrammer\\" who battles with the cult for the protagonist's individuality. Peter Fonda does his usual fine job as the leader of the cult. Brian Dennehy is as always appealing as the loving father who cannot understand what has happened to his son.It is unfortunate that this excellent film is not available on DVD, because it is an enjoyable viewing experience and contains quite a bit of relevant and important social commentary. This film features a very much above average cast and tells a fine story. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"It's as if he recorded this himself; a one man thing...

Its odd selection and playing order makes it the bizarre anomaly that it is. 'Best of dark horse' released in the 80's is another must have, but both albums are now dated in content and concept, so remain unfulfilling as comprehensive testimonies to Harrison's genius. The only 'best of' that could really do justice to Harrison's output would be a double cd: one to chronicle his work with the fab 4, and one to cover his solo work. It would have to cover all phases of his career from 'Do you want to know a secret' to 'Any road'. It would contain some of his early 'forgotten' work before '66, and all his solo hits including 'Ding dong ding dong'(his intelligent wackiness at its best, with the possible exception of 'Crackerbox palace'). now that would be a 'best of' album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's Wrong With This Album?","review":"I don't know what everybody's problem is (who reviewed this album.)

I have pretty much every Beatle album, so they don't do anything for me. And another problem, some of his biggest hits are repetitive. (\\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Give Me Love\\") \\"You\\" has to be his worst song here. It's overproduced (by Spector, go figure), but is kinda funny anyways. \\"Dark Horse\\" and \\"What Is Life\\" are the best ones here.

Every track is available elsewhere with the exception of the 1971 charity single \\"Bangla Desh.\\" Harrison is so far overdo for a good career-spanning Best Of that it isn't even funny. Each of the other former Beatles have excellent career retrospectives available.More than half this collection is given over to Beatles songs. That leaves a paltry 6 solo songs, and nothing beyond 1976. George's solo discography is rich, varied, and consistently interesting. I can only hope that this is updated with a greatly expanded track listing (omitting Beatles songs) and remastered sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many Beatles songs?","review":"The Beatles were an amazing band, no doubt about it, but this compilation is supposed to be the best of GEORGE. There is no need to fill half the album with Beatles tracks; that's what Beatles Greatest Hits are for. George had so many good album tracks that were not included, such as \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass.\\" I would much rather have those songs than yet another reproduction of Beatles-era songs.My advice is to pick up \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Cloud 9.\\" Those two, to me, are the best albums of George's solo career.

Each chapter addresses a different issue that is important to Arizona such as water, mining, railroads, ranching and others. I like the way the book is laid out for that purpose. It covers the growth and development for Wickenburg, but will mirror many other towns in Arizona. I especially like the way Mark Pry personalizes the town.

It assumes you are fascile with VFP. I believe that Rick has succeeded (moreso than Microsoft) at enlightening readers how to take advantage of the power that VFP offers for web development. The one drawback to the book is the age-old \\"moving target\\" dilemma. Since the book hs been published, Microsoft has delivered a (more) truly multithreaded version of the VFP runtime engine, and it now supports the Compile command in the run time version. This changes the equation a bit when it comes to deciding how to best deploy VFP as a web database server, and I wish Rick would e-publish an addendum that thoroughly addresses this.

The frames were just what I wanted but the condition they arrived in is unacceptable. The glass was cloudy and scratched. I tried to clean them with windex but that only removed the grime. The scratches are still there. I thought I would just add new glass but one of the frames is scratched as well. They were wrapped up nicely in corner protectors and bubblewrap but the damage was under the preshrunk plastic. I'm guessing it's too much trouble to send them back and I probably can't since I tried to clean them anyway. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"hmm.","review":"I like this book. Have to say though, I found it to be a tough read. I hestitate to say anything bad about it, because everyone else gave it 5 star reviews, so I feel like I must've missed the real magic in it. overall, it was ok. I never found the plot to be very well organized-it seemed like the author just kind of wrote whate came to mind and then went where it led rather than work from a definite plan. In fact, it never seems to have much of a plot at all, its really more of a psychological study of the nature of the characters. hence, it is not called the \\" The Adventures of a Lady.\\" I also would have appreciated a little more dialogue to move to story along, as sometimes it does get rather heavy and dull. However, if you can overlook that, Henry James has a beautiful writing style, creates beautiful characters, and is a necessity on the bookshelf of any serious reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really picks up about halfway through.","review":"When I started reading this for my English class, I wasn't happy that she had chosen this book, since by the end of the first chapter, I was already bored. But, I kept reading it, and I'm glad I did. The book gets very interesting about a third or halfway through, and once it picks up, it becomes much easier and faster to read. It still took me a little under a month to read it, and at times it was fairly difficult to grasp what was going on, since James would often write chunks of text with no breaks that would often last a page or a page and a half, but it didn't detract from the overall story. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminded me of a Soap Opera","review":"Rich people and the traps that they set for themselves. I had a hard time relating to the subject matter.Henry James is an excellent author, his cheracters are vivid, his stories very well written but Mr. James was born into money and it shows all through this story.I found the frequent use of French phrases and expressions inconvenient because I had to keep referring to the appendix to be able to follow the story.Although I enjoyed the story, my enjoyment was tinged with the impression that the people in the story had too much time on their hands and were in need of more constructive pursuits than meddling in the lives of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic?","review":"I couldn't really get into Henry James' \\"Portrait of a Lady\\".

I love them and they are now prized in my kitchen. I will say that the red insignia shown on each knife is actually a peel off paper and the knife block does not have the insignia painted red as it shows in the picture. Minor things to me, but maybe not to someone else. I highly recommend these. I don't see how you could be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really worth it","review":"Have had this set since 2007- really worth it.

Part two on \\"the tools of history\\" offers good guidance on researching, writing, and thinking about history. Again, short, provocative chapters should stimulate students to think and talk about the joys and difficulties of doing quality history.

Otherwise, the author has no usable talent; her writing is shallow and without meaningful feeling to the masses. Perhaps her family might understand her poetry.

Not only is it a clever story with unique characters and clever twists, it also seamlessly incorporates deeper ideas like discrimination, sacrifice, and overcoming traditional barriers. The great thing is that the author weaves these themes in so naturally, you walk away from the book with plenty to think about and keep you amused without feeling at all preached at. As a college student, I am somewhat in the habit of studying and analyzing what I read. This series thrives no matter from what angle it is read from.

My experience can be described as comparing the painting of the Mona Lisa with a pencil rendition.

There is no substitute for the full version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the original","review":"Don't buy this. BUY THE ORIGINAL 3 VOLUME. You can try to justify why the abridgment is better but it's all a bunch of nonsense.

The original is amazing, buy that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not go for the real thing?","review":"Abridgements of great works in and of themselves are not a bad thing. As I read through this volume I could not but help noticing how poorly it reflected upon Freeman's original three volume work.Douglas Southall Freeman's Magnum Opus is distorted quite significantly in this abridgement. If you have not read his original work I suppose this volume will suffice. But why settle? I frequently come across the original volumes at used bookstores for around $50-$60.Mr. Freeman's writing is good literature apart from being great history.

One of the traitis that Collins' team discovered was the idea of \\"servant\\" leadership. This notion, not surprisinlgy, is a biblical concept that goes to to the heartbeat of who a leaders really is. This is not something taught in MBA school. The MBA schools have produced crook after crook; they have not seriously addressed (except in only a cursory way) servant leadership.Finzel's book paints the picture of what a servant-leader looks like.

My favorite track is \\"Coochie Coo\\" because in combines a melodic sense with fun rhymes that allude to our dirtier sides. Dirty is deffintely my thing, and there is a lot of that here.

The casting was just right. After seeing The Road Home, I don't think anyone else could've portrayed Sayuri as well as Ziyi. Michelle Yeoh as her mentor is amazing, as usual.

I agree that the score and the visuals are stunning and the cinematography does a wonderful job of providing beautiful shots of the city and the landscape. But this movie could not escape from terrible acting. Characters seemed stiff and awkward (in every way other than the actual performance pieces and dancing), but there was so little emotion displayed on the screen. Some may argue that it's a cultural representation issue, but at the heart of the movie is a love story that never catches hold completely.

By sitting through this film I lost two and quarter hours of my life that I won't be getting back!As I have not read the book from which the film is drawn, I can make no criticism of the book. The film, however, is one long bore. I am reminded of \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" which was a truly great book but an absolute shocker of a film. \\"Geisha\\" is probably in this class.Yes, the sets were magnificent but that comes close to concluding a list of the film's virtues.

I don't make it a habit of pirating movies, but I do enjoy having a digital jukebox of my movies, much like most people do with music. This action by Sony prevents the customer from modifying the content so it can be played back on other devices, so forget about reauthoring it to play back on a PDA, PSP, or simply ripping them onto my laptop so I don't have to bring the DVD's with me when I travel.I need to pay more attention in the future so I can stop giving this anti-consumer company any more of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Description said the DVD was new and still in the box, it wasn't","review":"The DVD was packaged but somehow the DVD was so scratched and damaged that I couldn't even watch it because my DVD player couldn't read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Talent","review":"This film should have much to recommend it. The cinematography and art direction are outstanding. From a purely visual point of view, this is a stunning film. The direction and acting are also quite good, with all performances at least very good, and some, notably those of the estimable Ken Watanabe, Gong Li, and Michelle Yeoh, excellent. All this talent, however, is used in the service of a trivial romance novel plot. The latter is essentially poor girl falls in love with powerful, noble, and good looking man, survives numerous tribulations and ends up with the man of her dreams.

It is fascinating to see the kinds of situations a Geisha would of put into and how they dealt with it, and the training they underwent. It is also interesting to see the hierarchy in the Geisha world, as well as the distinction between geisha and prostitutes.

Beautiful in all respects: the acting, the photography, the palette, and the love story itself--between a young girl who becomes a Geisha, and the first man who is kind to her after she is sold into her new life. Like a jigsaw puzzle whose pieces seem random until they are placed side by side to form a whole, the disparate pieces of this story come together to create a canvass that is rich in colors, texture and beauty, and worth watching many times and reflecting upon. Clearly, though, the lives of other Geishas do not have such storybook endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I enjoyed this movie a good bit. It is visually stunning, the music is haunting and memorable, the pacing is smooth, and the acting is well done, particularly the character of Hatsumomo as portrayed by Gong Li. She actually brought a sympathetic element to the rather one-dimensional evil geisha in the novel.Much has been made of the casting choices and the liberties taken by the author from his source material. I have read the arguments those opposed to both the book and movie have, but I find they are not powerful enough to distract me from recommending this well done movie. It is a refreshing escapist pleasure.There are many special features covering the world of the geisha and the arduous preparation the actresses went through that are worth watching as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you to another world...","review":"Life of a Geisha is just that: the life of a young girl forced to become an entertainer of men. Her life becomes a bitter struggle for survival among women who each have their own agenda and their own motivation for the way in which they treat her.Taking place in Japan, around the time of WW2, Life of a Geisha takes you into their world and shows you an insider's view of the geisha and all of the people who interracted with them. Also shown is the different types of artforms the geisha were versed in, including dancing with fans, walking and hand movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Escape","review":"Enjoyed the book and this movie so much I decided I had to buy it to be able to watch it whenever I was feeling the need of a \\"great escape\\".Beautiful costumes and scenery.

The delicacy of the geisha's mannerand the beauty of her movements were mesmerizing. The photographywas so beautiful and mood provoking there arent words to express it.

There is no way that they are the same. This is just like the movie Anna and the King that can't show and made in Thailand because the story is so far off the true.

Boomy, overwhelming bass - like the kind that comes from a teenager's car where the entire trunk is a subwoofer. This is the type of bass that would be appropriate for Public Enemy's or the Beastie Boys' DVD-A/SACD reissues, not for a pop rock band like Crowded House! If there is justice, this Crowded House DVD-Audio disc will either go out of print and be re-released with a corrected mix, or Capitol should reduce the price to US$9.99, because that's all it's worth (definitely not worth the US$24.99 I paid!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Start Leading To Greatness","review":"Sorry to rain on the parade but I think this CD - by the stellar standards of Crowded House - is pretty average, particularly compared to the gradual ascent to the sublime Together Alone (one of the great albums of the 90's along with Achtung Baby and Live Through This).It has a couple of catchy singles but the production is really tinny and the lyrics are just OK.If I'm in the mood for Crowded House (most of the time) this is the CD I generally pick up last."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNFINISHED ORDER","review":"I CANNOT OFFER A REAL REVIEW FOR THIS SET .I HAVE BEEN WAITING SINCE LATE AUGUST FOR THE REST OF MY SET.

Most people know the names of Al Capone and Elliott Ness, the big names in this criminal battle. One name now forgotten is Paul Robsky, a foot soldier for the law, whose tale is told in this incredible documentary style novel.

Stakeouts, chases, gun battles, betrayal, even rivalry within the Untouchables - it's all here. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice follow-up to Fraley & Ness's book","review":"This is an interesting tale, well told. Fraley certainly had the knack of getting these stories down on paper. His co-author and subject, Paul Robsky was one of the \\"Untouchables\\", immortalized on TV by Robert Stack as Eliot Ness. Ness's own story is covered by Fraley's previous book, \\"The Untouchables\\".In this version of the story, Eliot is merely another one of the Untouchables, not the leader. Eliot is the go-between for communications from the US Attorney General and the Untouchables. Mostly they worked in pairs, pursuing their own line of investigation into the bootlegging industry.In the one story where Eliot and Paul both appear (the tapping of phones at Capone's hotel), the two stories pretty much match up. Otherwise Paul doesn't really mention Eliot much.This is a well-written story about a time that's getting harder and harder to imagine as it recedes into the past.

It analyzes the major issues, goes behind the scenes to examine the actions of policymakers, maintains a balanced treatment of the shortcomings both of Egyptian policymakers and of the donors (such as the IMF, the World Bank, and USAID), examines weaknesses in the data, and presents sensible and practical advice on strategy and policy, including required improvements in the functioning of key institutions.

It still eclipses most other comics today, but it's hard to imagine anything topping the first 24 issues. Most of the book is excellent, with funny moments like the story of Frankie the Eunuch and the \\"messiah\\", and scary scenes like the Angel in the basement (you'll have to read for a better explanation). The opening and closing chapters pale in comparison to the larger narrative, but serve to tell stories of \\"proud americans\\" just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, as is the whole series.","review":"Garth Ennis, Preacher: Proud Americans (DC Comics, 1997)Garth Ennis' iconoclastic series rolls on here, providing us with a bit of background and developing the storyline.

It is almost as sharp now as the day I bought it. Needless to say, I love that knife. About two months ago, I found myself in need of a new peeler, and given my fondness for the Kyocera knife, decided to give this ceramic peeler a try. Sadly, it really is not the same class of utensil.I use the peeler primarily for zesting citrus fruits for use in cocktails, and the ceramic blade handled that job reasonably well. The plastic channel zesters on either side of the blade (for making, say, a lemon twist) are basically worthless. I already had an OXO tool for that purpose, so no worries. But yesterday, after maybe 10 uses in 2 months, the plastic frame that holds the blade snapped into three pieces, rendering the whole thing useless. I'll be replacing it with the OXO Y-Peeler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great to use, but not durable","review":"The blade's nice and sharp, great-shaped handle, corers are a nice touch, but mine came apart and was unusable after just a few months of light duty at my house.

My laptop came with a 6 cell battery when I bought it 2 years ago and I never got more than 2 hours out of it so I am impressed with this replacement.

It was costing us a ridiculous amount of money to feed our baby and just started to settle on the fact that we'd be paying over $9.00 per bottle until he starts on solids.I started reading some other reviews on Amazon and found that the Similac Spit Up formula could work just as well as Alimentum. My wife and I tried it and after almost a week it has proved to be a success. Our baby boy is happy and so are Mom and Dad!Try this if you're currently paying too much for hypoallergenic formula and you don't know for sure if your child has food allergies or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for reflux baby!","review":"We love this formula. We battled it out with breastmilk, and several different kinds of formula during my daughter's first month of life. Only this formula would work for her. Everything else always came right back up. It has been determined that she has reflux. Zantac has really helped. Still we need formula! This is premixed and the thickest kind. I find it doesn't stain much, either (though I do wash things frequently). While the price fluctuates, it does seem to cost less than most of the other ready-made formulas, too, but you can't always count on that. All in all, I like this better than the sensitive for fussiness and gas (too thin so it came right back up), alimentum (baby didn't even want to taste it, too bitter? bad smell), good start (made her poop immediately and she fussed while drinking), and regular similac (too thin, came right back up)."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID ANYONE PROOF/EDIT THESE RECIPES ?????","review":"What a beautiful book to receive as a gift!

That said, though - I like it a lot, and I wear it a lot. My recommendation: check out any watch \\"live and in person\\" before you buy it online.Revised May '09: I stopped wearing this watch a year ago, and I finally got around to throwing it away. The screw-down cap stopped screwing down, and moisture got into the watch dial in humid weather. This watch, and my other Skagen, are both deep-sixed. I'll never buy Skagen again.

However there's no doubting the message of vemon, it beats Bob Dylan's Positively Fourth Street for bad mouthing you're ex friends.Oh My Love and Oh Yoko are love songs, so you can see this is an album of considerable contrasts.I suggest you hear it and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"It's funny how you can have a song like \\"Imagine\\" on the same CD as \\"How Do You Sleep?\\". Still, it works (at least I think so). If you're skeptical, just get it for the title track. You don't have to like the rest of the songs, it's a classic. It's more than a classic, it's a masterpiece. As for the rest of the album, \\"Jealous Guy\\" and \\"Oh My Love\\" are beautiful and touching. \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" is amusing. Still, it's a little upsetting how sinister and mean Lennon was towards his former buddy. \\"Those freaks was right when they said you was dead\\".

Some of the melodies are pleasant, but the lyrics are abysmal. Many of the songs are didactic, about leftist political ideas; moreover, there is not a single well-written love song on the entire album.The album starts with the didactic \\"Imagine\\", which begins, \\"Imagine there's no Heaven....No Hell below us, above us only sky.\\" Only someone with a tremendous motivation to do so can imagine that there's no Heaven or Hell; John was a drug-abusing rock and roller, so he had the motivation.John Lennon's songs never became pop standards, which is evidence of the poor quality of the songwriting. Compare the songwriting of John Lennon to that of the beautiful, well-written songs of Oscar Hammerstein, Dorothy Fields, Jerome Kern, the Gershwins, and Irving Berlin; then try to give this album anything but 1 star.This album is the product of a severely neurotic heroin user, and the songs are accordingly poorly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another artist dying too early","review":"It is extremely hard to imagine what kind of music would have been put out by some of the rock pioneers who had died tragically. What would Jimi Hendrix be playing guitar like by now? How would Janis be singing by now? What kind of songs would John Lennon be writing by no? We are talking genius stuff here. This i think is the finest of Lennon's solo albums and is a must have for anyone's collection, whether you are a fan or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I like the Imagine CD by John lennon.","review":"The Imagine CD was a very well-written collection of music, at least in my opinion. It did have a little of the Beatle beat, and that might have given it a little-less effect than songs like \\"God\\" or \\"Working Class Hero\\", but it did have pretty good emotional songs like \\"I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier\\" that represent the pain and feeling of not wanting to go die in Vietnam. And of course there's the old standby of \\"Imagine\\", a very sweet song full of emotion, that Paul McCartney could never had written. Not made for pop music at all, this is just one of John Lennon's musical masterpieces. I also enjoyed the Imagine Soundtrack, in case anyone's interested."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Lennon","review":"A great album, but not simply for the oft-discussed title song and the scathing \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" Among the treasures in John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" (1971) are the bluesy \\"It's So Hard,\\" the country-influenced \\"Crippled Inside\\" and the brilliant, inexplicably underrated \\"I Don't Wanna Be a Soldier\\" - six minutes of studio mastery. George Harrison's distinctive guitar work can be heard on five of the 10 memorable tracks. \\"Imagine\\" represents Lennon at his absolute best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spector-ized","review":"Somehow, everything he touches gets ruined. I still give it 5/5, because I feel sorry for Lennon. The wall of sound on Jealous Guy (to name one place) is incredibly annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try to imagine John Lennon with no possessions...","review":"A truly over-rated album, compiled by one of the greatest hypocrites of the 1960s. Try as I might, I cannot imagine John Lennon without possessions.His estate was estimated at $500 million when he died...Why didn't you show us the way, John, by divesting yourself and giving away your vast fortune? The rest of the songs are forgettable, and mediocre. Take a pass on this album and buy a Beatles' CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"We can finally rate this","review":"It pains me to give a john lennon product a 1 star rating, but it needs to be done. The remix from 2000 sounds so much better. Not to mention, the remastering from the original tapes really isn't that noticeable. If you compare your original cd's from the 1980's there isn't much of a difference. I'm aware these are the original sound recordings, but it seems like this is a step in the wrong direction. The remixes are true to the orginal recording, but the voice and instruments are brought out more. This really wasn't necessary. I only bought it because my friend got me a discount on the signature box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CD in package","review":"I would have loved to listen--I take care of a sick aunt and have not been able to address the fact--that I opened the package and no CD IN THE PACKAGE--I AM SENDING IT BACK THIS WEEK THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET YOU KNOW:) JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK THANKS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzled","review":"My son loved this book so much he destroyed it.

These 2 discs just scream originality! Modern drum 'n' bass combined with lots of tabla from masters Zakir Hussain and Karsh Kale.

The cases do not lay flat, they have a dished shape probably due to the way they're packaged.

This soundtrack is brilliant. Just try not to get all aglow when Sheena sings about a natural love. Try not to get into mood listening to \\"Words into Action.\\" And the Bob Seger tune?

Yes, I know Rob and Demi are in it and it was the 80's but just let all that go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track Listing on Amazon is Wrong","review":"The track listing on amazon is wrong. The following track listing IS correct (as I do have the CD and I own the movie).1. So far so good - Sheena Easton2. (She's the) Shape of Things to Come - John Oates3. Natural Love - Sheena Easton4. Words into Action - Jermaine Jackson5. Step by Step - J.D. Souther6. Living Inside My Heart - Bob Seger7. Trials of the Heart - Nancy Shanks8. 'Til You Love Somebody - Michael Henderson9. If We Can Get Through the Night - Paul Davis10. True Love - The Del Lords11. If Anybody Had a Heart - John WaiteAnd these are the orginal songs from the movie too!

It's a great CD! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"I listened to this years ago when my sister had it but she then moved out and took it with her. I have looked around for ages for it and eventually found it on amazon. This cd has eveything from upbeat to slow songs. It's a great cd to listen to on any occasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!","review":"This is not worth the money in anyway shape or form. Iron Maiden is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE BANDS!!! However, $1,200 for 16 cds is just a complete waste of money. People considering buying this should really stop and think that they are almost paying $100 per cd. Do you realize how insane that is? Than as explained before the box it comes in is cheap. What is the point other than have everything that was released??? Merzbow if any of you have ever heard of them came out with a box set that is very rare that isn't even this expensive and it comes with 50 albums. Just think how you can get just about every cd from this collection on Amazon and probably not even spend anywhere near half the price of this. The only thing you won't get is a cheap cover made to look like Eddie's head just buy the collectible latex mask replica of Eddie floating around on amazon for only $20 it is not cheap whatsoever and adds much better to your collection than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Pointless.","review":"Unless you don't own any of the maiden albums, don't bother. The only reason you would need this is if you're really rich and can easily afford it or are a really big fan who does'nt own all the studio albums. That's the thing. 95% of this set is just the plain old albums and anyone who is big enough of a fan to want this set most likely already has all the albums anyway. There really is'nt enough extra stuff here to merit $250 of my potential nudie bar money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST FOR A COLLECTOR!","review":"This is an incredible \\"de luxe\\" release of the Iron Maiden stuff. All the CD's are enhanced and the Head looks amazing. If you're a die-hard fan, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The price is worth every cent!!!","review":"Yes, if you are not a collector then buy the CD's seperately. But I have loved Iron Maiden since the early 80's when I was young and I have all their CD's. But for a collector, this is a work of art... It is worth every penny... Something like this comes around only once in a while and I will listen to all my regular CD's still and keep this for my Music/Art Collection. And of course it's Iron Maiden, true artists so 5 stars in my book... Money comes and goes, but true art and collecting come seldom... If you can find it, Buy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mirwais' music rocks!","review":"I bought this album based solely on Mirwais' work on Madonna's \\"Music\\" and it is really good. Unfortunately the album only has nine tracks and one of them already appeared on Madonna's album. The only track that really blows is \\"v.i\\". \\"Junkie's Prayer\\" is really interesting giving us the interpretation of what a junkie would sound like if he/she was praying. The rest of the album is basically stuff Mirwais repeated on Madonna's album but \\"Music\\" was more commercial and radio-friendly. Madonna's album is not as risk-taking as Mirwais' \\"production\\" but it still sounds fresh and far from the boring Boy Band & Britney clones ... that plays on .... If any of these teen groups really want to see their careers last, they need to take the Madonna route and search for talent that will help them create musical landscapes that are unique and daring...like Mirwais!"},{"rating":"2","title":"possibly..","review":"I would have given this album 5 stars but it only had 9 tracks on it. Which was pretty upsetting because the music on it is pretty good. Does anyone else think the beat in \\"Never Young Again\\" was sampled in Madonna's track \\"Music\\" along with that one other sound.. If you have heard both songs you will know what sound i'm talking about.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let-down","review":"After hearing \\"Disco Science\\" and \\"Naive Song\\" as well as, of course, Madonna's latest record, I decided to pick up this record. While it's not bad, and certainly the first two songs are excellent, the rest seems a little disorganized. \\"V.I.\\" is just annoying, as is \\"Junkie's Prayer\\", and the remainder of the songs run into one another without making any real statement. That said, I think Mirwais is probably a talented gentleman and may be able to get his act together on some later material, for which I will be waiting. The New York Times' comment on the cover of \\"Production\\" which says, \\"Witty and Startling\\" seems stuck in my head. Startling, perhaps - witty, not as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"MEZMORIZING!","review":"A beautifully orchestrated mix of industrial rock, hip-hop, and all techno. With prior work with Madonna, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Mirwais astounds and hypnotizes, a reccomendation without limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocal Social Stratification!!!","review":"The lyrics right off the back are incessant to the ear, because of the mind state of cherishing the life of today,not tomorrow. The album is giving the listener a clear visual of the ability to prevail with gangs and murders. This album is a structure of social stratification. Young Soldierz display a art of hard lyrics and beats especially on Cut Thoart punk which shows a glimps of society against street vocals.Buy this album and add it to your underground collection, Its a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"GLAZIER'S JOPLIN -- AN EASY WINNER","review":"There are very few pianists who know how to play Scott Joplin with style & rhythm without overdoing it. Joplin's music has built-in rhythm that's tempting to overstate, thus turning rag into a bacchanalia. On the other hand, Joplin played perfunctorily with a tight rein is bland & uninspiring.If you love rag, Richard Glazier's Scott Joplin CD is the one you want to get. I have several versions of Joplin on, both, LP & CD and as far as I'm concerned, this Richard Glazier CD IS \\"The Easy Winner\\". His performance is exciting, yet elegant. Everything is in good taste; nothing gaudy nor superficial-- just great style & rhythm. Mr. Glazier grew up playing this kind of music & is a master of syncopated rhythm. He plays this genre of music like Vladimir Horowitz played Rachmaninov & Chopin.RECOMMENDATION: All of Richard Glazier's CDs are masterpieces. BUY THIS CD. YOU'LL LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and tasty","review":"I've been using Annie Chun's for years now. I like to add a bit of fresh vegtables or sometimes meat to them but they are good plain if you're in a hurry. This is very hot. Like I do with their other dishes I just dumped in the entire flavor pack...oops it was so hot I couldnt taste anything but the hot. After a bit of experimentation I found for me that about 1/2 the flavor packet and a heaping tablespoon of yogurt made this a really flavorful hot and sour dish. Add some shrimp if you can find good wild shrimp and you'll think you're in a high quality restaurant. Considering it comes to my remote door the price here isn't too bad compared to the box stores which often don't have all the flavors to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this soup.","review":"It isn't the same as hot and sour soup from my favorite Chinese restaurant, not even close, but it's easy to fix, relatively healthy and tastes pretty good.

I just enjoy it for what it is, a light, tasty soup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy but not so tasty.","review":"I followed the instructions to the letter and there is still something missing from the flavor.

Otherwise, it's OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected","review":"For a fast, add water and microwave product, the taste and texture of this soup bowl is pretty good. It is a good snack, but don't depend on it for a main course. My only complaint is that the noodles tended to be a bit rubbery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expiration Dates","review":"I wasn't overly happy with the flavor of these, but brought them to work in case someone else would like to try them. They weren't overly impressed either. BUT then I found out the ones I purchased in December carry expiration dates of February of this same year.

They might have tasted better if they were fresh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not Taste Like \\"Hot & Sour\\"","review":"Annie Chun's Hot & Sour is not awfull, but it doesn't taste good either.

I enjoy them very much and now that I can save a few dollars by ordering them from Amazon, I am very happy. The soups are very tasty and some of them are lower in sodium than many of the other brands. So, I'm eating something healthy and saving some money. Great!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Compared to other brands of instant soup cups, Annie Chun's Hot and Sour Soup Bowl is pretty darn good. Compared to the other flavors of Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, this one is a major disappointment.The noodles are fabulous, and the veggies reconstitute very well, as with all Annie Chun's Soup Bowls, but unfortunately the flavor is really lacking. I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is missing, but it basically tastes like extremely watered-down hot and sour soup. I'm Annie Chun's biggest fan, so it pains me to leave a negative review, but the Hot and Sour is definitely out of my order rotation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold the salt","review":"Tried the Hot and Sour soup bowl and the Ppad thai. Putting 970 and 1000 units of salt in those products turns them into an abomination. My wife and I took one spoonful of each, then prompty put the remainder down the disposal and went out to eat. What you do to those dishes at least is a terrible waste of food, in a time and in a nation when decent food is at a premius.

It was fascinating to hear about what went into what is now the Landmark Forum and other programmes put on by Landmark. The revelations about how members of the Scientology Church actively set out to damage the reputation of Mr Erhard are well worth watching, if only so you can be clear and complete about the guy who founded it all.

When I think of him, I am moved to tears--not because of a fawning cult figure adoration. Like myself, I am aware of his many human flaws and failures. I am moved to tears because when I remember Werner Erhard, I remember who I am.I remember how I hated my mother and father and had little contact with them for 12 years.

Tyrone Power is as usual handsome, and beyond that gives a fair performance at best. Orson Welles as Cesare Borgia is \\"over the top\\" evil. Wanda Hendrix is not at all believable. She seems to be a teeny bobber in costume. How Tyrone could find her fascinating rather than the beautiful Marina Berti is hard to understand. It is too bad that this was filmed in black and white as the sets, countryside, and costumes would have been marvelous in color and possibly helped to add to the movie. The Alfred Newman score was also very fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power never boring!","review":"Wanda Hendrix the the light weight starlet here. She was married to someone (can't remember now) semi famous.(Audie Murphy?) She ruins the picture for me and cannot play the love interest to the handsome, dashing Tyrone Power.

She overcame so much and yet her message becomes a cry to help all handicapped people become contributing members of our society without discrimination.

The threads are large and widely spaced on tripod screws and so the amount of force on the threads is high. The same metal casting is simply threaded and so it is too weak to securely mount a tripod plate.

Prodeje produces some of the banginest G-Funk beats to ever come out the west coast! Many of the beats are relaxing, so you know this one is for the rider in you. The SCC group album N Gatz we Truss was a dope album, but the producion was more polished and smoother on this one. Robert \\"Fonksta\\" Bacon jr. throws in those awesome guitar riffs like he does in SCC's albums and in Quik's works and gives the album a great vibe. Plus, Hav and prod tear up the mic. Who says that West Coast MC's can't rhyme? LV lays down some dope hooks. This album was well put together, adn it will show throughout. If you like this album, you'll definitely need to peep SCC's All Day Everyday; there is a similar vibe in that album.

The tapes that corresspond are a vital addition. The only drawback I can see, is this...there is an abundance of information that is not included on the tapes.

Also there are much better and dynamic shots of some of these budo masters that this film (because of copyright?) didn't make use of.

I've loved this band's emotion ever since Frogstomp, and each album has gotten better. Diorama is no exception! This is a beautifully crafted album, while rocking hard at the same time. For those of you who still think of Silverchair as \\"the little Australian Nirvana\\", get over it! They have grown up, found their own sound, and in my opinion, are better than Nirvana ever was. Silverchair is still around, and you need this CD! By the way, they have 2 other albums, Freakshow and Neon Ballroom. GO GET ALL OF THEM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, the wonderful melodies","review":"One thing is for sure, this Aussie trio has grown up. \\"Diorama\\" is an amazing album that is able to keep you interested the whole way through. From the moment the wonderfully orchestrated \\"Across the Night\\" begins, you are in for something you haven't ever heard before. Orchestras, extremely catchy melodies, and even some heavy guitar riffs make this an album you must have. Daniel Johns' voice is wonderful, his lyrics amazing, but overall it's the music that really grabs your attention here. Incredibly well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silverchair is still totally awesome!","review":"Silverchair is still a totally awesome band and the album is very much like the 1999 release \\"Neon Ballroom.\\" Daniel Johns has this amazing voice that you just can't help but turn your ear to the music when you hear it and the awesome music playing. The orchestra goes good with the music and the guitar and drum playing is just awesome. This is defiently another great album by a great band and I yet again, look forward to another cd because they are by far, my favorite band in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"payola alive and well","review":"I have followed silverchairs work from the very beginning,and let me assure you that they are DONE.This recording has absolutely no resemblance to the band I knew as silverchair.To ad insult to injury,every review of Diorama that I have read has been nothing short of the second coming.This absolutely assures me that payola is still very much alive and well in the music industry.If you liked frogstomp or freakshow,diorama will make you cry.I can even handle neon ballroom,but diorama sounds more like a jellifish recording than silverchair.Shame on all the reviewers of Diorama for touting it as silverchairs best effort to date.They must have stuffed all of that record company money in their ears,because they're not hearing what I'm hearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beter than Creed","review":"Well this cd is not any good. My cousin had me listen to this garbage bubble-gum pop that is so worthless, unlike the great grungde of the early 90s, which is when Silverchair's much better cd called Freak Show was made. That is my absolute favorite one because it rocks so hard (most of the time). I like Nirvana as well, and dumb bands like Creed and Metallica should stop trying to copy everything great grungde bands like this do. Those are two of the worst posers in the modern genere of rock and roll/grungde. But anyway this cd is alot like those morons from the Baskstreet Boys and stuff because they are soo boring and never ROCK and they never play their own instruments!!!!!! That is NOT ROCK, people! Get Freak Show or the first cd, which I own, and maybe Simple Plan too. Simple Plan is a great new band that sound a whole lot like Sliverchair but they are undoubtedly their own band in and of themselves. FREAK SHOW IS THE BEST AT EVERTYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a few things to say...","review":"damn! i have been a fan of silverchair since frogstomp and i always knew Johns could sing, but it always seemed to me like they were holding back. well not anymore! now i imagine some of the more hardcore fans of silverchair who drooled over past heavy metal songs like israel's son or pure massacre could be turned off by this album, and it was a ballsy move for them to put out such a theatrical ballad type album, but i highly commend them for it, and it's one of the best albums i've heard in some time. buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"underated","review":"What an underated non played beautiful album.

I bought all there 4 albums at once cause I got a deal from the store, a promotion for their new album. \\"DIORAMA\\" was an extreme let down. After \\"NEON BALLROOM\\" I was hoping for there music to continue sounding that good, \\"NEON BALLROOM\\" was amazing. But \\"DIORAMA\\" is something completely different, where as there other 3 previous albums were about being depressed and all the other joys of being a teen, they suddenly became a happy pop-ish sounding band. There were only 2 songs really worth listing to on that album, \\"The Lever\\" and \\"One Way Mule\\" the rest were just not really sounding like the chair I enjoyed listing to. Had I not gotten the other 3 albums with it as well as the limited edition single \\"Pins in my Needles\\" I would have not even bothered getting it. It's a great album is you like happy music but if you want to here classic chair music you'll not find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step in a really terrible direction","review":"Most of this album sounds like Johns (lead singer) has gone way too far in trying to make a middle-school slow dance album. Im dissapointed in the production by David Bottrill who also produced Tool's Lateralus which was earth shattering and might be the best produced album ever. Perhaps I dont know whats going on behind the scenes, perhaps Disney bought silverchair and told them what to play... who knows, its possible. I personally take offense to the review that compared the song \\"Without You\\" to Radiohead, it sounds more like Creed, and Johns stepped in for Scott Stapp (their drunken recluse singer). Anyways, Silverchair used to be kind of cool, even though there lyrics and complete ripping off of a Nirvana like grunge was for the most part mediocre. To top it all off, their album cover looks like a cool advert for a new mysterious kind of chewing gum. But Ill give them two stars, cause frogstomp was cool when I was in fourth grade!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What???","review":"I can understand that the grunge era has passed, but there are much better alternatives than [bad] pop music.

Bad not meaning good, I was hoping to listen to some real rock/metal Sabbath type music that Frogstomp was all about. I don't know what this is, their are violins or something on this disc. Do me a favor, don't buy it, get is used & then burn it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music From Start To Finish","review":"I was always a fan of Silverchair, and when I heard Neon Ballroom, I loved the direction they were headed towards. This album is exactly where I hoped they would go. Daniel Johns wrote most of the songs on Diorama on the piano, instead of of guitar. The result is a much more diversified sound, and it all comes together with a perfect blend of his roots and new ideas.\\"On our previous albums, I wrote very angrily about the darkness in this world. On Diorama, the clouds are still there, they're just beautiful now.\\" - Daniel Johns (Lead Singer)I can't describe the feel of this album any better than the man himself. If you like Neon Ballroom and the Dissociatives, this is a perfect middleground of the two, and in my oppinion, a big transitional step for Daniel Johns. Amazing music, my only regret is not getting it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is amazing.","review":"All I can say is that Daniel Johns is one of the best singers out there and this album is one of the best I've ever heard. It's simply just amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best I've Heard","review":"Silverchair's new CD contains the most beautiful music I have ever heard from a rock band. They go out on a limb and create something unusual. I think people in the states don't know good music when they hear it. Diorama is amazing and it blew my mind the first time I spinned it. Silverchair sound very mature and very polished. If you're an old silvercahir fan I hope you agree with me and if you are not currently a fan, just listen to the cd once and you'll see what I'm talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diorama-far from it","review":"I was extremly disappointed with this CD, Freak Show and Neon Ballroom were two AMAZING CD's, i don't know what went wrong, but Daniel Johns, my respect for you has dropped since I listened to this CD.

Even though they're all great this remains my favorite (even though I've only had it for around six hours). Silverchairs' sound has definatley evolved but you can still hear similarites all the way back to frogstomp. Part of that is due to the new producer, who I think used to work on the beach boys albums. Anyway, the band continues to add more layers of music, as hinted on in neon ballroom. The strings and horns sound great mixed with the standard insturments. The only reason I took off a star was because the track order was a tad bit off, and it isn't a stellat album like urban hymes. Needless to say I really loved this album and since I'm so picky about my music, that says a lot. If you preferred the softer sounds of freakshow and neon ballroom, this album is for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"You should buy it!!","review":"I've been hearing a lot this CD and I think it's very good, the best CD of silverchair's carrer!! it's a shame about Daniel the lead singer sickness, but anyway everybody should hear them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually deserves 6 stars","review":"How can I even begin to explain to anyone how awesome this album is? Silverchair has, over the years, become simply better and better at their craft, and has been able to change their sound more than anyone ever could have predicted. The grand orchestrations more than exceed those of many true classical pieces, and all just in the background of Daniel Johns' talented vocals and songwriting. Songs such as \\"Across the Night\\", \\"Tuna in the Brine\\", \\"Without You\\", and well, the ENTIRE album are great examples of songs that alone could sell a record, but instead you get the surprise of all of the songs being fantastic themselves. There's such a shift in styles all the way through, including an old-school one called \\"One Way Mule\\" that really gives Diorama variety that most other albums simply can't pull off. I would suggest this album to anyone who appreciates and supports true music. Also check out Johns' new band, the Dissociatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest View From Here","review":"First of all, I want to say...*stands up and claps* I know, I know, Silverchair is a punk/garage/rock band, right? Right. Even though this album isn't what Chair fans are used to, it's not necessarily a *bad* change. I'm so happy that this album came to be because it's nice to see that after all Daniel went through as an individual, and after all Ben, Chris & Daniel went through as a band and friends...they're finally all happy. I will reccomend this CD to anyone & everyone who likes music. I think that Diorama, from it's heart-felt \\"World Upon Your Shoulders\\" to it's rock-out \\"One Way Mule\\", is maybe not my personal favorite from Silverchair...but definitely an awesome album that I feel very proud FOR them having made."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an awesome cd!!!","review":"This cd is amazing. The guys in Silverchair are so incredibly creative and their music is spectacular. I never thought that they would top Neon Ballroom... but they did. This cd contains beautiful songs, love songs, happy songs, sad songs, agressive songs... it's such a wide spectrum of feelings. Diorama is the perfect name for this cd. Every song on this cd is great!My friend bought a bunch of copies and gave them out to his friends... \\"No one should be without this cd,\\" he said. I agree!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aging like fine wine","review":"These three Austrailian boys have really grown into their own. Reflecting heavily on what the Beatles did in the sixties, only quietly, they have put together an album for the ages. This really is a showcase of great accomplishment. Silverchair have finally gotten out from underneath the teen-aged shroud that has hovered over thier career.With well thought out lyrics and the Help of Van Dyke Parks on the production end of the music they have really stretched the boundaries of what they once were. This is a series of progressions. Each album they make gets more solid and entertaining. Diorama is a materpiece. Simply stated.Daniel Johns' voice is breathtaking and you can really feel the meanings of these songs. Buy this record if you have not gotten it already. I'd say it's The Beatles meets...well, Silverchair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orchestra rocks","review":"EVERY song is spectacular. Daniel John's vocals are absolutely amazing.

He is the gullible public's \\"musical genius\\", a egomaniacal dictator whose musical offerings have infested commercial radio every time his \\"band\\" releases its latest \\"masterpiece\\". Diorama, released in 2002, is complete and utter tripe, with second-rate melodies and pompous arrangements filling out its interminable 57 minutes. Johns' forays into grunge are offputting here, but it is the overwhelming pretentiousness which makes this unlistenable (the minor success is opener 'Across The Night'). Diorama is one of those releases which is easy to like initially, but forgettable for the more discerning."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the effort that counts","review":"In a media world driven by technology, We often run into lackluster music that has been generated by machines and is overproduced. Has real rock'n'roll become a thing of the past? Silverchair has lost it's credibility as a rock band and has become sadly enough, mediocre. Understandeably artists and bands mature and evolve, yet this seems to be merely a copout. The album of late, Diorama, seems overproduced and overscored. Although most fans hail this piece as being their best work it, in my opinion, their most commercial and lackluster effort yet. I wouldn't spend the twenty bucks on it...borrow it if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I should have known things were going downhill for this band when they produced a greatest hits album after only three releases.

Listen (you critics) to every album. You can't compare Silverchair to anyone, because they aren't like anyone else. They are unique. I never hear one of their songs on the radio without immediately identifying it as Silverchair. They have their own signature sound and it is even more evident here. Silverchair only improve with each new album. From the first song to the last, this album will take you on a journey of sound incomparable to anything before or since. If you want Nirvana, listen to Nirvana. I prefer something broader. I prefer Silverchair."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Words......","review":"I've never reviewed anything on Amazon.com before, but for years I've religiously browsed their archives for hours on end for reviews/opinions etc. This album changed my attitude however, as I simply must let everyone know, and help them to understand the sheer brilliance of this album. This recording is so far ahead of most of its other contemporaries that its just mind-boggling. Songs like \\"Tuna In The Brine\\", \\"Across The Night\\" and \\"World Upon Your Shoulders\\" and \\"Luv Your Life\\" combine Daniel John's awesome voice and their beautiful arrangements to a result of absolute perfection. As other reviewers have already said, this album just gets better with every listen, accomplishing Johnsies' aim of sending listeners' to a state of magestic harmony.

Two good songs would make a 45-RPM single, but the rest of MENLOVE AVENUE - rejects and demos from Lennon's ROCK N ROLL and WALLS AND BRIDGES albums - make for a forgettable LP.

I always picture John like some struggling musician playing old smokey west side bar, no one listening, he's just feelin' down in it some night. Mostly just John's voice dominating over the backing music, sometimes just piano. Oh how I wish there were more/any artists like this still around who could sing and song write, play the instruments. More than just a face dancing around to some stolen music they call there own, please.

We bought two 6L bags almost 10 years ago, and have used them very heavily in highly abusive backpacking settings throughout Arizona. I just replaced the hydration tubing once again, and guess what -- the new tubing sets still fit! They taste fine, even when hot, and pack well.Compare these to Camelback -- Camelback stuff works great when new, but how many cheap Camelback bladders have come and gone during that time? We've probably tossed a good half dozen of these, cheap, made-for-the-landfill consumer products during the same time period!We also use our MSR Dromedaries in combination with a First-Need water filter. We hang one bag up 10', then tubing for 8', the First-Need filter, then a short piece of tubing to a second bag. With this system, you can passively purify water without pumping. A very easy way to fill up on a fresh 6L of water in 2-6 hours!Anyway, Kudos to MSR for making a quality, tough, super long-lasting product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs cap retainer","review":"I travel the back country where we need to carry extra water at times. MSR Dromedaries are great. Arrived on time, what I ordered. One of their features is the three caps provide different flow rates.

Fabric seems extremely tough. It packs tight if you get any air compressed out of it. The various openings were useful though I don't think I have usd the 1/2-inch for much of anything. Perhaps my only objection is you must grab the base of the opening through the fabric with one hand while tightening the lid with the other. It is not a huge inconvenience, though, since I can still close it up with no spillage. I was worried about leaks on my first extended outing into the desert with it but I had no problems.

Two tracks later is a decent live concert medley of 'L.A. Woman', 'Nausea' and 'Lexicon Devil'.

Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Atlanta true crime","review":"I've lived in Atlanta for almost thirty years and was eager to read this true crime book. The author does an excellent job of detailing the history of African Americans in Atlanta and obviously did lots of interviews in order to tell this true story. He can't help it that ultimately one doesn't feel much sympathy for the victim, Lance Herndon. There were a few times when the organization proved confusing, but, overall, I enjoyed this book and recommend it to those who enjoy true crime books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redbone: Money, Malice and Murder in Atlanta","review":"Wait until this book comes out in paperback.

They are velvet all over making it impossible to go outside when wet or slightly wet. Also the rubber sole? It's a very hard rubber, there's no give. You'd be better off walking barefoot.

I was always disappointed by the mastering job on the original CD release. Too thin and flat. This release takes care of that. The sound is greatly improved. The bonus tracks are interesting also. George comments that the impulse to pare down some of the tracks was tempting, but he chose to remain faithful to the original mix. I am glad he refrained. I now await the reissue of the rest of the Harrison catalog this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"It doesn't surprise me that over 300 people have reviewed this album so far and the overall rating is a perfect 5 stars. When some of the most emotional and beautiful-sounding vocal work combine with a spiritual atmosphere which comes together on a rock and pop album, you have yourself a really great album.When some of the best-sounding guitar work and a consistent flow are also included, then this is probably the best album ever made. George Harrison was so underrated, and here's your proof. Absolutely own this wonderful 2-disc collection of great tracks. You won't ever need to hit the skip button. Every track takes you on a journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME ALBUM!!","review":"This album is really great. George Harrison is an awesome guitar player and a great lyricist!

Few people would have guessed that George Harrison -- the invisible Beatle -- had this kind of album in him.Sure, some of it is syrupy, even derivative, yet it evokes a time and place that has come and gone without many landmarks worth noting. Harrison obviously spent his one big shot at solo fame here.There are songs that can make me cry and wonderful shifts in tempo and spirit. Guitars are George's specialty.Spirits have faded a bit. Harrison's work seems less important now.

It's brilliant, society changing, and an expression of his deep felt love and gratitude for Eastern Culture and Religion. The modern and historical CD \\"All Things Must Pass\\" is simply brilliant... s.b."},{"rating":"1","title":"living on reputation alone","review":"After many years (+20) I've relistened to this post-Beatles extravaganza. In retrospect this album a) is way overrated with sloppy play and very pedestrian songs save the soaring \\"What is Life\\"; b) was in desparate need of George Martin as producer; c) has jam session that demonstrating George's solid rock chops but are embarrassing in simplistic structure - could have come from a bad McCartney album. Cloud Nine and the vastly underrated George Harrison (1978) have far more interesting songs and production."},{"rating":"1","title":"great music, horrible re-mastering/recording","review":"Unfortunately, my high-end system really exposes horrible sound recording/mastering on this CD.

Harrison can write some great tunes, but he is hit and miss--mostly miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatle George Why?","review":"No doubt that the four Fabs, using tracks from their post-Fab years, could have made one GREAT album that could easily rate with anything they did as a collective. None of the Fabs really made GREAT solo records; let's all be very honest with ourselves here.George said he had been sitting on a wealth of material that could not find the light of day, due to the intense competition of John & Paul. George decided to let it all hang out and fill up 3 albums of songs written while still a Fab. Three albums is too much! All Things Must Pass would have made a GREAT single album. We will never end this argument here :)All we can do is ask why in the world Georgie reworked \\"My Sweet Lord.\\" It is awful and embarrassing. I cringed when I heard it. But nowdays with a CD player you can program your own version of this classic album.One hopes Paul will not go back and diddle with \\"Junior's Farm.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have passed","review":"I like the Beatles, and I thought George's were the best Beatle songs. I like Concert for George and I like other people playing his music. After watching/listening to Concert for George, I decided to get a George CD to round out my music a bit.Read all the glowing great 5-star reviews for ATMP, and recognized a couple of the popular songs, so I figured I was in for a treat. However, as much as I hate to say it, I can't even give it an average rating. I've listened to it enough times on the way to work (and once at home during an exercise in music appreciation) to be caught by any catchy tunes or inspired songs, and I'm afraid there aren't very many. Yes, there is My Sweet Lord, Isn't It a Pity, What Is Life, If Not For You (isn't it a Dylan song) - and that's about it. I try to get into Wah-Wah (though somewhat muddled) and try to like some of Beware of Darkness. Beyond that it is a struggle to listen to, I'm sorry to say. (I ended up donating to the collection at work.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\" It;'s Johnny's Birthday.........\\"","review":"With the exception of Side 3, this is George Harrison's legacy. Although, I must admit, I did like the very short, \\" It's Johnny's Birthday \\". The rest of it, is really great music, from the at the time, the underappreciated member of the quartet. Nope, not Ringo."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 words... \\" Isnt it a Pity\\"","review":"This song alone is worth Ten times More than what the CD costs. Of course the whole CD is great ( CD # 2 is debatable ), But Isnt it a pity Has to to be the most sweetest, beautiful gorgous melodys i have heard in years. Its perfect. All things must pass confirms that George Harrison isnt and never was \\"The quiet Beatle\\". He was a talented and peaceful soul. That very soul was in every song on this CD. So, If you want to get in touch with the soul and many talents of George Harrison, Buy this CD. Its as close to his soul as you are going to get..."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's so fine","review":"A jewel of an album! Probably one of the best if not *the* best Beatles solo album ever released -- every song (not counting the instrumental jams) is a gem. The rerelease is fabulous - great remixing of songs, nice extras (esp. the \\"new\\" track \\"I live for you\\"), incredible packaging. A lot of care and thought went into the re-release -- it will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"harrison proves hes a legend","review":"at first i was a little leary of buying this albumn when i saw it but i am obssesive beatles fan and have bought all the beatles albums and john and paul solo work too, this is the first solo effort by george that i have bought, and it is fantastic from the great remastering to the great new take on the artwok it 5 stars plus all the way through, stand out tracks are Beware of Darkness,What is Life, If Not For You, and of course My Sweet Lord. the album is a must for a Beatles fan or a fan of brilliant songwriting. recommended to everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the extra tracks?","review":"All Things Must Pass is a great album. But I greatly prefer the wonderful, original album. The new isue adds several extra tracks, none of which I find very interesting. They seem to be just filler. And worse, by placing them in the middle they ruin the flow of the album, and make you listen to filler after filler to get to the good stuff. All Things Must Pass is a great album; you'd be much better served getting the original. The extra tracks version is 60% of a great album and 30% of filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my music!","review":"I'm so happy to be filling in my music collection now that the kids are grown I can! I'm very happy to have this to add to my Beatles Collection. I have always wanted this album. The CD's that I can find on Amazon all these years later are such a nice find for me.They want more words than I provide in a review but what more can I add?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously - this is a great record","review":"I'm writing this review for people like my wife: she knows the words to the songs, but she doesn't know titles, albums, even bands on a reliable basis. For all you people who like Eric Clapton, the Beatles, and Seventies' style rock, this album is a must-have because of the sheer number of great songs.My Sweet Lord, What Is Life?, If Not For You - all solid hits. Eric Clapton does great guitar work in this period, just before he goes off to cut Layla with Derek and the Dominoes. Songs like Wah Wah, and Isn't It a Pity, and All Things Must Pass are more great Beatles-esque pop that extends Harrison's legacy. This is arguably the best solo record that any solo Beatle put together.This remaster is great for the remastered jams and extra versions of the songs you already like! And for 18 bucks (for two cds), it's a bargain. If you don't know what albums to get, but you know what you like - get this... you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good material, bad packaging","review":"The recording is excellent; the quality is very good and the material is vintage Harrison stuff... well done. But why the bulky packaging? This two-CD set should be in a standard-size double-disc jewel case so it could fit on our shelves or in portable CD carriers. It's an important album for Harrison fans, but needs a better package!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this may be 1, but what would be 2?","review":"Another 'must have' would have to be his 33 1/3 album. Another collection of terrific songs. Plus the tone of the album is more upbeat than ATMP. I always get the feeling people don't know about it for some reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably the best solo Beatle album...","review":"In my humble opinion, this is arguably the best solo Beatle album (along with John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band). I think he had all this bottled up creativity that exploded due to his Beatle input being contained to only one song per album. In addition to being a phenomenal album, this re-release is remastered and repackaged with a very cool colorized cover. It also has 5 additional tracks including a newly recorded stripped down version of My Sweet Lord. And I forgot about the guest musicians! Check out this list...Ringo Starr, Jim Gordon, Alan White, Klaus Voorman, Carl Radle, Gary Wright, Bobby Whitlock, Billy Preston, Gary Brooker, Pete Drake, Eric Clapton, Dave Mason, Bobby Keys, Jim Price, Ray Cooper, Badfinger and believe it or not, even Phil Collins! Derek & the Dominos were formed from the jam sessions they had here. This masterpiece was engineered by producer extrordinaire Ken Scott as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually moving","review":"A very lovely message, reflective lyrics against a masterful backdrop of textured sound and silence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A veritable feast of melodic pop-tunery.","review":"It's very rare to play an album in which nearly every song is great (not counting the second disc, of course). Although George is a 5-Minute-Offender (someone whose songs far exeed the 3-minute pop song rule), this never really matters as his songs are strong enough to last up to six minutes, as some of them do. This album is one of the finest I have ever heard along with The Beatles \\"White Album\\", Simon & Garfunkle's \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" and Michael Jackson's \\"Bad\\" (no laughing at the back). Best song - \\"Isn't It A Pity\\", the Bond theme that never was. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few albums to live up to the hype.","review":"Whether or not this is the best Beatles solo effort is irrelevant. The fact is, you can't really compare them. They are all pop records, but, very different in presentation. George has presented a somber, melodic, spiritual side of pop that had not been seen before. The haunting vocals are astounding and would be unmatched throughout the rest of his career. However, the extra tracks are a bit unnecessary. \\"I Live for You\\" is a beautiful song which I can't understand why it wasn't included originally. But, the instrumental \\"What is Life\\" and the awful \\"My Sweet Lord (2000)\\" have no place in the album. Also, the instrumental jams towards the end do get tedious. But, considering that's the only complaint I have, I highly recommend this album. Trust me, you'll get hours of enjoyment from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Were the Best","review":"I remember when this album first came out on vinyl. I got my copy for Christmas. This was not just another album. This was something special. It was a serious cohesive collection of work that surprised many people. George was always my favorite Beatle and it will always be that way. I was more happy than surprised. This album was only proof of what many of us already knew about George. But what was more important was that George had it his way. \\"Beware of Darkness\\" was always my favorite cut. As for \\"My Sweet Lord\\" that's still George's song in my book. Goodspeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't it a pity","review":"Isn't it a Pity that George is gone, but his music lives on...I have the three albums and also have bought the reissued cd's. The sound quality is improved and the alternative and bonus tracks are solid additions. All things must pass is by far, the best solo album put out by any of the Beatles. The material is top rate thanks to great 'session' players (like Eric Clapton, etc...)and the only way the songs could have been improved was if the Beatles actually played them. After this musical statement, Harrison's musical output was spotty, with average albums that contained 4 or 5 great songs each. Then came Cloud NIne in 1987, which was more focussed and energized. This resulted in the two Traveling Wilbury albums that brought Harrison back again full cirle (musically, if not commercially).If you want to create a Harrison, post Beatles, discography you can not go wrong with the above selections. All things must pass is the cornerstone to any great musical collections.Thank you George."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something New Would be Preferable","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love the Dark Horse and all, but George: How's about coming out with something new instead of remastering 30 year old songs! My Sweet Lord 2000 is about as memorable as the Blues Brothers 2000. In other words, if you already have this album don't waste your money buying it again. I'ts time for us as music fans to stand up and say no to record company attempts to divest us of funds for albums we already own. When George comes out with something new, buy that. In the meantime just say Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"One perfect song","review":"Please don't get me wrong... I consider My Sweet Lord one of the greatest songs of George Harrison and probably one of the best songs in rock history, but I don't wish to get 2CD huge album just for this... I have ATMP on MP3, and unfortunately I don't have any wish to buy it in Audio Format... the whole album is just boring and you want to turn it off immediately listening to every song, but My Sweet Lord... which is the only song I listen to with great pleasure in this album... Get ATMP on MP3, and than consider bying it on CD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Sweet Lord and a bunch of B sides","review":"The star is for \\"My Sweet Lord\\", a good song. He always was good for a song or two per album. It would've been nice if the rest of these songs had been written (or more importantly sung) by real artists like John or even Paul. Sadly, George is in control here. Most people know the jams are a joke. At least they're a joke you don't have to hear in George singing voice. The Beatles were the greatest band of all time. The solo Beatles were great sometimes. Try Plastic Ono Band, Imagine, Milk And Honey, Double Fantasy. In that order. P.S.

The album consists of several songs that you will never get sick of. This is a CD that you will listen to many times and still feel the original pizzaz when you first bought it.

Bordering on dostortion. Quite a let down given the fine songs and monumental album it is. Audiophiles will not be happy here. The only song with a reasonable playback quality is \\"My Sweet Lord\\" the second take.Nothing new about poor quality recordings.

Yet \\"Ambient 2\\" contains some of the most lyrical pieces of the 4 album series.The chiming sounds of keyboard or synthesizer are played against either a silent background, fading into quiet, or against a low struck tone that hovers in the background. The feeling is of floating on a lake at night, with the dark bowl of the sky completing a sphere of velvet around you and only the glistening stars for companions.This is by far my favorite of the Eno collaboration albums in the series. Harold Budd and Brian Eno seem to, indeed, speak a new language that both comprehend and we can marvel at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aural bliss!","review":"I actually like this better than Ambient 1: Music for Airports.

However, I don't find it one bit better than any of dozens of other Christian children's CDs. So, I'd say they are at least double over-priced when compared to other Christian children's music CDs. [For example, for $19.95 you can get a 5-disc set, with 192 Christian songs, from Cedarmont Kids.

The ORIGINAL album is great but this remastered version is horrible. Yoko Ono has changed the album by taking the Apple Co. logo off the inside of the album. This was recorded while John Lennon was dating May Pang and suddenly one of the songs he wrote about loving May now has the words \\"Yo-Ko\\" chanting in the background. The most signifigant and disturbing alteration to this album is the removal of John Lennon's art from the cover. He used to have one of his original drawings on the cover but Yoko removed it. She also appointed herself as producer. WARNING! Walls And Bridges is a stellar stellar album but the original is better. The original was made by John Lennon and approved by him. Buy the colorful copy with John's artwork on it not the one with him and 4 sunglasses!

The cover isn't bad but you don't change album covers. Thats like changing a painting. I don't get Yoko Ono."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the Music","review":"Something that's never been said enough of John Lennon, if at all, is his musical ear. The arrangements on this album and the preceeding \\"Mind Games\\" suggest a complexity that even Lennon never credited himself with. This is a great funk and blues album in the 70's axiom. There are rousing horns and slick strings underlying the always melodic tunes. Lennon always maintained he was strictly a rocker with no more ambition than his inspirations, Elvis and Buddy Holly. But he clearly has the talent of a major pop composer, perhaps gleened from years in the company of the likes of George Martin, Phil Spector and, yes, Paul McCartney. (Suprisingly, this album is much more cohesive than McCartney's work of the same period.) With such great session musicians working with him, I envision Lennon working much in the way Brian Wilson did with his Wrecking Crew compadres in the mid-60's. The result is a strong piece of work with a singular sound and great, great songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little known classic","review":"I had this album on vinyl around 30 odd years ago. It was always a good album, but it sounds great thanks to thelatest remastering on the current cd. Mightn't have been as big a seller as Imagine at the time, it is up there with my favourite Lennon solo works, with some great songs and solid backing."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best Solo LP","review":"My favorite of all John Lennon's solo albums. The critics' favorites are his first solo \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and second \\"Imagine.\\" But on this album he is going back to the days when he wrote songs, you know, for everyone's enjoyment, and not to express his inner turmoil or songs he wanted to be anthems like \\"Power to the People\\" or \\"Give Peace a Chance.\\" Take \\"Bless You,\\" or \\"Old Dirt Road,\\" for example. Strong melodies, and John's voice has a plaintive sweetness to compliment the lyrics perfectly. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wait for the remaster","review":"Though there certainly isn't anything here as strong as Jealous Guy, Gimme Some Truth, or even Mind Games (except #9 Dream, which is CLASSIC Lennon), this is a fairly strong Lennon release. It details the anguish Lennon was going through during his separation with Ono. It also features his best self-produced sound (Mind Games would be a near-classic with a thoughtful remixing), so it should really shine with a good remix.Besides the brilliant #9 Dream, this has the number 1 hit Whatever Gets You Through the Night with Elton John, the sprightly Surprise, Surprise, and the beautiful Bless You, an aching ode to Ono. If all the songs were this quality, this album would be a classic, but......you can really boogie to Beef Jerky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hindsight....","review":"..makes this record better 27 years later.Even though the lyrics aren't among Lennon's best, the music is very melodic and interesting. \\"#9 Dream\\" and \\"Old Dirt Road\\" have haunting melodies, and \\"Steel and Glass,\\" though similar to \\"How Do You Sleep?,\\" is very stark and gripping.This set deserves a re-master. C'mon Yoko, get off of your duff and do it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Any one who enjoys the genius of John Lennon will enjoy this album.Ignore the naysayers who compare this album to his other work and criticise it because it is not the same. It is not the same because John did not want it ot be the same. It has deep background and heavy production because John wanted it that way.The ultimate artist, with a mind of his own, John created this album exactly the way that he wanted it. If that does not appeal to some, then they do not understand John Lennon and his genius...Buy it, listen, really listen, and enjoy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his finest moment...","review":"Hey, I think Lennon was brilliant, but let's face it - of his solo records, only Plastic Ono Band and Imagine are classics. Hate to say it, but the critics were right this time. I thought this and Mind Games were great when I was 12, but now in my mid-forties ... not so much. This stuff is simply boring. Five-star? No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny we hardy knew ye","review":"This album proves that John may have very well been the most over rated Beatle. \\"Whatever gets you through the night\\" is one of the worst songs he ever recorded-God only knows how it ever became a hit-perhaps it was some cosmic dawning of disco consciousness. I'd rather listen to \\"Who has seen the wind\\"!!! I once thought this was his absolute worst album-not counting garbage like \\"Two Virgins\\" and other unfinished music--but then he came out of retirement with \\"Double Fantasy\\" and \\"Menlove Avenue\\" Maybe we should have all been looking for clues on the Beatle albums that John was dead instead of Paul. How the mighty are fallen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hidden Lennon classic","review":"In 1974, John Lennon was separated from his wife Yoko Ono, and he became very depressed. In the midst of his depression, he was able to produce a few albums - the best being Walls And Bridges. John's performance on the songs is chilling, especially on \\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out,\\" which is arguably his darkest song. Although the mood changes from time to time, the pain is still evident in his voice in songs like \\"Whatever Gets You Thru The Night\\" and \\"Bless You\\".Most people don't consider this to be his best work, and it's certainly not above Imagine or Plastic Ono Band, but it is a huge improvement over Mind Games. If you are having trouble deciding which Lennon album to purchase next (and you already have Plastic Ono Band and Imagine), buy Walls And Bridges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Lennon Album!","review":"Walls and Bridges is a great album. I would actually give it 4 and one half stars. It doesn't quite equal Imagine and it isn't close to Plastic Ono Band. I would still reccomend, though. The highlights of the album are Whatever Gets You Thru The Night, What You Got, #9 Dream, Steel and Glass and Nobody Loves You. All the other songs are slightly weak, but still good. This is a great album. Buy It."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Weekend","review":"Recorded when John was separated from Yoko. When this first came out, the reception was warm, but not overwhelmingly favorable. Hindsight tends to make this album seem a little better. However, the music is reaches high points more often than not. Capitol should try to restore some of the sleeve elements to this package, as it contained a number of drawings made by John during his schooldays and the original die-cuts were a lot of fun to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes to Lennon remixed, remastered, O-no to the packaging","review":"A lovely CD restored to sonic clarity... from John's 'lost weekeend' period. He's Sooohonest, melodic and inventive. Lyrically he's emotionally generous (\\"Bless You\\")resigned (\\"Nobody Loves You When You're Down and Out\\"\\") self aware the 'Hatred and jealousy' section of \\"Scared\\") and what was a bit of a dull, murky original mix and pressing is now pristine. Bless Yoko for her stewardship of his aural catalogue but both of my thumbs down for her repackaging -- losing John's orignal cover of childhood drawings, and the disk graphics are maybe a bit misleading/self serving (John and Yoko's faces morphing, originally from the Sometime In NYC record; butthis was the lost weekend, and May Pang was in the picture as well.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail Lennon-Saviour of Rock and Roll in history","review":"John Lennon \\"Walls and Bridges\\" was great.This album was made at a time when Lennon's relationship with Yoko Ono had collapsed.1974 was a year of chaos and joy for John Lennon.\\"Wheatever gets Thru the Night\\" was a great rock dancer song(Elton John was colaboreted in this song playing keyboards).The supporting cast of musicians is too numerous to name, but there are two 'guest' musicians of note: Elton John and Harry Nilsson. Kudos go to Elton John for his role in getting John Lennon back on track and reunited with Yoko Ono.Hail Lennon, you are great.

Scams can teach you a very important lesson which is not to lie. Another connection I have made to the book is that I do things that I think I can get away with, but I really can't.I really like Mr. Schroeder's style of writing.

I have been pleasantly surprised with this toy. The actual assembly did not take very long (less than a 1/2 hour) except for the 75 stickers--that took over an hour. It does some very cool \\"stunts\\" like the car is shot up a ramp and down a track into a glider plane, which then takes off for a short flight with the car in it. It also performs pretty consistently. It is true that these little one shot stunts are all this toy does but they are pretty cool to watch. I do think the toy is a little pricey for what it does but at least I don't feel like I have a pile of junk to show for it like has happened with some other car track sets (including Hot Wheels ones)in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books on the power of your thoughts.","review":"I got my original copy of this book years ago and it has been a continuous resource and reminder to keep my thoughts at a high positive vibration.

However, my gut feeling response to this book was not so positive. I've read many books on the subject of what happens after physical death, but this one struck me as too smooth, too edited, contrived. The excuses made for Hitler's actions made me mentally gag - as if the horrors he created through his twisted mind were actually not his doing at all, but were somehow his father's fault. I will admit I didn't read the whole section dealing with this, only got through a page or so before becoming disgusted to the point of just closing the book, and eventually passing it on to another reader, without comment, who may see it in a gentler light."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY","review":"I really couldn't force myself to read all of this book. The parts I did read, I found poorly written and shallow. To compare it to the books of Michael Newton is like comparing a grade-school composition to a post-graduate thesis. I think Ms. Cannon is on the right track, but she needs a lot more background in the field of psychology and hypnotherapy for starters. I frankly do not feel she is doing her clients any great favors and I think a lot of her interpretations are not logical. I felt disappointed with this book and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Fiction","review":"I couldn't finish this book. It seemed like fiction to me. After losing my husband and son I was really looking for an intellegent book on the subject of reincarnation. This book was a real disappointment. Many of the author's hypnotic subjects have a suspiciously similar conversational style. Similar, in fact, to the author's own conversational style. While trying to read this book I actually became angry with the author for expecting the public to believe such nonsense. Fairies and Elves, come on!

I am aware of this line of thinking so it reaffirmed that belief. The book encouraged us to think about how we can grow in our life on earth. To look at events in life as a learning experience for ones self and those who are around us. I believe it did a good job encouraging us to not be judgemental to others or ourselves because it will look quite different in the spiritual realm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Pleased at all","review":"I got this shaver for Christmas after having problems with Braun's Synchro cleaner. After not shaving for a couple days it takes forever to get a close shave. It does eventually shave close but misses longer, softer hairs so I wound up with little hairs scattered all over. It also pulverizes your beard and redeposits the shavings on your face...this morning I looked like I worked in a coal mine after my 10 minute (yes...TEN MINUTES!) shave. The pop-up trimmer was also worthless trimming sideburns and trying to catch those missed hairs mentioned above. It's MUCH louder than my Braun, you can't shave with it plugged in...the only good thing about it is comfort..and if you have 10-15 minutes to shave it does eventually get you a close shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it. Not worth the price!","review":"I got this razor for Christmas in '06 and was excited about all I had heard about it. It does do a good job of shaving close and not leaving razor burn or irritation. The problem comes when you use it for a few months and the trimmer starts to pop up while you are trying to shave. I eventually (after only 4 months) had to remove the trimmer. By 8 months the foils were breaking down and getting gashes in them, and I don't press very hard when shaving. I emailed Remington's customer service 3 weeks ago with this information and have gotten NO reply. I would at least expect them to replace this razor with a new one since their beard trimmer is defective and pops up every time I shave. NO response as of yet. Bottom line...it is far too expensive for this type of failure and lack of customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remington MS-5100 Review","review":"Remington does not present a true representation of this product on the box. Namely, this razor will NOT run while connected to an outlet. If the battery runs dead, you cannot shave. Please note the amazon representation above that there is a 5-minute reserve battery is also false. Both features, the 5-minute reserve and the running from cord feasibility are both true only for the more expensive MS-5200 series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"When I first bought the Remington 5100 I was quite pleased - it cut well and gave me a smooth shave. However, it has this annoying habit of slicing through the foils after about 4 or 5 weeks. As it cuts through the foils it pretty much trashes the blades. I took it to a remington shop and I was told that this was ordinary wear - and so I can only report that Remington is not really very durable and is want of frequent part replacements. Good razor when its working but with a fairly high need for maintenance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"This razor barely shaves my face. I shave every few days and my scruff is rarely very thick but this shaver fails to get it. I have to use it for over five minutes to get a good shave but I don't since that long irritates my face. With my old trifoil razor I got much better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better shavers out there for the $$","review":"I received this razor several years ago as a gift. It shaved well, but it recently broke. The latch that holds the shaver head on is merely a 2 thin ridges on each side that eventually wore out. I attempted to replace this part by calling Remington. They told me no fix is available, and I must purchase a new razor. The razor was perfectly good up until this happened. So I followed Remington's advice, and bought another razor, but NOT A REMINGTON! My new razor (Norelco) is much quieter and has a lithium battery. It shaves closer (I feel) and is more solidly constructed. This razor works well but has design flaws. There are better razors out there for the bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, but you can still hear!","review":"I use these for concerts.

It was an indie release that took almost 2 years to come out on DVD, but it finally did and I couldn't wait to see it. The reason is simple, the amazing young cast. I knew nothing of the writer, director, or story, but I saw that they got every up and coming young star in Hollywood to star in this thing and that alone should have made it a good film. Unfortunately the story is very very simple. It's not a bad movie per say, but it's just nothing different from a thousand other films in the genre. The cast was great, but the film was honestly just done. There was no surprises, nothing especially scary or violent, it was just a very simple and familiar film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its definitely a B movie.","review":"This movie was ok but I would not have bought it if I would have seen it first.

Director/co-writer T. Oliver keeps you guessing, accomplishing some eerie moments and drawing generally good performances from his young cast. Vets Dan Gauthier, Christopher Atkins and the always welcome Barbara Bain are on hand in small roles.I liked the spastic wilhelm-scream spooks---they were pretty frightening.At first I didn't like the movie's ending but after more thought, I think understand what went on.Overall, FORGET ME NOT is a nice change of pace from some of today's more sadistic flicks--I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star bag of garbage","review":"Reading some of the reviews left me asking what movie did these people see that was so great certainly no this one.Acting poor and plot twist that left me askin wtf.Not scary poorly done waste of time"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and enjoyable reading!","review":"As a quick primer, I found this book to be terrific.

That is the premise of this book but it does not deliver in the way of sexual female domination. There are some scenes where the main male character is disciplined by the 'women in charge' but most of the book is about his sexual power over women and how women can't resist him. That is not FemDom.The book also targets Christianity with many references to a female Savior and a female religious structure similar to the Catholic church. This may offend some people.I read the entire book and enjoyed it in spots. It is a sexual novel with a little FemDom but if FemDom is what you seek, this book will probably disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"FemDoms: Don't Bother","review":"I ordered this book a l-o-n-g time ago and recently found it while cleaning my bookcase.

Her voice is sensational. Sadly, as with many great artists today, this album feels more producer/market-driven rather than artist-driven. I understand that Regaetton is popular right now. I would even understand including a few Reggaeton-flavored songs to \\"keep up with the times\\" (Shakira's \\"La Tortura\\" comes to mind). But who mixes two genres within a single song?!? \\"Soy Differente\\" flows perfectly as a salsa, until Regaetton beats come in. The style feels very out-of-place in this song, as in most other songs in this album. Maybe this kind of thing will work at a club, but not for extended listening. In my opinion, the producers are making this album more marketable while stiffling India's own style. I hope she will regain contol by the next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"La India","review":"Coghead (Brooklyn, NY): I understand how you feel, but we must understand that every artist must one: create his/her own style and two: they have to keep up with what is in style.

This CD is one of the best results of such obsessions - it provides a clever mix of angry music with bits of electronica, pop, and punk. Surprisingly enough, the results provides a feeling of sadness, one that only post-punk might create - and yet it classifies itself as rock.It's better if you understand Polish when listening to this cd because the lyrics are quite funny and depressing at the same time, a bit like those of The Cramps. On the other hand, the music itself provides the aura of romantic melancholy - a result observed with bands such as Depeche Mode.This is a CD for connoseuirs of weird music - but mainstream people might like it too, depending on how open-minded they really are. I recommend this CD as it is an hour of pleasure and sad happiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible performance by Oscar Peterson","review":"Low price or not, this DVD is worth every penny!

Not only is this extremely painful, because it causes the cuff to pinch your arm and cut off circulation, but it also causes error messages on the machine, comes out with irregular heartbeat reading (because it's not monitoring the heartbeat efficiently), and it gets shoddy results. I've tried to use it correctly, had this happen, and go to the doctor shortly after and found out that the results of the machine were completely innacurate.Unfortunately, the only thing I've found to do when this starts happening is buy a new cuff, since it is slightly stiffer and resistant to wrinkling and bunching when it is fresh out of the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood pressure cuff has an extra valve that leaks","review":"We have to keep our finger over the valve to keep it from leaking in order to use the cuff.

The cover of the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the U.K.\\" is well done, with Dave Mustaine adding a more disdain filled growl to the song that Johnny Rotten ever could, and \\"Mary Jane\\", \\"Set the World Afire\\", and \\"Hook in Mouth\\" are very well done as well. All in all, this is classic thrash at its' near best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their best","review":"When I first heard this disc I thought it was basically bad with a few good moments. However, now that I've listened to it for a while, I think it's basically good with a few bad moments. The opening blitzkrieg of 'Into the Lungs of Hell' and 'Set the World Afire' is a pretty fine opening for a metal record; 'Mary Jane' and 'Liar' are solid tracks, and 'In My Darkest Hour' is one of their very best songs ever. On the downside, the cover of the Sex Pistols' 'Anarchy in the U.K.' is rather poor, and '502' and 'Hook in Mouth' are mediocrities soon forgotten. As an example of the 80s Megadeth sound, this album is not as consistent as Peace Sells, which new fans should check out first. But for those who like the 'Deth style, this should be a welcome treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Megadeth masterpiece","review":"Much stronger than Peaces sells, So far,, is a good start to getting into this band. I recommend this over 'Peace sells' because the quality of the tunes is much higher. To my liking 'PS' doesn t even deserve a rating. Anyhow, this album is good. The entire thing is good. 'Into the lungs of hell' gets it off to an excellent start (instrumental), then Set the world afire bursts into awesome guitar work by D Mustaine and J Young. Anarchy in the UK follows; very strong and PUNCHY. Track 4 Mary Jane A +. Then In my darkest hour, 'liar' and hook in mouth. And lets not forget 502.A + album. I don think Megadeth reached the level of playing they did here. In Rust in peace they came close, but this was my FAVORITE Megadeth line up. Get this.Enjoy of course : )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"It's hard to imagine now that at one time Megadeth was considered underground. So Far so Good is speed metal at its best. Blazing guitar work, that went unnoticed by my teachers that were all trying to teach me jazz. Speed metal/prog metal brought great music to the underclass. However, to call Megadeth elite at this time is a non-starter. Their version of Anarchy in the UK rips to shards any document that would have you think that they are playing music for the complexity of it. Really, this is just Dave Mustaine playing another modern version of the blues. His predecessors were folks like Charlie Parker, Buddy Guy, and John Coltrane.In this way, I have heard blues called, \\"The motherload of music.\\" Almost everything, be it punk, which is ultra simple blues, to speed metal, to John Coltrane, pretty much all Western music grows as a branch from the blues tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked","review":"Awesome album made great by the songs 'Hook In Mouth' and 'Liar', truly superb tracks which go down as probably Megadeths finest work ever, only rivalled by the earlier album 'Peace Sells....'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underappreciated Megadeth album","review":"This is perhaps the most underappreciated Megadeth album, and for no good reason. The riffs are fast and hard, the drums aren't exactly the best, but shine on Liar, and Set The World Afire.

A lot of people say that Peace Sells is the pinnacle of Megadeths career; that album has never really cut it for me.It is on this album that Megadeth really begin to show promise which would eventually lead to them recording some classic albums such as Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction and Crytic Writings.My favourite tracks on this particular album are Anarchy In The U.K. a brillant cover of the Sex Pistols classic,Mary Jane with great guitar work from Dave, In My Darkest Hour one of Megadeths best ever songs and Hook in Mouth a fantastic piece both lyrically and musically. The weak point on the album is probably the song 502, although it could be said it is far stronger than some earlier released material and some of the songs the band have done in recent years.Whatever about the weak points this is a fine album and proves that there was life in Megadeth before Marty Friedman's arrival."},{"rating":"2","title":"No as bad as everyone says","review":"I really don't understand why people think this album isn't very good. It opens with the instrumental \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\", which has amazing energy, the goes onto \\"Set the World Afire\\", which comes from the angry Megadeth roots. The 3rd track is a waste I have to admit. They cover the Sex Pistols' \\"Anarchy in the U.K\\", which has no place on a heavy metal album. The fourth and 6th tracks (\\"Mary Jane\\" and \\"In My Darkest Hour\\") are written from the same riff, and they sound noticably samey. Back to the good points, \\"502\\" is a great track for driving, as it is about driving.\\"Liar\\" is my favourite song on the album, cause I love the opening riff. The final track is \\"Hook in Mouth\\" which is also one of my favourites because of all the insrumental bits, and Dave did a good job at writing the music on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angry thrash!","review":"While this album is probably the weakest album of Megadeth's thrash career, it still contains enough strong material to make it worth buying. \\"Into the Lungs of Hell\\" is an interesting, fast piece, \\"Mary Jane\\" is a great tune, has a lot of cool riffs, and \\"Hook in Mouth\\" is just hands down the most aggressive, powerful song in their arsenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE BEST","review":"People keep saying this is a great album.

I am not a fan of classical music. In fact, it puts me to sleep. John Stevens doesn't really have an excitement to his music. It's just plain boring, and uninteresting. I am really surprised that he got a contract. Classical music isn't very popular, and probably only a minority will buy this boring music. Sure, John Stevens is a nice guy, but I don't think that his style of music will put him on the charts. If you would like a GOOD CD from an American Idol contestant, just buy Diana's or Kelly Clarkson's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo, kid, terrific first effort","review":"I applaud any young person who loves this music and wants to help keep it alive; if he can sing, too, that's even better - and make no mistake, John Stevens can sing. Accept it that at 17, his voice is still, understandably, a little thin and underdeveloped - he brings to mind Chet Baker's breathy but very musical delivery, without actually sounding like Baker - but I have a feeing that when we hear him at 30, he's gonna knock us dead.Already, John has a ton of style, and a very sure footing in his phrasing.Listen to this record. Then listen again. The kid grows on you. Absolutely refreshing and delightful.Welcome, John.

I LOVE this song, and Frankie has made it what it is. This comes nothing close. Michael Bublee' does a much better version, very powerful and beautiful tone.

Potential buyers and/or listeners will do well to spend their time and money on Sinatra. If you must listen to a young revivalist attempting to prop up the genre (because that digital CD is so much cleaner than those nasty 50 year old recordings), at least listen to Michael Buble for his stong voice and interesting phrasings. But not John Stevens.On this track, his timing is terrible, his vibrato is reminiscent of Alvin Chipmunk, he fails to excite when the music builds (1:49), and he doesn't have the vocal power to get through the last big note of the song (3:09). The arrangement is boring as well, with an intro that sounds like it came straight off of a karaoke track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon Sold Me the Wrong Battery","review":"It is very annoying when a person types the name of a product in and gets multiple hits back from Amazon.

These are the parts that inspired Robespierre and Danton, Marx, Lenin, and Stalin, which is to say, the parts that are really significant and, unfortunately, enduring.This must have been abridged to give freshmen elementary education majors a bite size edition to discuss in class for a day or two; as for Rousseau's techniques applied to actual and not theoretical children, I know a two and a half year old who would chew him up and spit him out like creamed cauliflower, long before nap time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but overpriced","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter who is crazy about cats but isn't permitted to have a live one.

I expected to get food ideas and portion sizes, etc. and instead she wrote things like, \\"you can eat cereal, or hamburg patties, or pasta, etc. She never mentions what kinds of cereal or what kind of portion would be appropriate.

It gives the history going back to when white men first came and starting taking away the Indian's land. Facts are given as well as personal history about white man's continual illegal sly plight to get more and more of the land. When they finally placed the few Indians (left from genocide) into barren land, Mother Nature surprised them when oil was discovered there. Funny, sad, and pathetic were the tales told of what went on when suddenly poor Indians became rich. Good storytelling.

I had been very disappointed. Apparently the author's strength is on trading psychology, not technical/fundamental analysis. His so called foundational analysis is nothing more than a marketing name with weak TA and FA substance. All the worse, the chapters seem quite disorganised and badly written.

This was in Italy, so I took a gamble on it. About halfway into the movie, I figured the Italian boy was the man who dropped his espresso earlier in the movie. I even predicted the ending correctly. I honestly felt the movie could have cut out maybe 30-45 minutes (mostly the bigoted back stories). I felt most of it wasn't needed. I also felt that the nudity scenes had no place in this movie.

As ANY military member both active duty, retired or former knows, NO troops would hold the weapons as they do currently. The butt of the rifle was towards the deck, not on the shoulder duringthat time. I guess Spike Lee failed to hire someone who knew aboutthe military. The way that currently members hold the weapons was notactive until the first Gulf War (butt of weapon on shoulder, muzzle tothe deck).

Although I finally got a price I would except, I now feel any price is too high to pay for this movie in any format. Every aspect of this film from script to direction was lacking in so many ways you would believe it to be a television production from the 80's. I would have thought that a story of such historical importance would have been told with more passionate depth in order to rekindle some form of interest in the positive contribrutions of Black Men in America. Instead the amatureish acting coupled with the lack of drama failed to spark any interest in the events depicted int this film at all. Spike and all involved with this movie should have given more thought and heart to these men who sarificed thier lives so honorably in a war where our contribrution is but a whisper in the minds of those who were involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Spike Lee nonsense","review":"This movie was worse than bad. With a catchy TV trailer, I began watching it with some hope for entertainment, but walked away about halfway through it when it became evident that there was no value to be had whatsoever of sticking it out.

It seems like just because he is speaking another language, he is supposed to be interesting.The tall big 'chocolate' soldier begins telling stories to the boy, which is fine, but he talks to him like he is a child, and we have to sit there listening.

For a war movie I would've liked more battle scenes but the ones in this movie were well choreographed. Some gratuitous(and period inappropriate)nudity but overall I think Spike Lee conveyed that period quite well. Overall an engaging and entertaining story. Don't believe it warrants all those one star reviews, which seem eerily similar to those on \\"Red Tails\\" movie review sites.

I believe Spike threw this together in attempt to prove a point after blasting Clint Eastwood on Flags of our Fathers.Spike did the Buffalo soldiers no justice since this movie was more of an agenda of proving all whites are bad and cause wars. How about people in general cause wars, Spike?In my opinion, \\"The Tuskegee Airmen\\" movie, starring Laurence Fishburne, is a much better movie about real people who did real things.Yep, this movie is well on its way to the 99 cent bargain bin, but even then I wouldn't waste my money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A gawdawful mess, compounded with racist stereotypes","review":"The bloated, convoluted WWII flick makes no sense whatsoever. Nothing that is happening ever makes sense militarily or tactically, and the plot is silly nonsense.For none of the above reasons, however, would I bother to review this dreck. What greatly troubles me is how Spike Lee, a black man, depicts the black soldiers in this movie: cowardly, undisciplined, mutinous, hypersexual, superstitious, ignorant, contentious, sloppy, etc. What gives? If a white man had made this movie and drawn the black characters this way, he would be widely derided as a racist, and rightly so. Why in the world would Spike Lee perpetuate these sorts of racist stereoptypes about soldiers of his own race???This garbage deserves swift oblivion, and Spike Lee needs to do some serious soul-searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spike should have paid me to watch this mess!","review":"If I could give this movie a \\"0\\", I would! I would have thought that Spike would have matured and grown as a director but he still sucks as a director. This movie is an utter mess. Bad writing, matched with bad acting, bad music that did not match the scenes and actions - made this move a waste of my valuable time. I felt like I was watching his movie - \\"She's Got To Have It\\" again. The actors spoke (lines and phrases) as if they were in THIS time period, not in this war time. The Germans did speak German very well but I believe the force and brutness of the delivery was not there. So many things about this movie is not accurate and just distrubed my movie watching experience. I believe this movie was directed by an amateur. Spike Lee couldn't direct himself out of the bathroom, let alone out of this movie. If you rent it for $1, you would have paid to much. Save your time and your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed & Insulted","review":"Positives:(1.) ???Negatives:(1.) Disjointed storytelling with poorly constructed flashbacks (everyone's currently popular cinematographic technique to showoff cleverness).(2.) Stereotypic characterizations with sophomoric scripting.(3.) Cheaply constructed military & war effects e.g. military uniforms that look as if they were cleanly pulled out of museum storage each day; cigarettes & munitions that last forever despite long term isolation from supply support.(4.) Worst of all was that the important story of black WWII infantry was turned into preachy propaganda & simplistic absolutes that do not permit the audience to be thoughtfully educated but instead to be insulted as if they were moronic simpletons."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I'm a big fan of WWII movies and the previews made this one look like it would be good.

Except Genesis has a huge repertoire of titles. Was final fantasy 4 too expensive with the franchise still in partial swing? Very dissapointed, should've paid closer attention to the line up.

No problems with the interface or difficulty levels, just that many of the games seem just thrown in there, they call this a favorites collection.

The original (non-widescreen) video of the video games is kept, and there is an option to use the original video size, fit the video on the screen keeping the aspect ratio, or to stretch the video to fit the entire PSP screen (I think a widescreen version would have been nice for some games like Sonic the Hedgehog, but that's no big deal). Also, the menus are good.This game seems to sell for $19.99 in stores near me that carry it.

The detail was amazing, as was the history of the American plant dating back to George Washington. I learned how to grow ginseng and prepare it for sale. I also found a list of businesses that sell the seeds to get you started, and a list of buyers who will purchase all the ginseng you can find or grow. The color photos were a real help. Best of all, I found over $100 of ginseng while hiking one day. What a trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wealth of Information","review":"This book is really in depth. I would recommend this read to anyone trying to get into Sengin or just wanting to learn more about the plant. A couple of the old timers around where I live were impressed by the book's information.

Don't know if it helped them step up their game but it is definitely worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite cd","review":"I had never heard of Lake Trout and bought it after reviewing the first three songs, and it is a great cd.

I read lots of books, but not usually romance novels - thought I'd give this a try, due to the location and since I had met the author, yadda, yadda, yadda.Although the locale and time period were very much of interest to me, the rest of the book was pretty much horrible. I was quite surprised to hear everyone else rave about it. The book is choppy, at best and makes for a very long read.I have read other romance novels since, so I can conclude that it is not the entire genre of romance novels that turns me off, simply this particular book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like romantic music and piano this CD is for you.","review":"Clayderman is a master with the piano.

Overshadowed by such 5-star masterworks such as Only The Lonely, Wee Small Hours, and Songs for Swingin Lovers, \\"Point of no Return\\" stands as Sinatra's final Capitol triumph. The burnished qualilty of the voice - no ring-a-ding-ding here - is surrounded by tastefully lush arrangements. (No over the top Gordon Jenkins strings). When the World was Young is a gem....not to mention gorgeous, classic versions of I'll Be Seeing You, September Song, and Sinatra's only (? someone correct me on that one if I'm wrong) recording of As Time Goes By. Play it again, Frank. (Well, I guess that was the genesis of Reprise Records but that's another review.....) \\"I will find you in the morning sun, and when the day is through...I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing you\\". Sorry.....Matchbox 20 doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful songs & arrangements","review":"Despite it not receiving critical acclaim upon it's initial release;this is one of my favorite Sinatra albums. The arrangements are by Axel Stordahl,Frank's first arranger/orchestra leader from back in the 1940's. This is the perfect album to listen to on a rainy, stormy day. Just kick back with a drink and a good book with this playing in the background and you are all set for great relaxation. Frank's version of \\"These Foolish Things\\" is the best around;as well as his version of the other classic tunes here. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vastly superior sound of a classic","review":"When \\"Point of No Return,\\" Sinatra's farewell to Capitol, came out almost everyone was startled and appalled by the dreadful sound--so muddy and muted particularly in the mono version. Here was Frank singing gorgeously in a program reflecting his keen knowledge of popular music and his exquisite taste in material with Axel Stordahl's swoony arrangements and it all sounded buried in six feet of water. Well, that's been corrected here as much as it could be corrected and it sure makes a difference. It says so much about Sinatra that he gave Capitol for its last Sinatra album, issued when his own venture on Reprise was well underway,a real classic. It's just a gorgeous piece of work start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I downloaded this book for my Kindle 2, and was unable to see any pictures on it.

It deals more with JFK style theories of what could have been, rather than what it really was. In the end, it falls short of its goal of debunking the resurrection accounts.I wish the editors would challenge William Lane Craig and Gary Habermas to an extended (3-day or more) debate on this subject.

Not likely, given the evidence to the contrary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date Before it Was Printed","review":"While there are those who would give this 5 stars even if it featured nothing but dancing elephants, those with any amount of knowledge of the present state of scholarship will find these essays somewhere in the range of speculative-outdated-appalling. Cavin -- the man who invented the \\"Jesus had an evil twin who faked the resurrection\\" theory -- makes for an intro that may as well have come from Acharya S. Martin and Drange need an education in how an honor and shame society worked. Derrett? I wonder how he gets away with an argument that amounts to racial stereotyping (\\"Jews are good with money\\") in this day and age.

I could have bought 2 Happy Meals or a frozen piece of meat, but what I got was a horrid, rancid comilation of Pretty Boy S**T! This doesn't even deserve 2 stars but I'm nice. There is one decent song on this album, Saturday Night in the USA, which to some may be worth $18.99 but it was definately not worth my five bucks. The \\"untouched\\" part of these \\"UNTOUCHED STUDIO DEMOS!\\" really shows. On many songs you cannot hear the vocals, the drums sound like plague-ridden duck being beaten with a pretty boy stick. Leather Boyz is a great song, but this CD destorys it. ALSO! I could sue the label for displaying 15 tracks on the cover when there are actually only 13. They left off 2 songs without even changing the art! In my opinion, Pretty Boy Floyd rules, but dont buy this CD. Get 2 happy meals instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!

They're a tough sell when it comes to books. (They're against them.) Still, I thought these kids might be interested in the one book that defined gothic horror, a genre much beloved by teenagers today. Forget it. They hated it. What was spooky to Walpole is hokum to youngsters who consider The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre one of the Ten Best Movies Ever Made. In desperation, I tried to teach the book as an example of 18th century camp, but campiness isn't a concept a 15 year old appreciates. Can 60 tenth-graders all be wrong? Yes, of course they're wrong.

As such I guess it should arouse some mild interest. I suppose it can be seen as a real creative achievement since it's not derivative of anything except for ghost stories and Shakespeare.It is NOT particularly entertaining for its own sake. Pioneering as it may be, it is nowhere near as exciting or interesting as many stories that owe it something. The language is stilted, characters flat, and plot ridiculous and at times hard to follow.

This book is an inspiration to the art of cheesy writing, with silly visuals (a Monty Python opening involves a large helmet falling from the sky and crushing a weakling boy on his wedding day) and horrid dialog \\"Alas! Help! Help!\\" this book had me both laughing and bewildered.Remember two things when considering this book, Walpole published it himself (we call that \\"vanity press\\" now) and he didn't take credit for it! He published under pseudonym and claimed it was a translation of an ancient text, thus twice distancing himself from it. Only after it sold did he admit he wrote it, then claimed his own genius. Though, as a new work, critics that found a translation interesting soon realized this \\"modern\\" work was in fact, bad.

The only problem is that the writing is rather too romantic- it's a bit florid and there are loads of exclamation points, and the people address each other as 'thou' and they put 'est' and 'eth' at the end of verbs. It's written very conservatively, meaning that there's nothing extra- everything written is directly related to the story.

It struck me at first as one of Anita Brookner's less successful efforts, a novel that made me understand why she has her detractors. But I kept reading and am glad I did.The ending is powerful, disturbing and shocking, pulling the slow opening into focus. The psychological nuances are eerie, yet we know as the story ends that they're not only possible, but true. This is one of those books that makes the implausible absolutely true and inevitable. Dolly is a tale of love and symbiosis and as elegant and frightening as the work of Henry James."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneering precision of perception at work again","review":"What makes Brookner such a tremendous writer? For one thing it is her style. She has a brilliance and precision in language second to none. She has a psychological understanding which is subtle and refined. Through this she creates characters who prove there are many different ways of being absolutely disappointed and frustrated in life. This work contains many wonderful elements. One is the description of the marriage of the narrator's parents, a marriage of two souls in perfect calm and harmony. Another is the description of the early years of the title- character, Dolly. Brookner makes even the most minor characters interesting, and gives us insight into areas of human life which no one else does. She is a pioneer in psychological perception with an exquisite sense of beauty and a remarkable feel for the language.

Yes, it's that bad. The Polly Anna gets slapped on so thick, the prose reads more like a movie treatment written in the past tense than an actual novel, with all the summarizing, summarizing, summarizing. J.L.'s laziness and lack of depth murders what could have been a truly epic masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the first half, but fizzles.","review":"I agree wholeheartedly with the review here by Phil Thwing. Essentially, the book starts out in classic Zelaznyish fashion but suddenly shifts over to something else about half way through. Very disappointing.

Days after finishing this novel, questions still race through my mind. This novel raises deep philosophical and theological questions. Not a first for Zelazny, whose Amber series speculated on the nature of reality and the location of the true template of existance. Once again, we see the forces of order and chaos in battle, but this is a much more reasoned and thoughtful story, and it asks questions that need raising about the path of our technology and how it relates to humanity. A powerful ending to a phenomenal career. Mr. Zelazny will be missed, and Ms. Lindskold did a superlative job in bringing this nearly lost work to us. If it were not made apparent on the cover, I never would have suspected that any talent other then Zelazny was at work here.

I can't even begin to imagine what possessed them to put an LED of that power on a tiny little USB hub, but I don't really need confirmation my hub is working from 3 miles away.

They include a stick-on foam strip to help keep the hub attached to the base, but this is clearly an after-thought to correct the problem users had with the hub slipping out of the base. I ended up setting the base aside and just using the main hub component. Oh, and it also failed to work!

This is a great powered USB 2.0 hub with 7 ports which I have setup on a MacMini. I like the blue indicator light which seems to be on all Apple peripherals these days. The hub is made of metal with a solid feel which sits securely on the desk, unlike other plastic molded hubs which bend and twist depending on the connected USB cords. I ordered 2 more for a PC desktop and laptop.

I like the aluminum finish, & the weight of it. I also like the option to plug it into an AC outlet & make it a POWERED USB hub. This is important for many peripherals. The blue light on top makes it easy to find, but is verry bright at night, almost like a blue flashlight shining a cone onto the adjacent wall. The unit easily slides out of the aluminum \\"base tray\\" if needed. This is my only caveat with the unit. I wish it had a way to lock the hub into the tray so it would not be so easy to slide out when you don't want to remove it.Overall, I am well pleased with my purchase, & would definately recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly, but ...","review":"Plug everything in and it works!

Its sturdy slim elongated aluminum case construction gives it some weight and durability. Mounting screws and bracket (included) provide a means for securing this device to a desktop or like I have done, to the side of my desk where it is out of the way yet still very accessible. The great thing about the mounting bracket is that you can slide the hub out of the bracket at any given time when you need to. There are four ports to the rear and three in the front.

I don't think it will budge unless I forcibly move it.I like the fact that it has some ports in back and others in the front, so I can use the back ports for stuff that stays plugged in all the time (such as my printer) and the front ports for things I plug and unplug frequently (such as my digital camera, iPod, etc.).It works just fine, and even looks kind of cool, so it's getting 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice little 7 port USB hub","review":"This hub meets my needs. I read the criticisms in other reviews and I see the same things. But, they are easily solved by the suggestions given in some of the reviews:1. The unit slides freely in the supplied bracket. The easy solution is to put a piece of double sided tape (the thick, spongy kind) on the bottom of the bracket, but leave the film on the top sticky side. Then slide the unit into the bracket. It is nice and snug but can still be slid out if needed. I'm surprised the manufacturer hasn't figured this out!2. The power light is extremely bright. If this bothers you put a piece of tape over it. It's bright enough that you should still see some light through the tape.Other wise this product has worked great. It's compact, has ports on the front and back which means you can put your printers, scanners, etc... on the back and your iPods, cameras, etc.. on the front.

Wiggling it sometimes helped. Apparently I am not the only one who has had this problem and I attribute it to poor quality control of either the socket or its soldering to the circuit board This part takes a lot of stress as the power cord is plugged in and out of the hub, and needs to be strengthened.The problem can be detected by removing the USB connector to the computer, to be sure you are running on the hub's own power, and then wiggling the power plug on the hub and watching the blue power light. Often it will be off as soon as the computer is disconnected, and wiggling it reveals the intermittent nature of the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I spent a few hours looking for a hub which was compact, powered and aesthetically ok.

I have purchased all albums that have come before and since that fabulous CD, although none stand out more than it does. Its been several years since DG has released anything new, and I was so excited when I heard a new album was on the way...until I heard it. I think it is WAY too over-produced, and it is almost a betrayal of the mellow, low-key sound that thousands of DG fans around the world have come to know, love, and depend on for years. By far, I think this album is his worst yet vocally, lyrically, and musically. I hope the classic DG sound I am so familiar with makes a resurgence on his next album. There are a couple songs that are pretty good in and of themselves, such as Aint No Love and The One I Love, and Nos Da Cariad is very beautiful and interesting. As a whole, tho, this album sounds very discordant and mismatched."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd buy this, if it weren't for the Copyright protection","review":"I am a HUGE David Grey fan and was really looking forward to purchasing this for not only myself but also for two others on my X-mas list.

I can honestly say that it is excellent. \\"The One I Love,\\" \\"Nowa and Always\\" and \\"Life in Slow Motion\\" are even better than I was expecting.However, actually being able to listen to this CD has been an adventure I was not expecting. Fortunately, I decided to check out other reviews on Amazon before sending in a repair request to my IT department staff to replace the CD ROM in my PC. I now realize that there is nothing wrong with my PC/CD player. Seems like rather primitive strategy on someone's part to limit access to this beautiful music.

I have over 1000 CD's and do not mind supporting artists, but I refuse to pay for a product and then be told when, where, and how I can use it. This is essentually what companies like Sony is doing and since I can't change their policies I choose to boycott this practice.

I actually like this album a bit more than his last one. The good thing about DG, I've noticed, is that you can't go wrong with his music. Even if you're disappointed and expected/hoped for more, you're still getting quality music. This album is good. It's not fantastic or spectacular, but it's good.I will say I appreciate his approach on a lot of these songs of starting the song slow and building it at the end, almost as if he takes a shot of coffee and really gets into the song.

Other highlights are: Lately, Slow Motion, and Ain't No Love.I see this album as Lost Songs meets New Day at Midnight minus cheesy electronics (i.e. 'Caroline').

He owes it to me for slapping together this blob of nothing CD. White Ladder was deep, dark, meaningful, painful, and cathartic. So, of course I couldn't wait for his next CD to come out. This is nothing like what I expected from Gray. Where is the moodiness? Where is the lyrical rain storm? True, most of White Ladder consisted of 6 chords, but the THEME and the FEELING were uniquely his. Life in Slow Motion may be better produced and have a fuller sound, but the entire CD is flat and boring. The only song indicative of Gray's previous performance is Disappearing World. One down... NINE to go. If you are a fan of White Ladder, make sure you get a good listen to this CD before you decide to purchase.

SunnComm's only suggested way, to rip and encode the songs for use in a MP3 player, is using the inadequate software provided on CD. In doing so you end up down sampling the audio quality twice (once to wma then again to mp3), resulting in poor sounding music files.I have a collection of hundreds of LEGAL CDs, which I encode into a personal (read not shared) music library to enjoy as I please.

It illuminates one way of relating science and mysticism.

For instance, the Buddhist belief in causation dictates that he rejects randomness in evolutionary theory as \\"unsatisfying\\" (p. 112) and insists that there must be \\"hidden variables\\" at work in quantum mechanics preventing randomness(pp. 47-48) -- two keys to contemporary science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compassionate and Openminded","review":"'The Universe in a Single Atom', where do I start?

The Dalai Lama makes some exquisite arguments that imply a greater strength of reasoning with the symbiosis of the two desperate modalities. This book clearly demonstrates that each ideology (western science, eastern introspection) has their own distinct merits but that both methods are required if the aim of reducing or eliminating human suffering is to be attained. His Holiness treats the reader to some snippets of Buddhist thought, and I must admit, it is far more complex and rational than I ever suspected.

The whole idea of the FBI doing this, or handling the case of Buddy Aces in such a manner was totally absurd. Further, that the mob would put a hit out in such a fashion as this is counter-intuitive. Nowadays though you have to be willing to sacrifice reality in order to enjoy yourself at the movies, but Smokin' Aces crosses the line in my view. The plot is videogamesesque. The acting was not a problem with the exception of Ryan Reynolds who was just awful as the (semi) main character. His Agent Messner was a serious drama queen and difficult to watch. As for Ray Liotta, why can't he find stronger films?

The storyline is about as unorganized and confusing as it gets, because the entire first half of the film is nothing but one nonsense barely-understandable segment after another, while the second half is a small improvement with lots of violence, gun shootings and blood to bring the viewers back from their sleeping state.Looking back however, it's just a failed attempt at an action movie that tries *so hard* to be entertaining, but the constant shifting around from one segment to another makes it almost impossible to enjoy on any level. Maybe it has some funny segments (such as the kung fu fighter striking near a guys face, and another segment involving a guy playing with a dead guys face) but overall, these funny segments just make it harder to take the action parts seriously, and it wasn't good enough of a movie overall to take seriously in the first place.

The writing was superb, the visuals were mesmerizing and the nods to other genre movies made watching them over and over again fresh and fun.This movie did not have a well written script and it showed. Some of the ideas were not bad. A collection of oddball assasins all trying to take out one mob informant and the violence ratcheting up to an absurb level could have been slyly amusing.

Alicia Keys is beautiful, but her acting was horrendous. She used the same expressionless face and the same flat, raspy, expressionless voice throughout the entire movie.

Smokin Aces is a very funny and very exciting film to watch. However note that it is not for children with many adult situations and adult humor.

The critics trashed it and it is much better than critics would have you believe. It is a violent, visceral old-school movie about a mob hit on a small-time Vegas hood.

The book is quick and easy reading and spans only 210 pages.The stories are varied and cover not just traditional firefighting. EMS, fire marshals/investigations as well as airport crash fire and rescue are also included.The problem with this book is it was written by three journalists. It is not historical or scholarly text.

I don't need to pay $6 for 13 pages of reviews that I can find for free on any number of travel websites, and certainly don't have to pay $6 for reviews of the Hard Rock Cafe and Planet Hollywood. Some of the write-ups on attractions and local restaurants are ok, but again, nothing I didn't find on other free sites. And only 2 reviews of hotels out of the dozens in the area.

The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint).

Of all the flavored cookie inserts I have tried, there has never been one that he doesn't like. I usually put one flavor in one side of the Everlasting Treat Ball and another flavor in the opposite end.

Instead of biting the ball, she licked the treat till it was soggy and then just took it out and ate it.

They aren't really \\"everlasting\\" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in theStarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large.Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.Third: These are probably the least repugnant smelling of the discs, to me, anyway. It just smells like chicken broth when the dog gets going on it.

Although the book does avoid the typical \\"add a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup\\" for the most part, which is a nice change, nearly all the recipes still call for some kind of starch to make the sauce thick: tapioca, cornstarch, flour.

Hint #1: just putting the carb count on the recipe, without modifying it to actually make it low-carb (like, I don't know, maybe taking potatoes out!) does NOT make it a cookbook for low-carbers.I'll give just one example: the Dijon Pork Chops call for a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and potatoes to create a recipe with 39 carbs per serving. Unbelievable! Just for comparison, the two chop recipes in Dana Carpender's200 Low-Carb Slow Cooker Recipesare Tangy Pork Chops for 11g carbs and Mustard Pork Chops for only 4g carbs.

I would not consider these books to be Star Wars novels. The characters were Hamblys own, not the characters that we all know. The only things that remained were the names.

I thoroughly enjoyed Darksaber, it at least kept me wanting to read after the first page. I picked up this book expecting Luke and Callista to encounter eachother more througout the story. The least Hambly could have done was kill off Callista. And enough with Leia always being the brave and heroic one! Give Han and Luke a chance to show that they can be brave without being wussies.

If she really loved him, it wouldn't have mattered if she was powerless or not. What the heck happens to Leia? She gets kidnapped....BORING! I can't believe I spent over $20 on a book that SUCKED so bad. Hambly couldn't write worth beans. Stop writing \\"Star Wars\\" stuff, lady.

The way that Leia was supposed to be utterly defenseless was crap and the Droch thing was the saddest attempt at producing an enemy that I have ever seen and then Callista showed up and was all weepy cause i can't feel the force and If i can't feel the force I can't love you Luke ifelt like puking this book is not worth the paper it is printed on and barbara hambly should NEVER NEVER write Star Wars!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it at all","review":"As far as Star Wars books go, this ones rates as second-worst only to The Crystal Star. Improbabilities, characters acting out of character, and the return of Callista -who wasn't a particularly interesting character the first time around. Plus the villain itself wasn't particularly believable. All in all? I would advise any true Star Wars fans to avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have know better","review":"After reading Children of the Jedi I should have known better than to read this one. The pacing was horrible. Would of literally burned the three books in the \\"Callista\\" trilogy if it wasn't for Darksaber because Kevin J Anderson understands how a Star wars book should flow. Barbara Hambly just didn't seem to know what to do with the universe she was trying to write in."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic is too nice a word to describe this book","review":"This is quite possibly the WORST Star Wars book ever written. I love SW and everything that has to do with it but this was horrible. The plot was generic the charachters were shallow and lame and the writing was childish. If Luke is such a great Jedi why is he constantly getting into so much trouble? If Palpatine wanted to wipe out all the Jedi why do there seem to be tons popping up all over the universe? One or two is understandable even likely but a HUTT? They are note exactly known for being quite and hiding out especially when they have something great like jedi powers? When oh when will someone who knows the SW universe write again? If you want to read good SW read Stackpole, Zahn, or any of the other X-wing series. For any true SW fan only read this book after you have read the others and only to keep the continuity going."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book ever written...","review":"I hope whoever determines whether or not a book gets the Star Wars seal of approval NEVER again lets Barbara Hambly get one. Her depiction of the Star Wars characters is weak at best. The storyline wanders around. Her writing is terrible. In short, if you are a Star Wars fan like myself, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I read this book almost a year ago and frankly I can't even remember what happened in it. I'm very glad that I can't remember what happened, this book was horrid. Don't even bother reading it unless you are a huge Star Wars fan and even then you may not want to. All I remember is that I had to force (no pun intended) myself to get through this book and that the whole thing was boring. Spend time reading Zahn's works if you want to enjoy some good Star Wars, because Planet of Twilight is totally lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow beginning, but a great book","review":"I don't know why everyone hated this book so much. The beginning was a little laborious, and I wish C3PO would be deactivated in ALL star wars books. Anyway, this book does focus more on the cerebral aspects of the characters, especially Leia and Luke. Large amounts of the book deal with the Force and Leia's growing knowledge of it. It is a good book because it's star wars. If you're looking for a fast paced action novel, go elsewhere.If you want a decent well-formed story that comes together pretty well at the end, then this one is recommended. There are also some new characters that are interesting,but the evil Dzym is one of the best of the \\"non-movie based\\" characters that have been introduced in a long time. At least borrow the paperback and give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...","review":"What an imagination!I loved it and those who fell asleep... well there's no telling about attention span, you must have had the last drops of the bucket!I congratulate her for daring to do it a different way.

I think it's about time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Barbra Hambley's writing skills?!","review":"I really enjoyed Children of the Jedi. I found it very interesting. SO WHAT HAPPENED!? Planet of Twilight was creepy and gross. What's up with that drach thing? I would not recommend this book to anyone but die hard fans, and only then because it is still a Star Wars book. Just not a good one. If she writes any more Star Wars books, they just better not include drachs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not up to the standard of the star wars universe","review":"Looking at the reaction of most readers it would seem that i must be an oddball. This book just as \\"Chidren of the Jedi\\" is boring, lacking excitement and never get the pulse going. As with \\"Children\\" i struggled all the way through this book. The chapters are way too long just as the previous novel was, at 20 to 30 pages a chapter this is not a pick up and put down book, it is a journey that never seems to end. I wish everybody could be a Kevin Anderson or Steve Perry and such like, but it seems that it is not just possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellant book overall, lack of originality in some areas","review":"This book, which I had the honor of reading before it was released to the general public, is different. The long dormant sentien life form, lacks seriously in orginality. Though Callista's final sacrifice provides a fitting end to her character, said as it might be. Leia's part of the story though is, as in the \\"children of the jedi\\" ver confusing. Likewise Luke seems to whine more, yet his jedi powers seem more than before. While the story itself is very enjoyable, its continuity is lacking. The purist will like it only for its clearing up of a major issue. The rest will enjoy it for its story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hambly Screws Up Again!!","review":"This book was just like her other one...she trys to make it more interesting but fails utterly. I disagree with the review that ddeboe@juno.com said about the difference in writing style. The truth is: SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO WRITE A SW BOOK! And if ddeboe was hinting that Kevin Anderson is not a good writer than he/she doesn't know SW from Star Trek. She portrays Luke Skywalker as someone that has just learned to use the Force. I should know, I have read over 30 SW books and most were good. But Barbara Hambly is the most distinquishable black sheep of the flock. From my stand point, she should be removed from the SW writers' list and put in some other writer. The only reason that i gave it 2 stars was that the plot was well built and Leia finally has begun to use the Force. Overall, if you can avoid buying it, do so and borrow it from someone or the library. This is a really boring book that drags out for a long time. But think about what you like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars?","review":"The story itself was tolereable if you could get past the bore of an opening long enough to realize this was a Star Wars Novel. One word for Barbara Hambly: WIT. Star Wars characters are witty. That's part of their appeal. One more thing, we should have dropped Callista off in Darksaber."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T READ IT","review":"Arguably the worst Star Wars book, EVER!!!! It starts. The begin is a conference, THAT NEVER ENDS. It description is excellent, but...too...long...and...boring. This book would probably be better if they shortened it a hundred pages or so. This book is a disgrace to the Star Wars Universe, and should never have been written!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I WOULD RATHER **** LEAD THAN READ THIS PATHETIC BOOK","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read, ever seen or ever heard. Quite simply Hambly watches to much Star Trek. The book gives Star Wars a bad name almost as if Star Wars was a movie made to sacrifice human souls for Satan. The only good thing it has done for me is put me to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm kind of neutral on the whole thing, but...","review":"personally, I didn't like Planet of Twilight just because it doesn't seem to line up with all of the other stuff that is out there. It just seems to be little details of continuity in the writing that keep me from liking the work. Hambly can write well, but flowery, descriptive sentences that go on and on (early on in the book I think there was a sentence that took six lines to painfully unfold), is not what the typical Star Wars fan is looking for. We are used to seeing the story unfold and move at the speed of light in the Star Wars books and it just doesn't happen here. As with her other book, Children of the Jedi, I find myself falling asleep much more quickly in my pre-bedtime reading ritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ecellent sequel to Children of the Jedi and Dark Saber.","review":"I like all of te Star Wars books but I paticulary like thisgroup.

Shield your eyes from this awful book!","review":"When someone writes a Star Wars book, you would think that the book would be about the Star Wars characters. Unfortunately, you're wrong in this case. This book is bad, really bad, with a terrible plot, sappy characters, and a forgetable ending. The reviewers who gave this book 5 stars must be reading something else, because frankly, I can't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time....","review":"The universe of Star Wars is a great place to be, with books and movies to help take you there. This book shatters that nice universe. While BH might be a good writer of her other books (I've never read them), her writing some of the books of Star Wars is an example of how badly we need some new plots, and better writers. BH seemingly does not know how to handle more than one person in a book, this entire book is about Leia. Throughout this whole book, everone is off doing something by doing nothing. I counted only once where Luke used the force, and at times where he could have used the force to help him, he would have these little excuses to the effect of: \\"I can't concentrate\\".There are a few good parts in \\"Planet of Twilight\\", but mostly you are waiting for them to happen. So if you are a fan of BH, buy the book and form your own oppinion of it, but if you are a fan of Star Wars, reread the Rogue Squadron series until the next Star Wars book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn-O-Rama!","review":"Just about the only good thing in this book is the return of Callista. It was good to hear from her again,but she really wasn't the same character. Han Solo was off doing something else and his part in this book was otherwise secluded. I can only remember about three of the original characters ever meeting at the same time. The book went by so slowly that many times I spent hours trying to understand only one chapter. The main character was Leia and it might as well have been titled \\"Small Book of Leia.\\" All of the others may as well not even been mentioned in this \\"book.\\" They weren't mentioned that much anyway. Action was rare and had no background. It was every bit of a waste of my time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was so dull!","review":"After reading about five other SW books, I was eager to try this one...but after reading about 30 pages, I already realized that this dull book had a weak storyline, zero action, no excitement, and nothing to make you want to get other people riled up about it.The book starts out with someone totally unfamiliar dying. Hambly introduces a bunch of characters and doesn't even explain who they are, where they came from, and what they're doing. And the drochs! Who ever thought of those? They're some creepy thing? If you want creepy, check out The Truce at Bakura! The drochs are totally un-scary. So if you're a *very* true SW fan like me, don't waste your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty dull","review":"This is not a Star Wars book.

With the latest batch of one volume tales, a small crisis happens, someone goes to investigate, they uncover something that could destroy the universe and the New Republic, all the main characters get together, Luke usually gets injured, and they overcome insurmountable obstacles to save the day. Well, this book is the same thing. About the only thing that was even interesting was Leia and a Hutt having a lightsaber duel! Stick with the X-wing books and/or the original Zahn trilogy. Zahn's newest book also shows some potential to break out of the mold. Of course, if you've got a friend who bought this, go ahead and read it, but I wouldn't bother reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say?

The action sequences (when there were any) were terrible. The plot was pretty improbable, but occasionally I found the plot to be half way decent, kind of like those old B movies. The problem was that some of the characters acted inconsistently, or they failed to act in character. Leia in particular bothered me, she was incredibly indecisive. The way characters interacted was also questionable, and the dialoges were often iffy.

I found myself flipping to parts with Han or Leia. I don't really know how it ends because I gave up once I read about those disgusting 'drochs'. The plot was a mess, the characters seemed to have lost their personalities (poor, poor Han!), and when Callista (who I can't stand from Children of the Jedi) showed up, I couldn't stand it anymore.

The only reason I was able to read it until the end was because it's a Star Wars book. I've got A LOT of problems with this book, but here are just a few. 1) It's too disjointed, bouncing between characters to the point of confusion 2) It isn't consistent with the other books. Luke is made into a relative weakling in terms of the for. One small example: Luke's starfighter crash lands, and his locker is jammed shut. Not only is Luke not strong enough to open the locker physically, the force also fails him, and he doesn't think to use his lightsaber. A small detail, but important to real fans of the series. 3) Plots involving Callista and Admiral Daala are wrapped up too abruptly, too conveniantly, and not realistically.

And to add to the experience, the proof-reading of this edition was very poor - typographical errors were frequent.So, I'm forced to report this was a real disappointment, to me anyway - and I warn others accordingly.

Its tunes are brilliantly orchestrated (piano, strings, sampling), poppy enough that I can't help singing along but not sugary sweet (isn't it unfair that Britpop is like doves, Blur, Echo, etc while American pop means Britney and Backstreet?), and so deeply textured and layered that I still notice new intricities in the music as I play the cd for the 200th time, especially on headphones, another way to appreciate the cd.

It is worth mentioning to, that the bonus tracks are not simply fillers or throw away songs, but among the best songs on the album.

Up until this latest product, I enjoyed seeing the improving quality of his stories. More than Courage however does not reflect a Special Forces A-team. The members of a real team have much more experience then reflected in Coyle's characters. The inclusion of Specialist and an inexperienced officer as part of the team goes beyond fiction. He could have accurately reflected an A-team and still tracked along the basic plot. I recommend passing on this book and hope his next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"I literally could not finish this book; I stopped after exactly 100 pages.There were too many technical flaws that anybody familiar with the US military and its special operations forces would be able to point out. I felt like I was reading a Hollywood manuscript...that's how technically inaccurate it was.Sorry, but when it comes to military books, suspension of belief is not in my vernacular. The author obviously did very little research in writing this book. His editor should also be ashamed as I found a couple of proofreading errors within the 100 pages that I read.Although I feel bad for giving this book a review without even having read the whole book, I cannot bring myself to read a book on military fiction that is technically inaccurate with proofreading errors.I suggest the author research his material better next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research and attention to detail","review":"Harold Coyle should do better research about Special Forces and ABN units before focusing a novel on them. In the past I have toughly enjoyed his novels, but this one was annoying. 1st LTs are not XOs on A teams. Warrant officers fill this role. You have to be a 1LT (P) to even apply to Special Forces. Spec 4s are not on A teams either. These oversights may seem minor to some but Coyle lost his credibility with me in first 20 pages. The rest of the book was painful with more technical oversights and failures in proof reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccuracies ruin a good storyline","review":"I have enjoyed Coyle's books in the past. However, I found too many technical flaws in this story to really get into it. From the start, the make-up and equipment of an ODA (Special Forces 'A' team) are completely incorrect. You will not find an ODA run by a junior liuetenant or captain, nor with Spec-4s as operators. The senior NCO is likely to be an E8 (master or first sergeant) and the other members will be E6s and 7s. Even to such trivial things as the terminology of the M-2 machine gun. It's a \\"Ma Deuce\\", not a \\"Ma Two\\". Much as I tried to just go with the story, I seemed to find myself saying \\"Well, that's wrong\\" about every other paragraph."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Coyle Actually Write This?","review":"I am a huge fan of Harold Coyle but this book reminds me of the junk books that Tom Clancy continues to spew out. I find it hard to believe that Coyle even wrote this! There is little character development and the story line is sporadic at best. Getting thru the first 100 pages can be mind numbing and doesn't get much better after that. This book is a huge disappointment for the Coyle fan and one would hope that whom ever ghosted this book for him goes away and he once again puts pen to paper. Don't waste your money on this unless you plan on using it to start a fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Than Courage","review":"I have read almost all of Harold Coyle's books and have always looked forward to them. This book was a tremendous disappointment.It contains too many technical errors and improbabilities. The Land Warrior system really was an underplayed segue within the story, and the two system experts were both exposed to combat. In addition, the editing job was a disaster. I found four errors, and I am sure there are more."},{"rating":"2","title":"TEN Stars and not just for diapers","review":"This is a bit of an odd review, because I have given these as gifts to new parents, because they make a diaper do double duty. But I also have bought some to use as cold or hot packs, because when I wet them and either place it the freezer to get cold or in the microwave for one minute, they do a better job that the more expensive cold/hot packs I have bought at the drug store. And a friend told me they are great for washable menstrual pads.

One of the features that I liked so much was the thin body and the narrow face. I have a thin wrist, and many men's watches bother my wrist after a few hours. This light weight of this watch is a nice change.After reading the problems that people had with the crystal cracking, I am pleased that this has not been a problem yet even after a few accidental whacks. The watch arrived in working order (no dead battery) and I like the look. Clean, subtle, understated style.My only knock is that I can see that I will need to replace the band within the first year.

I had it about a month and wore it nearly every day when I noticed that the rubber bands which were at first neatly concealed, began to shred and break - thus poking through between the bands which make up this otherwise charming piece.Also please note that it is 'silver tone' - NOT sterling, so it also tarnishes easily and can cause discoloration of skin in metal sensitive wearers (like myself).I stopped wearing it due to the unsightly rubber strings poking through.

My Town Car has a 4.6 liter V8, and the exhaust note is now much, much louder, but not like an old truck. It's more of a very deep, base-like rumble.

I bought the original LP in 1980, and was so eager to have some of the songs on CD, I had a friend record a couple tracks from my vinyl copy onto a CD: \\"1980\\" is that good. But since April 2005, with this \\"two-fer\\" series, we now officially have it on CD. And as I've mentioned the first album on the disc, \\"Energy to Burn\\" is certainly no slouch and kept the momentum going after their successful \\"Do it (Till You're Satisfied)album (1974). Also check out Rhino's excellent \\"Best Of\\" compilation CD (1997).

The same free mp3 files are available via a number of other sites too. So if you buy this, you are basically paying $19.00 to someone who has taken these free files and put them on an MP3 CD for you. If you are tech-savvy enough to know what to do with an MP3 CD (it won't play on most ordinary CD players, only MP3 CD players), you probably also know how to download a file from a web site. So why buy it?More importantly, Amazon sells a professionally recorded version of this book (with all apologies, it's better than the Librivox version) at a lower price.

Since then, I heard Rimsky Korsakov's Scheherazade and I was impressed for its melody as well as its oriental feeling. I remember well that one fine day I saw this picture: The song of Scheherazade at the movies. I was still a boy but I said to myself that someday I will have it for myself. I had to wait more than 30 years for that moment. When the commercial videos started, I went to video stores and always asked for the release of this film. It wouldn't happen until last year when I finally saw the pre-sale in Amazon. Now, I think that it worths to wait for something that you want. This movie has spectacular colors, incredible coreography and, mainly, the beautiful music of the russian composer Rimsky-Korsakov each moment.

This was their first album of original material when they became a trio. I liked this album because their music style was unique and true to themselves. They were not trying to be commercial, they just played their music the way they wanted to.Their other non-commercial writing style album was e pluribus funk.Their latter albums were produced too highly with the influence of being commercial because that is how they made their living after their legal battle with their first producer. So to alleviate as much unsurety as they could, they hired commercial successful producers.This album is probably the best representation of what kind of music grand funk railroad is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Know","review":"Tinny and hard to digest, the lone worthy track , ( I'm Getting ) Closer to my Home, is cool enough for me to give it 2 stars.

Your better off buying the albums seperatly, and for Amazon's price, your better off buying The Single Collection.Only cool thing about this box is that it contains the original Finnish release of Razorblade Romance, which is something you don't see too often anymore.

There comes a time when Gilly can no longer sit still and do nothing, and she starts out on her own to right the wrongs she is sure are happening.\\"Gilly\\" is a delightful book that takes place in the pre-civil war days of our country.

They are hindu squats, hindu pushups, and the neck bridge. The other exercises in the book are ones you probably did in grade or high school. His tapes are not any better.

What makes this book useful is the routines and the motivation. Furey challenges you and verbally pushes you, it always picks me up when I feel like skipping a workout. It has good cross training- road work conditioning programs that give you some place to start. The book is a bit pricey, but its the only volume I would recommend. Furey's other products, in my opinion are overpriced and really don't deliver much. Stick with this book and a jump rope, you should have everything you need for a great workout week in week out.

Lanita was faced with several obstacles and disappointments that led her life in so many different directions, but she didn't let that stop her. Lanita was a good person who made good and bad choices, but she seemed to make choices out of love. This novel was a great trip down memory lane as well. I'm several years younger than Lanita and this novel gave me details about several events in our history that I hadn't known previously. Even though I got a slow start, I ended up really enjoying the book. I'd recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This lens in just ok. It is a little soft at the edges and at wide apertures. After using it for a few months I sold it to buy a Canon 17-40 f/4 L. The Canon is a stop slower and a couple hundred dollars more, but the images are sharper and it is weather sealed. I would invest the extra money in a Canon lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sigma lenses","review":"Quite a sharp lens, did some very good shots until I replaced it with Canon 16-35 f/2.8. Overall I was very happy with it, the tiny little problem it is a very fragile lens (like most of Sigma lenses), and it needs a very special treatment, also the size of the filter is very big, makes it very expensive to buy 82mm C-PL for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid...","review":"Long story short, avoid this lens. I went through two copies in two weeks. Both had focus errors on my Mark IIn and my brother 40D.Sorry, just not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sharp as I'd like","review":"I love being able to get wide angle shots, and I had high hopes for this lens. However, I have yet to get a crisp, sharp image out of it. I've had it on both auto focus and manual focus, on a tripod using a remote shutter release and mirror lockup, and still only ever get slightly hazy or blurry pictures. I'm not sure if I have a bad unit, or it's a problem with the design, or I'm just not using it right. And, alas, it's too late to send the lens back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lens!","review":"This is a great lens. I really have nothing to add here from what the guys before e said.

You could get the Canon for $400 less than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"If you are going to buy a sigma lens any sigma lens.. you are wasting your money!!

The lady that leads them is a little weird, though. Sometimes it sounds like she isn't sure what she's talking about.

The velcros were very visible and shabby-looking. And when you use the extension band on it so you can wear it on your upperarm, it looks more ugly. The extension band looks like an afterthought expecially since the extension band that came with mine wasn't even the same color are the band itself (the main band was charcoal gray and the extension band was light gray, silver almost).Sad to say, I don't think I will actually be using this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaky connections - don't buy these!","review":"I don't tend to be picky about headphones or speakers, but these are terrible.

She was excited to play with it right away, but still doesn't understand they are beads. She will get it sooner or later. The first one I got was missing a couple beads so I returned it and got a full one. They all fit just right in the container, but you can't store the scoop there too. The lid doesn't come off easily, which is good and bad. My daughter can't open it herself and pour it on the floor, but if she closes it while playing I have to help her open it. Some of the first set was rubbed off too. It looks like maybe someone opened it, played with it and returned part of it. Overall a good quality toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful album","review":"hitomi's talent is not at question; her lyrics, melodies, and vocals are top-notch as usual. Since her debut in late 1994, she has written all of the words to her songs, at the encouragement of Komura, her producer.

The Album starts out by picking you up real high with their bad a** title track, Extreme Aggression. And then pritty much drops you to the floor from there. Some Pain Will Last, will leave you breathless with the genius Kreator expresses in the opening of the song. And Extreme Aggression's solo will tear you a new cornholio. You can buy this album, but I don't recomend it. I'm going to still keep mine because I really only liked the first couple of songs. After that I just have to turn it off. You should at least buy it for those songs and the fact that its Kreator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure total aggression","review":"This CD is what turned me onto Kreator. It lives up to its title. It is Extreme Aggression at its finest. this is the kind of CD you tear down someone's house with. this is the kind of music you listen to while driving 95mph on the freeway. it is pure, aggressive and raw. they were metal in its purest form before it was bastardized by all other forms."},{"rating":"2","title":"directed at the '99 review by 'a music fan'\\\\","review":"Like one reviewer pointed out, up there with Reign in blood as one of the best thrash efforts ever produced.

This isn't one. Forget the fact that the author provided WAY to many details on caving. The fact that Joy and Gabe never talked really got to me. All they did was dwell silently on the past and what the other person MUST be thinking. Ask for heaven's sake! You aren't mind readers. I listened to the book on tape only to kill time while driving. I don't think I would have made it through by reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointed","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape of this book and was thoroughly disappointed. The author spent so much time and too much focus on cave exploration and not enough time on the relationship of the 2 main characters. I was bored after the first cassette, but I tried to continue listening to the remaining 5. After the 3rd, I gave up. Unless cave exploration is your hobby and you have a passing interest in romance novels, I advise you to take a pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged out and kind of silly!","review":"If you have read Elizabeth Lowell's books before you kind of know what to expect (crossed lovers, misunderstandings) but this book seriously drags out the miscommunication and the whole \\"he loves me/ he loves me not\\" situations. I skipped trough about a third of the book, I felt so many chapters were just fillers and didn't really add to the plot or development of the characters. Towards the end they have supposedly cleared all their misunderstandings, yet they're still fighting about the past (what?). I guess if you really want to read it, look for it at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lowell's best","review":"Though I'm often a fan of Elizabeth Lowell, this wasn't one of my favorites. Much of the plot revolves around caving, and Lowell obviously did her research. However, she included so much detail - such as a description of every item they packed for a caving trip - that the story often dragged and at times I resorted to skimming. There is also an awful lot of blame and moping about a past misunderstanding, and often I wanted to yell at the characters, \\"Just talk about it already!\\" Real people might behave as foolishly, and the continued misunderstanding is necessary for the plot, but it's a problem when most of the secondary characters are more likable than the main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh... pick another Lowell","review":"The two charcters hated each other. They were so mean and nasty. It just wasn't enjoyable. I really like Elizabeth Lowell, but this was a disappointment. Pick another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not This Time","review":"I didn't know this was a re-write till I read some of the other reviews. I always look in the front to find the publish date and it seemed current. I haven't finished it yet but I got to say I got tired of being beat over the head with the alleged abortion issue. Lowell must have mentioned it at least 50 times in the first 100 pages. THREE times on one page. I got the message already! The caving doesn't sound interesting to me at all. I will stay above ground thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!","review":"What a waste of my time and money. I felt nothing for the plot or characters.

Based on the book itself, I would have to say that it's excellent--well-researched, very informative, very well-writtten. I couldn't find any other book on the market that offers this comprehensive and in-depth directory of Asian trends and phenomena. This book sold out in bookstores here in Singapore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book attempts to cover culture in ALL of the countries of the \\"far east\\", and in doing so has no depth or substance on any one topic. It also has no suggestions for further reading if you are intrigued by a particular topic. A much better book along these lines is the JAPANESE POP CATALOG which does contain fascinating detail, though admittedly it \\"only\\" covers japan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Funnest Books I Ever Read","review":"Kudos to the editors and writers at A.

All songs are in Bad Boys Blue style - greate dance melodies and love lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Disappointing Introduction To Bad Boys Blue","review":"I have downloaded various Bad Boys Blue songs over the past few months trying to decipher their exact sound. I have heard that they are a group from the 1980's, so I was a little sketchy about them as I hate '80s music. However, after hearing some of their excellent songs like THE POWER OF THE NIGHT and SAVE YOUR LOVE '99, I was sure that they could not make a bad song. So, without hesitation I purchased their newest album release, \\"Tonite\\". What I found was one good song (S.O.S) out of the entire album. The rest of the album's songs sound like regurgatated '80s tunes with absolutely no flair or orgininality. I was extrememly bummed when I realized that this album was a complete waste of my time and money. I am not dissing the \\"Boys\\", but this album was weak! I hope that in the future they can put a little more effort and enthusiasm in their projects. They have good stuff, but this album just a'int it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whatever you might think, the boys are back!","review":"Anyone who thinks this is not a good album needs brain surgery. This album has stayed in my CD player for a week and will not move for another two! Bad Boys Blue have been one of my favourite groups for 13 years, and they still show many Eurodance pretenders how it should be done. Where do you think the idea for that pathetic effort from Mel C came from?The best tracks are \\"I'll be Good\\" and \\"Take a Piece of My Heart\\", both fine examples of the talent that Tony Hendrik and Karin Haartman have shown BBB over the years. Fair enough, there's a couple of cheesy tracks on the disc, but hey, it's not a perect world!The simple statement is this: Buy the album if you like Bad Boys Blue and the trend (Europop) which THEY created. Also buy it even if you've just heard of them and are feeling curious. To not like this album is sinful. Well done guys, from a BRITISH fan! Can't wait until the next record is out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD!","review":"This is an excellent CD! They have done a really great job with this album.

It takes place in Cornwall and the Scilly Isles in Roman times....The story, characters (very well formed) and plot/sub-plots are rich with detail.

First-rate sound. First-rate material. And Crosby sounds as good as ever. Even though these songs were put on tape 25 years ago, they sound as if they recorded in the last 12 months. It you're going to have only on set of CD's by Bing, this is the set to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Bing Crosby collection. Super!","review":"This material was recorded around 1975. That means excellent sound. And the orchestrational backup is first rate - witty when appropriate, and mellow in the ballads (never schmaltzy). The voice is that of Crosby at the end of his career. But he handles his instrument so well that you never think you're listening to someone who's \\"over the hill.\\" He makes every song a delight.It seems that most reviews I come across extoll Crosby's material from the 30's and 40's. While his voice may have been in its prime then, I find the backup arrangements out-of-date and the sound grungy and faded. This collection has the Bing I enjoy listening to.I have a lot of Crosby on CD. This collection is the last one I would give up. I know this is a 3-CD set, and not cheap, but nearly every track you hear is a \\"keeper.\\" This is one collection you'll never grow tired of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Often Better Than Earlier Bing","review":"People can say what they want about Bing's voice in his 70s, but I think it was a wonder -- much better preserved than say, Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald in their '70s. This CD features some of his best work from that late period. Amazing, to me, that he recorded so much during the last few years of his life. The arrangements here are never overbearing, nor as dated as some of his older works. They were recorded well, and have been remastered perfectly. My only qualm would be that the original albums were not put together in that order. But this is still a set for ANY Crosby fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep you money","review":"Got this for my Grandson and it is poorly designed...zipper catches on the plastic divider inside.

Here she interprets the works of Atahualpa Yupanqui - an indigenous poet of the southern Andes. These songs are so profoundly intimate (if you understand Spanish), so heart wrenching, so intensely beautiful, that I can only listen to this album in absolute and total privacy because tears are likely to be rolling down my cheeks.No fancy synthesizers, no fancy arrangements. Just simple folkloric instrumentation and the most beautiful folk songs I have ever heard. This for me is Mercedes Sosa's crowning achievement. Nothing else she has done reaches to the sublime heights of beauty expressed on this album. If you understand Spanish, get this album and you will treasure it for the rest of your life. If you don't understand Spanish, consider learning it for the sake of the sublime poetry contained here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you could ever want from a CD","review":"The incomparable voice of Mercedes Sosa paired with the beautiful songs of Atahualpa Yupanqui.

I even got a couple comments by people asking me if I'd been in Florida recently(I live in PA). It works fast, and it looks natural.

I was perhaps a bit more cautious than recommended and only used very small amounts on my lower arms at first. After three applications over three days, I found that the \\"tan\\" was very natural looking. I then progressed to my face and legs and received many compliments about my \\"vacation-look\\" tan!

It might work for some but it didn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is NOTHING Gradual about this tan","review":"I am a very pale person, so I thought I would try this product as it clearly stated that it was to \\"build a tan\\", that it would not streak or turn you orange. WRONG!!!! There is NO WAY this gradually adds colour to your skin. I am BLOTCHY AND STREAKY AND ORANGE!!! Even the girls at the Tim Horton's drive through noticed how bad it was (it is so bad I am using drive-through because I wont get out of my car)I did everything I was supposed to, I used exfoliant made specifically by Neutrogena for pre-self tanner, I used a downward motion to apply the creme, I even let it dry properly,but having my arms and legs propped up and letting it airdry for 45 mins (although it says it dries in 5).It may work for those who are already dark, but 100% did not work on me properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Rock !!","review":"This is the music that I listened to during the college years of the mid 70's.

Oh My God is an all out rocker that opens the disc and is one of those songs you can't get our of your head once you've heard it.

I was in a Christian bookshop in Chelmsford, England, and this CD was playing. I was going through a tough time in my personal life. Then \\"A rose is a rose\\" came on. I just had to stop and listen to the whole track, wipe away a tear or two, and then buy the album there and then! This album is charged with truth and emotion, and I would challenge anyone to question the divine inspiration which runs through it.This is an album of the highest quality imaginable: beautifully crafted songs, a voice that reaches out and grabs you, and a team of musicians and technicians who know exactly how to get the best out of the two. I'd happily recommend this to anyone - of any religion or none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a \\"disclaimer\\" of sorts!","review":"This is a wonderful album, but the Amazon review has one piece of info wrong - this was Susan's third solo album, not her debut. Her debut is called \\"Wakened by the Wind\\" and \\"Angels of Mercy\\" followed that. Terrific singer with the sense to pick strong songwriters. The opening two songs \\"Summer Solstice\\" and \\"Waiting for Your Love to Come Down\\" are worth the price of the CD alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave","review":"Not made in USA.

After installing it and trying it out for a week. I cancelled my order for a much more expensive one. This subwoofer works great, when tuned properly it supplies the kind of bottom end I wanted. It took some fiddling with the crossover until I got it right. I did not want trunk rattling, or \\"disco\\" thump, but something that made the music fuller so I would not overstress the smaller speakers in the car. I had the best success when I placed the speaker against the back of the trunk facing forward. This gave the bass wave more extension and the sound was full."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined To Be A Classic!","review":"Some people seem to know how to create and lead effective group rituals, but ask them how they do it and chances are they can't put it into words the way this book does. I've read many books about ritual, and some of them are very good, but this book gets to the real heart of the matter - how to get to that indescribable place the a good ritual takes you to. Every ritualist needs this book. Your rituals need never fall flat again! :)One of the Pagan groups I belong to, Agave Spirit Grove, is having a monthly discussion group regarding this book. I think this is a great way to help increase the effectiveness of a group that works together in a ritual setting.One thing I like about Isaac Bonewits is that he doesn't expect anyone to agree 100% with his opinions and observatons. Even if you have many different points of view, you will find something useful in Rites of Worship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things I wish I'd known before","review":"Before I started doing public rituals anyway. This is the first book to tell a priest or priestess of any Neopagan path what they need to know to make any public ceremony powerful and effective. The discussion of \\"what to do when things go wrong\\" alone is worth the price of the book. Anyone interested in the \\"polytheology\\" of worship or the dozens of factors that have to be considered when planning or performing a ritual will find this book full of useful information. If you're ready to go beyond \\"livingroom religion\\" you'll find this book a Goddess-send!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Resource!","review":"This book is exactly what any group needs to make rituals more interesting. I know from personal experience how dissappointing a bad group ritual can be, particularly when coming from a solitary practice. Isaac gives concise answers to common problems, and brings up the reasons why certain aspects of ritual are needed, and why some things should always be left out. He is a brilliant writer... go buy all his books if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking. however, its bigger than I thot.","review":"I used to have similar watch b4.

I thought it would contain at least a few ideas for decorating, but there wasn't anything like that inside.

Withstands tears well. While not having to use a sharpener makes it quick to use, it also means the point is dull unless you use the small, awkward sharpener built in the end.

They had no source of electricity to recharge their camera, hence the actual footage of the trip is reduced to 2 minute segments, generally of them talking inside a small tent. They had no special lenses or expertise so the beauty of the Himalayas, or any professional footage of the mountains or nature for that matter was totally lacking. A complete waste of time. I've made this trip myself and was looking forward to reliving some of the experience, and was bitterly disappointed with this ripoff.

It is designed to turn off if it is not placed horizontally for a certain period of time. Something must be wrong with that switch because now it will not turn on at all. The light is on but nobody's home. As I said, I iron very little so I know that I haven't worn it out. Sending it off for repairs just sounds like a lot of expense.

Rowenta refused to replace it of course and also declined this second DM170 as being under warranty. This will be our LAST Rowenta product. When it works, it works great.

I constantly have to press the steam button (several times) to get sufficient amount of steam to iron my clothes. I wish I could return it but it's too late.

When I first got them they worked fine. But as another poster has indicated, the connectors are of very poor construction. The weight of the cable stresses the connector over time and the metal HDMI connector starts to *bend* or separate from the plastic housing. In my case, signal quality to the HDTV was affected with intermittent signal loss resulting in screen artifacts on my HDTV. Once I replaced the cable the artifacts went away. For +$60 per cable one would expect them to last forever, and certainly longer than the 1.5 years I've had them. Good inexpensive HDMI cables with solid connector construction will work just as well as expensive cables since the transported signal is digital 0's and 1's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job","review":"I used this cable with my new Sony (forget model) upconverting DVD player.

However, after 6 months I began to notice the signal would go out and I'd have to jiggle the cable to get it to work again. I realized that the weight of the cables were weighing on the HDMI ports of both my TV and PS3, loosening them. The cables would literally fall out of the port and I would have to position them just so in order to distribute the weight evenly. Eventually it came to the point where I couldn't start my PS3 up without jiggling the cables and repositioning them every five minutes to maintain a good signal.

Their guides have become filled with useless colour photos of generic scenes, The quirky, fresh information has disappeared -- In the summer of 2004, I used the LP guides for both Portugal and Spain. I was traveling for about three months. I had been in both places before and had used a LP guide. The most recent guides are stale and minimally updated.

She's always been my favorite author. Therefore it was no less than amazing to me when I worked diligently to get through Temptation. I struggled with every chapter. There was nothing to keep your interest or attention. So much of it was oddly written or terribly lacking. The story line was basically void.

Ms. Deveraux's previous novels have not been up to par, but this one reminds me of what she once was and still is, one of the best romance writers today. I wasn't to sure that I was going to like Temperance at first. She just seemed a little to sure of herself, but she kinda grows on you. There were a lot of parts that were just laugh out loud funny. My favorite minor character, and even though she seemed to be a pest, is \\"Charming\\" Charmaine. Everyone knows someone like her. All the characters are wonderful even the one's that you think are bad. Get this book! Don't wait for paperback.

The writing is a little different for a Jude Devereaux novel but that same great character development and story building that I've come to expect of a Devereaux book are all here. The ending is not a surprise but the twists and turns to get to the happy ending are a little different and make a good read. I enjoyed it page after page until the end. It's too bad the book ended.

I felt this this was all centered on Temperance and really no depth was given to him at all. I absolutley HATED the ending which I will not go into for those who have not read this book, but hated is truly an understatement on this one.

I've tried two recipes, each with terrible results and cannot recommend the book. Rice Pudding with Cherries and Almonds turned into a curdled, browned mess. Grits \`n' Cheddar Cheese were not much better, encrusting the crock in a thick, layer of burned grits. Each recipe recommended cooking on high for 4 hours but was overdone in under 3. Both recipes called for eggs, which, after mixed, rose to the top and cooked separately from the rest of the dish. I honestly think these recipes were not tested by their author. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"I have made 20 or so recipes from this book, and with only 1-2 exceptions, have found it to be easy and quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, why bother with the crockpot?","review":"Almost every recipe calls for browning meat in a skillet prior to adding it to a crockpot. When coupled with the warning not to store partially cooked meat in the fridge, one wonders who the book is for. If you have time in the morning to stand at the stove in a business suit and brown a pot roast prior to running to the office, these recipes will work for you. But if you are looking for quick cooking recipes, you will be disappointed by this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Mess","review":"Although Finlayson's book is well-laid out and beautiful to look at it, it has major problems. She seems to have overlooked the need for liquid in many of her recipes. The split pea soup has NO liquid listed, leaving me to guess at the amount. The recipe for short ribs in black bean sauce ended up a burned disaster. I will not use this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love God, Love your Neighbour","review":"In this erstwhile masterpiece, Spilling & Woofenden give the reader a taste of both heavenly and earthly delights while simultaneously chronicling the interior regeneration of George, a known antagonist of the Christian faith. Spelling affords us a view of a Swedenborgian couple living in a 19th century English village with a cast of equally likeable characters. Truly a page turner with the added benefit of teaching profound spiritual truths by means of describing ordinary, albeit providential, events!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very lacking","review":"To make a long story short, do not get this book unless you already understand OSPF, EIGRP, and BGP. I work w/ EIGRP and OSPF so the chapters on those were decent (b/c I already know them). But the chapters on BGP were awful. I read them twice and still didn't understand what it was saying. At this point I went to the Cisco web site and printed out the white paper on BGP and read it. That made sense. Buy the book for brief overviews on the topics, but nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"For all us Lammle lovers, who passed the CCNA with his book, this book turns out to be a serious let down. I passed my CCNA reading Todd Lammle is book and didn't have second thoughts buying this product for CCNP. I was in for a big surprise, I realize that Todd, has a tendency to over simplify the stuff for beginners and therefore was better suited to write for CCNA. Not only there are typos in this book but it also lacks in depth explanation and has little insight to any topic covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Mr. Lammle's standards","review":"Unlike the CCNA book published by the same author, the Sybex CCNP Routing book was not helpful in preparing for the Cisco exam. The book had an abundance of errors, especially relating to BGP (Chapters 7,8,9). The book also skimmed over EIGRP, which was covered heavily in the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Fundamentals, but the exam will ask for details","review":"This book was excellent for a general overview of Routing concepts and basic configuration; the exam I saw asked for a level of detail that the Sybex book didn't cover. (I took the exam in June of 2001, got an 839) Be sure you know redistribution well, or the exam will give you trouble...also know your command line, the exam will try to fool you with a drop-down list of commands that look similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"This study guide alone is not enough","review":"I have studied this book carefully and I found the book lacking in the materials that were tested on the exam. In fact, some of the exam questions were totally unfamiliar -- as a result I BARELY passed. Yes, the routing exam is more difficult in the CCNP cert. --- all the more reason for the author to expand on the subjects covered and, more importantly, to explain them better. Also, how about adding materials that were covered on the exam that were not covered or even mentioned in the book??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"I don't know why everyone keeps giving this book 4 and 5 stars. The reviewers acknowledge the errors but seem to really underestimate the significance.You will spend all kinds of time trying to figure out what a graph is trying to tell you etc, only to find you are dealing with a major Typo.I answered all the questions in a quiz only to find that the book listed all the questions again in the answer section!Also the questions in the book are too easy and there is no way to judge whether you are test-worthy or not. Often the answers are wrong or have nothing to do with the question.Bottom line you can't trust anything the book says and you better double check everything. I will use the Cisco press books from now.(Yes I passed, but only after giving up on this book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"CCNP: Routing Study Guide Exam 640-503","review":"In short this book is a waste of money. I have studied this book inside and out, and I had failed the exam. In retrospect, about 50 percent of the exam is not covered in this book. I am a veteran at test taking, and I know what I am talking about. Unfortunately, there is not a lot out there for the CCNP exams, but I would avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful reference but no exam prep.","review":"I studied this book from head to cover. The book is easy to digest & is pretty consistent with the BSCN course that I took, with respect to the terminology & commands. However, this guide fell far short of preparing me adequately for the 640-503 exam. If you want a quick easy reference to Cisco's \\"Routing\\" concepts, Buy the book, however if you're looking for material & practice questions to produce succesful exam results, I recommend something with more detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE WORST CCNP ROUTING BOOK OUT THERE!!!","review":"Exam Cram is a better study guide than this and that is not saying much. This book has approximately 250 pages of useful reading and 200 pages of Fluff. In depth protocols such as OSPF, and BGP are explained in less than 30 Pages. There is almost no way possible for someone to really get an understanding of these topics from this book. Cisco certification is highly regarded in the industry for certifing professionals that understand IP routing and this book is not the one to help you. Purchase the Cisco Press Book or Doyle's Routing TCP/IP Vol. 1 and stay away from this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't like.","review":"I used the Cisco Press Exam Certification Guide series to pass the CCNP exams. I got this one and I just don't like the higher level, skimming topics writing style. I'm not saying that I always understand the lower level stuff at first read, but I like the option of trying. The chapters I read of this book seem to offer not much more than high level topic summaries. The high number of typos bug too."},{"rating":"1","title":"CCNP routing study guide","review":"I used Todd Lammle's CCNA study guide with a good result. And as result I purchased this book without thinking about it. It was a bad decision. This book had lots of spelling errors and worst, incorrect material - which is really bad, I coudn't trust the material. Even though I did read the whole book, I ended up relying on another study quide (actually testing software) which explained things at a more detailed level. Simply, this book will not prepare you for the test, it's too simple and haphazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too many errors","review":"I have passed my CCNA, CCNP switching and Support exams and I have used the SYBEX range of books for all of them, I found those books to be good and informative with no spelling errors, command line errors and information in the wrong places. This book is full of mistakes, the information within this book is very informative but also very frustrating when you spot all these obvious mistakes, this book was rushed to be put on the shelves that is for sure, it can't of been proof read because if it had there would be no where near as many mistakes as this. Yes this book i'm sure can help get your CCNP:Routing exam out of the way, but I really don't believe people should waste their money on something that clearly has not been throughly proof read. I now have questions on using the Sybex CCNP:remote access study guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good study guide - need hands on experience","review":"Using this book I passed the 640-503 exam, barely.I am a CCNA, MCSE, MCP, etc and used Todd's CCNA book to prepare for the CCNA exam. I found that this book was just as good as the CCNA book however the material is a lot harder.There were several typos in the commands and although the exam prep cd was good there were several typos in the choices and explanations for the answers on the cd.The presentation of the information was excellent and it made understanding ospf and eigrp very easy, BGP was covered but is a complex topic.I recommend getting some hands on experience with routers before attempting to take this exam although I passed this exam with just this book.Would have been 5 stars but the typos in the book and on the cd cause it to be a 4, still an excellent resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"one song","review":"this is a one song albumI am doctor u all know it its on every drive-thru sample CDbut be careful!!!!!!!! because that is the ONLY song they have!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What??","review":"This booklet was missing most of the middle pages.

And some aren't too bad for ease of preparation.This one isn't easily doctored, nor is it that fast/simple to make. Therefore I don't see any reason to keep in the pantry.

Annie's signature Soba noodles can be cooked to either an unappealing glue or still hard inside. The sauce has an unpleasent odor, my fiancee would not even try it.

It was really was weak. Luckily there are two sides that are playable on this drum and the second side is hanging in there under adult supervision (but kids naturally want to whack this thing of course). If the makers provided extra and better quality drum \\"skin\\", then this drum should last a while and be a 5 star product (that can't cost them much).

I was a teenager when Poison stormed the scene. I admit, I listened to them and even liked some of their material. However, for some reason I never bought any of their albums, instead, I just listened to my friend's copies. Boy, I'm glad I went that route. There was a time that I was very hard and critical on the '80's bands. Now, with this huge emergence of the once popular \\"hair\\" bands, I've come to appreciate them more in what they did musically. But for some reason, I still don't respect Poison. Who feels like hearing the same songs recorded over and over again. Leave them alone, they're stealing your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Poison Allright!","review":"Just horrible glam rock! Glam at its worse really! What makes people think this is good? Saw them in concert (I was on a date) when they were touring for this album and I had to laugh watching CC Deville doing his solo: 15 minutes of fingertapping two notes. Wow! What talent! Poison's music is just atrociously amateurish to say the least. Someone with just elementary skills can play this stuff. The lyrics are just more of your typical glam stuff, \\"Dirty girl, party time, yeah, yeah, yeah!\\" Just terrible stuff! Listen to early Ratt, Crue, Bon Jovi, or just KISS for glam, not this junk. Even Warrant is better than this stupid crap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hair metal sucks","review":"I have no problem with a band that dresses up a bit as long as they have talent. Poison is not one of those bands. They have the mentality of adolescent junior high-school horn dogs. If you want to hear a good eighties band, listen to the Police or U2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, Even for Hair Metal","review":"This disc is alot better than \\"Cat Dragged In\\" probably because Poison had matured a little bit and wiped off some of the makeup (not all of it). \\"Nothin' But a Good Time\\" was catchy and popular and you can't deny that. \\"Fallen Angel\\" is also a well written track. \\"Every Rose\\", of course, needs no description being one of the most popular ballads of the 20th century. Just don't take Poison too seriously and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, mediocre bonus material","review":"As others have noted, the remastered sound is really good, and makes the purchase worth it. The bonus song is fine, but not more. The \\"world premiere interview\\" is really lame though. There's nothing \\"premiere\\" about it -- it's just some replay of an interview from the time of the album's release with *a lot* of the album music included under the voices. I didn't hear anything that wasn't just the usual rock star marketing b.s. I would have preferred an actual premiere interview, maybe some new commentary from the band or something. Also, who releases a big remaster without liner notes or recollections or interesting anecdotes? Poison, apparently. As I said, if you're a Poison fan, buy this for the sound of the remastered tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"do it do it do it","review":"lyrsics tight beat kinda odd coming from ice cube though. still worth many listens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight song from Ice Cube!","review":"This song from the Next Friday soundtrack is tight!

Brel's mellow \\"If You Go away\\".Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two good CD's, but not as good as just one of his recent CDs","review":"Unfortunately I disagree with the other reviewers. I found this compilation album to be a reasonably good introduction to the music of John Michael Talbot, but by taking snapshots from his long career and large repertoire it does not adequately represented his best music. Talbot himself says that his mid 80's album \\"Heart of the Shepherd\\" represents the beginning of his mature music, and that and his later music is what I prefer. I own that album and also \\"The Hiding Place\\", and \\"Meditations in the Spirit\\". Each of these albums presents a consistent spiritual message and I find that any one of them has more good music, and consistency, than this double CD which is weighted towards his earlier, maturing work. But it is John Michael Talbot, and does have much wonderful music. Three (or maybe four) stars for the music, but I only give it two in the end by comparison with his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"So very peaceful","review":"I actually bought this cd by chance. I was surfing on Amazon when I accidentally clicked on this album. I decided to listen to a few of the clips and immediately I knew I had to pick up this gem. Praise the Lord for music like this! In these times of cheesy commercialized songs, Talbot's music stands out with strong Biblical lyrics and haunting peaceful melodys. I just recently had surgery and during my recovery this album has brought me much comfort. I definitely recommend these 35 songs for your collection.

As the teachings given (in my opinion) seem to be 2nd hand ones; the worst thing of this book is that it contains a strange (and apparently wrong) form of kriya yoga which, I think, it may be either delusive (if it is a fake) or dangerous (if for some reason it really works). I think that kriya yoga is a holy science and maybe it should not be taught this way. Furthermore other techniques, mudras and so on are described, but as far as I know all these things do not belong to the kriya yoga tradition of Paramamhansa Yogananda.I suggest you should read some book of Paramahansa Yogananda, Roy Eugene Davis or Swami Kriyananda instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein Powder","review":"I have not found an protein powder that measures up to the Optimum Nutrition brand yet.

I am currently on a carb cycling diet that necessitates pretty strict control over carb intake. This protein has one of the lowest carb contents out there.

Splenda in small amounts is ok, but I would not want to take it daily basis. Stevia is a healthier option, but it does leave a slightly bitter taste in your mouth. This product mixed ok in milk, although it's consistancy is thinner than Jay Robb's. When mixed with 1/2 cup yogurt and 1/2 cup milk, the consistancy was much better. I am giving this four stars because of the price (12oz of Jay Robb is about $24.00). I don't hate the taste-it's just ok.

It's a bit thick so you should probably have a higher ratio of liquid to powder than is suggested in the instructions but that's up to your own personal taste.And the mixing issue isn't that big of deal to deter me from drinking it regularly but I can see how some people could be turned off by that.

I mix 2 scoops of the \\"Natural Chocolate\\" flavor powder with 12 ounces of water, a small handful of crushed ice and about 2 Tablespoons of half-and-half or heavy cream (makes it really creamy without adding much in carbs), mix in the blender well, and I get a thick, rich chocolate shake that tastes so good! Personally I don't need more sweetness, but if I did, I think I'd just add a little stevia. Sometimes in the morning (especially in the winter) I add in some chewable vitamin C (2 or 3 of the 500mg chewable orange flavored tablets) and blend it up, and it has a nice orange-chocolate milkshake thing going on. I LOVE THAT THIS HAS NO ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS! Those artificial sweeteners are horrible for your health. This powder uses all natural stevia. Perfect! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"Good taste and packs more protein per 100g than other stuff. More importantly its 100% natural. On my 4th bottle now. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a naturally flavoured protein!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes really vile","review":"The price and everything is fine, and it's not a bad product, but it seems falsely advertised. It's really foul tasting, I mix it with unsweetened chocolate almond milk. It barely mixes with a shaker, still clumps kind of bad, but I usually drink it really fast in the morning for breakfast anyway.It tastes really awful. The stevia extract or whatever they use leaves the same sort of filmy taste in my mouth that artificial sweeteners leave, which is a pity. Had I known what it tasted like ahead of time, I would have just stuck with what I was using. I'll go through what I have, but I won't be buying it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad taste, good value!","review":"This is my first protein supplement. The 5lb bottle was shipped nearly full and comes with a scoop to help you portion your servings. It has a somewhat sweet taste which I find goes well with orange juice (tastes like creamsicle), chocolate milk, strawberry milk, apple cider, and various fruit-based drinks. It also adds a lot of substance to fruit shakes as well. Sometimes it's a bit difficult to mix so you get little lumps when you drink it, but if you just keep stirring for a few minutes it dissolves well."},{"rating":"2","title":"still the best protein powder, but the flavor is different","review":"If you are looking for a product without artificial sweeteners, and not loaded with sugar, this is the product. I've used it off and on since it was first introduced. It always had an excellent taste and fulfilled the need for high protein, low carb, and easy on the wallet.I would give 5 stars, except this bottle tastes a little different than all the other bottles I've had, like maybe they have switched up something, and it does not taste as good as before. But with every competitive product seeming to be loaded with artificial sweeteners or tons of carbs, an athlete looking for low carb protein without artificial sweeteners is probably limited to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximizing gains","review":"Great bro-tein.

I definitely have found my favorite supplement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting natural whey","review":"Great product and a pretty good value.

I purchased some on Amazon and it was excellent. I then purchased some vanilla from GNC because I had a coupon and of course it was horrible. It tastes like old milk and will not dissolve in liquid. I'm suspicious that it was old but due to this I will never try the vanilla again. I will continue to purchase the chocolate from Amazon and only Amazon due to the price being the best you'll find and if you do the recurring purchase you get a great deal for a great whey. Top quality from Amazon unlike the chain stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised!","review":"I have never taken a protein supplement before and the first time I had some, was with this. I have to tell you, beinga vegetarian most of the time, I never really had taken enough protein during my workouts. This explains how I managed to become very lean and lost a lot of weight instead of packing on the pounds.The first day I took this in the evening (no workout), I woke up the next day feeling energized and refreshed (I suppose this is an indication this was missing from my diet). The following days, I started working out and taking this , and am already seeing a difference just after 1 week and no, it isn't water retention that I am seeing. Really good protein shake which tastes amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very optimistic about this protein","review":"I received this protein as fulfilled by the Vitamin Shoppe here on Amazon and immediately made a shake with organic milk, a scoop of this protein powder and a frozen banana. The shake, after blending ultra-well with my Vitamix, was excellent, perhaps not as sweet as with other protein powder, but the fact that you're getting an all natural product makes it all the better. The container indicates if you want a more sweet taste to reduce the amount of liquid but with a full cup of milk and a frozen banana, I was 100% satisfied with the flavor. I'm excited to use this in my homemade protein bars now and some other foods I make with protein powder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Protein Powder!","review":"I have been using the ON Gold Standard 100% Natural Whey for the last few months, and I'm really impressed with it. This is the best protein supplement I have used. I personally like the vanilla a little better, but the chocolate is great too. Both flavors are lightly sweetened with stevia, and have only 3g of sugar, while delivering 24g of protein per serving. I usually mix it in skim milk with a spoon (takes about a minute of vigorous stirring), but for best results, use a blender or a shaker bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!!","review":"Love the flavor and results.

Off course as long as your working out this product will work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Protein Powder","review":"This is my favorite protein powder.

This tape lacks a good deal of the bite that I expected, but is still entertaining. A lame and overlong and purposely-edited version of \\"What Do You Want From Life?\\" makes for the lowest point on the tape, and Fee plays everything too squeaky-clean IMHO, but most things hold up well enough. If you've never been a Tubes fan, you'll be impressed, if you are an Old Tubes Fan, like me, you'll wish they'd taped a tour about 2-3 years earlier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST albums EVER !!","review":"This band has achieved it's zenith with this album, no one has been able to even approach their excellence.

I can't say enough about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album.","review":"Wow, I loved this one when it came out, but it still blows me away in 2007. The lyrics are cynical and interesting, there's lots of mood and dynamics, and the rhythm and lead guitar work is intense. These guitar players have chops galore, but they understand that phrasing is the most important aspect of playing. Many of the coolest guitar parts are not just solos, but are woven right into the body of the song. Also, vocalist Geoff Tate's pitch and diction are dead-on. One of the best metal albums ever recorded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Garbage","review":"If you love music with every ounce of joy and emotion wrung out of it, then this record is for you. This is a perfect example of a band that takes themselves far too seriously. Queensryche is obviously inspired by Pink Floyd, but everything that makes Pink Floyd great (good taste, humor, originality, pop sensibility) is totally lacking in this record. OK, I will concede that if you are a Metal junkie who likes theme-albums for their own sake and musicians with good chops that like to show off (for the sake of showing off) then this is a must-listen. I had a neighbor that thought this was the greatest album ever. He once said to me, \\"Music isn't supposed to be FUN; music is supposed to be SERIOUS!\\" I guess you are pathologically impaired from enjoying music, then you won't mind listening to music that brings no enjoyment to the listener. But, on another level, this music can be enjoyed. That is, for the sheer hilarity of the stupid, over-bearing story that goes with the songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what you should get if you're a joke with no taste","review":"This album doesn't make any sense at all!! The songwriting is crap and this Tate guy just can't sing. All this is is another co-called \\"classic\\" that is nothing more than throw-away junk. When was the last time you saw any of these songs played on the TV or radio?? For a real concept album get Usher's Confessions or The Streets - A Grand Don't Come For Free. Now those are GOOD concept albums that are more ground braking than this unknown tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"a metal classic","review":"operation mindcrime is one of the best albums from this great hard rock bands along with empire.listen to classics like eyes of a stranger and revolution calling and buy this great cd.very highly recommended.five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy it","review":"This is by far one of the top three albums ever. When I mean album I mean the ENTIRE thing - the balance on this album is amazing. The story is unbelievable - this is a musical story - a heavy metal rock-opera.I could go on like crazy but a story about political corruption, brainwashing heroin addicts to kill religous figures around town.Amazing story - woudl love for it to be a book but afarid the book could not be good enough.My vote for the best concept album of all time"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Queensryche album ever!","review":"Absolutely unmatched to this day.Operation Mindcrime is, in my opinion, the best yet for this band.It's intricacies of storytelling combined with the ever flowing music blend together to give a supreme performance of the rock-opera genre.I have the cd, the cassette, & the DVD ;I love this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can anyone give this less than five stars?","review":"Queensryche reached its peak with this release. I have all of they're output, from the first LP to the most recent which is called Dedicated to Chaos. They are not the band they were when this one came out. Thats unfortunate, but I guess they had they're run. There is not one song on this cd that I dislike and my favorite track is Spreading the Disease, just listen to the drumming on this one, its awesome. Other favorites are Eyes of a Stranger, The Needle never Lies, I don't Believe in Love, Revolution Calling, the whole cd just flat out rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"great album - but this particular vinyl release is a bust","review":"I was really excited to purchase this album on vinyl and in fact always seeing it in the record store was one of the reasons I decided to jump into vinyl and get a turntable. So when I finally picked up this Capitol Records \\"from the vault\\" edition I was expecting awesome soundSo I was pretty disappointed to hear very poor sound and numerous pops, clicks, hisses and general surface noise - even after cleaning it. the retailer was a good sport and let me swap it out for another one but it didn't sound any better.So even though the album is awesome I would strongly avoid this particular release. If at all possible find a copy of the original vinyl release from the 80's - much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, Classic 80's metal album","review":"One of the best album of the 80's, period.

One of my favorites of all time. But this is a sorry excuse for a DVD package. I just don't understand why they didn't redo the music for the videos. Mono sound? Give me a break! How hard could it possibly be? They're probably planning on redoing it again with stereo or 5.1 in some super deluxe package so I have to buy it again! And the live album isn't that good either. I have every version this came out on, including the Livecrime CD version from way back. If you have that, I really don't see the need to buy this.Stick with the remastered CD and don't bother with this. Or better yet, save your money and buy the Revolution Calling box set and you'll get all of their EMI remastered albums. You can get it through a CD club for less than half the amazon price and it's a better value than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"CONCEPT\\" AT IT\\"S BEST.....","review":"The idea of a \\"concept\\" album is not new,but these guys brought \\"production\\" to a higher level, on this CD....Mindcrime IS and always will be a classic of unparalled excellence....It\\"s been said that \\"The sum is greater than the individual parts\\"...and this CD proves that...This WORK could NOT have possible without the individual efforts of every member of the band....striving for ONE cohesive sound......And let\\"s don\\"t forget the\\"Moronic Monks\\".....They made the \\"religious feel\\" of this recording possible.....Thanks to everyone,Especially Geof,Scott,Chris,Eddie,& Michael (who are these guy\\"s ???)....... \\"I remember now...I remember how it started\\"........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operation: MindRche","review":"\\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" is a book, not a CD, and everyone's interpretation will be different. It tells the story of a young man named Nikki who is disgusted with the corruption in Government and religion plaguing America. He joins an \\"underground revolution\\" called \\"Operation: Mindcrime\\" headed by the mysterious \\"Dr. X.\\" Though the order originally meant well, it fell into the grasp of organized crime, with Nikki in the eye of the storm. \\"Suite Sister Mary\\" is undoubtedly the best song in the album, and is an outright symbol of Queensrche's untouchable talent. The album as a whole throws the listener's mind into a vortex, bringing about emotions that arguably no other band could reach. I strongly recommend that you order this album, even if you are not a fan of heavy metal. If the music doesn't invoke thought, the lyrics certainly will."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first taste of Queensryche . . .And I love it!","review":"When I first borrowed this tape from my aunt I thought it would be yet another metel band screaming in my ear. I am so happy I was wrong! I'm not normaly a fan of this type of music but for Queensryche I'll make an exception! I loved Operation:Mindcrime from the first note I heard and now I have the whole colletion of thier CD's. I deffinately cannot wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album since \\"The Wall\\"","review":"This was an outstanding effort which unfortunately they were not able to duplicate. The lyrics are outstanding and the album takes you an a journey that you never want to end. This could easily be made into a movie assuming the right people are involved. You can listen to this 1,000 times and you'll always feel moved by the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands up over time","review":"I bought this CD in 2008 and have to say it really stands the test of time. I expected it to give me a reminiscing experience akin to listening to Poison's greatest hits or some other 80's band. It actually sounded current. And, god, the story sure feels relevant to the year 2008.Add to that the style of playing also has stood up over time so as to still sound good, and the fact it was recommended to me by others who first heard it post year 2000. Definitely recommended. Oh, and I'm not just a Queensyrche or just a metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivals The Wall","review":"From start to finish, there may not be a better album. Every song flows and while some can be taken apart for Radio play (Operation Mindcrime, I don't believe in Love, Eyes of A Stranger) doing that totally ruins the experience of listening to this album straight through. Very enjoyable. And if you can understand the story on the first try, you are a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Queensryche - a classic for the times and beyond","review":"Concept albums are tricky, and can easily turn out to be a cheesy smirkfest of inside jokes. Operation Mindcrime, on the other hand, is a brilliant expose of the times - it was conspiracy before conspiracy was cool (to butcher a metaphor). Engrossing storytelling, definitive characters, vivid music and plot - this feels like a movie soundtrack or an opera, and easily could have been. Superb guitar work, biting lyrics, insightful story ... I recommend this album without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning point for Queensryche.","review":"Mindcrime is the turning point in their career and it's a masterpiece. Concept, lyrics, music skills, song structures and everything is great. It's a rock opera, its story follows a man who becomes disillusioned with the society of the time and reluctantly becomes involved with a revolutionary group as an assassin of political leaders. Revolution Calling, Speak, Needle Lies and Operation: Mindcrime are my favorite tracks. Mindcrime is a classic and arguably their best album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prelude to Queensryches Magnum Opus","review":"Operation Mind Crime demonstrated the beginning of Queensryches finest hour. Queensryche paved the way for modern Prog Metal bands like Dream Theater. While Seattle was bustling with a bunch of Nirvana clones in the early 90s, Queensryche was breaking the mold by going an entirely different and more musical and thoughtful direction. I love this album second only to Queensryches \\"Empire\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Love's you long time","review":"This is one of the 1st CD's I bought back in the late 80's, when I finally decided to migrate my album collection to the \\"new\\" format. I heard 'Eyes of a Stranger' on the radio station once or twice and thought..hmmm!From my 1st listen, through my 100th, I was totally amazed at the story telling, the music and the depth of the CD. I honestly think this was the 1st CD I listened to 2 times in a row. It is now 15 years later, and the music is still fresh..I cant give this CD enough praise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Generic","review":"A coworker loaned me this CD with the promise that he was doing me a favor I didn't yet realize. I have to disagree, though, because this album is nothing special. It all sounds exaclty like any other music you'd expect to hear from this era, and could easily be mistaken as Def Leppard or Poison by the casual listener. There's nothing really bad in here, but there's also nothing to make you sit up and take notice. None of the songs really differentiate themselves if you listen to the album straight through, and the album itself just seems lackluster and monotonous. It's OK, but I can think of a lot of things I'd recommend before it."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!","review":"there's some great lyrics like suite sister mary but the rest of the songs are gospel! why? the vocals are quite good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkly entertaining","review":"I just want to say first of all that I'm just starting to get into the harder rock area of music. For years I've been more of a pop/light rock listener. However I've lately been trying to expand my musical horizons so I asked my younger brother to recommend some music. This was one of the first albums he suggested, so I gave it a listen. Then I arranged to buy it. What a great album! In addition to catchy, edgy music, the album tells a story about conspiracy, brainwashing, evil and the descent into despair. Not a great subject area to get drawn too deeply into, but very entertaining to get a glimpse of. Queensryche has done an excellent job of creating mood and telling a story without bogging down the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I'm a big fan of progressive music in general, bands like Yes, Gentle Giant, Frank Zappa, King Crimson, Uk, Pink Floyd, (early) Genesis, Rush, The Moody Blues etc.Just recently I've been getting into prog-metal, I was blown away with bands like Tool, Dream Theater and King Diamond, and heard plenty of reviews on this album and gave it a try. I love it to say the least. And highly recomended it to anyone who's a fan of progressive music. Get it, you wont be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Music of the Modern Era","review":"Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime is a modern masterpiece. Tate's vocals are insurpassable.The only singer whose voice gives me chills.Degarmo and Wilton are genious on the guitars, the solos will blow you away.not to mention the killer performances of Rockenfeld on drums and Jackson on bass. The song writing is extrordinary, the story grabs you and you can't turn it off until its done. And then you want to play it again!This has been my my favorite CD for the last ten years, I never grow tired of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The MOST \\"Underratted\\" album of ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Queensryche is the role model for all to hear. This album is simply put \\"PERFECTION\\". From top to bottom, every song grabs you. Draws you into its story and makes you one of the characters. They showed that they are True Musicians by going away from this successful method and becoming successful in a completely different manner. There is no limitations to this wonderful group. Operation Mindcrime is without a doubt the most underrated album in the history of music and maybe one day it will get its just reward. A must buy, but you have to listen to it, not hear it. Queensryche has a wonderful way of making you look inside you. You may not like it, but that is your problem. They just make you realize your problems. God bless them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindcrime","review":"Not a long review here. This CD speaks for itself. It's simply one of the most perfect works ever released by any band.

Go listen to St Anger or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Operation: Online Crime","review":"This is not the real remastered edition...the sound hurts my ears and is really bad with my headphones. Just buy the original cd and rip the music that way. Amazon needs to fire their sound mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the best Album ever made","review":"Although my favorite band has always been Iron Maiden, I have to admit that even they never produced an album as good as Operation MindCrime. This simply is the best album ever made by any band and is only rivaled by Pink Floyd's The Wall. Every song on the album fits neatly and tightly together with the other songs to form a cohesive whole, yet each song can also be pulled out from the mix to stand on its own.

It took the rest of the country about a year to \\"discover\\" it. I also saw them on tour opening for Metallica that year. It was a phenomenol show! This is far and away their best album. It is like \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" but with balls."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the Original CD, this one is Awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I thought I would buy the RE-MASTERED CD and get a better Sonic quality. What I found to my Shock and Horror, is that they introduced so much digital clipping and distortion that I can not stand to listen to this version.Don't get me wrong, I think this is one of THE GREATEST albums ever made in it's original release.I even exchanged the cd for another thinking it was a problem with the disk, but this did not help, as they all have the hidious distortion.I tried to contact the record company, but there is no way to get a hold of anyone to let them know someone really screwed up on this album.There is Clipping, Sizzling, and clicks that are not in the original release.Listen to the beginning of \\"I don't believe in Love\\" and you will hear all kinds of sizzle and crunch. This is all throughout this CD.Whom ever Re-mastered this cd should be shot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic, seminal album; horrific re-mastering job.","review":"How is it possible that such an abysmal sounding re-mastering job could have gotten past the members of Queensryche and the label? Mindcrime is, in my opinion, the greatest metal CD of the entire 80s, and was due for a re-mastering to take advantage of today's superior A/D conversions and dynamics...unfortunately, it sounds worse than the original: there is a lot of clipping, and in an effort to make the CD as loud as everything else out there right now, many of the dynamics that make the original such a masterpiece are gone.Stick with the original CD if you have it or can find it; the re-mastered version is useless to anyone with good ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Operation: Landmark - spreading the disease...","review":"Someone will ask himself why I didn't give 5 stars to this album. Good question, indeed!But believe me, people, this record is always worth a listen, even if you don't like neither progressive nor metal: it's a GREAT heavy album of the 80s, maybe the greatest one.I don't like very much QR's lyrics but that's MY problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a Revolution Calling.....you!","review":"I first heard Queensryche on the now defunct \\"Headbanger's Ball\\" which was paved over for shows like TRL on the awful network MTV. I first heard \\" Revolution Calling\\", then \\"Speak\\". I heard these two songs and realized... i need to get this album! The videos play an intrigal part in making Operation Mindcrime an essential must have. here is a great story that goes along with the twin guitar attack of Degarmo and Wilton,the pulse pounding rythym of Jackson and Rockenfeld, and of course the great vocals of one of rock's most underated vocalists...Geoff Tate. It is ashamed most people never think of this great band that came out of Seattle. They were metal in a new way that was daring and conceptual. They weren't a hair or grunge band. I recommend this albmum highly as well as there commercial smash \\"Empire\\".

This is certainly no \\"Scenes From a Memory\\" by Dream Theater or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floydd (two of my favorite concept albums), but the fact that it is not the best concept album I've heard doesn't mean it is not worth checking out for the great music. It sounds a bit dated, but the story line is interesting (if somewhat convoluted and lacking in originality) and the guitar work delivers when it is needed. Overall, I imagine when this first came out, I would have given it five stars, but it just doesn't stand up as well to the test of time compared to DT or PF concept albums (or even Symphony X or Rush)."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY ADDICTIVE ALBUM!","review":"This is definitely one of the better Queensryche albums, I tend to say Empire is better, but Mindcrime and Empire have thier own sounds, so I would have to say Operation Mindcrime is just as good. It has a great storyline, and once you listen to it, you'll want to listen to it over and over. If you're into 80's metal like Judas Priest or Iron Maiden, you'll like this album, it has many similar songs to them such as, \\"The Needle Lies\\" sounds like the chorus of Run To The Hills. The best song on here is definitely the hit single \\"I Don't Believe In Love\\" because it is very emotional and has an addictive chorus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Tale Dreams (Or not!)","review":"The Princess Diaries was an awesome book.

So on top of dealing with the normal teenage problems(like her mom dating her algebra teacher)she has to worry about princess lessons. I really loved this book!

It's ridiculous.Mia Thermopolis is an average, geeky, 14 year old girl who discovers that her Grandmother is the Queen of a small country, Genovia, and she (Mia) is an heiress to the throne.Sure, the plot sounds great, but it wasn't written well at all. Mia is TOO obsessed with her body and complains often about her breast size. There's also the fact that she has very little respect for adults, mostly her Grandmother.I will also warn you on the content of this book. It's shocking that this book was created for young girls, if you were to go by all of the extra thrown-in innuendos. There's talk about her Mother sleeping with her math teacher, a foot fetishist stalking her best friend, plus many sex-based conversations. There was a ripe level of swearing, too.This book is a complete waste of time... however, I recommend it if you want to reduce your IQ level."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book","review":"OKay so I thought this book was really good, just to make that clear incase you didn't tell by the stars. But there was something about how stupid Mia was, I mean she doesn't notice that Lily's brother like's her. Also the fact that she really think the cool guy likes her is just stupid. She assumes that just because she's a princess sudddenly everything's peachy and that everyone will like her which is just not true. Some people just don't like other people because well they don't like them. But I though this book was really good because it talked about real stuff that normal people would freak out about. Like my mom dating my teacher would just be freaky and if I suddenly found out I was a Princess (which I highly doubt)I would totally freak and if my grandmother was like grandmere I would probably do the same things. Over all I thought it was a good book with belivable characters and a good plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute story","review":"I loved this book and the movie equally. It was a very good read. Mia is lovable as are most of the characters. I recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Princess Diaries","review":"This was a great book, I really enjoyed how we felt and saw the Same feelings that Mia experienced. It really made me think about how being a princess would feel like. I also learned how annoying the press can be. It is a great book about a teenage gril just trying to get through the day. It shows her Secret Admirer, her crush and other people who she liked or had problems with. She showed how freindships are not always perfect and how you can solve them. This was my favorite book that I ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Easy to read","review":"I bought this book at a bookstore as a last resort, but I ended up loving it so much that I was extremely sad when it ended. It is about a normal, geeky 14 year old girl whose life is suddenly turned upside down by discovering the fact that she is the princess of a small European municipality \\"Genovia\\". This book was written fairly recently (I think in 2000) so everything she mentions about pop culture you totally know what she is talking about. The style of writing is fun and easy to relate to for a teenager. It makes you never want to put it down! I even risked car sickness just so I could find out what happened next. I loved this book so much and am highly anticipating the sequel. Hats off to Meg Cabot for a wonderful book. I reccomend \\"Princess Diaries\\" to anyone who is looking for a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good book","review":"This was a great book, though very easy to read. The plot was a little unrealistic, but easy to follow. It's not exactly great literature, but good for a nice, quick (and funny) read.

Definetely read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Princess Diaries\\" didn't meet my expectations.","review":"I know everybody else raved about it, but I have to admit I liked the movie much better. The filmwriters (Thankfully) pretty much rewrote the whole thing. I'm not exactly sure why, but I found the movie much more interesting. I'll probably read the second one, just because I want to find out what happens. Sorry Meg Cabot, but that's my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and easy to relate to","review":"Mia Thermopolis is just your average 14-year-old vegetarian feminist environmentalist with confrontation issues when she discovers that she is the sole heir to the throne of Genovia, a small European principality. She now has to cope with paparazzi everywhere and princess lessons from her intolerable Grandmere, the dowager princess, not to mention the everyday pressures of Mia's life!Sounds formulaic? Maybe it is somewhat, but more than formulaic, it's hilarious and sympathetic. Anyone can understand Mia's initial reaction to the discovery of her royal blood: she bursts into tears. She is an individual who doesn't like makeup and fake nails, isn't trendy and just wants to be herself. This book is perfect for any girl who considers herself an outsider and is tired of being told she should change!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meg Cabot's Royal Writing","review":"When I first saw this book at my school library, I knew it was going to be good. I had no idea how good. You see, The Princess Diaries is about Mia Thermopolis, a teen who's got more problems than she can handle. #1: Her mom is dating her Algebra teacher. #2: That's the subject Mia is Flunking. #3: Her dad just told her she is a Princess of an entire country. #4: She has to take Princess lessons with her awful french Grandmother. #5: Mia is branded a FREAK. #6: She is fighting with her best friend. And just when things look like all they can do is get worse, the coolest kid in school asks her to the dance! Read on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Am SO Not a Princess!","review":"This is a wonderful story of Mia Thermopolis, a girl who just wants to survive high school but finds out she's really a princess. Told through her journal entries, it is the story of a typical teenage girl with the usual problems: failing algebra, a crush on the cutest guy in school, and her mom dating her algebra teacher! Then, her father and her grandmother visit, and surprise her with the news that she is the Princess of Genovia, and must ready herself to eventually lead the small country!

The Princess Diaries was so entertaining and very well written. Mia, the main character seemed like a typical teenage girl, which makes it very easy to relate to.

Its worth the price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Princess Diaries","review":"In The Princess Diaries Mia Thermoplis thinks that nothing else in her life can go wrong since she is already flunking algebra and is the biggest geek of the school, but when she finds out that she is Princess of Genovia her world is turned upside down.I really enjoyed reading this book because I can relate on how she has lots of bad days, she is fun, and is very nice. This book takes place in modern times, but has some fantasy because how many girls find out they're a princess one day? Any girl who wishes that they could be a princess or just wants to read about how one girl tries to survive being one will enjoy this book. I suggest you read this book and if you like The Princess Diaries then try reading the sequel Princess in the Spotlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aesome book!","review":"I was expecting this to be some hokey romantic/frilly story about as girl who's dreams come true...instead is was a humorous story of a teenager who had no wish to be a princess at all.

You can't help but smile when reading this book. defintely one of the best books I've read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay.","review":"But it wasn't what I expected. It really wasn't that much about Mia being a princess. It was just a typical nerdy girl wants the hunky guy kind of story. The princess thing was really kind of background, like Mia's got all these typical teenaged problems and oh, by the way, she's also a princess. And I thought Mia whined a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the Movie, It's so Much Better.","review":"The book, The Princess Diaries, was an ok book. I do not think the author did a good job on planing how different events happen in the book. I think the way the events happened were unrealistic. When Mia's school finds out she is a princess, I think that if you found out that someone in your school was royalty you would do a little bit more then point and stare. I also don't think Mia's grandmother should have been so mean to her. Any grandmother, even a queen, would never be that mean to her granddaughter. I also don't think other people should read this book because it isn't that interesting. When something major happens it goes by way to fast. This is a book you can skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel your IQ points drop as you read...","review":"This is a rare case in which the movie is better than the book. Instead of having morals like the movie, about being whatever you want to be, instead the character obsesses (whines and whines and whines) about her looks (oh, yeah, she's a *real* role model for girls her age) and her boyfriends Cabot so many cliches about teens its not even funny. This book is one of the reasons why the English language is deteriorating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage cliché","review":"Despite \\"The Princess Diaries\\" popular acclaim-and not critical claim-this book is one to be avoided. Being a high school student myself, I resent Cabot's obviously aged interpretation of high schoolers and high school in general. Because she is not in high school, characters in \\"The Princess Diaries\\" fall victim to just about every teenage cliché there is. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny how I forgot most of it","review":"I thought it was a great read. I knew it was cos' I couldn't put it down once I started reading it.

As she realizes that it isn't going to happen.Then along comes her Grandmere and father to tell Mia something that will change her life forever and she will never just be plain old Mia.Overall this book was wonderful, I found it focused more on her life then it did with her being a Princess, but I suppose there will be more about her being a Princess in the upcoming books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Who: Amelia ThermopolisWhat: She's a princess of Genovia and her parents have been hiding it from her 'til now, her 16th birthday.When: Who knows?

Because of this, she must now learn to be a princess under the tutelage of her grumpy and strict Grandmere.This was a very fun young adult book. I listened to the audio book, narrated by Anne Hathaway. (She played Mia in the movie version of the book, which I have not seen.) She has the voice and emotions of a typical ninth grader down pat!

It seems like all that she cares about in all of the boooks is her boyfriend. Whether she's going to lose him, if he actually loves her, if they'll go to the dance together ect. It gets very dreary and I regret even picking up the books. It seems as though after the original book, Meg Cabot lost her steam and started fixating on a few specific points, including her boyfriend.

Not worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"After seeing the Disney production of this book, I was very excited to read the adventures of Mia and her crazy life. However, this book did not live up to even one of my expectations. It was not worth my time or money. The movie is wonderful and apropriate for all ages. However, there is no way I would let a twelve year old read this book. It is too crude for any of my \\"princesses\\" to read. Instead of being inspireing about how anyone can become what ever they want, I found pages of an annoying young girl who is too concered about the size of her chest and whether or not her algabra teacher is \\"frenching\\" her mother. Do not waste your time ont this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OBSCENE!!!","review":"My eight year old sister bought this book, thinking that it had SOME relationship with the movie she liked so much. She read it very quickly, so I read it myself, on the offchance an older reader might enjoy it. I was appalled. Within the first two chapters, this book discusses sex, testicular cancer, and it actually describes the main character remembering finding her mother's diaphragm in the shower. Throughout this entire book (I find myself hesitating to call this piece of trash a book, by the way) are vulgar references to sex and the main character's sexual feelings, thoughts and fantasies. This book does not deserve to be on bookstore shelves masquerading as a book for young readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I weep for the future","review":"After reading the reviews of this book by my peers, I am more concerned than ever about the mental stagnation of teenagers. I can't believe all these girls are lapping up this tripe. The struggle to change perceptions about body images and individuality is already lost if teens are this undemanding about the kind of crap they read. Books like this are part of the problem when good books can be part of the solution. Wise up, girls.

I was expecting a great chick lit /coming of age, that was as wonderful as the movie. I give the movie 5 stars, and I have to give the script writer for the movie many kudos for coming up with such a great movie from this lousy book.Usually it's the movie that doesn't live up to the book's expectations, but this was the opposite. The book has swearing and her mom sleeps with her teacher! The movie was a G-rated, uplifting, complete family film. I couldn't even finish the book I was so dissapointed. Maybe if I hadn't loved the movie so much and been expecting so much, it would have been okay, but come on, why all the talk about sex?

It is rare that a book is written that is entertaining, sensitive, funny and appropriate for both teens and parents.Cabot's book has reminded me of the trials and tribulations that teens go through and will provide my daughters with a rare insight into their days to come.

And she was right. Mia's thoughts, friends and things that she does really hit home for me and what it's like to be a high school freshman (even though I am not a princess). This book made me laugh out loud and feel better about some of the things that make me feel like a geek. My friends and I like it so much that we sometimes read our favorite parts at the lunch table.

It was very entertaining, but that is as far as it goes. Maybe I am just sensitive, but there was so much harsh teen-cliquing it was unrealistic. For instance, later in the book, the 'goths' are protesting their right to worship Satan. Uh-hum? And how many goths do you know, Mrs. Cabot? The character of Mia was overly cliqued.

Anyway, she has a Cinderella time when she finds out that she is heir to a kingdom! But, all is not perfect in Manhattan. Her friends at school find out that she is a princess. Her mother is dating her Algebra teacher. UGH! Her grandmother insists that she take Princess Lessons. Mia does survive it all!

This story is a hilarious look at how Mia deals with her newly-discovered royal status, and how everyone around her treats her because of it. Entertaining, well-written, and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Princesses","review":"This was a very interesting book. It has some inappropriate langue in it, but heck! I'm ten!

What more could you ask for?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun summer reading book for teen girls.","review":"Teenage girls will especially love this book, THE PRINCESS DIARIES. I know because I am a teenage girl and I loved it. After seeing the new Disney film, I had to go out and read this book. If you know the plot of the film, then you basically know the plot of the book. It's about a young modern-day teen girl named Mia who is kind of a klutz and lives with her mother. Then she finds out she is actually a princess of a small European town called Genovea and must learn to act like a princess so she can be heir to the throne. This book is exciting and interesting with a unique storyline. If you like good teen, fantasy novels, then I definitely recommend THE PRINCESS DIARIES. Also check out the Disney film starring Julie Andrews - it's just as amazing!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Winner!","review":"I was reluctant to read \\"The Princess Diaries\\" because I didn't wanted to read more worthwhile things. Luckily, I actually did read it and I can't stop thanking myself! This book is pure brilliance and Meg Cabot's idea is one of the most original ideas I've read in a while. In an age of book journals, this is one journal turned book that is a must-read. The only drawback from this book is that the tone is sort of whiny, and I for the life of me cannot understand why a girl wouldn't want to be a true princess. This book inspired me to try to 'self-actualize' like Lilly Moscovitz encourages Mia to be and also defend myself when I need to. This book is full of hilarity and I encourage anyone of any age to read \\"The Princess Diaries\\" and it's sequel, \\"Princess in the Spotlight\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess goes Mad","review":"This book is about a once normal girl that finds out that her dad is a prince so that would make her the princess. It talks about how she doesn't want to be a princess and how her life is so horrible. All these bad things keep on picking on her and her mom starts going out with someone that she doesn't like.

The story is easy to follow and you feel like a part of Mia's life. You begin to feel like her friend and you actually begin to feel for her. She is a normal person who gets put in a very strange situation. It builds on to be a fantastic story. I would suggest anyone to read this book and buy it.

I've read pretty much all of them. It's about Mia Thermopolis, who thinks she's just an average girl until she finds out she's a Princess.

Also read angus,thongs,and full frontal snogging!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Princess Diaries- Princess in the Spotlight","review":"I purchased this book for my 11 year old because she had enjoyed the first book. I started to read it myself and was disappointed with the subject matter involving Mia's mother and her algebra teacher sleeping together, Mia's mother becoming pregnant, and Mia pondering whether her mother would consider getting an abortion! Needless to say, I did not give the book to my 11 year old after all, and told her she would have to be much older to read it! I feel the content is for older teens only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Pessimistic","review":"This book was wonderful. It had a great story line and series of events. However, Mia's character was incredibly pessimistic. She had such a narrow veiw of the world! You would think that someone that concerned about the less fortunate would appreciate the things that she has more because many do not.I found her unbelievably self-centered and selfish, no matter how \\"enviromentally friendly\\" she was. The thing is, she never looked on the bright side of things. Okay, so her hair looked like a triangle. Oh well! Very Vain. Also, WHY does being 5'10\\" make her a freak??? and what is wrong with big feet? Alot of people have large feet nowadays, and what is wrong with being tall? Many glamorous people are. Models are. That was the main stickler about this book. If Mia was just a tad more positive, this book would be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"STILL IS NOT HERE!","review":"I ordered the Princess Diaries for my daughters summer reading list on August 4th.

The movie is nothing like the book, and for good reason! Disney couldn't have upheld a family-friendly reputation if they had of released the movie more than loosely based on the book! For any mothers considering this book for their child, don't do it! It deals with very immoral issues as acceptable, and this book has been recommended to children no less! Please just go to a bookstore and read some of the content of this story, and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This book is 100% pure trash! It is very inappropriate for anyone. Even though the movie is good the book is one of the trashiest books I have ever read. It is constantly making fun of Jesus Christ/God and using his name in vain. It is also very immoral and set bad examples! I would not suggest to anyone and it desevres 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Princess Diaries","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's about a 9th grader who isn't pretty, popular, big-chested, or anything else. She likes this guy named Josh, who of course likes the most popular and pretty girl in the school. Her parents aren't married, and her mom is dating her algebra teacher. (UGH!!) She hates algebra and is flunking it, so of course she's not very happy about it. Then she finds out that she is the princess of a tiny country that no one has ever heard of. I can't tell the rest, but I will say that it was a lot of fun to read about her adventures afterwards :) P.S. some other books you might like if you liked the Princess Diaries: the Alice books by the author of the shiloh books...phyllis something-or-other"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty cool","review":"i think it was probably one of the best books i have evr read that was based on a modern teenage girl's plain life.it's very easy to see that this could be about a real girl, even though i doubt it. it's pretty easy to relate to Mia's problems, besides the one about her being a princess, and it draws u in.to the person who said that it had no ending. go read philip pullman's 'His Dark Materials' series. He ends it in a sentance like 'Lyra shouted at Pantiliamon[sp?] to come back.' yea, i'm exaggerating, so wat. i read the secodn book like three months ago... the point is, if meg cabot put in a real ending, it would probably not make u want to read the next book more. it'd just be 'yea, i read it, so wat.' but if she leaves the character without all of her problem solved, u'll want to know how she solves the rest and wat happens to her friends etc. etc.overall, the book was realistic, funny, and just a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read:)","review":"I normaly don't like to read but this book was EXELLENT. I have yet to find a book better, I couldn't put it down. It is so like a girls diary so real. Meg Cabot is the best auther.If you buy this book but the second one two (The princess in the spotlite)because when you read this book it leaves you at the egde of your seat and you have to read the second one right away. So please read this book it is sooooo good,words can't descibe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, educational, totally entertaining","review":"I predict that this book will be the big surprise bestseller of the year 2000. I have been privileged enough to read advance copies, and I was absolutely entranced. The characters are vivid (just wait till you meet Grandmere), the situation is intriguing, and the denouement is completely satisfying. This is the definitive young teen book of the new century.Its appeal -- while absolutely modern -- crosses generations. Without a word of a lie, I gave my advance copy to my mother -- 89 years young -- and she could not put it down. She was laughing, she was crying, and she thought it was the best book she had read in years.She -- like the rest of my family -- cannot wait for the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enchanting Modern Fairy Tale","review":"This is the most creative book I have ever read. I really enjoyed this book because it actually does sound like what teens today would write. The language of the book is very modern and the actions are very realistic. This story isn't the classic \\"Dear Diary\\" thing with calmness, but it is an explosion of emotions written down. It is something more likely to be found in my diary. This creativity is simple, yet it makes the story much more fun.I also loved the plot of the story and the characters. The plot is very original. It is about a girl, Mia, who finds out that she is the next heir to the throne of a microscopic country, when she is already fourteen! Imagine not knowing that for all your life. The characters are very fun because none of them are that normal. Mia is an invisible girl who needs more self-esteem, and she has a best friend who is rebellious and independent, Lily.The book is somewhat different from the movie, but I think it is more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best","review":"Okay this book was good, but not as intriquing as 1&2. Meg could have done better. Its all about Mia wanting to break up with her boyfriend Kenny,(Which she finally does) to get with her best friends big brother. It ends like the movie, Mia gets Micheal, and leaves for Genovia. I give it 4 stars just for being cheasy like the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to this fabulous music!","review":"If you are not familiar with Rondo Veneziano, then this will be a CD that gets you hooked and looking for more.

Von Hoffman does a wonderful job of telling the scene how it was. Ifyou want to understand hippies of the 60's read this book. It takes a different approach of the scene by not foccussing on anything, but covers everything. Von Hoffman did what most writers of the Acid era did or could not do; he was unbiased. The only down side was the strange organization. It had no chapters or real structure. Despite that fact, the book was very fluid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A summer reading","review":"Frankly speaking I have given it a very quick screen.

As long as this type of sissy bar is not being used to support any type of weight and for decoration only...you will have no problems. Because of this...ended up finding a less expensive 42 inch sissy made to fit a beach cruiser frame and bolt to the axle of the rear wheel. This ended the issue of the \\"adjustable\\" seat while being used. Plus...was able to bend that new sissy bar to an almost 45 degree angle for an even more funky look.In addition...you are on your own to locate the bolts and nuts to hook the clamps to the bike. Would have been nice to have included 50 cent bolts and nuts to install to your bike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it should","review":"This is a good quality sissy bar. I have used them on kids bikes and they worked fine. I decided I needed a banana seat bike for myself, though, to ride around with my youngest daughter and then I had a problem. I weigh 240 pounds and the bar would, over time, slip down a bit in the clamps. So I bought two hose clamps and clamped them right above the bar clamps. This extra \\"help\\" kept the bar from slipping in the clamps.Anyway, I never had a problem when I used it on a kid's bike, even kid's weighing over 100 lbs. My weight was just too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for copics","review":"I'm not quite sure why Copic made this marker pad...Really, would recommend watercolour paper or a smooth Bristol paper way before I recommended this!

Invisible Gardens is even better. Like A Bridge Between Us, Invisible Gardens is populated by characters who because of their combination of strengths and frailities, humor and passion, feel like real people. Shigekuni's prose, however, is the book's greatest strength. Few writers pay such detailed attention to language: Shigekuni's descriptions are both precise and lush, and her ear for the poetry of the sentence is unerring. This was a marvelous read; I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killing the messenger doesn't help this book","review":"The novel, on the surface, is just silly. An etherial, allegorical story begins this book; in a few italicized paragraphs a woman watches a coyote catch a swan, and drag the beautiful bird away, her neck clutched in his fierce jaws. In fact, it is the swan that is deadly and it is the coyote trickster that dies on page 2. The rest of the novel is the swan enumerating excuses for killing the coyote.Human being (a term used loosely) Soto is not a model mother or lover in this novel, that meanders through the life of a straw woman, a fallacy constructed to distract the reader from what the swan is up to. Set in a university environment, the message appears to be \\"if the protagonist is smart enough, it's okay to behave this way.\\" Avatars of the swan have submitted glowing reviews, and they attack nay-sayers at will but without accuracy.This story is literally deadly dull to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beauty is as beauty does","review":"Any beauty in this novel is only skin deep. It is disturbing, distorted, and decidedly disingenuous. Unhappy people make silly and/or stupid choices throughout. These things don't amount to an engaging story, they add up to an avatar protagonist with an agenda.Put bluntly, the book stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"As dull as watching paint dry","review":"I read this academic mumbo-jumbo passing as Literature, and thought it was awful. Leaves a bad taste in your mouth. \\"Epigone\\" comes to mind as a way to compare this work to the works of other contemporary Asian authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah Blah Blah....","review":"Invisible Gardens made me feel like an ADD sufferer. I found myself thinking about grocery lists and meeting schedules rather than focusing on the story. I was so bored with this woman's daily life, I was forced to think about my own. This is not to say that every book should be filled with excitement, but I do expect to be entertained in some way shape or form.The story itself makes no sense. Lily is so bored with her own life, she rebels by having an affair. There is no rhyme or reason to the plot, characters or ending. It's like listening to a boring friend telling a boring story filled with nonsense. Who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far!","review":"I shopped a long time for this handheld vacuum. I wanted something with power (a wall plug-in, that didn't need to be charged) and something that was quiet. So far this vac delivered everything I wanted. I work in a large open office area; the vac could be run while people were working and even talking and was not disturbing. It picks things up quickly and quietly and it is powerful too. I highly recommend it. The only thing is that it does get warm. The shoulder strap is helpful because it is a little awkward, but all of the attachments it comes with are very useful. It worked well to get dust bunnies and hard to get crumbs out of keyboards, plus paper shreds, and small rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this!","review":"My Aunt owns this thing. I used it to vacuum her car. Well! I was so dissapointed! This has no suction power what so ever! It wouldnt even suck up a piece of fuzz!

Dont buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and not-so-good","review":"I purchased this thinking it would be a wonder and I was right... wonder what I was thinking! Its suction isn't powerful when you use the hose. Try to vacuum up spilled kitty litter? It sucks it up but not in, and as soon as you turn it off, a bunch of kitty litter spills back out. The fact that the cord isn't retractable and doesn't have a spool to wind it on makes the Shark unwieldy - you have a ton of cord to try and deal with. Not to mention that it's pretty heavy and using the shoulder strap to carry it like a purse is also awkward. It doesn't hold much dirt - you have to empty it quite often to regain any suction. I am extemely disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"I initally purchased this little Shark to clean my four flights of carpeted stairs. During one of my many trips from Virginia to NY I decided to take my Shark with me and it worked out great. Now after a long drive or after a little spill in the van I just clean it up with my vacuum. My favorite feature is the rotating brush attachment. It picks up the typical dirt from kids and it's easy to clean. The other attachments work great in small areas and in automobiles. If you remember that it's great for small areas and you will be happy with your purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect until the motor went.....","review":"This vacuum was a dream until the other day when the motor went. I noticed the problem when I was using the appliance. I started to smell smoke. I thought perhaps the Hepa filter in the back was too full, but it was not. That was when I noticed the sparks flying in the vacuum. Needless to say I have to investigate if I can get a new one from the company. I will say this; I take very good care of my appliances. After every use (usually weekly) I washed the filter and let it properly dry for a day. This product failed because it was poorly designed. If they don't make good on this problem, I am reporting them to the proper agencies. This is a safety concern, especially when I have owned it for less than one year. I would advise not getting this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for pet owners","review":"This works well for hard floors and picking up larger things, but it really doesn't pick up pet hair.

So I bought the new powerful Shark. What a let-down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I needed-maintenance too high","review":"The portability is great. Unfortunately, half-way up the stairs I have to empty the cup/clean the filter. Emptying the cup/filter causes a big mess. The unit just does not hold enough waste to be and effective vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent but not up to expectations","review":"Compared to other handheld cordless vacs, it is very good.However, the Shark's claim of being powerful and quiet is highly exaggerated. The vac worked fine for the first few months, but the motor seemed to lose a little power and after a year of use the suction power was mediocre at best. You will need to empty the bag constantly and keep it fully charged for it to perform well.Also the round shape of the vac is a major design flaw, the \\"snout\\" of the vac is so broad and blunt with the opening of the vacuum so small it was hard to get into corners unless you use an attachment.The charger is also another design flaw, it is often hard to dock the vacuum in it and doesn't fit so well.It is also noisy, it's not terribly loud, but it produces an annoying whiney higher pitched sound.Generally, cordless vacs are not the greatest in terms of performance and longevity, but if you must get one and don't have much to spend than I could recommend this vac half heartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful but so fragile","review":"I had this one, and it was gorgeous, I fell in love the minute I saw it in a store...

Sadly, Aluminum scars my radiant stovetop, so I'm out of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Popcorn but.....","review":"I've owned this popper for almost a year now. When I first received it as a gift I was really excited. It makes great popcorn BUT it is a pain in the neck to clean! As someone else stated in their review the L-screws that connect the lid fall out when you take the lid off. Cleaning the popper is a chore because of the was the lid is designed. It only took four or five times of using it before I got tired of cleaning it. I can't think of the last time I've used it because of the chore of cleaning up...I'm back to the microwave."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a replacement","review":"the popcorn popper is defective, all four pins came outafter the second time that I used it. It is the worst product I have ever used in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I return this?","review":"I now have my second \\"Back to Basics\\" corn popper. The first one seemed defective after one use. The lid did not stay on the pot and continually came off during the popping process. I returned it only to get another one that does the same thing. The lid has a metal clip to attach to the cooking pot, near the turning handle, but it does not correctly clip to the pot, offering no way to keep the lid on while you are turning. If anyone knows how I can get a hold of the manufacturer, please leave info here. I can't find a website for them. Unless the product is re-designed you are better without one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"I bought this popcorn popper after having had a similar type popper several years ago. I was very disappointed when I opened the box and took the popper out. Two pins that hold thelid to the center rail were missing. There was one pin on each side of the lid and I was not sure if that was the way it was designed. After the first use when I took the lid off to clean it, the other pins fell out. I realized then that there were supposed to be four not just two pins. I was able to put them back in, but everytime I clean it the pins fall out. The originial popper I had years ago never had this problem. I called Back to Basics and explained the problem. They are supposed to send me new pins for the lid that are designed differently to correct the problem. I am still waiting for them to arrive. I will admit the popcorn tastes great, but it is not worth the hassle to reassemble the lid after every use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good popcorn, bad design","review":"As others have said there are many problems with the design of this popper. The popcorn is good, but that does not reflect the different poppers because they will all taste the same. This popper has a viewing window (plastic) on the top. This window is what I saw as its biggest fault. Since I like popping popcorn several times a week my poppers get use a great deal. The window cracked after using it for 3 days. For the next month it continued to crack more and more until the window just dropped out of it. With that window gone, there is no way to &quot;safely&quot; pop popcorn because it will shoot out and the oil splashing. The little butter holder is pointless and useless. My advice is find a popper that does not have a viewing window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Design","review":"I agree with all of you that it was poorly made, mine is broken and I can't even use it. Also I thought that the directions ..., they want you to buy the pre measured packets of popcorn and oil. If you want to try to get replacements their website is [website] they might be able to help you out."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],O={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",O,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(B,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-63756493"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/50.md","filePath":"library/50.md"}'),L={name:"library/50.md"},j=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{R as __pageData,j as default};
